 2 Synopsis 
Name of Sponsor/Company: Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North 
America, LLC  
Name of Investigational Product: IDP-122 Lotion  
Name of Active Ingredients:  Halobetasol propionate (HP) 0.01% w/w 
Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled Clinical Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of IDP-12 2 in the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis 
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 12-16 inve stigational centers in North America 
Objective: 
The objective of the study is to ev aluate the safety and efficacy of to pical IDP-122 Lotion when applied once 
daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaq ue psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global 
Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is specifically to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion in comparison with vehicle. 
Methodology: 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel- group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of IDP-122 Lotion in compar ison with vehicle. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at 
least 18 years of age and have a clini cal diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 
3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry cr iteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion, respectively. Two containers of the assigned study 
drug will be dispensed to the subject at the Baseline visit. The study drug will be applied topically to the 
affected areas (as determined by the investigator at baseline) once daily for 8 weeks. The initial application 
will be made by the subject per instruction from the study staff.  The subjects will be instructed to avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light sources and to use protective clothing to prevent sunburn. 
Subjects will apply their once daily treatments at home as explained by the study coordinator or designee at 
each investigational center. 
The study coordinator, or designee at each investigational center will dispense 2 new containers of study drug 
to each subject at Baseline and Weeks 2,  4, and 6. During post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the 
subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug which will be evaluated for drug usage 
compliance. Upon completion of the 8-week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the 
investigational center 4 weeks later for a post-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, subjects will be allowed to use investigator approved no n-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; 
no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. The investigator will assess the areas affected by psoriasis at each study visit. 
All areas affected by psoriasis (with an affected body  surface area [BSA] of 3%-12%, inclusive) are to be 
treated with study drug . The affected areas (3%-12% BSA) will not include face, s calp, palms, soles, groin, 
axillae, and intertriginous areas. Information on report ed and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained 
at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination will be  performed at Baseline, W eek 8 (end of treatment), 
and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit) for all subjects. Blood samples for complete blood count with differe ntial (CBC/Diff) and serum ch emistry will be collected 
from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, urine and 
serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screen ing. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
Baseline (prior to randomization) and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit), and serum pregnancy 
testing will also be conducted at Week 4 and Week 8. 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments, as 
appropriate, prior to commencement of any alterna tive therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who 
discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to 
return for the 4-week follow-up vis it after the last treatment visit.

 If signs or symptoms develop in the se lected treatment areas during the treatment period that restrict daily 
activities or make continued application of the study drug difficult due to discomfort, the investigator may instruct the subject to temporarily interrupt use of the study drug and to resume application of the study drug 
once the signs/symptoms have subsided. The investigator should try to minimize study drug interruptions; and 
if needed, make best efforts to limit a “drug holiday” to 4 days. If the study drug interruption does exceed 4 consecutive days, the investigator should consult with th e medical monitor to determine a course of action. If 
the study drug is interrupted, discontinued, or a concomitant medication is used to treat a sign/symptom, an adverse event shall be recorded. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study, due to clini cally significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will 
return for the 4-week follow-up visit after the last treatme nt visit and will be instructed to follow-up with their 
primary care physician, if indicated. If any subject who has an AE, during  the treatment period, the subject 
will be followed by the investigator until resolution (return to normal or to the baseline state) or stabilization, 
as determined by the investigator. 
In addition, application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety data evaluations 
(including reports of local skin reacti ons, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. 
If the subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by the medical 
monitor in conjunction with the investigator to determine course of action. 
Number of subjects planned: 
Approximately 210 adult subjects (approximately 15 subjects per investigational center) with moderate or 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4)  will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 
2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that:

Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration: 
IDP-122 Lotion, applied topically, once daily for 8 weeks. 
Application Instructions:  
The investigational center staff member will instruct the subject to apply the study drug to the affected 
treatment areas identified at the Baseline visit by the inve stigator. The staff member will instruct the subject on 
the proper application procedure duri ng the Baseline visit. Subjects will be instructed to squeeze a small 
amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) onto a fingertip and then spr ead a thin layer of the study drug 
over the affected treatment area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in 
increments to cover all affected treatment areas as desi gnated by the investigator. In addition to the verbal 
instructions given during the visit, the subjects  will be provided with written instructions. 
Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer of study drug to the entire selected treatment area(s) as 
indicated on the body diagram at home once daily up to the Week 8 visit. Subjects will be advised to avoid or 
minimize exposure to direct sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light sources while in the study and to wash their hands before and after application of the study drug. 
The amount of study drug used by the subjects will be monitored by weighing each newly dispensed study 
drug container and re weighing each returned study drug  container at all applicable study visits. The maximum 
allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study. 
Duration of treatment:  
8 weeks for all subjects

Criteria for evaluation: 
A summary of the study measurem ents follows. Note that for all efficacy  measurements, the 
investigators/evaluators will be provided with training to ensure consistent evaluations across investigational 
centers. To the greatest extent possibl e, the assessments for a particular subject should be performed by the 
same sponsor-approved evaluator at all study visits. 
Safety Measurements : 
Local Skin Reactions: Tolerability will be evaluated thr ough assessments of selected local signs and symptoms 
(itching, dryness, burning/stinging). In addition, the treatment areas will be examined at each visit by the 
evaluator for the presence or absence of significant known drug-related AEs; skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia, and folliculitis. Any local skin reaction requiring use of a concomitant therapy or is a cause for 
study drug interruption or discontinuation should be reported as an adverse event. The scales to be used for 
assessing local skin reactions follow:

 Statistical methods : 
All subjects who are randomized and dispensed study drug will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis 
set. All subjects in the ITT analysis set who complete the Week 8 visit without any major protocol violations will be included in the per protocol (PP) analysis set. All subjects who are randomized, receive at least 
1 confirmed dose of study drug, and have at least 1 po st-baseline assessment will be included in the safety 
analysis set. 
The ITT analysis set will be considered primary fo r the evaluation of efficacy. The primary method of 
handling missing efficacy data will be the method  of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation; no imputations will be  made for missing safety data. 
 Efficacy: 
 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints are intended to compare once daily application of IDP- 122 Lotion and vehicle. 
Specifically, the efficacy  endpoints include: 
 The percent of subjects with treat ment success, defined as at least a 2 grade improvement from 
Baseline in the IGA score and an IGA score equating to “clear” or “almost clear” at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 
and Week 12 (4-week follow-up), as summarized using descriptive statistics. 
 The percent of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and Week 12 (4 week FU), as summarized using descriptive statistics for the target lesion treated with study drug. 
 
Inferential Statistics 
Primary Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 
2-grade improvement from Baseline in IGA score and an IGA score equating to “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to compare once daily application of  IDP-122 Lotion with its 
vehicle. The percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by analysis center.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Similar to the primary endpoint analyses, pairwise co mparisons will be performed using CMH tests stratified 
by analysis center. The second ary efficacy endpoints will be: 
 Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Cl ear to Almost Clear at 
Week 12 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Cl ear to Almost Clear at 
Week 6 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Cl ear to Almost Clear at 
Week 4 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Cl ear to Almost Clear at 
Week 2 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables will use a gated sequential procedure starting with the 
comparisons of the first bulleted item and proceeding on to the next item. The process will terminate if a 
nonstatistically significant value is observed.

 Tertiary Efficacy 
The follow tertiary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed to further character ize the treatment effect of IDP-122 
Lotion over the IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion. The analyses will use CMH testing stratified by analysis center 
without adjusting for multiplicity. 
 Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade im provement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 8 for the target lesion 
 Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade im provement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 12 for the target lesion 
 Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade im provement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 6 for the target lesion 
 Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade im provement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 4 for the target lesion 
 Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade im provement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 2 for the target lesion 
Safety: Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. Descriptions of AEs will include the 
dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding the study 
drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and investigator’s assessment of causality. All AEs will be recorded and 
classified using terminology from the Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA). All reported 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug 
application, will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ 
class, preferred term, severity, an d relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or 
relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system or gan class or a preferred 
term using the event with the greatest severity or cau sality, respectively, within each category. All reported 
serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting SAEs, 
system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject and will include a verbatim 
description of the event as reported by the investigator, as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start 
date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, 
outcome and relationship to the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from 
the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE. 
 
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness, burning/stinging, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia and folliculitis will be summarized by tr eatment group and visit. Additionally, the percent of 
subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, dryn ess, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any 
point in the study following the first application of study drug, will be tabulated by treatment group.  Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits. 
 
Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values to summarize laboratory test results 
collected at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to 
determine the shifts. A listing of all out-of-range laboratory test results at any assessment time point will also 
be provided. Determination of clini cal significance for all out-of-range labo ratory values will be made by each 
investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listi ng of all clinically significant laboratory test results 
will be provided.

 Sample size calculations:  
One hundred forty (140) IDP-122 treated subjects and seve nty (70) vehicle treated subjects will have greater 
than 95% power to detect a statistically significant outcome for a two-sided test with an alpha level of 0.05. 
This is based on treatment success rates of 33.3% and 9.7% which were observed in V01-118A-201. Success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from Ba seline in the IGA score and an IGA score equating to 
“Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
 
This study will be performed in compliance with GCP including the archiving of essential study documents. 
This protocol follows guidelines outlined by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). All data

 5 Introduction 
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-med iated disease that varies wide ly in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number  of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic 
features of psoriasis include hyperprolifera tion of epidermal cells associated with 
dermal/epidermal inflammation, resulting in shar ply demarcated red plaques, which may be 
covered by silvery scales aff ecting the skin and scalp. 
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent  of body surface area (BSA) 
involvement are considerati ons in selecting therapy. 
Biologic treatments are now either available or in development to treat psoriasis. However, 
these treatments are not typically used for mild disease, and their safety  profile is not entirely 
well understood. 
Topical therapies are used in all disease seve rities, but may be impr actical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasi s treatment is topical corticosteroids, which 
range in potency from superpotent to low pot ency (Class I to Class VII, respectively). 
Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of 
psoriasis. Although topical corticosteroids are very effective, long-term  safety remains a concern, 
particularly with the more potent ones. Adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, 
and potential hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ax is suppression have been associated with 
higher potency topical corticosteroids and prolonged treatment. Ultravate
® cream and 
ointment (halobetasol propionate [HP] 0.05%) is currently on the market and are classified as 
super-high potency (Class I) corticosteroids indi cated for the relief of the inflammatory and 
pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  
Having a lower concentration product that is a Class I steroid might be advantageous for 
patients, as the steroid provi des relief from inflammation, and may reduce the adverse 
reactions associated with a steroid (eg, skin atrophy). 
6 Study Objectives and Purpose 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical IDP-122 Lotion 
when applied once daily to adult subjects with m oderate to severe plaque psoriasis (defined 
as an Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is 
specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy  of a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion 
in comparison with vehicle.

 7 Investigational plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomize d, parallel-group study designed to assess the 
safety and efficacy of IDP-122 Lotion in comparis on with its vehicle. To be eligible for the 
study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive IDP- 122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion, respectively. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topically  to the affected area (as determined by the 
investigator at Baseline) once daily for 8 weeks.  The initial application will be made at the 
investigational center during th e day as per instruction from the study coordinator or 
designee. The subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, artificial 
ultraviolet light sources and to  use protective clothing to prev ent sunburn. Subjects will apply 
their daily treatments at home as explaine d by the study coordinato r or designee at each 
investigational center. The study coordinator or designee at each investigational center will 
dispense 2 new containers of study drug to ea ch subject at Baselin e and Weeks 2, 4, and 6. 
During post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, a nd 8) the subjects will be asked to return 
their used containers of study drug. Subjects w ill be asked to not apply study drug on day of 
clinic visit so that subject can apply during the visit after assessmen ts are completed. Upon 
completion of the 8-week treatment period, a ll subjects will be aske d to return to the 
investigational center 4 weeks later for a pos t-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). 
During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use Investigator approved non-
medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; no other skin car e products will be 
permitted on the treatment areas. 
The investigator will assess the treatable areas affected by psoriasis at each study visit. All 
treatable areas affected by psoriasis identified at Baseline (with an affected BSA of 3%-12%) 
are to be treated with study drug. The treatable affected areas will not include the face, scalp, 
palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas . If palms and soles are affected, study drug may 
be applied at the discretion of the investigator ; however, these areas will not be included in 
treatable BSA or efficacy assessments. Information on reported and observed adverse events  (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be perfor med at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), 
and Week 12 (the 4-week post-treatment ce ssation follow-up visit) for all subjects.

 Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry 
will be collected from subjects at Screening, W eek 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential, urine and serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening and 
confirmed at baseline with a urine pregnancy test prior to randomization. Serum pregnancy 
tests will also be conducted at weeks 4 and 8, a nd an additional urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index ques tionnaire (DLQI) questionnaire will be 
administered to subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8/End of Treatment and Week 
12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
Subjects who terminate study participation earl y will be asked to complete all Week 8 
assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencem ent of any alternative therapy for psoriasis 
(if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be 
replaced and these subjects may be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit.

 8.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Reasons for withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Psoriasis flare, as determined by the investigator, which requires treatment with a 
disallowed therapy. 
 Either at the investigator's request, for tolerability reasons (e.g., severe adverse 
reactions), or at th e subject’s request. 
 When the requirements of the protocol are not followed. 
 When a concomitant therapy likely to inte rfere with the results of the study is 
reported, or required by the subject (the investigators will report all such 
information on the source documents/electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and decide, in accordance with the sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn). 
 When a subject is lost to follow-up. The investigators will try twice to reach the 
subject by telephone and will send a follo w-up letter by certified mail before 
considering that the subject is lost to  follow-up. These actions  will be reported on 
the End of Study eCRF and a copy of th e follow-up letter maintained in the 
investigator's file. 
All premature discontinuations and their r easons must be carefully documented by the 
investigator on the final eCRF, and, if need be , on the AE form. In any case, no subject who 
has been included and has a study number assigned can be replaced by another if they discontinue prematurely for wh atever reason. All data gather ed on the subject prior to 
termination will be made available to the sponsor. Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as lis ted on the final report form are defined as 
follows: 
Normal Study Completion – Subject completes the study as planned in the protocol. 
Adverse Event  – Complete AE form. 
Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subj ect moved, schedule conflicts. 
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or de signee before making decision. 
Lost to Follow-Up – Document with 2 phone calls and a certified letter. 
Pregnancy  – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to 
term. Complete pregnancy form. 
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis before the end 
of the study and the investigator determin es it is not due to lack of efficacy. 
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis after at least 2 weeks 
of study drug treatment and the risk of conti nuing the subject in the study outweighs the

 Subjects who terminate treatment early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments 
prior to commencement of any alternative ther apy for psoriasis (if pos sible). Subjects who 
discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects 
will be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit. 
All subjects are free to withdraw  from participating in this study at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No cons traints will be placed on 
ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other 
conventional therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as  determined by their 
physician. 
9 Treatment Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a double-blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to 
investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as  all individuals closel y associated with the 
study. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 (IDP-122 
[HP 0.01%] Lotion: IDP-122 Vehicl e Lotion). Each screened subject will be assigned a 
unique 6-digit study subject number assigned by th e investigational cente r, which will consist 
of the 3-digit investigational center/site number (pre-assigne d by sponsor/designee) and the 
3-digit chronological screen ing order number, starting with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The 
study drug kit will be assigned to subjects base d on a randomization code and kits will be 
dispensed to the subjects at Baseline.  A study drug log will document the inventory and 
dispensing of study drug at each investigational center. 
9.2 Randomization and Blinding 
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be 
numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each 
investigational center. Study drug supplies will be distributed to the investigati onal centers to 
maintain the randomization ratio w ithin each investigational center. 
As a double-blinded study, the investigators, th e site staff, the sponsor, and the clinical 
monitors will not be aware of the treatmen t assigned to the indi vidual study subjects. 
Delegated staff members at each investigational center will di spense the study drugs and will 
collect all used and unused study drug containers as scheduled.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
28 
 9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled s ubjects will be unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after al l data are verified, 
entered into the database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and 
entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
In the case of a medical emergency, the inve stigator can break the blind for the subject 
involved preferably by first discussing the situ ation with the medical monitor and the sponsor 
(or designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contacted with 
unblinding information by a sponsor representati ve. The investigator will record the code 
break in the subject’s source documents. 
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concom itant Medication or Therapy 
Subjects in this study must not have psoria sis that was previously nonresponsive to 
prescription medications, per the Investigators’ best clinical judg ment. Subjects must also not 
be using lithium or Plaquenil. Any concomitant therapy stopped for washout as indicated 
below is to be recorded. As noted in the ex clusion criteria, there are mandatory washout 
periods and restrictions during the study. Specifically: 
 Received treatment with any topical an tipsoriatic drug product within 14 days 
prior to the Baseline visit 
 Within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline vis it, subjects must not have used any 
phototherapy (including la ser), photochemotherapy, or non-biologic systemic 
psoriasis therapy (such as newer oral ps oriasis medications (e g Otezla), systemic 
corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids or cyclosporine) 
 Has used immunomodulatory therapy (biolo gics) known to affect psoriasis within 
3 months of the Baseline visit 
 Within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline vis it, subjects must not  have had prolonged 
exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultrav iolet radiation 
 Within 60 days or 5 drug half-lives (w hichever is longer) pr ior to the Baseline 
visit, subjects must not have received treatment with any i nvestigational drug or 
device and may not be concurrently particip ating in another clin ical study with an 
investigational drug or device 
Subjects are allowed only the use of invest igator approved non- medicated cleansers, 
moisturizers, and sunscreens in the treatment areas. Protocol exclude d areas (face, scalp, 
axillae, and intertriginous ar eas) may be treated with OTC 1% hydrocortisone cream, tar 
shampoos or allowed moisturizers.

 CONFIDENTIAL 
29 
 Protocol excluded areas of palm s and soles may be treated with study drug but will not be 
included in the BSA or IGA assessments. If palms and soles are treated, they may be 
evaluated by the inves tigator for improvement. 
Subjects using concomitant therapies during the c ourse of the study that could interfere with 
the interpretation of the study re sults (including but not limite d to those listed above) should 
not be withdrawn, but the use of the concomita nt product should be discontinued. No other 
topical treatment (except as noted above) ot her than the study drug will be permitted for 
psoriasis. 
Information on concomitant therapies will be recorded in the Prior and Concomitant 
Medication or Therapy source document. Any ther apy used by the subject will be considered 
concomitant medication or therapy (e.g., aspirin, Tylenol, birth control pills, vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant therapy dosing 
constant during the study. Any change to concomitant therapy should be noted on the Concomitant Therapy source document and eCRF. 
9.5 Treatment Compliance 
Each subject will be instructed on the importa nce of returning his or  her study drug at each 
applicable study visit. If a subj ect does not return his or he r study drug, he or she will be 
instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the containers dispensed at each on-site treatment visit to  the next subsequent study visit. The maximum allowable 
weekly usage is 50 grams for this study.  Each container will be weighed by a study 
coordinator or designee prior to  dispensation and after collection. The subject will also be 
asked to complete a diary calendar and quest ioned regarding the study drug use since the 
previous visit in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying th e study drug. A 
subject who deviates significantly from the prescribed application amount will be counseled. Any missed applications of study drug will be noted by subject on the diary, which will be collected and placed in the appropriate sour ce document. Missed applications will be 
documented in the eCRF. 
9.6 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The investigators must read the protocol thoroug hly and must follow the instructions exactly.  
A deviation from the protocol is an uninte nded and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the sp onsor and the IRB/IEC and agreed to by the 
investigator. Deviations usually  have an impact on individual  patients or a small group of 
patients and do not involve inclusion/ex clusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
 
Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
30 
 A protocol violation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the patient, when the patient or i nvestigator has failed to adhere 
to significant protocol requirements (inclusi on/exclusion criteria) and the patient was 
enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or wh en there is nonadherenc e to FDA regulations 
and/or ICH GCP guideline. 
The investigator or designee must docum ent and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As so on as possible after such an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the r easons for it, and any proposed protocol 
amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regul atory authorities, if required. 
10 Study Drug Materials and Management

10.1.3 Administration 
The investigational center staff member will in struct the subject on th e proper application 
procedure of the study drug to the affected trea tment areas identified at the Baseline visit by 
the investigator. Subjects will be instructed  to squeeze a small amount of study drug (about 
the size of a pea) onto a finger tip and then spread a thin layer of the study drug over the 
affected treatment area. If necessary, additi onal pea-sized amounts of study drug may be 
applied in increments to cover all affected tr eatment areas as designate d by the investigator. 
The maximum allowable weekly usage is 50 gram s for this study. In addition to the verbal 
instructions given during the visit, the subjects will be provided with written instructions (See 
Appendix 17.1). 
Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer of study drug to  the entire sele cted treatment 
area(s), as indicated on the body diagram. Subj ects will be advised to avoid or minimize 
exposure to direct sunlight a nd artificial ultraviole t light sources while in the study and to 
wash their hands before and afte r application of the study drug.

 It is suggested that subjects do not apply study drug on day of clinic visits so  that this may be 
done by the subject at th e clinic after study asse ssments are completed and to confirm proper 
application technique an d retrain as necessary. 
10.2 Study Drug Accountability 
Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigat or is responsible for ensuring that the 
investigational center staff member will conduct a complete inventory of study materials and 
assume responsibility for their storage a nd dispensing. In acco rdance with federal 
regulations, the investigators must  agree to keep all study materi als in a secure  location with 
restricted access. The investigator will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of all 
study drug. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of 
accounting for all clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be recorded with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the inves tigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Each tube will be weighe d (with the cap on) before dispensing to and 
upon return by the subjects, and weights w ill be recorded on the pharmacy log and 
appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to the sponsor/designee for 
destruction at the c onclusion of the study. 
11 Study Procedures and Evaluations 
All subject information and data obtained dur ing the study visits will be recorded in the 
source documents, applicable study logs, and eCRFs. Evaluators must have appropriate, document ed experience and training, or obtain approval 
from the sponsor based on experience (o r through additional trai ning organized by the 
sponsor). At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same 
investigator/evaluator as sesses the same subject.

11. Provide subject with DLQI for completion. 
12. Exit the subject from the study and complete the end of study eCRFs. 
Note : For subjects, who exit the study after Week 8 but pr ior to completing Week 12, 
perform all of the assessments scheduled for Week 12 at the time that the subject 
discontinues or within 2 week s of subject discontinuation. 
11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
11.2.1 Body Surface Area Affected by Psoriasis (BSA) 
The investigator will assess the percent BSA (3%-12% required to qualify at Baseline) 
affected by psoriasis in the allowed treatment  areas for each subject at Screening/Baseline 
and at all study visits. The BSA will not include areas of the face, scalp, palms, soles, axillae, 
and other intertriginous areas. Note: palms and so les with psoriasis may be treated with the 
study drug but will not be included in the BSA or IGA assessments. 
11.2.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) 
The IGA is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), and will be assessed 
by the evaluator at each visit for the overall aff ected areas with plaque psoriasis. The face, 
scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas are to be excluded in this assessment.

 An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of we ight and vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, a nd oral temperature) wi ll be performed at 
Baseline, Week 8, and Week 12 (post-treatment follow-up visit). Height will be measured at 
Baseline only.  Any abnormal physical exam findings will be recorded. 
11.3.3 Safety Laboratory Tests 
Routine safety laboratory tests (CBC/Diff a nd serum chemistry) will be performed at 
Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. Any out-of-rang e laboratory result that is considered 
clinically significant by th e investigator will be recorded as an AE and should be confirmed 
by repeat testing at the discretion of the i nvestigator. Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities at any visit will be followed to re solution (return to normal or to the baseline 
state) or until clinically stable as determined by the investigator. 
11.3.4 Pregnancy Tests 
All female subjects of childbearing potent ial will undergo serum pregnancy testing at 
Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. In addition, urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
Screening and prior to randomization at Base line, and at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment 
follow-up visit). 
11.4 Other Evaluations 
11.4.1 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
The DLQI questionnaire will be administered to  subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 
8/End of Treatment and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
11.4.2 Photography 
Photographs will be taken of ta rget lesion and one other psoria sis lesion at all study visits 
starting with baseline. Only subjects who provide written photographic consent will be 
included in photography.  Reference the photography manual for this study. 
11.5 Adverse Events 
11.5.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the study drug. AEs includ e any unfavorable and uninte nded illness, sign, symptom, 
clinically significant laboratory test abnormality , or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product that has appeared or worsened duri ng the course of the clinical 
trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. The collection of 
nonserious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should begin following the subject's 
completion of the consent proces s to participate in the study. 
Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
43 
 11.5.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that o ccur during the course of 
the study. The AEs should be documented as a si ngle medical diagnosis. When this is not 
possible, the AE should be docum ented in terms of signs and/ or symptoms observed by the 
investigator or reported by th e subject at each study visit. 
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not  the AEs are considered drug-related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by the study site personnel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symp toms that result in the subject’s requiring 
a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from  the study will be reported as an AE. The 
following data will be collected on all AE s and recorded on the appropriate eCRF: 
 Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
 Onset date and end date 
 Maximum intensity (severity) 
 Seriousness 
 Action taken regarding study drug 
 Corrective treatment, if given 
 Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessm ent of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring correctiv e treatment, leading to discontinuation or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion).

 CONFIDENTIAL 
44 
 11.5.3 Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. 
An SAE or serious adverse reaction is defined as any untoward medical  occurrence that at 
any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life threaten ing, (the term "life threaten ing" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an even t which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires in patient hospita lization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an 
AE) 
 Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospita lization, but may jeopardize th e subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to pr event 1 of the above listed outcomes 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be consider ed an SAE, and must be reported to the 
sponsor/designee within 24 hours of your awareness of the event.  
11.5.4 Assessment of Severity 
The severity assigned to an AE should be de termined by the maximum severity of the AE. 
The categories described below should be us ed to estimate the severity of AEs: 
 Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
 Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
 Severe: Marked limitation in activity; so me assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy requ ired; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening

 CONFIDENTIAL 
45 
 11.5.5 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related”. The following s hould be taken into account when assessing SAE 
causality: 
 Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was 
withdrawn and the SAE resolved or th e event recurred after re introduction. 
 If there is a reasonable possi bility that the AE is asso ciated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness. 
 Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
 No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists. 
 If the AE is directly rela ted to study procedures or th ere is a lack of efficacy. 
11.5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require  expeditious handling a nd reporting to sponsor 
or designee within 24 hours of investigational center notificati on to comply with regulatory 
requirements. 
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to st udy drug, must be immediately reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of the investigat or’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must 
be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE 
report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator ’s awareness of the 
event. 
The fax number for reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
           
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor of an SAE.  If only limited information is initially 
available, follow-up reports are required. Addi tional relevant information such as hospital 
records and autopsy reports should be provided to Sponsor/designee as soon as they are 
available. Should the investigator  become aware of an SAE (rega rdless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE 
must be reported in accordance with pr ocedures specified in this protocol.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
46 
 The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure  the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by the sponsor. 
11.5.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is de signated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater 
frequency, specificity or severity. 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are bot h unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out) to the study drug. Thes e expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 
and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory repor ting agency(ies). Valeant Pharmaceuticals will 
notify regulatory authoriti es of these AEs and all participating investigational centers in 
writing for submission by the investigator to th e IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the 
form of a Safety Update to the Invest igator Brochure (i.e., “15-day letter”). 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The inve stigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the 
informed consent requires revi sion. The investigator should al so comply with the IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.5.8 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
If an AE should require laborator y testing in addition to that required by protocol, the results 
of the test(s) must be obtained by the investigational center and filed with the subject’s source documentation. Any laboratory test result th at meets the criteria for an SAE must also 
be reported to the sponsor/designee via writte n SAE report form signed by the investigator 
within 24 hours of investig ational center notification. 
11.5.9 Pregnancy 
All female subjects of childbearing potential mu st use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of contraceptive failure is 
minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a female subject of childbear ing potential in this clinical trial, the 
investigator must review the following information about study participation: 
 Informed consent requirements 
 Contraceptives in current use 
Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
47 
 Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling,  the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the in formed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbeari ng potential should be in structed to contact 
the investigator immediately if  they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late 
menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld unt il the results of labor atory pregnancy testing 
are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must 
not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study 
treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the resu lt of pregnancy testing 
is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the 
subject will be followed until the pregnancy come s to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the sponsor, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complicati ons occurring during th e pregnancy or the 
delivery. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediatel y reported to the medical monitor within 24 
hours of the investigator’s awar eness of the pregnancy. All co nfirmed pregnancies must be 
reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written Pregnancy 
Report form within 24 hours of the inve stigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. 
12 Statistics 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all st atistical tests will be two-sided and will be 
performed at the 0.05 le vel of significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of  the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percen tage of subjects in ea ch category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descrip tive statistics will in clude n (number of 
subjects), mean, standard deviation, medi an, minimum, and maximum. Appropriate 
inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation 
carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation 
for a subject will be used to estimate subseque nt missing data points). No imputations will be 
made for missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses  will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized  prior to unblinding of the study treatments.

 12.1 Assessment of Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percen t of subjects with treatment success, defined 
as at least a 2-grade improvement from Baselin e in IGA score and an IGA score equating to 
“Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to compare once daily application of IDP-122 
Lotion and vehicle.  
The percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed using Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests st ratified by analysis center. 
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy 
Similar to the primary endpoint analyses comparisons will be performed using CMH tests 
stratified by analysis center. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be: 
 Percentage of subjects who show at leas t a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 12 for IDP- 122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at leas t a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 6 for IDP- 122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at leas t a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 4 for IDP- 122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
 Percentage of subjects who show at leas t a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 2 for IDP- 122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables will use a gated sequent ial procedure starting 
with the comparisons of the first bulleted item and proceeding onto the next item. The process will terminate if  a nonstatistically signifi cant value is observed.

12.1.4 Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site 
with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each study site . The study is intended to be conducted in a 
manner such that a minimum of 15 subjects w ill be randomized and included in the ITT 
population (i.e., approximately at least 10 subjects in the IDP- 122 arm and at least 5 subjects 
in the Vehicle arm) for any investigator. In the event that there are too few subjects in a 
treatment arm for an investigator, then the invest igator’s data will be combined to achieve the 
desired sample size minimum per treatment arm. The combining of investigator data will be 
accomplished by taking the investigator with th e smallest enrollment and combining it with 
the investigator with the largest,  restricted to investigational sites that did not meet minimum 
enrollment. If there is a further need to combin e data, then the data of the investigator with 
the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the 
second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of 15 subjects  enrolled. The process of combining investigator data that 
have insufficient subjects per treatment ar m will result in redefining the groups of 
investigators for the purposes of statistical an alyses. These combined groups will be referred 
to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses. 
Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
50 
 The consistency of treatment response will be  investigated across the analysis centers 
subsequent to combining the da ta as described above. Statistic al tests will be conducted to 
identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common 
statistical and clinical conclusions. For the purpose of testing cons istency of treatment 
response, the primary efficacy variable will be considered. The percent of subjects with 
treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of 
treatment group, analysis center, and the interaction term of treatment group by analysis 
center. Further examination will follow if the analysis results in a significant interaction term. 
In the event that the logistic regression interaction p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a 
sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis cente rs with the extreme efficacy result will be 
performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect. On the other hand, if the 
analysis results in an intera ction terms with p-value greater  than 0.10, then the conclusions 
from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers. The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or 
centers that contribute to the statistical signif icance of the interaction term of the logistic 
regression. The process involves submitting subset s of analysis centers to the logistic 
regression and observing the interaction p- value for the subset. Subsets resulting in 
interaction p-values greater than  0.10 are considered homogeneous. 
The search for an extreme analysis center begi ns by analyzing all subset s that can be created 
by excluding 1 analysis center. If 1 or more of  the subsets result in an interaction p-value 
greater than or equal to 0.10, then the analysis center excluded from the subset with the 
largest interaction p-value is deemed the extreme analysis center. 
If all subset interaction p-valu es are less than or equal to 0.10,  then the process will analyze 
the interaction for all subsets that can be create d by excluding 2 analysis centers. If 1 or more 
of these subsets generate interaction p-values  larger than 0.10, then the analysis centers 
excluded from the subset with the largest inter action p-value are deemed  the extreme analysis 
centers. 
Thus, the process of identifying the extreme analysis centers will continue in a stepwise 
manner by first excluding 1, then 2, then 3, etc, analysis centers until the logistic regression 
interaction p-value exceeds 0.10. 
Once the extreme analysis center or centers have  been identified, then the treatment p-values 
of the remaining analysis centers will be computed. Inferences will be drawn from the 
treatment p-value, as well as any pertinent obs ervations regarding the extreme analysis center 
or centers. Additionally, it is noted that this proc ess excludes subjects from the analysis in a 
nonrandom manner and has an unpredictable impact on the power of the treatment effect test.

 In the event that the treatment effect of the remaining subset is not statistically significant, 
due consideration of the post hoc  aspects of the process will be given when the results are 
interpreted. Conclusions will be presented by the sponsor as appropriate to the findings of the 
sensitivity analysis. 
Prior to investigating the treatment effect with in the analysis centers, the magnitude of the 
site main effect will be investigated to determ ine if the main site-to-site variability is such 
that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, th e percent of subjects 
with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed  with a logistic regr ession with factors of 
treatment group, site, and th e interaction term of treatment group by site. If  the analysis is not 
computationally feasible due to some s ites having very few subjects enrolled, the 
low-enrolling sites will be excluded from the analysis. 
12.1.5 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. 
This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, 
imputation will be conducted within each treat ment group independently , so the pattern of 
missing observations in 1 treatment group canno t influence missing value estimations in 
another. 
For each efficacy variable (IGA and psoriasis signs), the following steps will be performed to 
impute missing data: 
1. Calculate the number of missing Week 8 valu es to be estimated by MCMC in each 
treatment group. Let nmiss be the maximu m number of missing Week 8 values 
among the treatment groups. 
2. For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed values 
and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing efficacy data in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ 
data sets. The resulting data set for ea ch treatment group will be combined into 
1 complete data set for each imputation. Options will be included in each imputation 
process to prevent estimating values to be out side the range of expected values for the 
assessment. 
3. Imputed data will be used to determine dichotomized success/failure values. 
4. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the appropriate CMH test. 
5. CMH statistics will be normalized using the Wilson-Hilferty transformation.

 12.1.6 Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses 
12.1.6.1 Analyses Using Last Observation Carried Forward 
In the first set of sensitivity analyses, mi ssing IGA values will be imputed using LOCF. 
Treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed as it was in the primary analyses. Comparisons 
will be performed on imputed data using CM H tests stratified by analysis center. 
12.1.6.2 Repeated Measures Analysis on Observed Data 
As a second sensitivity analysis, treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a 
repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized  estimating equations), with 
treatment success as the dependent variable  and treatment, analysis center and visit 
(Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8) as  independent factors. 
12.1.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT population for the following subgroups: 
Baseline IGA, sex, age, ethnicity, and race. Age will be dichotomized to less than the median 
age of subjects and greater than or equal to  the median age of subjects. Subgroup analyses 
will be conducted on the primary efficacy e ndpoint and will contain only descriptive 
statistics. 
12.2 Assessment of Safety 
12.2.1 Adverse Events 
The primary analysis of safety will be conducted at Week 8.  There will be a tabulation, however, of the AE’s that start in the period post the Week 8 to Week 12 visit.  All AEs 
occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by trea tment group and will provide the number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
study drug. When summarizing TEAEs  by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject 
will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respec tively, within each category. All reported SAEs 
will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, a nd relationship to study drug.

 All information pertaining to AEs noted dur ing the study will be listed by treatment group 
and subject and will include a verbatim de scription of the event as reported by the 
investigator, as well as the preferred term, sy stem organ class, start date, stop date (if 
stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken re garding the study drug, corrective treatment, 
outcome, and relationship to the study dr ug. In addition, a listing of subjects who 
prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of 
subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.2.2 Local Skin Reactions 
The frequency of local skin reactions incl uding itching, dryness,  burning/stinging, skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia and folliculitis  will be summarized by treatment group and 
visit. Additionally, the percen t of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, 
dryness, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any point in the study following the first 
application of study drug, will be  tabulated by treatment group. 
12.2.3 Safety Laboratory Values and Vital Sign Measurements 
Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits. 
Shift tables will be presented for changes in sa fety laboratory values to summarize laboratory 
test results collected at Base line and Weeks 4 and 8. Normal ranges established by the central 
laboratory will be used to determine the shifts . A listing of all out-of-range laboratory test 
results at any assessment time point will also be provided. Determination of clinical 
significance for all out-of-range laboratory valu es will be made by each investigator and 
included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clin ically significant laboratory test results 
will be provided. 
12.3 Subject Disposition 
A tabulation of subject disposition will be provided. The tabulation will include the numbers of subjects who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons 
for discontinuation will be included. 
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographic data and Baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics for the ITT,  PP, and safety analysis sets. Comparisons 
between treatment groups will be performed to ensure comparable results. 
12.5 Protocol Deviations 
All protocol deviations will be reported to the sponsor and recorded throughout the study. A tabulation of protocol deviations will be included in the final study report.

12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations 
12.8.1 Analysis Populations 
Approximately 210 adult subjects with moderate or  severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score 
of 3 or 4) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 2:1 randomization ratio, it is 
anticipated that: 
 Approximately 140 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) 
Lotion 
 Approximately 70 subjects will be random ized to receive IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using th e intent-to-treat (ITT)  population and the per 
protocol (PP) population. The I TT analysis set will be consider ed primary for the evaluation 
of efficacy. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
All subjects who are randomized and dispen sed study drug will be included in the ITT 
analysis set. All subjects who are randomized, receive at le ast 1 confirmed dose of study drug and have at 
least 1 post-baseline safety assessment will be included in the safety analysis set. 
All subjects in the ITT analysis set who co mplete the Week 8 visit without any major 
protocol violations wi ll be included in the PP analysis  set. The PP population will include 
subjects in the ITT population who did not  meet any of the following criteria: 
 Violated the inclusi on/exclusion criteria 
 Used an interfering concomitant medication 
 Did not attend the Week 8 visit 
 Missed more than 1 post-baseline study visit prior to Week 8 
 Have not been compliant with the dosi ng regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication during participation in the study) 
 Out of visit window at the Week 8 visit by more than ± 5 days

55 
 Subjects that discontinue from the study due to an adverse event relate d to study treatment or 
documented lack of treatment effect will be in cluded in the PP population. Prior to breaking 
the blind, other additional criteria may be a dded to the list to accommodate for unforeseen 
events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that resu lt in noteworthy study protocol 
violations. 
The number of subjects in each analysis se t will be summarized. Reasons for study 
withdrawal during the blinded study will be su mmarized using frequencies and percentages 
by treatment group. 
12.8.2 Sample Size Determination 
The following power calculations were computed using the observed Week 8 dichotomized 
IGA efficacy data in the I TT population from the Phase 2 study V01-118A-201. SAS PROC 
POWER with the Fisher’s exact  test option was used to ca lculate the power for various 
sample sizes using a two-sided test with an  alpha of 0.05. Table 5 presents the efficacy 
estimates derived from study V01-118A-201.

Percent 
Success 33.3% 9.7% 
Success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvemen t from Baseline in the IGA score and an IGA score 
equating to “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
*IDP-122 refers to the (IDP-118 Monad (HP 0.01%) Lotion) used in the V01-118A-201 Study 
**IDP 118 Vehicle composition used in the V01-118A-201 is equivalent to the vehicle that will be used in this 
study (IDP 122 Vehicle Lotion). 
 
One hundred forty (140) IDP-122 treated subjects and seventy (70) vehicle treated subjects 
will have greater than 95% power to detect a st atistically significant outcome for a two-sided 
test with an alpha level of 0.05.  
It was noted that the estima tes extracted from the above studies are based on the LOCF 
method of handling missing values while the proposed Phase 3 analysis will account for 
missing values using multiple imputations. The power stated above sufficiently exceeds 95% 
which will compensate for the difference in handling of missing data.

17.1 Subject Instruction Sheet 
A thin layer of study drug should be applied once daily  at about the same time each day over 
the affected treatment areas indicated by the inve stigator for 8 weeks As a reminder, the face, 
scalp, axillae (armpit) and intertriginous (skinfold) areas will be excluded.  
 Specifically, subjects will squeeze a small amount of study drug (about  the size of a pea) 
onto a fingertip and then spread  a thin layer of the study drug over the affected treatment 
area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in increments 
(one pea size gently rubbed over a treatment area at a time) to cover all affected treatment 
areas.  The amount of study drug used by the subjects  will be monitored by weighing each newly 
dispensed study drug container and weighing ea ch returned study dr ug container at all 
applicable study visits. The maximum allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study.  Be sure to wash your hands after you appl y the product (unless the study doctor has 
instructed you to treat your palms).  Reminders: 
 On study visit days please wait until after your study assessments are completed before 
application of the study drug or any approved moisturizers. Any retraining can be provided by site staff, if needed. 
 Avoid contact with the eyes, inside the nose, mouth and all mucous membranes. 
 THE TEST MATERIAL SHOULD BE USED ONLY BY THE PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS PRESCRIBED and it should be kept out  of the reach of children or others of 
limited capacity to read or understand. 
 
Store this at room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  Containers of test material must be returned  to the study facility, ev en if they are empty. 
 
Be sure to complete the diary calendar each da y to document applications and also note any 
missed doses; and bring the comple ted diary to each study visit.

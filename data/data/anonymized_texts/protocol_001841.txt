103 1. BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE:  
104 Insulin  degludec  (IDeg),  an ultra-long-acting  basal  insulin,  is increasingly  used to 
105 treat patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). IDeg has a half -life of 25 hours  and 
106 duration  of action  exceeding  42 hours  in patients  with T1D (1,2)  and as a result  does 
107 not require  as stringent  a dosing  schedule  as other  basal  insulins.  It has been  shown  
108 to have a 4 -fold lower within -patient variability in its  pharmacodynamic response  
109 compared   to  insulin   glargine  over  the  24  hour  dose  interval   (3).  The  rate  of 
110 symptomatic  and severe  hypoglycemia  in T1D patients  has also been  shown  to be 
111 lower  with IDeg  than insulin  glargine  (4). A recently  published  systematic  review  
112 and meta -analysis of 15 clinical trials comparing IDeg to insulin  glargine showed  
113 lower  fasting  plasma  glucose  and less nocturnal  hypoglycemia  with IDeg  (5). The 
114 total basal  insulin  dose invariably  decreases  with the transition  to IDeg  (6,7).  The 
115 lower  insulin  use  and  lower  rate  of  hypoglycemia  may  eventually  translate  into 
116 medical  cost savings  too (8). Moreover,  patients  have  expressed  more  satisfaction  
117 with their regimen and quality of life with IDeg compared to other agents in  one 
118 study that compared this  objectively using questionnaires, before and after transition  
119 (9). All of these factors give IDeg an advantage over other basal insulins currently  in 
120 the market.  However,  steady  state concentration  of IDeg  is not reached  until 2 to 3 
121 doses  are administered  daily,  and this may result  in greater  glycemic  variability  in 
122 the  24  to  72  hours  following the  initiation  of  therapy with  IDeg  (10).  There   is 
123 currently  no evidence -based  guidance  on how to minimize  glucose  excursions  when  
124 transitioning patients from their existing basal insulin to IDeg. The package insert  for 
125 IDeg  suggests  a 1:1 dose conversion  from  other  basal  insulin  regimens  to IDeg  for 
126 adult  patients.  However,  this does not account  for the time it takes  IDeg  to achieve  
127 steady  state and can result  in worsening  of glycemic  control  in the 48-72 hours  after 
128 the transition  is made.  Many  practitioners  at the University  of Washington  Diabetes  
129 Clinic have seen better glycemic control within the first 12 to 24 hours in  T1D 
130 patients in whom we gave 50% of their usual dose of insulin glargine  at bedtime  
131 along with the first dose of IDeg. This leads to our hypothesis that a bridg ing therapy  
132 involving  the use of a reduced  amount  of patients’  prior  basal  insulin  at the time of 
133 initiating  IDeg  will lead to improved  glycemic  control  in the first 24-72 hours  on 
134 IDeg,  minimizing  the morbidities  associated  with hyperglycemia  and the need  for 
135 correctional  insulin  and also avoiding  hypoglycemia  resulting  from  over-correction  
136 due to use of additional  rapid -acting  insulin.  Additionally,  we will follow  what  has 
137 been  done  in prior  clinical  trials  of conversion  from  other  basal  insulins  to IDeg  and 
138 hence,  convert  them  from  their insulin  glargine  total daily  dose to 80% of that dose 
139 as IDeg  (4). An improvement  in the safety  and ease of transitioning  from  the more  
140 commonly used glargine to IDeg may greatly encourage more providers and  patients  
141 to adopt IDeg as the basal insulin of their choice. Another benefit would  be knowing  
142 how to transition  patients  back  to their outpatient  IDeg  therapy  when  they are being  
143 discharged home from an inpatient stay and were switched to insulin glargine  during  
144 their hospitalization, as IDeg is not formulary in  many hospitals. The purpose of this  
145 pilot study  is to gain preliminary  evidence  of whether  bridging  with insulin  glargine  
146 while  transitioning  to IDeg  provides  better  glycemic  results  in the transition  period  
147 compared to direct  conversion.

149 2. ENDPOINTS AND  OBJECTIVES:  
150 Primary  endpoint:  
151 Change  in percent  time spent  in target  glycemic  range  (TIR,  glucose  70-180 mg/dL,  both 
152 values included) in the 48 hours before and the 48 hours after the  1st dose of  IDeg  
153 Primary  objective:  
154 To  compare  the  mean  change  in  percent  time  in  range  (as  defined  by  the  primary  
155 endpoint) between patients who transition directly to IDeg to the mean change in  patients  
156 who use a bridging dose of insulin glargine along with 1st dose of IDeg. 
157 
158 Secondary end  points:  
159 These will include the following data obtained from their CGM download in the 48  hours  
160 following  the first dose of IDeg  as measured  as a difference  compared  to the 48 hours  
161 preceding the  dose:  
162 1. Coefficient of variation of percent -time-in-range for each treatment  within  
163 each group  
164 2. Nocturnal time in range of 70 -180 mg/dL (between mid -night and 0600  hours,  
165 both values  included)  
166 3. Percent time above 180 mg/dL (TAR -1), percent time above 250  mg/dL  
167 (TAR -2) for each treatment within each  group  
168 4. Percent  time below  70 mg/dL  (TBR -1), percent  time below  54 mg/dL  (TBR - 
169 2) for each treatment within each  group  
170 5. Number of correction boluses for each treatment within each  group 
171 
172 Secondary objectives:  
173 To compare each of the secondary endpoints between patients who use a bridging dose to  
174 patients who transition directly to IDeg.  
175  
176 3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS  
 
177 3.1 Study  Hypothesis:  
178 Our hypothesis is that among patients who transition from insulin glargine to  IDeg, those  
179 who use a bridging dose of insulin glargine will not have a significant change, on  average,  
180 in  time  spent  in  target  glycemic  range  during  the  transition  period,  whereas,   those  
181 transitioning d irectly to IDeg will have a significant change in this parameter. We  further  
182 hypothesize  that   those   using  the  bridging  dose  of  insulin   glargine   will   have  less 
183 hypoglycemia,  less hyperglycemia  and need  fewer  correction  boluses  than the direc t- 
184 conversion patients during the transition  period.  
 
185 3.2 Study  type:  
186 186 
187 This   will   be   a   double -blind,   randomized,   single -center,   proof -of-concept   study.  
188 Randomization  will be stratified  by use of insulin  glargine  once  daily  or twice  daily  at 
189 baseline.  Randomization  will be conducted  using  permuted -block  design  with a block  
190 size of 4, ensuring  equal  numbers  of bridging  and non-bridging  patients  in each of the 2 
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
6 | P a g e   
 191 resultant  strata  after every  4th patient  is randomized  within  a stratum.  The 2 strata  with 
192 blocked randomization within each stratum will result in 4 groups as  follows:  
193 1. Bridging  Groups:  
194 i. Patients transitioning from once daily insulin glargine  to once daily IDeg  with 
195 a bridging dose of insulin  glargine.  
196 ii. Patient s transitioning from twice daily insulin glargine  to once daily  IDeg  
197 with a bridging dose of insulin  glargine.  
198 2. Direct -Conversion  Groups:  
199 i. Patients transitioning from once daily insulin glargine  to once daily  IDeg  
200 without  a bridging dose of insulin glargine (but with a bridging dose  of 
201 placebo solution to preserve  blinding).  
202 ii. Patients transitioning from twice daily insulin glargine  to once daily  IDeg  
203 without  a bridging dose of insulin glargine (but with a bridging dose  of 
204 placebo solution to preserve blinding). 
205 
206 All patients will be instructed to use their own prescription insulin medications till  before  
207 the 1st  dose of IDeg.  On the night  they have  to transition  to IDeg,  they will start using  
208 study drugs  for their basal  insulin  (see section  3.10.4).  Starting  with the 1st dose of IDeg,  
209 their basal insulin will be from study drug only, till visit #3 (see section 3.10.6), at  which  
210 time,  they will resume  their original  insulin  prescriptions.  They  will remain  on their own 
211 prescription  short -acting  insulin  throughout  the study.  On the night  of the transition,  all 
212 patients will be instructed to take their 1st  dose of IDeg and along with this, they will  take 
213 a second  injection  from  a pre-filled  syringe  of a pre-specified  dose of insulin  glargine  or 
214 matched  placebo  (normal  saline),  that participants  will collect  from  Investigational  Drug  
215 Services  Pharmacy  (IDS)  on the same  day. The dose will be calculated  ahead  of time by 
216 study staff on  visit  2 (see under  section 3.10.2.1). Neither  the patients, nor  the  research  
217 staff will be aware of their randomization, which will be done by IDS. Patients will act  as 
218 their own controls,  as we will collect  glycemic  data from  48 hours  prior  to the first dose 
219 of IDeg,  which  will be compared  to the data seen in the 48 hours  after the first dose of 
220 IDeg.  During  this observation  period  of the 48 hours  before  and after the first dose of 
221 IDeg,  no adjustments  will be made  to the calculated  and recommended  doses  of insulin  
222 glargine or IDeg. Patients will be followed for up to 1 week after the first dose of IDeg. 
223 
 
224 3.3 Rationale for study  Design  
225 Though  IDeg  is being  increasingly  used in clinical  practice,  there  are no guidelines  on 
226 what  is   the  best  way  to  transition  patients  from  other  long -acting  insulins,  such  as 
227 glargine,  to IDeg.  The package  insert  recommends  1:1 dose conversion  from  other  basal  
228 insulins  to IDeg,  but this does not account  for the time taken  by IDeg  to achiev e steady  
229 state (typically 48 -72 hours). There  is no  guidance on  what  to do in  those 48 -72 hours.  
230 Given  the time taken  for IDeg  to achieve  steady  state,  the period  of transition  from  one 
231 insulin to another, can result in significant glycemic variation in the 24 -72 hours after  the 
232 first dose.  We want  to study  how best to avoid  or minimize  this and the option  of using  a 
233 small  dose of their original  long-acting  insulin  has anecdotal  evidence  of success  in our 
234 practice.

 236 3.4 Study  population:  
237 We aim to recruit  patients  with type 1 diabetes  mellitus  only.  We will screen  50 patients  
238 with  the  plan  to  randomize  approximately 40  patients  to  start  IDeg.  The  IDS  at  the 
239 University  of Washington  will randomize  patients  (1:1)  to either  receive  or not receive  a 
240 bridging insulin glargine dose along with the 1st  dose of IDeg, within the stratified  groups  
241 of once - or twice -daily insulin -glargine  regimens.

290 3.7 Withdrawal  Criteria  
291 Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any stage and for any  reason. 
292 
293 Patients  may be discontinued  prematurely,  by the investigator  for any of the following  
294 reasons:  
295 • Emergence of a severe condition(s) such that, in the judgement of the  investigator,  
296 continuation in the trial would negatively impact the health of the  patient.  
297 • Lack of compliance with study medication or visits as judged by the  Investigator.  
298 • Patient lost to  follow -up. 
299 • Major protocol  violation.  
300 • Inter -current  illness  that, in the judgment  of the investigator,  should  result  in 
301 premature  discontinuation.  
302 • Use of prohibited medications (see the Inclusion/Exclusion  criteria)  
303 • Onset of glucocorticoid burst/pulse therapy during the study  period.  
304 • Knowledge of new risks necessitating new benefit/risk  evaluation.  
305 • Patient voices intention to become pregnant in the immediate future. 
306 
307 Patients must be discontinued for any of the following  reasons:  
308 • If Novo  Nordisk  determines  that the study  must  be stopped,  all patients  will be 
309 required to end participation at that  time.  
310 • Trial  closed -out. 
311 • Patient becomes pregnant. 
312 
313 A patient  will not be discontinued  early  from  the study  solely  because  of missing  the 
314 scheduled  transition  from  insulin  glargine  to IDeg.  The research  staff will discuss  the 
315 matter  with the patient  and determine  whether  they feel he/she  can continue  moving  
316 forward  in  the  study  following  all  study  procedures,  including  dosing.  If  after  this 
317 discussion,  the patient  and the research  team  are in agreement  about  continuing  in the 
318 study, the investigator will decide if he/she may remain in the  study. 
319 
320 A subject cannot be considered lost to follow -up until the research center performs  and 
321 documents at least three (3) attempts to contact him by phone, email or  letter.

324 Patients  discontinuing from  the study will  not be replaced.  IDS  will  continue to  assign  
325 randomization   of  the  next   participant   to   a  specific   group,   based   on  the original  
326 randomization plan, when the next participant has completed screening procedures and  is 
327 ready  for randomization.  We will include  data from  all randomized  participants  in our 
328 data analysis. 
329 
 
330 3.9 Rationale for Study  Population  
331 The main  objective  of our study  is to determine  if the use of a bridging  dose of insulin  
332 glargine  is able to improve  glucose  control  in first few days after the first dose of IDeg.  
333 As  a  result,  we  will  recruit  participants  who  are  reasonably well  controlled  on  their 
334 baseline  insulin  regimens.  We will exclude  participants  on non-insulin  glucose -lowering  
335 agents,  as these  can affect  glycemic  variability  themselves  and confound  the results.  We 
336 are   not   excluding   patients   with   known   severe   hypoglycemia   or   hypoglycemia  
337 unawareness in this study, as these are the patients who stand to benefit the most from  the 
338 transition from insulin glargine to IDeg. We are excluding patients with stage 4 or 5  CKD.  
339 We will be excluding  patients  with a myocardial  infarc tion in the last 6 months.  These  
340 patients  will be excluded  as they carry  a higher  risk that hypoglycemia  or hyperglycemia  
341 may result in  mortality. 
342 
 
343 3.10 Visit  Procedures  
344 Subjects  will be screened  for study  eligibility  and interest  in participating  in this study  
345 (Screening Visit/Visit 1).  All subjects will have the study explained to them and sign  the 
346 informed  consent  prior  to  beginning  any  study  procedures.  Subjects  must  meet  the 
347 inclusion criteria and have no exclusions. 
348 
349 Randomization and treatment will be initiated only once eligibility is confirmed. 
350 
351 There will be 4 phases to the  study:  
352 • A screening phase to establish eligibility that spans from screening visit  till 
353 insertion of study CGM (up to 2  weeks).  
354 • A baselin e observation phase to collect CGM data on their original  insulin  
355 glargine regimen, starting from insertion of study CGM to first dose of  IDeg  
356 administration (~3  days)  
357 • A treatment  phase  starting  from  1st to last dose of IDeg  and consisting  of at least 
358 3 days of IDeg therapy (3 -7 days).  
359 • A follow -up phase  from  removal  of study  CGM  to exiting  from  the study  (till up 
360 to 7 days after the last dose of  IDeg)

3.10.1  Screening Visit (Visit  1): 
Participants will be seen at the research wing of the Diabetes Care Center (DCC) at the 
University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Research staff will obtain informed consent after 
explaining study procedures. A detailed diabetes and medical history will be co llected from 
the subjects. Their current medication regimen will be verified from them, particularly the 
actual number of units of the different insulins they are using. Subjects will undergo 
assessment of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, weight, height , BMI) and a focused 
physical exam. If there is no available record of eGFR within the last year and/or 
hemoglobin A1c within the last 90 days, these will be obtained by phlebotomy at this visit. 
2 tubes of blood (1x 3cc lavender and 1x 4 cc lime green) wi ll be drawn and sent off to 
measure hemoglobin A1c (by HPLC method) and basic metabolic panel to the UWMC 
clinical laboratory, if required. Subjects will be instructed to not alter their diet, alcohol 
consumption or exercise regimen from the time of study CGM insertion till 48 hours after 
the first dose of IDeg.  
 
If they are considered to be eligible for the study, then the research staff will contact IDS. 
IDS will then randomize the participant to one of the two arms within the two stratified 
groups. (Refer to sections 3.5 and 8.5 for details). Research staff will then contact the 
participant by phone or email to have them return for visit 2 for insertion of the study CGM.  
 
Important considerations for keeping things as uniform as possible in the study  are as 
below:  
• We will ensure that all subjects on once daily insulin glargine are taking it at 
bedtime. Subjects who were taking it in the morning only at screening visit, will be 
switched to bedtime dosing at least 7 days prior to study CGM  insertion.  
• We will ensure that subjects on twice daily insulin glargine at screening visit are 
taking their 2nd dose of the day at  bedtime.

396 3.10.2 CGM insertion visit (Visit  2): 
397 Participant  will return  to the DCC,  within  2 weeks  of visit 1, to meet  with a research  
398 coordinator  who will assist  with the insertion  of the CGM  (Dexcom  G6). At this visit,  
399 study staff  will  also  perform  any teaching  and  training  that  may be  required  for  the 
400 participant  to know  how to use the CGM  device.  This visit needs  to be conducted  before  
401 1200  hours.  They  will  be  given  CGM  supplies  to  last  up  to  1  week.  They  will  be 
402 instructed  to keep  the study  CGM  on at all times  for this duration.  If they have  their own 
403 CGM,  then they will be allowed  to keep  that on in addition  to the study  CGM,  should  
404 they desire  to do so. They  will be instructed  to replace  the sensor,  if needed.  The study  
405 CGM  insertion  day will be considered  day 0. The next day will be day 1. Transition  to 
406 IDeg  will be done  on Day 3 as below.  Subjects  will be dispensed  a log book  in which  
407 they will need  to document  carbohydrates  consumed,  exercise  duration  and time,  timing  
408 and doses  of basal  and bolus  insulin  (broken  down  as prandial  and correction),  self- 
409 monitored  blood  glucose  values,  hypoglycemia  symptoms  and intervention  for each day 
410 they are in the study (from CGM insertion to removal) (See Appendix A and B). We  will 
411 inquire  about  any change  to concomitant  medications  and document  insulin  doses  being  
412 administered. 
413 
414 
415 3.10.2.1 Insulin  Dosing:  
416 At visit 2, subjects will also be given written instructions on how to do the transition  from  
417 insulin glargine to  IDeg. 
418 
419 Calculation of IDeg  dose 
420 The dose of IDeg  that subjects  will be switched  to will equal  80% of the total daily  dose 
421 of insulin  glargine  they reported  using  at visit 1. This reduction  is what  was done  in the 
422 clinical  trials  of  conversion  from  any  basal  insulin  to  IDeg  with  lower  risk  of 
423 hypoglycemia (4). For example, if a subject was on 25 units of glargine at screening  visit,  
424 then they will need to switch to 20 units of IDeg (0.8 X 25 = 20). Number of units will  be 
425 rounded up to the next whole number if decimal points are ≥ 0.5 and rounded down if 
426 <0.5.  
427 
428 Timing of IDeg  dose 
429 To keep things  consistent  across  participants,  we will instruct  all patients  to start their 
430 first dose of IDeg 3 days after the study CGM is inserted. The rationale for this is that  the 
431 first 24 hours  of data on the CGM  is not very accurate  and after that we want  48 hours  of 
432 baseline glucose data on insulin glargine, prior to transitioning to IDeg. This will be  used 
433 later  as  their  baseline  to  compare  with  the  values  seen  on  IDeg.  Subjects  will  be 
434 instructed  to   administer  their  first  dose  of  IDeg  at  2100  hours  on  the  3rd   day after 
435 insertion of study CGM. They will then administer the same dose of IDeg every night  for 
436 5 ± 2 consecutive doses. 
437 
438 Dosing of Insulin  Glargine  
439 Dosing of insulin glargine will depend on the group a subject is randomized  to: 
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
13 | P a g e   
 440 
441 If randomized to bridging  dose:  
442 For  subjects  on  once -daily glargine,  up  to  day 2  after  study CGM  insertion  they will  
443 administer  their usual  insulin  glargine  dose at bedtime.  On day 3, they will administer  
444 50% of their usual glargine dose (using study drug) at 2100 hours along with only their 
445 FIRST  IDeg  dose,  as calculated.  Thereafter,  they will not administer  insulin  glargine  till 
446 after the 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg  are completed. 
447 
448 For  subjects  on  twice -daily  glargine,  on  day  3  after  study  CGM  insertion  they  will 
449 administer  their AM glargine  dose as usual  (i.e. 100%).  On the same  night,  they will 
450 administer 50%  of their bedtime glargine dose  (using s tudy drug) at 2100 hours along  
451 with  only  their  FIRST  IDeg  dose  as  calculated  above.  Thereafter,  they  will  not 
452 administer insulin glargine till after the 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg are completed. 
453 
454 If randomized to direct  conversion:  
455 For  subjects   on  once -daily glargine,  up  to  day 2  after  study CGM  insertion  they will  
456 administer their usual insulin glargine dose at bedtime. On day 3, they will administer  the 
457 first dose  of IDeg , as calculated  above,  at 2100  hours  and a placebo  solution  in a dose 
458 equivalent to 50% of their usual glargine dose. They will NOT  administer  any  insulin  
459 glargine from that night till after 5 ( ± 2) days of IDeg are completed. 
460 
461 For  subjects  on  twice -daily  glargine,  on  day  3  after  study  CGM  insertion  th ey will 
462 administer  their AM glargine  dose as usual  (i.e. 100%).  On the same  night,  they will 
463 administer  the first dose  of IDeg , as calculated  above,  at 2100  hours  and a placebo  
464 solution  in a dose equivalent  to 50% of their bedtime  glargine  dose.  They  will NOT  
465 administer  any insulin  glargine  from  that night  till after 5 (±  2) days of IDeg  are 
466 completed. 
467 
468 Use of short -acting  insulin  
469 At the CGM  insertion  visit (visit  2), subjects  will be instructed  to use their prandial  
470 insulin  to carbohydrate  ratios  or pre-specified  doses  of prandial  insulin  the way they 
471 would  have  otherwise,  during  the study.  For the 48 hours  before  and after  the first dose 
472 of IDeg, however, all subjects will be instructed not to use any correctional insulin  unless  
473 their blood glucose is >250, both around meals and otherwise. While we understand  that 
474 subjects  might  be reluctant  to allow  their blood  glucose  to run in the 180-250 range  
475 without correction, we feel this is a necessary part of our study protocol. The main  reason  
476 for this is that our primary  study  end point  is time in range  (TIR).  If the change  from  
477 insulin  glargine  to  IDeg  results  in  more  time  in  the  180 -250  range  in  patients  not 
478 receiving  the bridging  dose of glargine,  patients  are likely  to correct  this aggressively  
479 with the use of correctional  insulin.  This would  dilute  any measurable  differences  in our 
480 primary end point (TIR). It would only potentially show differences in the  secondary end  
481 points of dose and number of correctional insulin  used. However, by telling them to  avoid  
482 bolusing till glucose rises above 250,  we  will be  able to discern  any differences in  TIR 
483 that might arise from the change of basal insulin, while at the same time, not being  unsafe  
484 for the patients over a 96 ho ur period of  time.

 486 3.10.3 Telephone Encounters  #1: 
487 This will be on day 1 (i.e. the day after the study  CGM  is inserted).  We will ensure  that 
488 the study  CGM  is working  and the subject  does not have  any questions  or concerns.  
489 Study  staff will also assist  the subject  with any troubleshooting,  if necessary.  Subjects  
490 will be instructed  to upload  their CGM  data on day 3, for research  staff to review  it. 
491 Subjects  will  be instructed  not  to  alter their insulin  glargine dose for the  followi ng 48 
492 hours,  till the night  of day 3, when  they transition  to IDeg.  We will inquire  about  any 
493 adverse  events  and change  to concomitant  medications  and document  doses  of insulin  
494 being administered by patient. 
495 
 
496 3.10.4 Telephone Encounter  #2: 
497 Research  staff will review  patient’s  CGM  data upload  on day 3. We will inquire  about  
498 adverse  events,  any  change  to  concomitant  medications  and  also  document  doses  of 
499 insulin being  administered.  
500 If there  is ≥ 38 hours  of usable  CGM  data,  then they will be instructed  to proceed  with 
501 their first dose of  IDeg that night,  as scheduled.  In  order to obtain the bridging dose  of 
502 insulin  glargine  or matched  placebo,  subjects  will be instructed  to proceed  to IDS at the 
503 University of Washington to collect their s tudy drug the same  day. 
504 If there  is < 38 hours  of usable  CGM  data,  then subjects  will be instructed  to wear  their 
505 CGM, per study protocol, while remaining on their original insulin regimen, and to  again  
506 upload CGM data on day 5. Research staff will review this data on day  5. 
507 If there is ≥ 38 hours of usable CGM data from day 3 -5, they will be instructed to  proceed  
508 with their first dose of IDeg  that night,  as scheduled.  Subjects  with < 38 hours  of usable  
509 CGM data will be discontinued from the  study. 
510 
 
511 3.10.5 Telephone Encounter  #3: 
512 This will be on day 4, i.e. the day after the first bedtime  dose of IDeg  (or on day 6 for 
513 subjects  who  needed  to  repeat  baseline CGM  data collection).  We will  inquire  about  
514 adverse   events  and    any  change  to   concomitant  medications.  The   doses  of  insulin  
515 administered will be obtained and documented. The main purpose of this call is to  ensure  
516 that the subject implemented the transition from insulin glargine to IDeg, correctly. If it  is 
517 discovered that the subject forgot to transition, then they will be given repeat  instructions  
518 to  dose on  night  of day 4.  If  it  is  discovered  that  the subject  executed  the  transition  
519 incorrectly,  then they will need  to undergo  a 3-day “wash  out period”,  during  which  they 
520 will resume  their original  insulin  glargine  regimen  (with  alterations  as deemed  necessary  
521 by study  physician  on day 4), and then they will be instructed  to execute  the transition  
522 again  on night  of day 7. If a subject  performs  the transition  erroneously  a second  time,  
523 he/she  will be discontinued  from  the study  and replaced  by a new subject  as the study  
524 supplies  allow.  Subjects  will be instructed  not to alter their dose of IDeg  for at least the 
525 first 3 doses (i.e. 48 hours after 1st dose).

 527 3.10.6 CGM Removal and Download Visit (Visit  3): 
528 Subjects  will come  in approximately  8 ±  2 days after their CGM  insertion.  At this visit,  
529 their study CGM will be removed and downloaded. We will inquire about adverse  events  
530 and  any  change  to  concomitant  medications.  We  will  collect  and  review  their  study  
531 logbook.  They  will  also  be  given  instructions  on  how  to  transition  back  to  insulin  
532 glargine. 
533 
534 Once -daily  glargine  users :  Approximately  24  hours   after  their  last  dose  of  IDeg,  
535 subjects  will be instructed  to administer  50% of their original  total daily  dose of glargine  
536 at bedtime.  At 48 hours  after their last dose of IDeg,  they will return  to their original  
537 bedtime insulin glargine dose. 
538 
539 Twice -daily  glargine  users: Approximately 24 hours after their last dose  of  IDeg,  they 
540 will administer  50% of their original  bedtime  insulin  glargine  dose.  Approximately  36 
541 hours  after  their  last  dose  of  IDeg  t hey  will  again  administer  50%  of  their  original  
542 morning insulin glargine dose. Approximately 48 hours after their last dose of IDeg,  they 
543 will resume  their original  insulin  glargine  dosing  regimen  (i.e. 50% of total dose twice  
544 daily). 
545 
546 Subjects will receive a gift card for $50 for participation in the study. 
547 
 
548 3.10.7 Exit Visit/Telephone encounter #4 (Visit  4): 
549 This  visit  will  be  approximately 7  days  after  the  study  CGM  removal  (+/ -  2 days).  
550 Subjects  will  be  called  to  see  if  they have  any  concerns  or  questions.  They  will  be 
551 instructed  to  follow  up  with  their  original  endocrinologist  for  any  further  insulin  
552 adjustments. 
553 
 
554 3.11 Assessments for  Efficacy  
555 On the screening visit (visit 1), if there is no available record of eGFR within the last  year 
556 and/or  hemoglobin  A1c within  the last 3 months,  these  will be obtained  by venipuncture  
557 at this visit.  The research  team  nurse  or physician  will perform  this. 2 tubes  of blood  (1x 
558 3cc lavender  and 1x 4 cc lime green)  will be drawn  and sent off to measure  hemoglobin  
559 A1c (by HPLC  method)  and basic  metabolic  panel  to the UWMC  clinical  laboratory.  No 
560 extra  blood  will be collected  from  the subjects.  There  will be no other  instances  of blood  
561 collection  during  the study.  These  will help ensure  that appropriate  subjects  are enrolled  
562 in the  study.  
563 At the various telephone encounters, study staff will verify that the subjects are  following  
564 study  instructions  correctly.  Specifically,  on Telephone  Encounter  #2, only if adequate  
565 usable  CGM  data is available  on the data uploaded  by the patient  will they be allowed  to 
566 proceed with the transition (see section  3.11.4).  
567 By measuring the time a patient spends in range (TIR = 70 -180 mg/dL), we are  assessing  
568 the efficacy of the use of IDeg as a basal  insulin.

 571 3.12 Assessments for  Safety  
572 The  primary safety concern  in  this  study is  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia  
573 management  will be revised  at screening  visit to ensure  appropriate  education  and all 
574 medications and supplies needed to manage hypoglycemia will be prescribed at  screening.  
575 Subjects  will be instructed  that if they see BG <70 mg/dL  on their personal  CGM  that 
576 persists  longer   than  15  minutes  or  notice  symptoms  of  hypoglycemia  regardless  of 
577 glucose  reading,  they need  to perform  a capillary  blood  glucose  (CBG)  measurement  to 
578 confirm  if the meter  shows  a reading  <70 mg/dL.  If it does,  they need  to complete  a 
579 hypoglycemia  episode  form  (Appendix  B).  Upon  onset  of  a  hypoglycemic  episode,  
580 subject  is recommended  to check  CBG  every  15 minutes  until the value  is ≥ 70 mg/dL  
581 and/or  symptoms   have   resolved.   Repeated  CBG  measurements   and/or   symptoms,  
582 occurring  within  a period  of 60 minutes  after onset  on a hypoglycemic  episode,  will by 
583 default be considered as one hypoglycemic episode until a succeeding CBG value is ≥ 70 
584 mg/dL and/or symptoms have been resolved and should be reported as one  hypoglycemic  
585 episode.  CBG  measurements  <  70  mg/dL  or  hypoglycemic  symptoms  after  the  60 
586 minutes period shall trigger the reporting of a new hypoglycemia episode and prompt  the 
587 subject  to fill out a new hypoglycemic  episode  form  until a succeedi ng measurement  is ≥ 
588 70  mg/dL and/or  symptoms  have  been  resolved.  In  case  of  several  low  CBG  values  
589 within  the 60 minutes  interval,  the lowest  value  is the one that will be reported  as the 
590 CBG  value  for the hypoglycemic  episode  but the start time of the episode  will remain  as 
591 the  time  for  the  first  CBG  value  and/or  symptom.  Whenever  a  subject  completes  a 
592 hypoglycemia  episode  form,  they should  notify  study  staff within  24 hours.  When  they 
593 notify study staff, details of the events around  the low blood glucose (activity, food  intake,  
594 insulin  administration)  will be collected  from  them  and then recommendations  will be 
595 made, as deemed necessary, by the study  physician.  
596 Hyperglycemia  is the other  risk of this study.  Subjects  will be instructed  at screening  to 
597 notify  study  staff  within  24  hours  of  a  blood  glucose  >250.  Study  staff  will  try  to 
598 ascertain  from  the  subject  if  any  investigations  are  needed  and  make  management  
599 recommendations, as deemed necessary, by  the study  physician.  
600 By measuring the time a patient spends above or below range (>180  mg/dL or <70     601  
mg/dL) and assessing the frequency of use of correctional doses of short -acting insulin,   602 we 
are assessing how safe their glycemic managemen t regimen  is. 
603 
 
604 3.13 Patient Compliance  
605 Patient compliance to study procedures will be assessed during the telephone encounters. 606      
Compliance will be defined by the following (all 3 need to be met to be considered      607 
compliant), assessed during the 48 hours prior to and after the first dose of  IDeg:  
 
608 • No missed doses of basal insulin  
609 • No missed doses of nutritional insulin with meals 
610 • Wearing the study CGM for >19 hours a  day

 613 4. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS:  
614   The primary objective of this pilot study is to calculate the change in percent time that    615    
BG is “in range” (TIR defined as 70 -180 mg/dL) in the 48 hours before the first IDeg     616 dose 
vs. the 48 hours after the first dose, and to compare the mean of this change between 617 patients 
who are randomized to receive bridging glargine and those who are randomized  618 to not  receive 
bridging glargine.  Randomization will  be str atified by glargine use (once 619   vs. twice daily). 
For each patient, the TIR  in the 48 hours before first IDeg use will be   620   calculated,  as will 
the TIR in the 48 hours after first  IDeg use. The difference of these   621    values will then be 
calculated, and the mean of the differences compared between the    622 randomized arms.  Our  
primary  hypothesis  will  assume  that  the  “bridging  effect”  is 623 similar between patients who 
take glargine once daily and twice daily. However, we plan 624 an exploratory look at this 
assumption as a secondary  objective.  
625 
626 If we assume the true change in TIR (before first  dose of  IDeg minus  after first dose of  627 
IDeg)  to be 0% for the  bridging group and  15%  for the  non -bridging group, and  if  we 628 
assume a common standard deviation of 15% (meaning the distributions of change in TIR 629   are 
separated by 1 standard -deviation unit), then 20 patients in each group will provide   630 87% 
power to observe a statistically significant (at the two-sided level of .05) difference  631 in mean 
change of  TIR. 
632 
633  As noted above, we’ll assess the magnitude of this difference as a function of once - vs.   634  
twice -daily glargine use.  With only 40 patients,  it’s highly unlikely that  a statisti cally   635    
significant interaction will be observed, but if the directions of the difference in mean    636     
changes  are the same in the once -daily vs. twice -daily groups we shall consider the      637 results 
to be consistent with each  other.  
638 
639 Secondary endpoints to be assessed in a descriptive manner include the following: 
640  1. Coefficient of variation of TIR for each treatment within each  group  
641 2. Nocturnal time in range of 70 -180 mg/dL (nTIR; both values included) (between 
642  mid-night and 0600  hours)  
643 3. Percent time above 180 mg/dL (TAR -1), percent time above 250 mg/dL (TAR -2) 
644  for each treatment within each  group  
645 4. Percent time below 70 mg/dL (TBR -1), percent time below 54 mg/dL (TBR -2)  
646  for each treatment within each  group  
647 5. Number of correction boluses for each treatment within each  group 
648 
649     The overarching goal of  this pilot study is to collect data in a controlled setting on a     650  
variety of long -acting insulin regimens  and  gain  an  idea if there is  a signal.  The data   651     
generated in this pilot study will be used to assist in the design of a future and larger     652 study 
where a more definitive comparison of efficacy will be  conducted.  
653 
654 
655 5.  DATA  HANDLING  AND  REC ORD  KEEPING:  
656 Study  information  will  be  collected  for  each  participant  by  research  staff  using  
657 standardized  Case  xReport  Forms  (CRFs).  CRFs  will not report  information  about  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
18 | P a g e   
 658 treatment assignment in order to maintain blinding of treatment allocation. Forms will be 659 
stored at a secure location at the clinical site.  We expect that the majority of data will be  660 
collected via CRFs; however, other data sources, such as C GM download and laboratory  661  data,  
may be used.  All  study data will  be  entered  into  the Research  Electronic Data  662 Capture 
(REDCap),  a  web -based  data  entry  and  management  system  that  is  HIPPA 663   compliant 
and powered  by the  In stitute of Translational Health Sciences, by research    664 staff.  The 
clinical data management procedures will be consistent with the International  665 Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH E6) standards for Good Clinical Practice  (GCPs)1. 
666 
667 
668 6.  ETHICS:  
669 Ethical  considerations  related  to  the trial  include ensuring that  all  patients  receive an 670    
amount of insulin deemed appropriate by the clinicians for treatment of their diabetes    671 
mellitus both during the study period and fo llowing the conclusion of the study. Patients  672    
should have prompt treatment for both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia with blood    673 
glucose level of > 250mg/dl, as well as other possible complications related to treatment  674 with 
insulin, accor ding to the standard of care following the guidance of their clinicians.  675  Potential 
participants will be sought from among the patients attending the study center,  676 University of 
Washington’s Diabetes Care Center in Seattle, WA.  An application wi ll be 677 submitted for  
approval  by  University  of  Washington's  IRB  prior  to  conducting  the  678   research study.   
Potential candidates  will be identified and contacted according to the   679 procedures established 
by University of Washington’s  IRB in compliance with local laws 680 protecting patient 
confidentiality and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and  681  the  ICH GCP  
guidelines1.  Patients meeting the  inclusion and exclusion criteria of the   682   study will be 
identifie d by clinicians at the study center and offered the opportunity to    683  participate in the 
study.  An informed consent form will be given to all patients meeting  684   the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   This informed consent form will clearly offe r the   685    possibility to opt out 
of any further contacts  with the study.  Written consent will be     686    obtained from all subjects 
invited to participate in the study after explaining again the    687  purpose  and  procedures  of  
the  study.  In  the  initial  contact  and  at  the  time  of  the 688 screening visit,  study subjects  
will  be encouraged  to  ask  questions  and  they will  be  689 reassured that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time.  Clinician investigators and 690  Nov o Nordisk, will comply with all 
applicable  regulatory and legal requirements,  ICH  691 GCP guidelines  and  the  Declaration  of  
Helsinki  in  obtaining  and  documenting  the  692 informed  consent1. 
693 
694 
695 7.  STUDY  SCHEDULE:  
696 The study  will  begin  recruitment  of  patients  immediately  following  the  approval  of 697  
University of Washington’s  IRB.  We plan to  recruit patients over  a 12 -month period.  698  
Following the completion of patient recruitment and data collection, we plan to p erform  699 data 
analysis and complete the integrated final study report over a 4 -month  period.

715 8.1 Study medication(s) /  devices(s)  
716 • Insulin  glargine, 100 units per mL injected subcutaneously daily, dosage as  
717 determined by the clinician and study protocol. Manufacturer: Sanofi or Lilly  
718 • IDeg,  100 units  per mL injected  subcutaneously  daily,  dosage  as determined  by 
719 the clinician and study protocol. Manufacturer: Novo Nordisk.  
720 • Placebo, 9g/L sodium chloride (normal saline) injected subcutaneously  daily,  
721 dosage as determined by the clinician and study protocol.  
722 • Pen needles for injecting  insulins.  
723 • Dexcom G6 Mobile CGM System, inserted subcutaneously and worn for  3-10 
724 days. Manufacturer: Dexcom, Inc.  
725 • Glucose meter and 100 test  strips, to perform self -monitoring of  blood glucose,  
726 one box dispensed per patient. Source: Diabetes Care Center.  Manufacturer:  
727 Accucheck Aviva Plus  
728  
 
729 8.2 Packaging and Labelling of Study Medication(s)  
730 • IDS will package the  glargine  and  placebo  as  pre -filled  syringed  from  vials 731
  identically. IDS will then label the syringes with dose, dosing instructions, and 2 
732  patient identifiers based on study drug request order entered by research staff,  733
  after being n otified about treatment assignment by  IDS. 
734 • IDeg will be dispensed in the original manufacturer’s packaging,  and  IDS will  735
  label IDeg with dose, dosing instructions, and 2 patient  identifiers.  
736 •   Dexcom G6 Mobile CGM System will be distributed to patients in its original   737
  manufacturer  packaging.  
738 
739 Labelling of all medications and device will be in accordance with local law and study 
740 requirements.

21 | P a g e   
 742 8.3 Storage a nd Drug Accountability of Study Medication(s)  
743 All investigational  and/or  trial  products  received  will  be  accounted  for  by  the  IDS. 744     
Accountability logs are maintained for each product and dispensing is logged out as     745   
individu al line items. Other than syringes and needles, subjects will return used, partly   746  used, 
and unused products, and these will be documented on the accountability logs and  747 may be 
retained for  reconciliation.  
748 
749 All products will  be  stored  at  the  designated  temperature  (e.g.  refrigerated  or  room 750 
temperature) with temperature monitoring by the institutional system, TempTrak. This is 751 a 
continuous monitoring system  with  temperature time points  taken  every 15  minutes. 752 
Temperature  graphs  are  accessible  via  a  web -based  system.  TempTrak  sensors  are  753  
calibrated on a yearly basis. A second overlay is the use of Min/Max thermometers with  754  
manual recording of temperature daily on Mon - Fri. All Min/Max thermom eters have a  755 
calibration certificate and are replaced prior to the expiration  date.  
756 
757 Destruction of trial products are by incineration at an EPA approved site as contracted by 758 
the University of Washington Medical Center, currently by Clean Harbors Environmental 759   
Services.  If  preferred,  trial  products  can  be  shipped  back  to  the   Novo  Nordisk.   760 
Destruction of returns  can be performed  on an on -going basis. At study closure, all trial  761 
products  are  accounted  for an d  any unused  remaining inventory can  be destroyed  or  762 
shipped back to Novo  Nordisk.  
763 
764 At the time of study drug prescription and dispensing, research staff will provide patients 765  
with instructions to store the study drug at room temperature (below 86oF), keeping the   766  study 
drug away from direct heat and light.  Research staff will verify the conditions for  767  storage 
with patients on day 7±2 of study intervention period.   How ever, research staff   768  will not 
specifically require patients to measure or record the storage temperature of the  769 study drug 
because  of  the  short  duration  of  the  study intervention  period,  making  it 770 extremely 
unlikely for the  study  drug to  be  compromised  as  long as  patients  properly 771    follow the 
storage instructions.   There will be no trial medication(s) dispensed to any    772 person not 
enrolled in the study.  IDS  will store unused study drug separately from used  773   study drugs in 
the refrigerator  at 36°F to 46°F (2°C  to 8°C) until the drug’s  expiration  774    date.   Patients 
will be instructed to return used/unused study drug, and  University of    775 Washington’s IDS 
will destroy the returned study drug per its standard protocol outlined  776  above.  
777 
 
778 8.4 Auxiliary Supply  
779  There  is  no additional  item  or equipment  needed other than the ones  listed under the   780  
section of Study medication(s) / devices(s).  Patients may continue to use the following   781 
medications and devices during the study  period:  
782 •  A  rapid -acting  insulin  analogue  that  patients  normally  take  following  the   783
  instructions of their clinicians, administered using either insulin pens or vials and 
784  syringes  
785 • Glucagon emergency kit, inject 1  mg/mL subcutaneously or  intramuscularl y as 786
  needed for treatment of severe  hypoglycemia  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
22 | P a g e   
 787 • Home glucose  meters  
788 • Home continuous glucose monitors 
789 
 
790 8.5 Randomization and Blinding  
791  We will perform a randomized, placebo -controlled intervention study to  minimi se bias.  792 
Study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms within 2 stratified 793  
groups groups (see Section 3.3).  After a participant has been randomized, a study drug   794   
request will be  sent to  IDS  to dispense the  s tudy drug.   In  keeping with the blinded   795  
procedure, the patient and research staff will not be aware of treatment assignment. The  796  study 
drug request sent to  IDS will reflect only the dose of bridging insulin they should  797 receive. 
IDS  wi th then dispense a prefilled syringe of either insulin  glargine or matched 798  placebo to 
reflect this dose, directly to the research participant on  the day it needs to be  799   administered. 
Participants will then administer the study drug at home acc ording to the   800  instructions  
provided  to  them  by  their  clinician  investigators  and/or  research  staff  801  according  to  
their  randomized  assignment  and  the  dosing  described  under  Section  802 3.11.2.1.  
803 
 
804 8.6 Breaking of Blin ded Codes  
805    Breaking of the blinded code will not be applicable, as medical emergencies that may    806  
possibly  associated with treatment with insulin will be no different between the control   807 and 
the study groups.  However, breaking the blinded code may be done if demanded by  808   the 
patient.   Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code must r ecord the   809 time, date 
and reason, as well as his/her initials in the source documents.  All codes must  810   be kept 
throughout the study period.   Accountability of  all broken or unbroken codes    811 (hard copy 
or electronic) will be performed at or after trial  closure.  
812 
813 
814 9.  CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND  MEDICATIONS:  
815 9.1 Definitions:  
816 Concomitant illness: any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the first visit). 817 
Concomitant medication:  any medication  other   than  the  trial  product(s)  that  is  taken 818 
during the trial, including the screening and run -in periods.  
819 Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication must be recorded at trial entry (i.e. at  820 
the first visit). Any changes in concomi tant medication must be recorded at each visit. If  821 the 
change influences the subject’s eligibility to continue in the trial, Novo Nordisk must 822 be  
informed.  
823 The information collected for each concomitant medication includes, at a minimum, start  824 
date, stop date or continuing, and  indication.  
825 For  each  concomitant  illness,  date  of  onset,  date  of  resolution  or  continuing,  at  a  826 
minimum, should be  recorded.

872 10.  ADVERSE  EVENTS:  
10.1 Definitions  
The FDA approved version of the Prescribing Information or update thereof will be used  
for assessment of expectedness.  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  (AE):  
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or 
not related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related 
activity aft er the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow -
up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded as AEs, if 
recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  
• Pre-planned proced ure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 
consent  
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening  procedures  
 
Clinical Laboratory Advers e Event:  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically 
significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a 
severity, which requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, disc ontinuation of trial 
product, more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening*  experience  
• In-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require 
hospitalisation may be c onsidered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition  
• Suspicion of transmission of infectious  agents  
*The t erm life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was 
more severe.  
 
Serious Adverse Drug Rea ction (SADR):  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship 
to the trial product is at least possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be 
dismissed. Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event w hich fulfils both the criteria 
for a Serious Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
24 | P a g e   
 873 An SAE which is unexpected and  regarded   as  possibly  or  probably  related  to  the  
874 trial/study product by the  investigator.  
875 
876  Medical  Events  of  Special  Interest  (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g.  877  
wrong  drug  administration   or  wrong  route  of   administ ration)  or  (2)  a  suspected   878 
transmission of an infectious agent via the  product  
879 
880 Non-Serious Adverse  Event:  
881 A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 
882 
 
883 10.2 Severity Assessment  Definitions:  
884 • Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily  activities  
885 • Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities 
886 • Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities,  unacceptable  
887 
 
888 10.3 Relationship to study medication Assessment  Definitions:  
889 • Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal  relationship 
890 • Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be  dismissed  
891 • Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial  product 
892 
 
893 10.4 Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
894 • Recovered:  Fully recovered  or  by  medical  or  surgical  treatment  the  condition  has 895   
returned to the  level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the 896 
informed  consent  
897 • Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the 898 
event. This term should only be used when the subject has  completed the  trial 
899  • Recovered with sequelae:  As  a result  of the AE, the subject  suffered persistent  and   900   
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered 901 with 
sequelae should be rated as an  SAE 
902 • Not recovered 
903 • Fatal  
904 • Unknown  
905 
 
906 10.5 Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
907 All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from  908 
the first study -related activity after th e subject has signed the informed consent and until  909 the 
end of the posttreatment follow -up period as stated in the  protocol.  
910 
911 We intend to comply with all local legal, regulatory, and IRB  requirements. 
912 
913 All AEs will be reported on the Adverse Events form that will be completed by the study 
914 staff,  who are masked  as to study  treatment  assignment,  at each regular  follow -up visits.  
GLIDE Study  
V6.0_07.12.2019  
25 | P a g e   
 915  This   will  ensure  that  AEs  are  ascertained  in  an  unbiased  manner  using  the  same  916  
standardized  methodology  for  patients  in  both  treatment  arms.  Forms  will  include  917  
standardized questions relating to specific events of import in d iabetic patients on either  918 of 
the  study treatment  arms,  as  well  as  any significantly abnormal  physical  findings  919  
identified on examination and any significantly abnormal laboratory results obtained on  920 the 
patient between visits or at  the time of the visit.  AEs reported or ascertained between 921  clinic 
visits will be captured and  reported  at the  time of the  next scheduled visit.  Pre -  922 existing 
conditions (that  is,  any condition  that  was  known  to  be  present  prior to   the 923  signing of 
informed consent or was identified during the screening procedures) will not   924  be considered 
or recorded as AEs unless the condition worsens in intensity or frequency  925  after the initiation 
of study intervention.  Likewise, c ontinuing AEs will not be reported   926 as AEs at subsequent 
visits unless they increase in severity or frequency between  visits,  927   they result in criteria for 
a SAE, and/or they resolve between visits.   The investigators   928  will report all adv erse events 
including SAEs, SUSARs, serious adverse drug reactions   929  (SADRs) to the competent 
authority and independent ethics committee/IRB based upon  930  federal regulations and 
local/IRB policies.  The investigators will also  report all SAEs,   931     SUSARs, and SADRs to 
Novo Nordisk at the same time such events are reported to     932  regulatory authorities or within 
15 days from the investigators becoming aware of such   933 adverse events, whichever comes  
first. 
934 
935 The investigators wi ll collect the following information at minimum for each of these  
936 events:  
 
937 1. Study name  
938 2. Patient identification (e.g. initials, sex, age)  
939 3. Event (preferably a diagnosis)  
940 4. Drug  
941 5. Reporter identification (e.g. Name, or initials)  
942 Also 6) Causality, and 7) Outcome  
943  
 
944 10.6 Follow -up of Adverse  Events  
945 During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical trial, the investigators and  
946 institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study -related 
947 adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to  the  study. 
948 This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance status. 
949 
950 All adverse events classifi ed as serious or severe or possibly/probably related to the trial  951     
product must be followed until the subject has recovered and  all queries have been      952  
resolved.  For  cases  of  chronic  conditions  follow -up  until  the  outcome  categor y  is  953 
“recovered” is not required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” 954 or 
“not recovered”.  
955 
956 All other adverse events must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” 
957 (for chronic  conditions),  or “recovered”  or until the end of the post-treatment  follow -up

been resolved.  
 
10.7 Pregnancy  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the investigators immediately if they become 
pregnant.  
 
The investigators will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the trial 
period. Reporting of pregnancy by investigators will occur within the same timelines 
described above for reporting of Adverse Events.  
 
Pregnancy complications should be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse 
event.  
 
10.8 Precautions/Over -dosage  
All patients enrolled in the study will have access to and be instructed to wear a CGM from 
day 0 until the completi on of study intervention. Patients may continue to wear the CGM 
as part of the standard of care for their diabetes beyond the study period. Use of a CGM 
has been shown to be effective in preventing hypoglycemia, which is a possible 
complication related to overdose of insulin, as well as morbidities and mortality related to 
hypoglycaemia (11). Clinician investigators and/or research staff will also provide patients 
with instructions on prompt recognition and proper treatment of hypoglycemia and 
prescribe pat ients with glucagon kit to be used for treatment of hypoglycemia as needed. 
Patients will have access to medical providers at the DCC by phone or e -care 
communication if additional guidance is needed in the event of overdose by the study drug 
during the st udy. 
 
 
11.  LIABILITY AND SUBJECT  INSURANCE:  
During and following a subject’s participation in the clinical trial, the investigators and 
their institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study - 
related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the 
study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 
status.  
 
The investigators will be responsible for the conduct of the study and agree to defend, 
indemnify, and hold harmless Novo Nordisk, any of its parent companies, affiliates, or 
subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, 
distributors, salespersons, customers, licensees, and end -users from and against any cla im, 
suit, demand, loss, damage, expense or liability imposed by any third party arising from or 
related to: (a) any breach of Novo Nordisk -investigators’ obligations or representations; or 
(b) Novo Nordisk -investigators’ negligent or grossly negligent use or willful misuse of the 
study drug, the results, or services derived  therefrom. This

jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter determines that such losses or liability arose as a 
result of Novo Nordisk’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or material breach of 
its responsibilities.  
 
 
12.  EVALUABILITY OF  SUBJECTS:  
For all analyses, patients not meeting the compliance criteria of the study listed under 
Section 3.13 will not be included in the analyses. Clinician investigators will determine 
patients’ compliance with study drug based on patient’s recorded log and patients’ time 
spent wearing CGM after CGM data has been downloaded at the follow -up visit. We will 
includ e data from all randomized participants in our data analysis. The subjects or 
observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion will be documented and 
signed by the clinician investigators or staff prior to database release. The documentatio n 
will be stored together with the remaining trial documentation.  
 
PK and/or PD Modelling  
PK and PD modelling is not planned for this study.  
 
 
13. PREMATURE TERMINATION OF  STUDY:  
All patients participating in the study will have already been taking insulin gla rgine prior 
to their enrolment in the study. Therefore, we do not anticipate patients developing any 
unforeseen adverse effect associated with the administration of insulin glargine. Similarly, 
we do not anticipate patients developing any unforeseen advers e effect associated with the 
administration of the placebo (normal  saline).  
 
IDeg will be discontinued if a patient:  
• Experiences an SAE related to IDeg (with the exception of hypo - or 
hyperglycemia) or an intolerable AE, such as a persistent allergy or  rash.  
• Becomes pregnant or  breastfeeding  
• Withdraws consent for participation in the  study  
 
Date and reason for drug discontinuation will be recorded on the relevant Case Report 
Form. Refer to Section 3.7 for Withdrawal Criteria.  All study discontinuations decided by 
the clinician investigators will be reviewed by University of Washington’s IRB. Patients 
discontinued from the study will be placed back on their original home insulin regimen and 
asked to follow up with their outpatient endocrinologists within 2-12 weeks, or at an 
interval deemed appropriate by their outpatient endocrinologists. Major attempts will be 
made to schedule an end -of-study follow -up phone call for all patients who are lost to 
follow -up during the course of the  study.  
 
Patients who dis continue study drug or withdraw consent from the study prior to 
completion of data collection will not be replaced.

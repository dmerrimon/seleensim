 1. Background and Rationale  
 
The prescribing of inappropriate medications for older adults is extremely common in the 
United States, ranging from 12% in community settings to 40% of those who are institutionalized.1-3  
Benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, and sedative hypnotics are among the most commonly 
prescribed in circumstances that are inconsistent with practice guidelines.3,4 While inappropriate 
prescribing increases the risk of adverse health consequences for all patients, older adults are 
particularly vulnerable.2,5-7 Physicians’ lack of awareness of alternatives, ambiguous practice 
guidelines, and perceived pressure of patients or caregivers are among the reasons why these 
drugs are used more than might be optimal.2 
  Reducing inappropriate use of these drugs may be achieved through decision support tools 
for physicians that are embedded in electronic health record (EHR) systems. While EHR strategies 
are widely used to support the informational needs of providers, these tools have demonstrated 
only modest effectiveness at improving pr escribing.8-13 The moderate effectiveness of current 
clinical decision support tools is thought to be largely due to what  content they contain  and the lack 
of provider -focused design principles being used to develop them .14,15 Prior approaches have also 
been criticized for the sheer volume of alerts, the lack of clinical significance of the tools, and the 
poor/delayed timing of the clinical decision support (i.e., after the prescribing decision). 
Accordingly , the effectiveness of these tools could be enhanced by leveraging recently -gained 
insights from behavioral economics and other related sciences. Their application to EHRs has 
been limited, and they have not been used to reduce the prescribing of potentially harmful 
medications to older adults.  
 
2. Study Aims  
The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate whether EHR -based tools , 
optimized using behavioral science principles , reduce inappropriate prescribing among older 
adults. Our overall hypothesis is that thoughtful incorporation of behavioral principles into 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
6 
 EHRs will reduce inappropriate prescribing and adverse drug events among older adults 
compared to usual care.  
The objectives and endpoints for th e adaptive  and replication  trials are summarized 
below.  
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS  
Primary  
To determine whether EHR -
tools designed using behavioral 
science principles are more 
effective than at  reduc ing 
inappropriate prescribing of 
high-risk medications in older 
adults  than standard EHR tools 
or usual care .  Composite of 1) discontinuation 
of high -risk medications 
(benzodiazepines, sedative 
hypnotics, or anticholinergicsor 
2) ordering a gradual dose 
taper for one of these 
medications  These outcomes are rapidly measurable 
using EHR data alone and will provide 
evidence of provider behavior change.  
Secondary  
To examine whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools 
reduce cumulative prescribing 
of high -risk medications in 
older adults compared with 
usual care .  Quantity of high -risk medication 
prescribed , defined by number 
of pills and milligram 
equivalents of high -risk 
medications prescribed to 
patients in follow -up  These outcomes capture the extent to 
which high -risk medications are 
cumulatively prescribed to patients by all 
providers over the follow -up period.  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
To evaluate whether behavioral 
science -based EHR tools reduce 
the risk of clinically -significant 
adverse drug events, falls, 
fractures, hospitalizations, or 
emergency room visits  
compared with usual care.  Rates of adverse drug events, 
falls, fractures, hospitalizations, 
and emergency room visits in 
follow -up; quantity of high -risk 
medications dispensed to 
patients in follow -up period  These outcomes measure clinical  
outcomes that are consequences of these 
high-risk medications, measured in medical 
and pharmacy administrative claims data.  
 
 
3. Study Design  
 
3.1 Study site 
 
The replication trial will be conducted in outpatient primary care practices at Mass 
General Brigham (MGB), specifically Mass General Hospital . MGB has  a fully functional EHR, 
EpicCare ( www.epicsys.com ), that supports computerized ordering of medications . MGB is 
comprised of 150 outpatient practices with over 1,800 physicians . 
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
7 
 3.2 Overall design  
 
We will conduct a p arallel group trial at Mass General Brigham , specifically within MGH 
primary care practices . We hypothesize that these tools will reduce prescribing of high -risk 
medications (primary outcome), cumulative prescribing  of high -risk medications (secondary 
outcome), and clinically -significant adverse drug events like sedation and confusion ( tertiary 
outcome) compared with usual care.  
3.2.1 Trial Design  
 This trial is a cluster -randomized, NIH -defined Phase III pragmatic trial. The study 
statistician, in partnership with data analysts at MGB , will generate and implement the 
randomization scheme, with oversight by the Principal Investigators. All the study sites will be at 
MGH for this trial ; we have received approval from leadership at MGH primary care practices and 
Digital Health eCare teams to conduct this trial . For study evaluation, data regarding patients' 
medical history, disease control, medication use , and healthcare utilization will be obtained from 
EHR data or administrative claims data. Any administrative claims data used for evaluation in this 
study will come directly from MGB  in HIPAA -limited datasets  through their risk -bearing contracts.  
  We will randomize primary care providers at MGH to one of the 2 most promising treatment 
arms identified in the prior adaptive randomized trial conducted at Atrius Health or usual care  
(described in further detail in 5.2) . We expect to randomize approximately 2 00 providers.  Providers 
randomized to one of the  2 selected treatment arms will receive an EHR tool to guide their care of 
eligible patients. We will randomize providers based on provider demographic characteristics, 
patient case -mix factors, and baseline rates of high-risk medication prescribing  measured in EHR 
data.  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol

 Providers will be eligible if they prescribed a benzodiazepine, sedative hypnotic, or two distinct 
anticholinergics to at least one older adult in the 180 days prior to randomization. Providers will 
receive these EHR tools for their patients who meet the f ollowing criteria: 1) older adults (aged 
65 years or more), and 2) who have been prescribed at least 90 pills of benzodiazepine or 
sedative hypnotic or have been prescribed at least one active orders of at least 90 pills of two 
different anticholinergics i n the last 180 days. Follow -up will last 12 months. These patients will 
also be included in the analyses. The type and timing of EHR tool that the providers receive for 
these patients will vary based on their assigned intervention arm.

3.4 Scientific rationale for study design  
The use of a randomized trial in this setting is scientifically justified, as this design will be 
able to provide evidence of causality in the effectiveness of the tools on reducing prescribing and 
rates of clinical outcomes. An observational study design, by contrast, would not provide the same 
degree of scientific rigor.  
 
3.5 Justification for intervention  
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are also informed by the Beers Criteria and 

NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
9 
 other major clinical guidelines.16-18 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
classes: (1) benzodiazepines; (2 ) sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) anticholinergics. 
These classes were chosen because they all have established clinical guidelines recommending 
reductions in use, continue to be heavily over -prescribed, contribute significantly to poor clinical  
outcomes in older adults, and also have non -drug or less risky therapeutic alternatives. While 
prescribing non -drug options may be the optimal alternative to these potentially inappropriate 
medications, their adverse effects could also be attenuated by choosing alternative medications  in 
a different drug class , lower doses of medication, or alternative, safer medications within the same 
drug class.  
  We have chosen to focus on key principles of behavioral economics and cognitive 
psychology to “nudge” providers to optimize prescribing, such as  timing, salience, framing, 
simplification, pre-commitment, and boostering. These principles were selected based on their 
effectiveness in other settings19-22, their applicability to the care of older adults , and their ability to 
be adapted to the EHR context.  
 
3.6 End-of-study definition  
The MGB trial will be completed 12 months after randomization. Providers and their eligible 
patients will be followed until the end of this follow -up date , or until censoring . 
 
3.7 Data sources  
We will use EHR data to implement the EHR tools, identify study subjects, track study 
progress, and evaluate the effect of the interventions. We will also use administrative claims 
data to evaluate tertiary outcomes  among the subgroup of patients with claims data . 
Data warehouses reside in an Oracle environment and consist of the Clarity and Payer 
databases. The Clarity database is a relational database that contains clinical and  financial 
information from the Epic Suite of products; including the electronic medical record system, the 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
10 
 appointment scheduling syste m, the patient accounting system, and the master patient index 
(Identity). The various tables within the Clarity database are refreshed on a daily, weekly or 
monthly basis . At MGB, we will extract clinical information from the electronic medical record 
system via the Epic Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) or the Mass General Brigham 
Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). Accessing the EDW in particular is necessary in order 
to adequately identify and link all eligible patients seen  by the enrolled providers in our study 
and measure outcomes, which is not possible using other sources.  
For the claims data, the Medicare claims data are being provided by the funder, the 
National Institute on Aging (NIA), through their partnership with Acumen and the established 
MedRIC  (https://www.medric.info/data -enclave/data -pages/data ). In order to obtain claims data 
from the funder, we will provide them with Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) for linked 
patients in our study.  We are executing all appropriate data use agreements with the NIA and 
Acumen  to receive these data.

 4. Study Population  
 
The study will intervene upon primary care providers ( primary care provider  designated 
physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) and their patients in the outpatient 
practices of Mass General Hospital .  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
  The subjects involved in this trial are providers from multiple clinical sites, all at  Mass 
General Hospital . The target population of providers and the patients they treat is pragmatic and 
widely representative. Providers will be eligible if they treat older adult patients. Each study clinic 
has an EHR system in place. The inclusion criteria are limited to maxi mize generalizability in 
accordance with pragmatic trial principles by PRECIS -2 (PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum 
Indicator Summary ). 
 
Providers will be eligible if they:  
• Are a primary care provider at  Mass General Hospital , with a minim um clinical schedule  
of 2 sessions  per week  
• Prescribed a benzodiazepine, sedative hypnotic, or anticholinergic to at least one older 
adult in the 180 days prior to randomization  
 
Patients will be included in the analysis if they:  
• Are assigned to one of the randomized primary care providers  (by MGB  indicators)  
• Are aged 65 years or more  
• Have been prescribed at least 90 pills of benzodiazepine or sedative hypnotic or at least 
one active orders of at least 90 pills of two different anticholinergics in the prior 180 
days

4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Patients not meeting the inclusion criteria above will not be included in the study . No 
other exclusion criteria will be used . 
 
4.3 Recruitment and retention  
 
4.3.1 Informed consent considerations  
We have received a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA authorization for all physician -
subjects and patient -subjects in this study.  The goal of this project is to improve existing decision 
support  to reduce the use of potentially dangerous medications in the elderly, consistent with 
numerous professional guidelines and quality metrics.  P roviders will retain oversight of the ir 
patient s’ care  and will be able to make therapeutic choices based using their professional 
judgement . Patients will not receiv e any direct intervention as a result of their inclusion in the study .  
 
4.3.2 Inclusi vity of study subjects   
Physician and patient subjects will be included based on their meeting eligibility criteria as 
part of routine care, and the study population will be highly inclusive. We expect these participants 
to cover a broad range of participants by gender and race/ethnicity.  Given the minimal risk nature 
of the study, p articipants will not receive incentives, remuneration , or be required to provide 
informed consen t. 
5. Study Interventions  
5.1 Therapeutic areas  
The focus areas for the EHR tools will be primarily drawn from the outpatient Choosing 
Wisely recommendations in geriatric medicine but are also informed by the Beers Criteria and 
other major clinical guidelines.4,23 In specific, we plan to focus on the following therapeutic 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
13 
 classes: (1) benzodiazepines; (2)  sedative hypnotics (sleep medicines) and (3) 
anticholinergics.  
 
 
5.2 Study interventions  
 
Physicians in the replication trial randomized to one of the 2 active intervention arms will 
receive one of several possible enhanced EHR decision support to guide care. The type and 
timing of an alert will vary based on the intervention are outlined below. The t wo specific EHR 
tools for the replication trial at MGB was determined based on the adaptive randomized trial 
results:  
Arm Alert type  Open 
encounter  Follow -up 
booster  Pre-commitment  
1 Enhanced  X X  
2 Enhanced  X  X 
Usual care  None     
 
Arms 1 through 2 are enhanced  EHR tools to encourage the deprescribing of the 
medications under study.  Physicians randomized to usual care will receive no intervention.  
The central component of Arms 1 through  2 will be an enhanced EHR alert (known as a 
Best Practice Advisory [BPA]). The enhanced BPA will appear on each provider’s EHR screen 
and will contain several standard components .  The BPA will:  
1. give providers  information about why the medication is dangerous for their patient 
using the behavioral science principle of salience to make this information as 
impactful as possible ;  
2. include a set of tips to help providers discuss medication discontinuation with their 
patients ; 
3. ask provider s to select an acknowledgment reason if they decided not to discontinue 
the medication ; 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
14 
 4. include a SmartSet order set that will allow providers to order a gradual dose taper 
for their patient, which limits risks of withdrawal symptoms for the patients for 
benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics , order alternative medications, place a 
referral to a behavioral health  specialist , provide instructions on how to make 
lifestyle modifications to improve patient symptoms, and add customizable patient 
instructions for how to gradually taper off benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics, 
as applicable.  
We will also test several other modifications to this enhanced BPA. In specific, as 
outlined in the table above, we will add in a boostering option in the enhanced BPA in Arm 1, 
which is a provider -directed option for a follow -up in -basket message sent 4 weeks after the 
BPA is triggered. Arm 2 will test the use of a two -staged pre -commitment BPA in which the 
providers are prompted to discuss risks of these high -risk medications  and share  a handout  
about the risks with their patients, at their own discretion .  
 If patients are eligible for alerts to be fired for multiple  therapeutic classes of interest 
(e.g., benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics) , the EHR tools will appear for both classes  
separately.  
 
5.3 Measures to minimize bias: randomization and blinding  
 
Providers  will be randomized to treatment arms in equal proportions  based on blocks . We 
will use pr ovider -based cluster randomization to minimize the possibility of contamination in 
study interventions between practices and clinic staff. For the randomization, we will use 
stratified randomization based on clinic practice size and baseline rates of prescribing to 
reduce potential imbalances between the providers assigned to the treatment arms.   
The providers will not be blinded to which arm they were assigned to, as blinding is the 
context of an intervention that is intended to motivate action will be infeasible.  The study 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
15 
 analyst  will generate and implement the randomization scheme, with oversight by the Principal 
Investigators.  Investigators will be blinded to the treatment arms during interim and final analyses . 
 
 
6. Study Assessments  and Procedures  
 
6.1 Baseline data  
 
We will collect baseline data on patients and providers using extracted EHR data and/or 
administrative claims data as applicable for the study aim. This baseline data will be used to 
assess any potential imbalances in the characteristics of providers or patients despite 
randomization. The baseline data will include, but are not limited to:  gender, baseline rates of 
prescribing, practice location, and patient case -mix. We will also collect patient  data that 
include but are not limited to: sociodemographic data , medical history and comorbidities, 
baseline resource utilization in prior 12 months (i.e., number of visits) , biometric values (e.g., 
serum creatinine, systolic/diastolic blood pressures) .  
 
 
6.2  Outcomes  
 
The primary outcome will be a binary composite measure of a reduction in inappropriate 
prescribing , evaluated using EHR data.  In specific, we will measure a composite of 1) 
discontinuation of high -risk medications (benzodiazepines, sedative hypnotics, or 
anticholinergics)  defined by either: a) active discontinuation and no subsequent order or b) no 
order during follow -up or 2) ordering a gradual dose taper (for benzodiazepine or sedative 
hypnotics) . Our primary analyses will be within patients who had a visit (telemedicine or in -
person) with a study provider after randomization. If either of these actions is taken by  
provider s for a specific patient at any point in the follow -up window , we will classify the  patient 
as having had a reduction in inappropriate prescribing. If the patient has multiple therapeutic 
classes of interest (e.g., benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics), we will classify patients with 
a reduction for any class as a “reduction”  for the composite measure . We will also stratify 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
16 
 patients by their number of eligible therapeutic classes (i.e., one, two, or three classes) and 
analyze outcomes within these strata.  
Secondary outcomes include the quantity of high -risk medication prescribed, defined by 
number of pills of high -risk medications (all three classes) prescribed to patients in the follow -
up period  and number of lorazepam milligram equivalents of benzodiazepines and sedative 
hypnotics  to capture cumulative prescribing by all providers . As above , we will also stratify 
patients by their number of eligible therapeutic classes (i.e., one, two, or three classes) and 
analyze outcomes within these strata.  
Tertiary outcomes will include the extent to which medications are filled and consumed 
by patients , as measured within the subgroup of patients with claims data.  In specific, these 
outcomes will be conducted among the large subgroup of patients funded by Medicare , 
including pharmacy claims  via the  secure  MedRIC data enclave . In particular, we will measure 
the quantity of high -risk medication dispensed, defined by number of milligram equivalents of 
high-risk medications filled by patients, in follow -up, using pharmacy claims data. Other tertiary 
outcomes will include the occurrence of clinically -significant adverse drug events, including but 
not limited to, sedation or cognitive impairment , and all -cause hospitalizations and falls or 
fractures, measured in administrative claims data . These clinical outcomes will be evaluated 
using validated  and CMS -driven  ICD-10-CM diagnosis and procedure -based algorithms applied 
to these patients’ medical and pharmacy administrative claims data. Because the sensitivity of 
clinical outcomes in EHR systems is known to be low (e.g., because patients may seek 
subsequent care at other healthcare systems), using routinely -collected data from insurers 
overcomes this limitation.24 We will also evaluate implementation of the intervention using 
structured deidentified data from the EHR about use of the EHR system , which will help inform 
how to scale the interventions  (see Data to be collected form) .  
 
6.3 Adverse events  and unanticipated problems  
 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
17 
 For provider -subjects, the EHR decision support designed for this trial is only meant to 
highlight information that could be useful in patient management and prescribing. Therefore , 
we do not anticipate any safety issues to arise with regards to provider -subjects who receive 
the electronic decision support, and the IRBs who have reviewed our prior proposals have 
agreed with this general approach.  
For patient -subjects, we do not anticipate the occurrence of any adverse events as a 
result of providers receiving decision sup port aimed at reduc ing the use of potentially unsafe 
medications that already have established clinical guidelines advising against their use. The 
decision support provides resources to help patients safely discontinue the high -risk 
medications under study (e.g., providing tapering guidelines and facilitating the substitution of 
lower -risk therapies) . There is a theoretical risk of precipitating withdrawal , but the risk is less 
than the continued risks o f ongoing use of the drugs being addressed by the interventions . 
We will ensure the safety of patient -subjects by leaving ultimate clinical decision -making 
in the hands of the evaluating provider who is in charge of caring for the patient. The study 
team will not be providing any direct care to patients, and all treatment decisions will ultimately 
be made by the patients’ own medical teams . As a result, any adverse events will be handled 
in the course of regular clinical care . Further, to maximize the generalizability of the results and 
to avoid co -intervention, patients will not be required to have study -specific monitoring as part 
of the proposed pragmatic trials. Therefore, we do not plan to use any patient -directed 
prospecti ve monitoring of Adverse Events ( AEs) or Significant Adverse Events ( SAEs ) in this 
trial. An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as a ny untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical e xam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ 
involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.   
- Adverse Events  will be classified using the following rating scales:  
o Severity: Mild, Moderate or Severe  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol

 ▪ Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms but are easily tolerated  
▪ Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern but may 
interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by simple therapeutic 
measures  
▪ Severe: Events interrupt the participants’ normal daily activities and 
generally require systemic drug therapy  
o Expectedness: Unexpected or Expected  
▪ Unexpected: nature or severity of the event is not consistent with the 
condition under study  
▪ Expected: event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) are defined as any  adverse event that  results in death , is 
life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the  event as it 
occurred , requires or prolongs hospitalizatio n, causes persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity , results in congenital anomalies or birth defects , and i s another condition which 
investigators judge to represent significant hazards . 
However, our plan for data and safety monitoring does include multiple mechanisms to 
ensure minimal risk of participation in the trials.  We will leverage an automatic adverse event 
reporting and review system to observe and monitor for any SAEs that do occur. In specific, 
providers report adverse events through a n online  reporting system. Any reports of deaths will 
be submitted to the NIA Program Officer and to the Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) 
Chair or designated DSMB member within 24 hours. Any unan ticipated SAEs deemed by the 
specialists and to be related to the intervention will be reported to the NIA PO and to the DSMB 
Chair or to the designated DSMB member within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of the SAE. 
All other reported SAEs and AEs received by the study team will be reported to the NIA

 7. Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
 
Our null hypothesis will be that rates of provider prescribing  (defined by evidence of a 
reduction in prescribing  of high -risk medication ) in the intervention arms will be no different 
than in the other arms, including the usual care arm.  
 
 
7.2  Sample size determination  
 
 We should have  >80% power to detect absolute differences of 10% or smaller in the 
reduction in prescribing  between each  intervention arms and usual care, assuming an intra -
provider  correlation of 0. 1 (which is based on prior work including the Atrius trial)  and a 
baseline rate of the primary outcome of 25% in the usual care arm . We plan to use Holm -
Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing  between each of the intervention arms and 
usual care , but we will be powered even if using a Bonferroni correction. Our assumptions will 
also be robust to a slightly higher baseline rate of the primary outcome in the usual care arm. 
We should also be sufficiently powered to detect meaningful differences in the clinically 
significant adverse events.  
 
 
7.3  Statistical analyses  
 
7.3.1 Analysis of the primary endpoint s 
 
The unit of analysis is at the patient -level. All analyses will use intention -to-treat 
principles. We will use generalized estimating equations to adjust for clustering and repeated 
observations  per provider  to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention arms versus usual 
care. For the inappropriate prescribing outcome, we will use a log link function and binary 
distributed errors. These models generate the estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust 
standard errors and are considered to be particularly a ppropriate when outcomes are common 
(e.g., incidences of ≥10%).  Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
21 
 planned as unadjusted; however, in secondary analyses, we will adjust for patient age, 
race/ethnicity, and gender . 
Given the nature of the data and how the outcomes are categorized, there will not be 
missing values for the primary endpoint, as the absence of action is classified as no action by 
the provider. For the primary analysis, we will include all eligible patien ts in the denominator 
who had at least one visit with their primary care provider. In secondary analyses, we will 
include all eligible patients of those primary care providers in the denominator, regardless of 
whether the patient visited the provider over the follow -up period.  
 
 
7.3.2  Analysis of secondary endpoints  
 
For the secondary outcome of cumulative medication prescribing , will use an identity 
link function and normally distributed errors within the generalized linear model s. For tertiary 
adverse clinical outcomes  and resource utilization outcomes , we will use a log link function and 
binary distributed errors. These models generate the estimated relative risks (RRs) with robust 
standard errors and are considered to be particularly appropriate when outcomes are common 
(e.g., incidences of ≥10%). For  these outcomes from claims data, we will follow patients whose 
providers are randomized to the study from the time of randomization until they are censored 
due to lose of continuous enrollment in their health plan . Due to the nature of the 
randomization, we do not anticipate any systematic differences in the amount of follow -up time 
per arm but will account for any imbalances using inverse probability censoring weights.  
Because this is a randomized trial, our primary analyses are planned as unadjusted; 
however, if there are strong patient -level predictors of the outcomes not balanced by stratified 
randomization, we will adjust for these. Given the nature of the data and h ow the outcomes are 
being measured, there should not be missing values. However, should there be sufficient 
missing data (e.g., >10%), we will use multiple imputation.25

MGB Trial Protocol

 7.3.3 Baseline descriptive analyses  
 
We will report the means and frequencies of pre -randomization variables separately for 
intervention and control subjects.  Comparisons of these values will be performed using t -tests 
and chi square tests and their non -parametric analogs, as appropriate. The outcomes will be 
evaluated using intention -to-treat principles among all randomized patients.  
 
 
7.3.4 Subgroup analyses  
 
In subgroup analyses, we will explore whether there were any modifiers of the effects of 
the EHR tools. For example, we will explore if certain types of providers (e.g., by specialty) 
were more likely to respond to the EHR tools or if there were observable differences in patients 
who w ere less likely to receive inappropriate medications, such as gender or race/ethnicity.  
 
7.3.5 Exploratory analyses  
 
In secondary analyses, we will control for potential confounders which will be measured 
using EHR data from structured fields and administrative claims data. These variables will 
include provid er characteristics (such as s pecialty, age, and gender), patient characteristics 
(such as major comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and age), and practice characteristics (such as 
practice size).  
 
8. Ethical and regulatory requirements  
8.1 Ethical conduct  
General oversight of the project by the principal investigators (Drs. Choudhry and 
Lauffenburger) will occur throughout the study period, including regular contact with practice 
managers and clinical leadership at each health center to obtain ongoing feedb ack. In addition, 
this protocol will undergo Institutional Review Board (IRB) evaluation by a centralized IRB for 
this multi -site clinical trial. Study data will be accessible at all times for the principal 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
23 
 investigators (Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger) and co -investigators to review, if applicable. 
The principal investigators will review study conduct (e.g., protocol deviations) on a monthly 
basis. The principal investigators will also ensure that all proto col deviations for the trials are 
reported to the NIH and the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 We believe that the risks to participation for both sets of subjects (i.e. providers and 
patients) are no more than minimal for several reasons.  
 First, the intervention aims to emphasize guideline -recommended information for 
providers to assist in their decision -making when caring for older patients. Second, all 
treatment decisions will ultimately be made by licensed health care providers. Finally,  the 
intervention is specifically provider -focused and delivered in an electronic health record system 
using information already available to providers. We believe there is no more than minimal risk 
involved to the provider subjects, as the providers will  simply be “nudged” to alter their 
behaviors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed to being forced to do so. All 
medical decisions are ultimately made by the provider . This trial will not interfere with the 
ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, 
including allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are no 
more than are encountered during routine clinical care and are less than patients would 
otherwise encounter if there were to receive the high -risk medications whose use the 
intervention seeks to reduce. In addition, these risks will be minimized in our protocol as we 
are relying on the provider to prescribe as they see best for their p atient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR tools are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In addition, 
as described above, in  the unexpected situation in which the EHR tools lead to worse 
prescribing decisions, we will discontinue those arms at the end of Stage  1. 
The primary risk to patients will be privacy of health information. We will minimize the 
risk to privacy by taking appropriate steps to limit access to data to study investigators. Clinical 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
24 
 data on the care for patients will be retrieved from the electronic medical records and insurer 
administrative claims. The data extracts obtained from the electronic medical record are 
continuously used by clinical operations staff for quality assessment a nd improvement, and 
undergo routine, rigorous peer -review by experienced data analysts to ensure accuracy and 
completeness. Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger will work with the research project staff to 
ensure the accuracy of these data throughout the study period. For the purpose of conducting 
analyses of the study outcomes, this will involve creating scrambled patient and provider 
identifiers and sharing only limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the 
purposes of analysis. All tea m members have received appropriate training in data privacy.  
 
8.2 Informed consent  
We will enroll provider -subjects based on their being employed by Mass General 
Brigham  as an outpatient primary care provider . As with other minimal -risk, quality 
improvement studies we have performed that involve electronic alerts to providers, formal 
informed consent will not be sought. First, the nature of this quality improvement intervention 
involves testing EHR decision supp ort directly for providers (using information already available 
to them and a similar infrastructure they use in the course of re gular clinical care). Second, the 
ability to understand the true effect of the intervention as it is delivered in the real world would 
be difficult to ascertain if true informed consent was sought. Third, o btaining true informed 
consent would predictably reduce the number of patients participating in the study, especially 
those from unrepresented populations, and therefore undermine the generalizability of the 
study results, a foundational aspect of pragmati c clinical trial principles. Fourth, t his approach  
has been  approved by clinical leadership at the health organization. In our prior work at these 
institutions, we have received a waiver of informed consent from the IRBs of these 
organizations for similar interventions. We also request a HIPAA waiver of patient au thorization 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
25 
 to access the administrative claims and EHR data necessary for outcome evaluation , as doing 
so would be impractical and infeasible to conduct the study.  
While providers and patients will not be consented into the study, an organization -wide 
email will be circulated across MGH  to inform providers of the launch of an intervention 
leveraging clinical decision support tools to support improved prescribing for older adults.  
 
8.3  Confidentiality and privacy  
To protect against the risk of inappropriate disclosure of personal health information, the 
study team will use limited PHI data for the purpose of analyzing the study. These analyses will 
be overseen and conducted by MGB  investigators. These datasets will consist of pharmacy 
and medical claims, laboratory information, and structured information from the EHR. The only 
PHI that will be shared with the study investigators are dates (e.g., date of birth, 
admission/discharge da tes, and dates of medication fills ), zip code , and Medicare Beneficiary 
Identifier (MBI), which is necessary in order to ac cess the Medicare administrative claims data 
for the outcome evaluation . Sharing this information will be necessary to assess the impact of 
the interventions.  
The electronic data will be safeguarded by state -of-the-art security protocols. The 
facilities have 24 -hour security and are protected by locked entrances. Both health systems 
have computer networks in place that employ up to date virus protection software  and enable 
password -protected access only to study investigators. All data transfer s between the 
organizations will be accomplished using secure file transfer protocols.  To ensure the 
confidentiality and security of all data, the research team operates a secure, state -of-the-art 
computing facility housed at MGB’s  data center. The MGB  data center is a secure facility that 
houses both computing environments as well as clinical systems and electronic medical 
records for several large hospitals in Eastern Massachusetts. Entry into the computer room 
requires staffed computer room security. The Division’s computers are connected to the MGB  
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
26 
 networking backbone with 10 gigabit -per-second fiber links. Network security is overseen by 
electronic medical records systems to the research team’s data. All data are transmitted to 
programmers’ workstations in an encrypted state. Backups are created using the current 
Department of Defense standard for data security  and are stored in a locked facility. The 
redundancy, extensive data power, and security of our computer facility confirm our capacity to 
collect and manage data and ensure confidentiality for all project participants.  
As described, all members of the research team have completed or will complete 
appropriate human subjects research training and patient privacy training related to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The setup for analysis of these HIPAA -
limited data will be exactly the same as all of the other IRB applications that our MGB  research 
division submits for secondary use of data. In fact, we have an umbrella -approval place in 
place with the  MGB  IRB for using these types of HIPAA -limited data. All of the datasets, 
including limited PHI, will be stored only on secure servers at MGB  Healthcare’s data center 
and will only be accessed by a limited number of individuals in the study team from this division 
who are all trained in data security and patient privacy.  
 
8.4 Safety oversight  
We plan to use a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) and a Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for all aspects of this research. We will also establish an 
independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) with experience in quality of care, 
patient safety, and biostatistics. The DSMB will act in an advisory capacity to monitor 
participant safety and evaluate the progress of the st udy, review procedures and management 
of the study. Drs. Choudhry and Lauffenburger are the PIs at  MGB . The DSMB will consist of  
individuals  with experience in quality of care, patient safety, and biostatistics. This committee 
will convene  biannually and review data related to the study protocols and ensure protection of 
patient confidentiality and safety, as well as to monitor the quality of the data collected via the 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
27 
 study protocols  on a semi -annual basis . We will also be in routine contact with clinical 
leadership to obtain any feedback from clinicians regarding the studies. Compliance of 
regulatory documents and study data accuracy and completeness will be maintained through 
an internal study team quality assurance process.  At each meeting, the DSMB  will make 
recommendations as to whether the studies  should continue or if changes to the protocol are 
necessary for continuation.  This trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
8.5 Benefit risk assessment  
8.5.1 Known potential risks  
There is a small risk associated with altering medication prescribing behaviors, including 
allergic reactions or other adverse medication effects; however , these risks are no more than are 
encountered during routine clinical care. In addition, these risks will be minimized in our protocol as 
we are relying on the provider to prescribe as they see best for their patient; the prescribing 
changes in the EHR too ls are simply suggestions, not rigid rules for the providers.  In the 
intervention arms, providers will be encouraged to follow national guidelines in the care of their 
patients and discontinue dangerous medications. It is recommended that some of these 
medications (benzodiazepines, sedative hypnotics) be discontinued through a gradual dose taper 
so as to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and suggested tapers will be provided as a solution within the 
EHR prompts.  Another potential small risk to patients will be pri vacy of health information. We will 
minimize the risk to privacy by taking appropriate steps to limit access to data to study 
investigators. Clinical data on the care for patients will be retrieved from the electronic medical 
records and insurer administra tive claim s. 
 
8.5.2 Known potential benefits  
This study is designed to improve electronic health record prescribing tools for providers 
caring for older adults. Potential benefits for participants in this study include improved decision 
NUDGE -EHR  V.2 – April 1 4, 2025  
MGB Trial Protocol  
28 
 support tools and guideline -concordant prescribing. The human subjects may benefit from 
discontinuing a dangerous drug that is not recommended for them. Additionally, the subjects 
and society may benefit in the future from accumulated knowledge that originates from this 
research. We will also produce severa l EHR tool deliverables for this work for the public, 
researchers, and policymakers, which will be shared as generalized knowledge.   
 
8.5.3 Assessment of potential risks and benefits  
The intervention aims to emphasize guideline -recommended information for providers to 
assist in their decision -making when caring for older patients. All treatment decisions will ultimately 
be made by licensed health care providers. The intervention is spe cifically provider -focused and 
delivered in an electronic health record system using information already available to providers. 
We believe there is no more than minimal risk involved to the provider subjects, as the providers 
will simply be “nudged” to al ter their behaviors towards guideline recommended care, as opposed 
to being forced to do so. All medical decisions are ultimately made by the provider. This trial will not 
interfere with the ordinary workings of the outpatient centers.   
The potential societal benefits outweigh the minimal risk, especially in light of multiple 
measures in place to protect confidentiality.  The data extracts obtained from the electronic medical 
record and these claims are continuously used by clinical operations staff for quality assessment 
and improvement, and undergo routine, rigorous peer -review by experienced data analysts to 
ensure accur acy and completeness.  For the purpose of conducting analyses of the study 
outcomes, this will involve creating scramble d patient and provider identifiers and sharing only 
limited Protected Health Information (PHI) with investigators for the purposes of analysis.  Because 
our intervention encourages providers to discontinue dangerous medications in a way that 
prioritized patient safety and enables the provider to retain full decision -making power of the care 
of the patient, there is no more than minimal risk involve d for our patient and physician -subjects.

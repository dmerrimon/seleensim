Study Title  A phase 1/ 1b dose- finding clinical trial evaluating the safety of ABI -009 
as antiproliferative therapy for patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH)  
Protocol Number  PAH-001 
Phase  1 
Indication  Intravenous (IV) ABI -009 as antiproliferative therapy for patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The patient population is adults 
with PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] Function Class II and III), 
a subset of patients known to have a poor prognosis and worse 
survi val.  
Study Objectives  Objectives 
This phase 1/ 1b study will involve dose escalation to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of 16 weeks of therapy (Dose -finding Safety Part
) followed optionally by up to 32 additional 
weeks of therapy (Extension Part) with ABI -009 IV in patients with PAH  
who are WHO Functional Class II or III despite best available 
background therapy. The MTD will be determined on the basis of the 
results from the safety evaluation.   
After the MTD is reached in phase 1, there will be up to 2 cohort 
expansions in phase 1b at the MTD and/or one alternate dose or 
schedule to determine the recommended phase 2 dose. The expanded 
cohorts will be such that up to 10 patients for each of the cohorts will 
be enrolled to obtain additional safety and efficacy data , inclusive of 
patients from phase 1 . The recommended phase 2 dose, which may 
differ from the MTD, will be determined on the basis of results from 
safety, efficacy, pharmacologic and correlative studies in th is phase 
1/1b study .

The End of Study (EOS) defined as either the date of the last visit of 
the last patient to complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last 
data point from the last patient that is required for primary, secondary, 
and/or exploratory analysis, as pre- specified in the protocol.  
End of Treatment is defined as the date of the last dose of ABI -009. 
End of Treatment Visit is when efficacy and safety assessments and 
procedures are performed after the last treatment . 
•For a patient who does not complete the 16- week treatment,
EOT Visit  must occur within  4 weeks (±7 days) after the last
dose of ABI -009.
•For patients who complete the 16- week treatment, the final
efficacy and safety assessments and procedures (EOT Visit) are
performed at week 17.
Follow- up period is the on- study time period for at least 28 days after 
the last treatment either in the Dose -finding Safety  Part or optional 
Extension Part, whichever is later. All patients that discontinue study 
drug and have not withdrawn full consent to participate in the study will continue in the follow -up phase for survival and therapy. Follow up will 
continue up to 1 year, approximately every 12 weeks ( ±3 weeks), until 
withdrawal of consent, or the study closes, whichever is the earliest. 
This evaluation may be made by record review and/or telephone contact.  
Study Treatments  This phase 1/ 1b study will have a 16- week Dose -finding Safety  Part to 
identify recommended phase 2 dose and evaluate the safety and 
efficacy profile of weekly ABI -009 (via dose- finding and dose- expansion 
cohorts), followed by an optional 32- week Extension Part to obtain 
additional safety and efficacy data on longer term treatment with ABI -
009.   
16 weeks of  Dose- finding Safety  Part 
In the dose- finding phase 1 portion of the study, 4 dose levels of ABI -
009 will be tested in cohorts of 3 patients each (1, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg/m2, 
see Table 1 ), using the 3+3 dose escalation design. There will be no 
intra-patient dose escalation allowed.  Escalation to the next dose level 
with a new cohort of 3 patients will occur after no DLT was observed in 
the first treatment cycle of 4 weeks. If a DLT occurs in a cohort, 
additional 3 patients will be recruited to the cohort. If no further DLTs 
occur, then a new cohort of 3 patients at the next higher dose level can be enrolled. If 2/6 patients at dose level 1a experience a DLT,  then that 
cohort will be closed to further enrollment and the study may be

Confidential and Proprietary  11 Amendment: October 24, 2019 terminated. If 2/6 patients at dose level s 2a, 3a, or 4a  experience a 
DLT,  then the previous dose level is considered the MTD.   
It is estimated that a maximum of up to 24 patients will be required to 
achieve the MTD; however, MTD could be reached with as few as 9 
patients. Patients will be allowed to dose reduce by one dose level for 
reasons of toxicity, with a maximum of 2 dose reductions allowed for a 
patient . At the lowest dose level, a dose reduction of 25% will be 
allowed.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, debilitating and fatal disease for which 
there is currently no cure. The disease specifically affects the endothelium and smooth 
muscle of the pulmonary arteries, with cellular constriction and hyperproliferation leading to vascular remodeling, stiffening, and narrowing. The progressive increase in pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) over time increases right ventricular afterload and leads to right ventricular dilation and failure. Progressive reduction in cardiac output from right 
ventricular failure leads to decreased exercise capacity and death [1]. The current FDA 
approved therapies for PAH target vascular factors that regulate vasodilation and vasoconstriction and include the prostacyclin analogues, endothelin- 1 receptor 
antagonists, phoshodiesterase 5 (PDE -5) inhibitors and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) 
stimulators. These agents alone and in combination improve exercise capacity and delay the time to clinical worsening but do not significantly prolong survival  [2, 3] or specifically 
address the underlying hyperproliferation of the endothelial and smooth muscle cells in 
the pulmonary arteries.  
Recent human clinical trials using the antiproliferative agent imatinib (Novartis), suggests 
that new approaches targeting vascular endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation is an efficacious approach for patients with PAH  [4]. While imatinib was effective in treating 
PAH, i.e., it significantly decreased PVR and increased 6- minute walking distance 
(6MWD) [4], the clinical development of imatinib was halted by the sponsor (Novarti s) for 
high risk of severe toxicity, specifically, subdural hematoma. Therefore, there is a great 
need for new safer ‘antiproliferative’ agents to be evaluated in the treatment of PAH.  
Recent in vitro  studies  [5, 6], animal models  [6, 7], new translational data using human 
PAH patient samples  [6] and a cl inical case report  [8] suggest strongly that rapamycin 
(sirolimus) , an allosteric mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, can prevent 
and reverse PAH. mTOR signaling is hyperactivated in PAH, and inhibiting this pathway 
is a promising novel treatment approach. mTOR inhibition resulted in strong 
antiproliferative activity, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells, which was demonstrat ed by Goncharov (2014)  [6], Houssaini  (2013)  [9], and Kyrmskaya et al (2011)  
[5]. In addition, the suppression of mTOR has been described to affect the canonical 
hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet -
derived growth factor (PDGF) and p27 cell cycle pathways, which are known to be central 
to PAH pathogenesis  [5, 10, 11]. 
nab-Sirolimus  (ABI-009, Aadi, Pacific Palisades, CA) is a novel albumin -bound 
nanoparticle form of sirolimus  that has shown excellent antiproliferative activity in tumor 
xenograft models as well as a porcine restenosis model with strong evidence of vascular 
smooth muscle cell suppression and high accumulation in the lung. A recent phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors showed evidence of clinical activity, low toxicity, 
and favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile [12]. The safety profile of ABI -009, despite 
higher doses, compared very favorably to oral sirolimus  and rapalogs in this patient 
population (historical comparison). In this application, we propose the clinical testing of  
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  20 Amendment 4: October 24, 2019 
 ABI-009, the long acting nanoparticle human albumin- bound formulation of sirolimus , as 
a novel targeted systemic therapy for PAH.  
The significance of this study  lies in addressing a debilitating disease with a new 
antiproliferative approach specifically targeting the disease biology .  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is classified into subgroups including idiopathic PAH 
(IPAH), familial,  and PAH associated with other conditions (APAH). Idiopathic PAH 
accounts for at least 40% of PAH cases, 4% are familial type, and the remaining cases are APAH (>50%).  
The number of patients with PAH in the US is estimated to be 30,000; however, PAH is 
widely recognized as a disease that is underdiagnosed [13]. Pulmonary arterial 
hypertension has an incidence of 2.4 cases per million people per year, and an estimated 
prevalence of between 15 to 50 cases per million people [14]. The prevalence of PAH in 
certain at -risk groups is substantially higher: in patients with systemic s clerosis it is 7% to 
12% [15, 16]. PAH is considered a complex, multidisciplinary medical condition that, if left 
untreated, can be life threatening with 3- year survival after diagnosis at only about 50%. 
The mean age at diagnosis is 36 years, but PAH can affect people from 20 to 90 years old. Women are affected approximately twice as often as men.  
 
Treatment for PAH and the Rationale for using ABI -009 
The FDA has approved several drugs to date for the treatment of PAH, all of which are 
vasodilators and offer only symptomatic relief. The administration routes include oral, 
inhaled, subcutaneous (SC), and intravenous (IV). They belong to 4 classes based on the 
mechanism of action: Prostacyclin derivatives (epoprostenol, iloprost and treprostinil) are potent vasodilators; endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs, eg. bosentan, macitentan 
and ambrisentan) block the binding of endothelin- 1 to the receptor and inhibit the 
endothelin effects of vasoconstriction and smooth muscle growth; phosphodiesterase 5 
(PDE- 5) inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil) block the breakdown of cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate and enhance nitric oxide- mediated vasodilation; and soluble guanylate 
cyclase (sGC)  stimulators (riociguat).  
These current approved PAH therapeutics mainly function as vasodilators and do not 
address the endothelial and smooth muscle cell hyperproliferation aspect of the disease. 
Thus, an entire aspect of the biology of this disease has not been effectively explored. Importantly, current treatments provide largely symptomatic relief with temporary 
improvements in right heart function and exercise capacity; invariably PAH patients’ 
disease progresses, even on combination therapy. The use of ABI -009 as a safe, 
efficacious and targeted anti -proliferative therapy represents a unique opportunity to help 
patients with debilitating PAH, already on maximal approved therapy, with the possibility of modifying the course of the disease. An effective treatment could have a lar ge clinical 
impact on the lives of these patients.  
Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting PDGF, Bcr/Abl and c -Kit, is the only 
antiproliferative drug that has been tested in PAH  in late -stage clinical trials . In a phase 3 
study, imatinib demonstrated efficacy, meeting the efficacy endpoints of improved 6MWD

 and reduction in PVR, but an increase in unexpected rates of intracranial bleeding and 
high dropout rates due to AEs  have led the sponsor (Novartis) to stop development of this 
drug [4]. These studies provide proof of principle that a vascular remodeling anti -
proliferative agent can be efficacious in PAH patients, however, safety remains the key issue for such approaches.  
This study will present a unique opportunity to develop a targeted molecular 
antiproliferative therapy for PAH. Recent evidence strongly suggests that the mTOR  
pathway is important in PAH development  [5, 6], and sirolimus  is efficacious in models of 
PAH [7, 8]. Systemic (IV) ABI -009, exhibits preferential lung uptake [17] with a favorable 
PK profile for PAH (unlike oral mTOR agents) and a favorable safety profile in a human 
phase 1 oncology trial  [12]. 
 
1.2. ABI-009 Background  
1.2.1.  Rapamycin (Sirolimus)  and Rapalogs  
Sirolimus  is a crystalline powder with the empirical formula C51H79NO13 and a molecular 
weight of 914.17. Sirolimus  is a protein kinase inhibitor that is used for 
immunosuppression in transplant patients and is under investigation as a cancer 
treatment. Sirolimus  inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a regulatory 
protein kinase in cancer that recognizes high stress levels, including depleted nutrient levels and states of hypoxia [ 18]. mTOR is a serine/threonine- specific protein kinase, 
downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/Akt  (protein kinase B) pathway, 
and a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation, stress, and metabolism. Additionally, mTOR is involved in regulating angiogenesis by controlling endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation via the hypoxia- inducible fa ctor-1α and vascular endothelial 
growth factor [ 19]. Consistent with its role in cell proliferation, the mTOR pathway is 
frequently overactivated in a number of human malignancies  and is thus considered to 
be an attractive target for anti -cancer therapy. Sirolimus  and its analogs (rapalogs) 
funct ion as allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 and are currently used in the treatment of 
advanced renal cell  carcinoma and other tumors [ 20]. 
1.2.2.  ABI-009 ( nab- Sirolimus ) 
The nanoparticle albumin- bound sirolimus  (nab-sirolimus , ABI -009) is freely dispersible 
in saline and is suitable for intravenous administration and have produced favorable 
safety profile and produced evidence of efficacy in patients with metastatic solid tumors  
[12]. 
The nanoparticle albumin- bound or nab
® technology (Abraxis BioScience, a wholly -
owned subsidiary of  Celgene Corporation) when applied to hydrophobic molecules, such 
as paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane®), has led to improved drug delivery, safety, and 
efficacy in various solid tumors compared with the conventional paclitaxel formulation [21]. This suggests that a nab formulation of sirolimus  may also produce similar 
advantages over the standard sirolimus .

 1.2.3.  ABI-009, Albumin Mechanism of Transport and Selectivity for PAH 
Pathology 
The nab technology utilizes albumin receptor -mediated (gp60) caveolar endothelial 
transcytosis to transport dugs to the subendothelium  [22]. Indeed, we have seen in our 
laboratory that nab- drug transcytosis across the epithelial monolayer was dependent on 
albumin and caveolae formation [22]. Albumin is highly soluble, has long plasma half -life 
and broad binding affinity, and highly accumulated in disease sites such as tumors and 
during inflammation [23, 24], making it an ideal candidate for drug delivery. Consequently, 
the hyperproliferative and leaky vasculature in tumors resulted in increased albumin-
based drug uptake for nab- drugs  [25]. Increased gp60 expression and robust albumin 
uptake has been observed in rat lung tissues and wild- type mice endothelial cells of aorta 
relative to other tissues  [26-28]. Mechanical stress as well as mediators such as cytokines 
and thrombin, a key player in the pathobiology of PAH, can mediate morphological 
changes in endothelial cells and widening of the intercellular junctions  [29, 30]. PAH is 
associated with increased transendothelial permeability of macromolecules and lung 
edema, which contains high level albumin protein [24, 31]. It has been further observed 
that cells under stress, such as those in tumors and sites of inflammation, display 
significant higher albumin uptake than normal cells and degrade albumin for their nutrient 
and energy needs  [23, 32, 33]. Accumulating evidence shows that PAVSM and 
endothelial cells in PAH share several analogous features with cancer cell stress 
response, such as increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis  [6, 34-37], 
association with metabolic glycolytic shift, deregulated mitochondrial function, and constitutive up- regulation of HIF1alpha [6, 36, 38]. Taken together, these results provide 
strong background that the hyperproliferative vascular lesions in PAH should result in 
enhanced uptake of albumin- bound sirolimus  over oral sirolimus  and that anti -proliferative 
strategies used in cancer are relevant t o treat PAH.   
1.2.3.1.  Preclinical Studies with ABI-009 
In preclinical studies, ABI -009 has shown an excellent safety and efficacy profile; it 
showed preferential accumulation in lungs; it reduced cell viability and decreased 
downstream signaling and showed excellent efficacy in various xenograft cancer models, 
including pancreatic, colorectal, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer  [39-42]. 
Importantly, ABI-009 has also shown efficacy in models of proliferative vasculopathy of 
the peripheral artery, supporting its use for indications related to the therapeutic remodeling of vascular disease [43].  
ABI-009 Preferential Uptake in Lungs compared to Oral Sirolimus  in Rats  
We compared whole blood PK and tissue distribution at 24 hrs after ABI -009 IV 
administration (dose 1 mg/kg) in rats (N=5) to oral  sirolimus [44] (dose 1.6 mg/kg) in rats 
(N=5), to determine relative uptake into the lung (target organ for PAH) and liver (major 
excretion route for sirolimus ). Blood and tissue levels were measured by LC/MS/MS or 
HPLC ( Figure 1) . Blood levels at 24 hrs were comparable. The calculated tissue extraction 
ratios (conc of rapa in tissue/conc of rapa in blood) in the lung were 72 and 24 respectively 
for ABI -009 and oral sirolimus  indicating a 3- fold higher lung targeting for ABI -009. In 
contrast, the extraction ratios for the liver were 27 and 43 respectively for ABI -009 and 
ABI-009

 = 0.01. The 500 μg dose of  ABI-009 also significantly reduced medial fibrosis by 
qualitative analysis, P  < 0.0001 t -test, and media cell proliferation by Ki -67 staining, P  = 
0.02 t -test (Figure 2). 
The observation suggests that a single ABI -009 dose has an antiproliferative effect on 
vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and suggests that ABI -009 may also be 
active in the treatment of PAH that shares similar hyper -prolifer ation characteristics.

stenosis (B) and medial fibrosis (C) 28 days after double- injury [43]. 
 
1.2.3.2.  Translational Studies in Human Idiopathic PAH (IPAH) Tissues 
Goncharov a et al. at University  of Pittsburgh recently confirmed the importance of mTOR 
in human IPAH tissues. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed that 
mTOR signaling is markedly upregulated in small remodeled pulmonary arteries from human subjects with IPAH ( Figure 3) [6]. Primary distal pulmonary artery vascular smooth 
muscle cells (PAVSMCs) from human subjects with IPAH have increased phosphorylation and activation of mTOR and its downstream effector S6 (S6) that is 
associated with increased proliferation and survival compared with normal controls  
(Figure 4 ) [6].

Sirolimus  given preventively (Days 1– 21) or curatively (Days 21– 42, Figure 7 A) inhibited 
monocrotaline- induced PAH to a greater extent than did imatinib or fluoxetine as indicated 
by changes in pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and percentage 
of partially muscularized and fully muscularized vessels. Representative photographs of 
immunofluorescence staining for α-SMA in control rats and MCT 6- week rats treated with 
sirolimus , fluoxetine, imatinib, or vehicle from Day 21 to Day 42 showed a reversal of PAH 
as indicated by reduced arterial wall thickness of the pulmonary arteries ( Figure 7B ). The 
authors concluded that sirolimus  was more effective in prevention and reversal of PAH in 
a rat monocrotaline model than imatinib or fluoxetine [ 9].

 In a study of sirolimus  in a chronic hypoxia mouse model of PAH, sirolimus  prevented 
hypoxia- induced increase of proliferative activity within the pulmonary vasculature, 
blocked hypoxia- triggered media thickening of intrapulmonary vessels, attenuated 
hypoxia- induced right ventricular hypertrophy, reduced hypoxia- triggered hypertrophy of 
individual cardiomyocytes, and reversed hypoxia- induced  pulmonary vascular 
remodeling  [7]. 
1.2.3.4.  Pilot Clinical Study in PAH Patients Treated with Everolimus 
Seyfarth et al (2013) reported a pilot study with e verolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in 10 
patients suffering from PAH (n = 8) or chronic thromboembolic PH (n = 2) with progressive 
disease despite therapy with at least 2 vasodilating drugs  [45].  All patients were treated 
with everolimus at a dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily for 2 days in addition to their prior 
medication. The dose was adjusted thereafter to achieve a target serum level of 5- 8 
ng/mL. The average daily dose was 2.1 mg (range 0.75- 4.5 mg/day ). Safety and 
tolerability were observed throughout the study. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and 6- minute walk distance (6MWD) were considered coprimary end points. In 2 patients, 
study medication was stopped prematurely because of an AE. One patient had acute bronchitis, and the other had right heart decompensation. The remaining 8 patients exhibited a significant 31% decrease in PVR (median [interquartile range], 1,012 [688–
1,344] vs. 663 [546– 860] dyn s cm –5; P = 0.018) and an increase in 6MWD (median 
[interquartile range], 236 [139– 350] vs. 298 [207– 450] m; P = 0.069) after 6 months of 
treatment with everolimus. This pilot study suggests that mTOR inhibition may be a suitable approach for the treatment of P AH. 
1.2.3.5.  Human Case Report in a PAH Patient Treated with Oral  Sirolimus 
Wessler et al (2010) reported the case of a 61- year-old woman who presented with a 
large pancreatic mass and metastasis to the liver and biopsies consistent with an islet 
cell tumor  [8]. In 2007, this patient was diagnosed with PAH with no response to nitric 
oxide treatment. Despite inhaled iloprost, she remained in New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class 3. In 2009, she was treated with oral sirolimus  (1 mg bid) in the setting of 
progressive disease to the liver. After 8 weeks her liver metastasis responded to 
treatment and the patient reported markedly decreased effort dyspnea. She was now able 
to exercise by climbing flights of stairs (NYHA class 2). The patient continued treatment 
with sirolimus  for 10 months and by early 2010, she was NYHA class 1, her pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure by echocardiogram was normal and her EKG findings of right -
side heart strain had resolved. The authors concluded that the temporal association between sirolimus  administration and the improvement in clinical, echocardiographic, and 
catheterization- documented pulmonary hypertension provides compelling evidence that 
sirolimus  was effective in treating this patient’s PAH. It should be noted that there was no 
discussion of any AEs  related to oral sirolimus  and that as a cancer patient, the type of 
acceptable toxicities would be different than in a PAH patient.  The toxicities of oral 
sirolimus  (1 mg bid ie, 2 mg daily) are described in the Rapamune prescribing information 
[46].

 1.2.3.6.  Clinical Studies with ABI-009 
In a phase 1 dose escalation, tolerability and pharmacokinetics study conducted at MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (Protocol CA -401), ABI-009 was well tolerated with evidence of 
responses and SD in various solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer, both of which typically express mTOR [ 12]. Twenty -six patients were treated with 
45, 56.25, 100, 125, 150 mg/m
2 ABI-009 per week for 3 weeks, followed by a week of rest 
(28-day cycle). ABI -009 administered intravenously. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  
was established at 100 mg/m2. 
Nineteen patients were evaluable for efficacy. One patient in the 45 mg/m2 (95 mg actual 
sirolimus  dose) cohort diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the kidney and with bone and 
intrathoracic metastases had a confirmed PR. The target lesion of this patient was reduced by 35.1% and the duration of response lasted 183 days. Two (11%) patients (at 
doses 45 and 125 mg/m
2, with actual sirolimus  doses of 88 mg and 193 mg, respectively) 
had an overall tumor evaluation of SD (confirmed): 1 patient with mesothelioma had SD 
for 365 days and 1 patient with a neuroendocrine tumor in the left axillary node had SD 
for 238 days.  
In the phase 1 study described above, for all cohorts and all grades, 25 of 26 (96%) 
patients experienced at least 1 AE. The most common AEs were mucosal inflammation 
(10 patients, 38%), fatigue (7 patients, 27%), rash (6 patients, 23%), diarrhea (6 patients, 
23%), and nausea (5 patients, 19%). Most of these AEs were grade 1/2 events, with only 3 grade 3 nonhematologic AEs (2 elevated AST and 1 dyspnea). Specifically, at the 
maximum -tolerated dose (MTD, 100 mg/m
2), all 7 patients experienced at least 1 AE of 
any grades, and the most common AEs were mucositis and fatigue (5 patients, 71% 
each). Four (15%) patients experienced at least 1 treatment -related SAE, including 
arrhythmia (grade 2) and mood alteration (grade 3) both in the 125 mg/m2 cohort, vomiting 
(grade 3) in the 45 mg/m2 cohort, and dyspnea (grade 3) in the 100 mg/m2 cohort.  
The most common hematologic AEs, for all cohorts and grades, were thrombocytopenia 
(58%), followed by hypokalemia (23%), anemia and hypophosphatemia (19% each), and 
neutropenia and hypertriglyceridemia (15% each). Most of these events were grade 1/2, and only 1 grade 4 hematologic event occurred (thrombocytopenia in the 150 mg/m
2 arm). 
At the MTD, the only hematologic AE was a grade 3 anemia.  
For the present  study in PAH patients, the starting dose will be 1 mg/m2, which is 10 0-
fold lower than the MTD obtained in the oncology phase 1 study.  The original starting 
dose for this study was 10 mg/m2. Four patients were treated at this dose. Two patients 
developed dose- limiting grade 2 rash , associated with persistent intolerable pruritus . 
One of the 2 patients with rash developed cellulitis of the abdominal wall,  most likely as 
a result of infection introduced through the skin by scratching.  Another  patient 
developed grade 1 paresthesi a, which was also dose- limiting. As a result of these DLTs, 
the starting dose was amended to 1 mg/m2.

 an approved sirolimus  prodrug temsirolimus (day 5 sirolimus  Cmax 133.9 ng/mL after 5 
days of IV daily administration of temsirolimus at 19.1 mg/m2 [51]), the Cmax with ABI-009 
was substantially higher. For continuous daily oral dosing of sirolimus  at an average dose 
of 3.6 mg/day  [47], the reported C max was 25.3 ng/mL. Compared to oral sirolimus , the 
predicted C max of ABI-009 at 1, 2.5, 5 , and 7.5 mg/m2, the proposed doses to be testing 
in the planned PAH study, respectively were up to 6 , folds higher – with the potential 
advantage to obtaining higher lung concentrations with ABI -009 along with potentially 
lower toxicities compared to oral sirolimus . 
1.2.3.8.  Rationale for Starting Dose of ABI -009  
The starting dose of 1 mg/m2 for this study is selected based on the following 
considerations:  
• Clinical safety of ABI -009 has been previously evaluated in a phase 1 oncology 
study, with the MTD established at 100 mg/m2 of sirolimus  (as nab-sirolimus  or 
ABI-009) given weekly.   
• The original starting dose for this study was 10 mg/m2. Four patients were treated 
at this dose. Two patients developed dose- limiting grade 2 rash, associated with 
persistent intolerable pruri tus. One of the 2 patients with rash developed cellulitis 
of the abdominal wall, most likely as a result of infection introduced through the 
skin by scratching. Another patient developed grade 1 paresthesia, which was also 
dose- limiting.  
• The revised starting dose for this  study is 1 mg/m2 weekly, which  is 10 folds lower 
than the initial starting dose.  
• Rapammune (oral sirolimus ) dosing used chronically for transplant patients 
(Rapamune PI) is >8x higher than the proposed starting dose of ABI -009 [46]. 
Rapamune is dosed at 2- 5 mg/day, which is 14- 35 mg/week. Starting dose of ABI -
009 is 1 mg/m2/wk, which is about 1.7 mg/week assuming a BSA of 1.7 m2. 
• Safety of everolimus in the PAH patients (Seyfarth 2013) was studied in 10 patients 
that received an average of 2.1 mg/day or 14.7 mg/wk for 24 weeks in addition to standard PAH therapy [ 45]. Everolimus was well tolerated in that study.  
• Safety profiles of everolimus and Rapamune are similar. Everolimus dosing levels are similar to Rapamune dosing (Rapamune PI), with both being in the same range as the planned starting dose of ABI -009. 
• Drug -drug interaction potential of ABI -009 with standard PAH drugs is low (see 
Section  9.3). 
• Animal studies and clinical studies of ABI -009 have not shown any AEs that have 
not been previously described for mTOR inhibitors .

 3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Study Design 
This study is a dose -finding prospective phase 1/ 1b, single arm, open- label, multi -
institutional study to determine the MTD, DLT, safety, and preliminary efficacy of 16  
weeks of IV ABI -009 treatment  in patients with PAH who are WHO Functional Class II or 
III despite best available background therapy . 
The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
In phase 1, up to 24 patients will be enrolled using the standard 3+3 dose escalation 
design in the dose- finding phase. 
In phase 1b, a n additional 4- 7 patients in up to 2 expansion cohorts to obtain a total of  
up to10 patients at each of the 2 dose levels, MTD and/or an alternate dose or schedule. 
The MTD will be determined on the basis of  the results from the safety evaluation. The 
RP2D, which may differ from the MTD, will be determined on the basis of results from safety, efficacy, and pharmacologic and correlative studies.  
Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator and Safety Commi ttee, tolerate ABI -009 
well and achieve clinical benefit during the first 16-week Dose- finding Safety  Part, and 
for whom there are no alternative therapies available,  may opt to continue therapy 
(optional Extension Part) for up to an additional 32 weeks at their assigned dose or 
lower, if permanently reduced. The optional Extension Part  should start within 4 weeks 
after the  last dose of the 16- week Dose -finding Safety Part .

3.2. Study  Duration  
The study was originally  expected to take approximately 30 months from first patient 
enrolled to last patient follow -up, including approximately 18 months of enrollment period, 
up to 16 weeks of treatment ( Dose -finding Safety  Part) (or until treatment is tolerated) , 
followed by an optional Extension Part for up to  32 additional weeks  of ABI -009, and at 
least a 28 days follow -up after the last dose either in the Dose -finding Safety or Extension  
Part, whichever is later . With the addition of the 7.5 mg/m2 dose cohort, it is anticipated 
that enrollment will take another 12 months for enrollment .   
3.3. End of Study , End of Treatment, End of Treatment Visit, Follow -up Period 
End of Study  (EOS) is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last patient to 
complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last patient that 
is required for primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as pre- specified in the 
protocol.   
End of Treatment  (EOT) is defined as the date of the last dose of ABI -009. 
End of Treatment Visit is when safety and efficacy assessments and procedures are 
performed after the last treatment . For patients who complete the 16- week treatment, 
EOT visit occur at week 17 (± 3 days) .  For a patient who does not complete the 16- week 
treatment , EOT Visit  must occur within  4 weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of ABI -009.   
Follow -up period is the on- study time period for at least 28 days after the last treatment 
either in the Dose -finding Safety P art or optional Extension P art, whichever is later . All 
patient s that discontinue study drug and have not withdrawn full consent to participate in  
the study will continue in the follow -up phase for survival and therapy . Follow -up will 
continue up to 1 year approximately every 12 weeks  (±3 weeks), or more frequently as 
needed, until withdrawal of consent, or the study closes, whichever is the earliest. This 
evaluation may be made by record review and/or telephone contact.

6.1. Screening Evaluations 
This study will be conducted at approximately 5 sites in the US. Additional sites may be 
added.  
Each  patient  who enters into the screening period fo r the study  receives  a unique patient  
identification number before any study- related procedures are perf ormed.  The patient  
identification number will be assigned. This number will be used to identify the patient  
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
patient .  
The patient  identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a patient  is rescreened.   
Before patient s may be entered into the study, the Sponsor  requires a copy of the site’s 
written IRB/IEC  approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other patient  
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable.  A signed and dated Institutional 
Revie w Board (IRB) approved informed consent form (latest approved version) must be 
obtained from each patient  prior to performing any study -specific procedures. All patient s 
or legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the consent form 
before commencement of study -specific procedures.  Patients who lack capacity to 
understand protocol requirements will be excluded.  Adverse Events are to be collected 
for a patient  upon signing the informed consent until 28 days after last dose of study drug.  
Screening evaluations will be performed for all patients to determine study eligibility.  
These evaluations must be completed within  28 days  prior to enrollment.  Any questions 
regarding patient eligibility should be directed to A adi or other sponsor -nominated 
representatives or designees for approval.  
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period, after signed 
informed consent has been obtained,  designated in the Schedule of Assessments , 
Table  2. The 6MWD test will be conducted following guidelines by American Thoracic 
Society [52].

6.4. Pharmacokinetic S tudy   
A PK study of sirolimus  will be performed  with limited PK sampling on all patients in the  
dose- finding  portion of the study  during the first 4 weeks  of treatment, assessed via 
central lab:  
• Blood s amples will be obtained on day 1 (week 1) and will be taken immediately 
predose (before infusion),  immediately after termination of infusion (end infusion), 
then at 1 hr, 2 hrs, and 4 hrs post infusion. Thereafter , blood samples will be taken 
every week  immediately predose for the next 3 weeks (weeks 2, 3, and 4)  to 
determine a trough level .  
Additional PK samples for sirolimus  analysis will be obtained for local lab assessment to 
help correlate AEs  with blood levels during treatment:  
• From all treated patient in the 16- week Dose finding Safety Part (including 
expansion cohort/s): Immediately predose starting at week 2 and continuing for the 
duration of the study  
• From all treated patients in the up to 32 weeks of Ex tension Part: Immediately 
predose starting at week E 2 and continuing every other week for the duration of 
the study  
• Optional PK samples for consenting patients: During week s 1 and 3 of the Dose -
finding Safety  Part at 24, 48, and 72 hours post infusion.  
Note that T = 0 is defined as the start of infusion, ie, all sample collection times are relative 
to the start of infusion. The sample at the end of the infusion is collected immediately after  
the infusion is stopped. If the duration of infusion is changed, the sample should be collected immediately before termination of the infusion and the time noted.  
Whole- blood samples will be collected in EDTA tubes f or determination of sirolimus  in a 
central laboratory . 
Sample Handling for Central Lab: 
• Collect approximately 4 mL blood into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA as the  
anticoagulant.  
• Mix the whole blood gently but thoroughly in the tube immediately after collection.  
• Split the sample into two tubes. One tube will be kept as a back -up sample.  
• Ensure that both tubes are labeled identically.  
• Store the blood samples deep frozen at a temperature between - 20 and - 80°C.  
• The samples will be shipped to a designated laboratory.  
Sample Labeling:  
The following information should be on each sample:

Confidential and Proprietary  48 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  7. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  TREATMENTS
7.1. ABI-009 Dosage, A dministration, and Schedule 
The planned treatment period is 16 weeks , with ABI -009 given weekly. Patients , who 
based on the investigator and Safety Committee’s assessment,  tolerate  ABI-009 and 
show clinical benefit during the 16 -week  Dose -finding Safety Part, and for whom there 
are no alternative therapies available,  may opt to continue therapy in the o ptional 
Extension Part, with ABI -009 given weekly  at the originally assigned dose (or lower, if 
permanently reduced) for up to 32  additional  weeks . A physician must be available at the 
time of administration of IP on dosing days that correspond to study visits. Supportive 
care per the institution’s normal standard of care including concomitant medications can 
be provided at the investigator’s discretion.  
In the dose- finding portion of the study, 4 dose levels of ABI -009 will be tested in 
cohorts of 3 patients each ( 1, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg/m2, see  Table 1  and below), using the 
3+3 dose escalation de- escalation design.  There will be no intra- patient dose escalation 
allowed.  Escalation to the next dose level with a new cohort of 3 patients will  occur 
after no DLT was observed in the first treatment cycle of 4 weeks. If a DLT occurs in a 
cohort, additional 3 patients will be recruited to the cohort. If no further DLTs occur, then a new cohort of 3 patients at the next higher dose level can be enr olled. If 2/6 patients 
at dose level 1a experience a DLT, then that cohort will be closed to further enrollment 
and the study may be terminated. If 2/6 patients at dose level s 2a, 3a, or 4a experience 
a DLT, then the previous dose level is considered the M TD.  
It is estimated that a maximum of up to 24 patients will be required to achieve the MTD; 
however, MTD could be reached with as few as 9 patients. Patients will be allowed to 
dose reduce by one dose level for reasons of toxicity, with a maximum of 2 dose 
reductions allowed for a patient . At the lowe st dose level, a dose reduction of 25% will be 
allowed.

7.2. Dose Modi
fication and Stopping Rules 
7.2.1.  Dosage Adjustments, Dela ys, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent  Discontinuation 
If treatment cannot be administered on the planned visit date, ABI -009 may be 
administered ±3 days from the scheduled date. Prior to ABI -009 administration, patients 
must meet the following hematological requirements:  
•ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L
•Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  49 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  • Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL 
The treatment will be on hold up to 14 days until the patient has fulfilled these criteria.  
In the event of clinically significant AE in any part of the study, treatment may be withheld , 
and supportive therapy administered as clinically indicated. If the toxicity or event is not 
grade 3/4 and resolves to baseline or grade 1 in less than or equal to 14 days of stopping therapy, then treatment may be restarted.  
A DLT is defined as a study -drug -related grade ≥3 hematologic AE or persisten t 
intolerable nonhematologic AE  of any grade that requires dose reduction or permanent 
discontinuation of the study -drug, in the opinion of the investigator.  
Dose reduction of ABI -009 to the next lower dose level should be considered as clinically 
indicated for patients who are receiving ABI -009 at above the lowest dose level . At the 
lowest dose level, a dose reduction of 25% will be allowed.  Once a dose has been 
reduced, it must not be increased to the previous level. A maximum of 2 dose reductions 
are allowed  for a patient  in the entire duration of the study . 
The maximum delay between a missed scheduled dose and the next one (whichever 
dose was missed) should not be longer than 14 days. Approval from the Medical Monitor 
is required to restart study treatment after ≥21 days of interruption .

single- use 50- mL vial will contain 100 mg sirolimus  and human albumin as a stabilizer. 
Each vial will be labeled according to country -specific regulatory requirements for labeling 
of IPs.  
Unopened vials of ABI -009 should be stored in a refrigerator (2° -8°C; 36° -46°F) in original 
cartons to protect from light. Reconstituted ABI -009 may be stored for up to 4 hours at 2-
8°C (36° - 46°F), followed by 4 hours at room temperature (<25°C) in the IV bag. Both 
unopened vials of ABI -009 and reconstituted ABI -009 should be stored in an area free of 
environmental extremes and must be accessible only to study personnel.  
Temperature records for ABI -009 must be made available to A adi or Sponsor nominated 
Contract Research Organization monitoring teams for verification of proper study drug 
storage.  
8.2. ABI-009 Accountability , Disposal , and Compliance 
Only completely unused study drug vials should be retained by the site until a representative from A adi or Sponsor -nominated CRO has completed an inventory. 
Partially used and completely used vials should be destroyed according to the site’s guidelines, and their disposition should be recorded on the Investigational Drug Accountability Record Form.  
The Investigator, or designee, shall record the dispensing of study drug to patients and any remaining study drug after dosing in a study drug accountability rec ord. The study 
drug record will be made available to A adi or authorized A adi-designated monitoring 
personnel for the purpose of accounting for the study drug supply. Inspections of the study drug supply for inventory purposes and assurance of proper storage will be conducted as necessary. Any significant discrepancy will be recorded and reported to A adi or their 
designee and a plan for resolution will be documented.  
Accurate recording of all ABI -009 administration will be made in the appropriate section 
of the patient’s eCRF  and source documents. The investigator or designee is responsible 
for accounting for all study -specific IP either administered or in their custody during the 
course of the study.  
8.3. ABI-009 Reconstitution 
NOTE: It is not a requirement to use filter needles in the preparation, or in -line filters 
during the administration of ABI -009. In any event, filters of pore size less than 15 microns 
(15 µm) must not be used.  
ABI-009 will be reconstituted by appropriate study personnel fo llowing the Pharmacy 
Manual , and administered to the patient in the study site. The Investigator will calculate 
the BSA of the patient in order to determine the total amount of ABI -009 to be 
administered.

8.4. Receipt and Return of ABI -009 
Upon receipt of the study drug supplies, the Investigator or designee will conduct an 
inventory and sign both copies of the study drug receipt and forward one copy to the 
address indicated on the form. One copy of the receipt and the packing slip must be retained in the Investigator’s regulatory file records.  
A representative from Aadi or his/her designee will inspect the study drug inventory, Drug 
Accountability Record form(s), and will arrange for the disposition of any remaining unused study drug. No study drug may be returned to A adi without the representative 
from Aadi or other A adi-designated personnel first inspecting the study drug inventory 
and accountability documentation.

Confidential and Proprietary  52 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  9. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES  
All concomitant treatments, including blood and blood products, must be reported on the 
eCRF. Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications 
or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in  Section  9.2. 
Concomitant therapies are to be collected from enrollment/randomization through the 
EOT Visit . Therapy name including indication, dose, frequency, route, start date and stop 
date will be recorded on each patient ’s eCRF(s).  
9.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures  
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from 
the time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be 
recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name, dose, and the dates 
of administration are to be recorded. Additionally, a complete list of all prior cancer therapies will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Patient s should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of 
blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics,  anti-emetics, anti -diarrheas , and 
analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their 
institutional guidelines.  WBC growth factors may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines.  
Extreme precaution must be taken with contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only), as it is not known if there is the potential of inhibition/induction of enzymes that 
affect the metabolism of estrogens and/or progestins.   
9.2. Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
The use of certain medications, and illicit drugs within 5 half -lives or 28 days, whichever 
is shorter prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study  will not be 
allowed. If a prohibited medication is required for single use (such as for a procedure) 
while study drug is held, the A adi medical monitor can approve such use.  
The following medications or non- drug therapies are prohibited:  
• Other anti -cancer therapy while on treatment in this study.  
• Antiretroviral drugs ( patient s with known HIV are ineligible for study participation).  
• Herbal remedies (eg, St. John’s wort) unless approval is granted by the medical monitor.  
• Sirolimus  is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4. Drugs that are strong inhibitors or 
inducers of CYP3A4 may only be used under special circumstances (eg, as a single use for a procedure) while treatment with study drug is interrupted. The list 
may be modified based on emerging data.  
• Use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic window (such as fentanyl, alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, 
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  53 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  terfanide) within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of ABI -009.  Other 
medications may be allowed if there is agreement between the sponsor and 
investigator  
• Use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 within the 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of ABI -009  
9.3. Drug -Drug Interactions of ABI -009 and Standard PAH Medications  
The potential for drug- drug interactions between ABI -009 and standard PAH medications 
is low. Sirolimus  is a substrate for (i.e., it is metabolized by) both cytochrome P -450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and p- glycoprotein (P -gp). It is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 or P -gp. 
Several of the standard PAH medications, eg, bosentan, sildenafil, ambrisentan, treprostinil etc are also metabolized primarily by CYP3A4. Since none of these medications are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4, they are used in together in 
combination for treatment of PAH. Therefore, addition of ABI -009 to standard PAH 
therapy is not expected to alter the PK of these drugs or cause adverse drug interactions. 
Nevertheless, in the planned clinical study the starting dose is 10X below the MTD 
determined in an oncology phase 1 study, giving a very wide safety margin for the 
patients. Additionally, safety will be closely monitored along with the PK of sirolimus  in 
the PAH phase 1 study, and it may be possible to identify if any AE is related to drug 
interactions through analysis of sirolimus  plasma levels.

Confidential and Proprietary  54 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1.  Study  Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint s:  
MTD, DLTs, and toxicities and safety profile of 16 weeks, as well as safety profile of the 
up to 48 weeks of  ABI-009 given IV, in patients with PAH who are WHO Functional Class 
II or III despite best available background therapy . 
In the dose- finding portion of the study, 4 dose levels of ABI -009 will be tested in cohorts 
of 3 patients each ( 1, 2.5, 5 , and 7.5 mg/m2), using the 3+3 dose escalation design.  There 
will be no intra- patient dose escalation allowed.  Escalation to the next dose level with a 
new cohort of 3 patients will occur after no DLT was observed in the first treatment cycle 
of 4 weeks. If a DLT occurs in a cohort, additional 3 patients will be recruited to the cohort. If no further DLTs occur, then a new cohort of 3 patients at the next higher dose level can 
be enrolled. If 2/6 patients at dose level 1a experience a DLT, then that cohort will be 
closed to further enrollment  and the study may be terminated. If 2/6 patients at dose level s 
2a or 3a experience a DLT, then the previous dose level is considered the MTD.  
The treated population will be the analysis population for all safety analyses. Adverse 
events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Medical Activities (MedDRA) and grouped by their system organ class and preferred term. Summary tables will include the 
number and percentage of treatment -emergent and treatment -related AEs, AEs of special 
interest, SAEs, and incidence of patients experiencing dose modifications, dose 
delay/dose not given, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP due to an AE.  
An external Safety  Monitoring Committee ( SMC) will assess safety data periodically  as 
needed.  
Secondary Endpoint(s):  
The following will be measurements will be summarized at baseline and at 17 weeks ( after 
16 weeks of treatment  in the Dose -finding Safety  Part): 
• pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by right heart catheterization  
• pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)  
• pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)  
• central venous pressure (CVP)  
The following will be measurements will be s ummarized  at baseline, 5 , 9, 13, and 17 
weeks:  
• Doppler -echocardiographic assessments of right ventricular structure and function 
• 6- minute walk distance (6MWD)   
• WHO functional class  
• Pulmonary function test  
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001 Aadi Bioscience  
Confidential and Proprietary  55 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  The following will be measurements will be summarized every 8 weeks of the Extension 
Part (ie, at week E 9, E17, E25, and E33):

ory Endpoint(s):  
•Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and trough level of sirolimus  for weekly treatment
during the 16 weeks of Dose- finding Safety Part and every other week treatment
during the Extension Part
•Measurement of brain naturetic peptide (BNP), C -reactive protein (CRP) and
troponin levels, indicative of right ventricular strain at baseline, 5 , 9, 13, and 17
weeks and for BNP, every 8 weeks in the optional Extension Part (E9, E17, E25,
E33)
•Change from baseline to week 17  and to weeks E17 and E33 in the Extension Part

•Change from baseline to week 17  and to weeks E17 and E33 in the Extension Part
in emPHasis10 questionnaire
10.2.  Sample Size Considerations 
The dose -escalation portion of this clinical study will enroll up to 24 patients. Dose 
escalation will follow the 3+3 rule to establish the MTD. Three planned dose levels are to 
be used (
Table 1). The minimum number of patients required to establish the MTD is 9 
patient
s. In case there is a dose limiting toxicity at each of the 4 dose levels, each cohort 
of 3 patients will be expanded to 6 patients, in which case a total of 24 patients will be 
treated.   
After the MTD is achieved, up to 2 cohorts (one including the MTD and one alternate dose 
or schedule) will be expanded to enroll a total of up to 10 patients in each cohort to further  
evaluate safety and preliminary utility (potential for clinical efficacy) of ABI -009 in the 
treatment of PAH.   
10.3.  Pharm
acokinetic Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will include all patients in the phase 1 dose escalation who 
received ABI -009 during the first 4 weeks  (central analysis) .  
An additional (local) PK study will be conducted to obtain trough sirolimus  levels 
throughout the study (both in the first 16 -week Dose -finding Safety  (weekly samples)  and 
optional 32- week Extension Part (every -2-week samples ) from all enrolled patients , as 
well as a more detailed sirolimus  PK from weeks 1 and 3 from patients who consent . The 
whole blood concentration of sirolimus  will be summarized by descriptive statistics as 
appropriate. A simple regression model will be applied to assess the relationship of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters with dose and pharmacodynamics and safety .

Confidential and Proprietary  56 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  11. MONITORING, RECORDING AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
11.1.  Toxicities of ABI -009 
ABI-009 is a formulation of sirolimus . No unexpected toxicities not already known for 
sirolimus  (Rapamune®) or the sirolimus  prodrug, temsirolimus (Torisel®), were identified 
in the nonclinical toxicity studies, or observed in the phase 1 studies for ABI -009. 
More details on the known precautions, warnings, and AEs of sirolimus  and rapalogs  are 
found in the Rapamune® and Torisel® Package Inserts [ 46, 53]. 
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or 
worsen in a patient during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient’s 
health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or 
intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or 
symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivit y or toxicity to the IP should be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of the IP should 
be reported as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose 
resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form 
and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself.  
All patients will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include 
monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: the patient’s clinical symptoms, 
laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
All AEs will be recorded by the investigator from the time the patient signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of ABI -009 and those SAEs made known to the 
investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. AEs and SAEs 
will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the patient’s source documents. All 
SAEs must be reported to A adi Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a patient is to be 
removed from treatment due to an AE. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that 
all AEs observed by the investigator or reported by the patient that occur after the first 
dose of IP through the EOT Visit  are reported using the applicable eCRF (eg, AE 
Summary CRF).  
11.2.  Evaluation of Adverse Events  
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes:  
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  57 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  • AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol]  
• Assessment of relatedness to the IP  
• A ssessment of relatedness to protocol -required procedures  
• Action taken 
The AE toxicity grading scale used will be the NCI CTCAE Version  4.03.   
11.3.  Serious Adverse Events 
11.3.1.  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening (places the patient at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an 
in-patient admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of 
the serious criteria, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “other 
medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could inc lude allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug- induced liver injury, or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
Since the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for SAEs, 
if AEs correspond to grade 4 “life threatening” CTCAE grading scale criteria (eg, laboratory abnormality reported as grade 4 without manifestation of life threatening 
status), it will be left to the investigator’s judgment to also report these abnormalities as SAEs. For any AE that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the event’s severity status must be recorded in the patient’s medical record.   
11.3.2.  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that m eets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report 
Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must 
be reported to A adi Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow -up 
reports.  
ABI-009 
Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  58 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and 
consistent. This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time of signing of the informed consent form to 28 days 
after the last dose of IP), and those made known to the investigator at any  time thereafter 
that are suspected of being related to IP.   
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospital records and other relevant documents. If a patient died and an 
autopsy has been performed, copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to A adi Drug Safety as soon as these become available. Any follow -up data will be 
detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Aadi Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the investigator is responsible for informing the 
IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up information 
about the event. The investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file i ncluding 
correspondence with A adi and the IRB/EC.  
11.4.  Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Reporting 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female patient, or female partner of a male patient, while the 
patient is taking protocol -required therapies report the pregnancy to A adi as specified 
below. In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should monitor for pregnancies that occur up to 3 months after the last dose of protocol -
required therapies.  
The investigator will follow the female patient until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Aadi Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal 
or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. If a lactation case occurs while the female patient is taking protocol -
required therapies, report the lactation case to A adi as specified below. In addition to 
reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for lactation 
cases that occur up to 1 week after the last dose of protocol -required therapies.

12.1.  Discontinuation from Investigational Product  
The following events are considered sufficient  reasons for discontinuing a patient from 
the IP:  
• AE(s) (that are intolerable)  
• Physician decision  
• Withdrawal of consent (from treatment only)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up 
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specified on the eCRF)  
The reason for treatment discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF and in the 
source documents.  
12.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a patient from the study:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Death  
• Lost to foll ow up  
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specified on the eCRF)  
The reason for study discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.  
At the time of withdrawal, it should be determined whether the patient is withdrawing from 
treatment alone, or from treatment and collection of further data (eg, survival). Every effort 
should be made to collect survival data after patient withdraws from treatment.  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason w ithout 
prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
12.3.  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate Patient ’s 
Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a patient (s) from IP  and/or other 
protocol -required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a whole at any time prior 
to study completion.    
Patient s may be eligible for continued treatment with A adi IP and/or other 
protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the local country’s 
regulatory mechanism.

13.1.  Informed Consent  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator  to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template ar e to 
be communicated formally in writing from A adi to the investigator. The written informed 
consent document is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a patient ’s participation in the clini cal study, the  investigator  is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the patient  after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before  any 
protocol- specific  screening procedures or the IP is  administered.   
The investigator  is also responsible for asking the patient  if the patient  has a primary care 
physician and if the patient  agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of  the 
patient ’s participation in the clinical study . If the patient  agrees to such notification, the  
investigator  is to inform the patient ’s primary care physician of the patient ’s participation 
in the clinical study.  If the patient  does not have a primary care physician and the  
investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator  is to document such in the 
patient ’s medical record. 
The acquisition of informed consent  and the patient ’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notifi cation of the primary care physician is to be documented in the patient ’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  to be signed and personally  dated by the patient  
or a legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion.  The original  signed informed consent  form is to be retained in 
accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form  is to be 
provided to the patient  or legally acceptable representativ e. 
If a potential patient  is illiterate or visually impa ired and does not have a legally acceptable 
representative, the i nvestigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed 
consent form to the patient  and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the patient  and 
the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was 
freely given and understood.   
13.2.  Institutional Review Board/Independent  Ethic s Committee  
A copy of the protocol,  proposed informed consent form, other written patient  information, 
and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IRB for written approval.  
A copy of the written approval of the protocol and infor med consent form must be received 
by Aadi before recruitment of patient s into the study and shipment of A adi IP. 
The investigator  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amend ments and changes to the informed consent document.  The 
investigator  is to notify the IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAEs  occurring at the 
site and other AE reports received from A adi, in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator  is responsible for obtaining annual  IRB approval [IRBs only]/renewa l 
[IRBs and IECs] throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the i nvestigator’s report s 
and the IRB  continuance of approval must be sent  to Aadi.

Protocol: P AH-001  Aadi Bioscience  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  61 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  13.3.  Patient  Confidentiality 
The investigator  must ensure that the patient ’s confidentiality is maintained fo r documents 
submitted to A adi. 
• Patient s are to be identified  by a unique patient  identification number. 
• Wh ere permitted, date of birth  is to be documented and formatted in 
accordance with local laws and regulations. 
• On the CRF demographics page, in addition to the  unique patient  identification 
number, include the age at time of enrollment. 
• For SAEs  reported to A adi, patient s are to be identified by their unique patient  
identification number, initials (f or faxed reports,  in accordance with local laws 
and regulations), and dat e of birth ( in accordance with local laws and 
regulations ). 
• Documents that are not subm itted to Aadi (eg, signed informed consent forms)  
are to be kept in confidence by the investigator , except as described belo w. 
In compliance with Federal regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the 
investigator  and institution permit authorized rep resentatives of the company, of the 
regulatory agency(s), and the IRB direct access to review the patient ’s original medical 
records for verification of study- related procedures and data.  Direct access includes 
examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are 
important to the evaluation of the study.  The investigator  is obligated to inform and obtain 
the consent of the patient  to permit  such individuals to have access to his/her study-
related records, including per sonal information.  
13.4.  Protocol Amendments   
If Aadi amends the protocol, agreement from the i nvestigator must be obtained.  The IRB 
must be informed of all amendments and give approval.  The investigator must send a 
copy of the approval letter from the IRB to A adi. 
13.5.  T ermination of the Study 
Aadi reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Both Aadi and the i nvestigator 
reserve the right to terminate the Investigator ’s participation in the study according to the 
study contract.  The investigator  is to notify the IRB in writing of the study’s completion or 
early termination and send a copy of the notification to A adi.

14.1.  Data/Documents
The investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct 
of the study and the distribution of the investigational product  are complete, accurate, 
filed, and retained. Examples of source documents include: hospital records; clinic and 
office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; checklists; dispensing records; recorded data 
from automated instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being 
accurate copies; microfiche; x -ray film and reports; and records kept at the pharmacy; 
and the laboratories, as well as copies of eCRFs or CD -ROM.  
14.2.  Data Management  
Data will be collected via eCRF and entered into the clinical database. These data will be 
electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical 
team.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and 
investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
14.3.  Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection  
The i nvestigator  is responsible for compl ying with  the requirements for  all assessments 
and data collection (including  patient s not receiving protoco l-required therapies)  as 
stipulated in the protocol for each patient  in the study.  For patient s who withdraw prior to 
completion of all protocol-r equired visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 2), th e investigator can search publicly available 
records (where per
mitted) to ascertain survival status.  
This ensu r

14.4. S ample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood, biomarker or pharmacokinetic sample collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and 
for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study patients. This includes testing to ensure 
analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of  the study. 
This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred 
sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
If informed consent is provided by the patient, Aadi can do additional testing on remaining 
samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the disease, the 
dose response and/or prediction of response to ABI -009, and characterize aspects of the 
molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites). Results from this analysis are to 
be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study. 
Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.  
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the patient directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of biomarker, biomarker development, or other exploratory 
studies are not placed in the patient’s medical record and are not to be made available to

Confidential and Proprietary  63 Amendment 4 : October 24, 2019  the patient, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except 
as specified in the informed consent.  
The patient retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the Investigator. Following the request from the patient, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and patient number so that any remaining blood or tumor samples and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request 
of the patient through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate 
(eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample). If a commercial product is developed from this research 
project, the sponsor owns the commercial product. The patient has no commercial rights 
to such product and has no commercial rights to the data.

15.1.  Study  Monitoring  
The A adi representativ e(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator  for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, e CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that patient  confidentiality is respected.  
The A adi representative is responsible for verifying the e CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  Monitoring w ill include on -site visits with the investigator and his/her staff as 
well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During 
monitoring visits, the facilities, IP  storage area, e CRFs, patient’s source documents, and 
all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the A adi representative in 
accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan.   
The investigator  agrees  to cooperate with the clinical monitor  to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing e CRFs,  
are resolved.  
15.2.  Audits and Inspections  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s  audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from A adi’s Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy,  
protocol- required therapy  storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.

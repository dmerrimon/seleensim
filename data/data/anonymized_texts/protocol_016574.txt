EFFICACY A ND 
SAFET Y Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints : 
• Proportion of s ubjects who achieve pain relief at 15 minutes. 
Headache pain i s assessed using a 4 -point scale  (0 = none, 
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) . Pain relief is  defined by a 
decrease i n pain  from severe to  mild or none  without the use of 
acute rescue medicati on. 
• Proportion of subjects  who achieve sustained pain relief f rom 
15 minutes to 60 minutes  post patch application . Sustained 
pain relief r equires  a pain rating of mild or none  at eac h 
timepo int from 15 minute s to 60 m inutes  without the use of 
acute rescue medication.    
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
• Proportion of su bjects that achieve p ain relief at 5 , 10, 20, a nd 
30 minute s post patch appli cation  
• Proportion of subje cts that achieve s ustained pain relief f rom 5 
to 60 m inutes and from 10 to 60 minutes  post patch application  
• Proportion of subject s that achieve p ain freedom  at 10- and 
15-minutes  post patch applicatio n 
• Proportion of subjects  that achieve sustained pain freedom 
from  10 to 60 m inutes and from  15 to 60 minut es post patch 
application

 SAFETY  
• Incide nce of adverse events   
• Physical exam in cluding height and weight  
• Vital signs  including  blood pressure   
• Serum chemistries and hematological par ameters  
• Serum and urine pregnancy for wom en of child -bearing 
potential  
• 12-lead ECGs   
• Assessment  of conco mitant medications  
• Investigator  visual s kin Assess ments  
 
STATISTICAL 
METHODS:  
EFFICACY ANALYSIS : For the primary efficacy analysis, the proportion o f subjects 
achieving pain relief at 15 minutes and sust ained pain relief  from  
15 minutes to 60 minu tes post -dose will be anal yzed sep aratel y 
using a  Cochran  Mantel Haenszel test stratified by clu ster 
headache subtype (chronic or episodic) .  A significance t est of the 
treatment difference comparing each C213 dos e to placebo wil l be 
tested at the two -sided 0.05 level, and odds ra tios and their  
correspo nding 95%  confidence intervals will be calculated.  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods .  A 
fixed sequence procedure will be appli ed to the t wo C213 arms and 
the primary and secondary e fficacy endpoints  to adjus t for 
multipli city and  to contr ol for overall type I error.  
 
Safety An alyses:  
Adverse events will be summarized overall and by pref erred term 
and system organ class.  Adverse events will also be summariz ed 
by severity and relationship to study drug. S erious AEs an d AEs  
leading t o discon tinuation of study drug will also be summarized.  
All safety data will be listed by subject and para meter, separate 
listings of all abnormal lab oratory fin dings will be provided, and 
clinically significant abnormaliti es will be recor ded as  AEs.  
 Samp le Size: 
It is anticipated that 2 0% of subje cts receiving placebo and 55% of 
subjects receiving active tr eatment will achieve pain relief at 
15 minut es and sust ained pain relief  from  15 minutes to 60 minu tes 
post-dose.  Based on a  two-sided ch i-square t est with  continuity 
correction and an alpha level of 0.05, 40 patients/arm will provide approximately 80% pow er to detect this same difference between 
two treatmen t groups, assumin g a 15% dropout rate.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Backg round C2 13 fo r the Acu te Treatm ent of Cluster Headache  
Cluster headach e is a deb ilitating a nd painful disorder t hat affects approxi mately 0.1% of the 
U.S. population.  The excruciating he adaches, lasting from 15 minutes to 3  hour s and averaging 
45-60 minut es, and are o ften descr ibed as t he worst pain the sufferer has ever ex perienced .  A 
number of acute treatments hav e been utilized , including injectable triptans, inhaled oxyge n and 
neuros timulation.  Perhaps the most important att ribute for a n acute t reatm ent of c luste r 
headach e is rapi d onset of pain relief or freedom  (Rozen  et al 201 2). 
Zosano is evalua ting C213 for the acute treatment of cluste r headache ( both episodic and 
chronic).  Intranasal and oral zolmitriptan pr oduct s have b een evaluated f or the t reatment of 
cluster headache, in random ized, pla cebo-controlled trials and found to  be effective.  
Unfortunately, these trials only demonstrated significan t efficacy at 30 minutes, which is not 
ideal  for these intense an d short -lived  attacks (Cittadini et al 20 06, Bahra et al 2000, Hedlund et 
al 2009) . 
Subcutane ous (SC) suma triptan  is also effective for the treatment of clus ter headache and  
relieves h eadache p ain in a significant percentage of suff erers  (Ekbom  et al 1993) .  Thi s is likely 
due to the rapid absorption of s umatriptan f ollowing injection .  Zosano conducted a 
pharmacokinetic study ( CP-2015- 007) c ompar ing plasm a concent rations of sumatriptan 
following subcut aneous adm inistration with several dose l evels of C213 and or al zolmitriptan 
2.5 mg.  The mean plasma con centrations  following C213 3.8 mg, oral zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, and 
subcutaneous sum atriptan  6.0 m g are sh own below .  Note that the plasma concentrations of 
sumatr iptan we re divided by 10 to account  for differences i n potency, as the slide is intended to 
illustrate the c omparative pharmacokinetic curves.

 By vi sual ins pecti on, one c an see th at plasma concentrations of zolmitripta n were det ectable ver y 
quickly after C213 ad ministration , and th e time to maximum concentration is simila r to 
subcut aneous sumatriptan.  As has been described s everal times, time to  maxi mum conc entrat ion 
of oral zolmit riptan is approximately one hour  (Seaber  et al 1 998), which is far  less desirable for 
treating cluster headache s. 
If the ra pid absorption of zolmitriptan following C2 13 administration res ults in fast relie f of the 
severe pai n of cluster headache, C213 would be a  valuable  addition to the therapeutic opt ions 
currently avail able to cluster headache sufferers.  The goal of this tr ial is  to compare C213 doses 
of 1.9 mg and 3.8 mg (administered as tw o patche s of 1.9 mg ) to placebo  for the treatment of 
acute cluster headache.  
1.2 Clinical Pharmacology, Efficacy, an d Safety of zolmitr iptan and other 
studies of Cluster Headache 
Human P harm acokinetics  
A Phase 1 study compared the PK of intracutaneous zol mitriptan and its m etabolite s as wel l as 
the tolerability of various doses of intrac utaneous zolmitriptan to a stand ard oral dose (2.5 m g) of 
zolmitriptan ( CP-2015- 007).   Additiona lly, since onset of effect may be an important attribute of 
the intracutaneo us system, th e study include d a compa rison of T max values with SC sumatriptan 
6.0 mg .  The study provided preliminar y information on the  potential advantages of the C213 
system use  for the tre atment of cluster headache s. 
The calculated  key pharmacokinetic param eters fo r the Zolmitriptan regi mens and subcutaneous 
sumatriptan are s hown in  Table 1.

Perhaps  mos t relevant to the potential utility of this product  for the treatment of cluster headache 
is the T max for the ZP -Zolmitriptan regimens, showing muc h more rapid absorpti on of the 
zolmitriptan from  intracut aneous administration than from oral administrati on. 
Effic acy Measurements  
The ef ficacy of C213 for the acute treatment of cluster headaches has  not been e stablished.  The 
efficacy of zolmitriptan given by oral tablet  or nasal spray has b een demons trated i n large 
placebo -controlled trials  (Rapoport  et al  1997, Dawson  et al 2005, Dahlof  et al 1998) .  In a 
meta-analysis of zolmitript an nasal spray  for clus ter headac he, the authors found that headache 
response wa s observ ed at 30 minutes (primar y endpoint) in a lar ger proportion of subjects than 
placebo for both 5 mg a nd 10 mg doses (48.3%  vs 29.5%, P = .0004, a nd 63.1% vs 29.5%, 
P ≤ .001, respe ctively).  Furthermore,  significantly more subjects were pain free at 30 minutes in 
both dose groups as compared to placebo (3 4.8% vs 19.3%, P = .007 for 5 mg, and 44% vs 
19.3%, P  ≤ .001 for 10 mg).  Similarly, oral zolmitriptan was found to be ef fective i n episodic 
cluster head ache at both the 10 mg (59.5%) and 5mg (56.6%) doses  versus placebo (42.2%, 
P ≤ 0.01 for both doses)  Bahra et al 2000.  The oral formulation was not found to be significa ntly 
different from p lacebo in chr onic cluster.   
Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was evaluated in two double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
crossover trials  of ind ividuals with cluster headache.  Pain relief rates at 15 minutes for S C 
sumatriptan were 74% and 75% compared with placebo p ain relie f rates o f 26% and 35% .  In 
both trials, S C sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo.  Thus, pain relief r ates 
appeared higher with the more rapidly absorbed product  (Imitrex product information) . 
Safety A ssessments  
As with e fficacy, the safety of vari ous formu lations of zolmitriptan ha s been extensively studied, 
predominantly in migraine patients .   
The safet y of oral z olmitriptan  at significantly higher doses (and presumably higher plasma 
concentrations)  than those proposed for the C213 program, has b een evalu ated in two large 
placebo -controlled studies  of migraine .  Dahlof et al  1998 evaluated 1181 subjects who received 
zolmitriptan  doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg (more  than 200 subjects pe r dose group) .  
The inciden ce of adv erse events was 61%, 75%, 79% and 76% respectively.  \The most 
commonly reported adverse events were  asthenia, dizziness, paresthesia and feelings of 
heaviness.  Most of the adverse events were mild or moderate in intens ity, not seri ous, transient  
and reso lved without intervention.  The incidence of chest -related adverse events i.e. , tightness, 
pain, hea viness, and pressure was low.   Administration of z olmitriptan , even at the highest dose, 
was not as sociated with signifi cant effects on clinical la boratory test s or ECGs.  
Rapoport et al 1997 compared oral doses ranging from  1 mg to 10 mg of zolmitriptan to placebo 
in 1258 migraine patients and  found that efficacy increas ed as a function of dose,  and that  all 
doses of z olmitrip tan were well -tolerated, although the incidence of adverse events was 
dose-related .

 Doses of 25 mg of  oral zolmitriptan  for the treatment of migraine were evaluated in two 
additional studies ( Schoenen e t al 1994 and  Visser et al 1996) and in both studies this dose was 
well-tolerated.  
Long- Term  Safety Studies  of Zolmitriptan  
Two large long- term studies have established the long- term safety o f oral zolmitriptan  and 
intranasal  zolmitriptan .  The Int ernational Zolmitriptan Study group studied 2058 patients who 
treated 31579 migraines with 5 mg oral  zolmitriptan  over one year and  found the drug to be well -
tolerated.  D awson et al  evaluat ed 538 patients who treated  20717 at tacks over 1 year with 
intranasal zolmitriptan  5 mg, and also found a high degree of tolerability.  Therefore, the 
long- term safety of frequent administration of zolmitriptan  administered from two di fferent 
formula tions has been well  established.

1.3 Study R ationale  and Choice of Design  
C213 is a novel formulation of zolmitriptan for intracutaneous delivery, which when 
administered  results in rapid systemic absorption of zolmitriptan and time to maximum 
concentration of plasma z olmitriptan o f approximately 15 minutes.  This product was evaluated 
in a previous migraine trial  (CP-2016- 001), and the 3.8 mg dose was superior to placebo f or both 
co-primary endpoints.  The 1.9 mg dose was superior to placebo for 1 of 2 co- primary endpoints 
(pain freedom at 2 hours).  Tolerability was good, and the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions, that all resolved over a cours e of hours to days.  
Cluster headaches are severe, debilitating and exquisitely painful, but the att acks are of s horter 
duration than in migraine.  Given the characteristics of the attacks, any drug administered to abort the attacks must be rapidly absorbed to  be of benefit.  Previous trials of subcutaneous 
sumatriptan have demonstrated that a rapidly absorbed tripta n can relieve the pain associated 
with a cluster attack .  Thus, C213 with observed T
max ranging from 2- 30 minutes seen in a 
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 21 of 68 
 previous Phase 1 study, may be absorbed rapidly enough to produce systemic levels of 
zolmitriptan , sufficient to reliev e a cluster h eadache attack.  
The doses of C213 used in this study are 3.8 mg, that was found to be effective in a previous migraine efficacy trial and 1.9 mg , that was effective for pain reduction in the same trial.  There 
is anecdotal clinical evidence th at lower dose s of injected triptans may be effective for cluster 
headache attacks.  
Sample size determination was estimated based on the characteristics of C2 13 and the results of 
previous trials of pharmacologic agents for the treatment of cluster headache .  The only product 
approved for treating cluster headache is subcutaneous sumatriptan, and the effect size i n those 
trials was significant.   However, the t rials were crossover designs utilizing paper diaries 
conducted in the 1990s.  The more recent trial s with zolmitriptan (particularly nasal spray) had 
smaller effect sizes, perhaps due to slower absorption than seen with SC  sumatriptan.  C213 has 
pharmacoki netics more similar to S C sumatriptan than the zolmitriptan formulations.  Therefore, 
we estimated the effect si ze of C213 to be somewhere between that of S C sumatriptan and that of 
intranasal zolmitriptan.

the subject will self -administer 
the patches .  The subject will 
continue to complete the 
eDiary at speci fied time points 
out to 60 minutes  post dose . 
 
 
Subject  will be seen for 
their final visit within  
1-8 days post  C213 
application . 
 
 
This is a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled study.  Subject s who have consented 
and meet the entry  criteria will be randomized to receive one of  three blinded treatment s.   
Qualified subjects will randomize to the double -blind treatment period at  Day 1 and will have up 
to 48 weeks  to confirm and treat a  cluster headache.  Using the eDiary to confirm the  subject is 
experiencing a cluster headache, subjects will self -administer the  patches  and continue to 
respond to questions in the eDiary for 1-hour post  treatment administration .

3.2.6 Early Termination  
3.2.6.1 Withdraw al of Su bjects 
Subject s may be withdrawn f rom treatment or from the st udy for the following reasons:  
• At the ir own request  or at the request of their legally authorized representative;  
• If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation of treatment  would be detri mental to  the 
subje ct’s well -being;  
• If the subject  exper iences any A E believed to be possibly or probably related to s tudy 
drug and severe enough to warrant withdrawal of treatment;  
• If the subject  starts and continues to use a prohibited drug, as listed in Sect ion 6.2.10; or   
• If the subject  is non- compliant with the  study drug and dosing schedule , or any other 
requirement of this protocol .

For all subject s who are withdrawn from the study, the reason must be rec orded on t he 
appropriate sou rce document and on the appr opriate e CRF .  The subject  must be followed up to 
establish wh ether the reason was an AE, and, if so, this must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures in Section  8.3.  Subject s with ongoi ng systemic and s kin AEs at s tudy termination 
will be followed unti l all signif icant changes have resolved or become medically stable.   
To the extent possible, all examinations scheduled and all data normally collect ed at  com pletion 
of the study (the fin al study visit) mu st be perfo rmed on all subject s who receive study drug, but 
do not complete the study according to protocol (see Section  6.1.4).  This can be done until study 
closur e but pre ferably as close as  possible to the t ime of the s ubject ’s early termination.   
The inve stigator mus t make at least three documented attempts (phone, email, etc.)  to contact 
subject s lost to follow -up up until the time of database lock.  This incl udes one c ertified letter 
sent to the subject ’s primary pl ace of residence.  A copy must be maint ained in the  source 
documentation.

 4 STUDY TREATMENTS  
4.1 Iden tity of Invest igational  Products  
4.1.1 C213 
The C213 patches will be  manufactured by Zosano Pharma  in Fremo nt, CA (see Investigator ’s 
Brochure for more information) .   
4.1.2 Comparator Product :  ZP -Placebo  
The P lacebo will be  manufactured by Zosano Pharma .  The placeb o patch is a s ingle use , 3 cm2 
Placebo ( intracutane ous microne edle) system that contains no active in gredient s. 
The Placebo patch is supplied and packaged in an identical fashion as the C213 1.9 mg  coated 
patch thereby maintaining the blinding. 
4.1.3 Produc t Des cription and P atch Appl ication  
The Zosano C213 Micr oneedle Sys tem is a novel drug delivery technology which consi sts of a 
disposable titanium patch centered on an adhesive backing with microneedles that are dry- coated 
with the drug product formulation, and a r eusable ha ndheld applicator th at ensures that t he patch 
is applied with a defined application spe ed and energ y to the site of administration.  
The C213 System is a proprietary disposable patch and a reusable applicator.  The zolmitriptan-
coated tit anium  microneedle a rray (3  cm2 array) i s attached to a 5  cm2 adhesi ve patch.  A 
magnified image of the zol mitriptan -coated microneedles is shown in Figure  2.  The patch 
system is composed of several parts.  The pa tch is mo unted insi de a polycarbonate plastic ring 
with a co -molded desiccant ( Figure  3). 
The completed system is packaged in a nitro gen purged foil cup.  The reusable applicator is 
shown in Figure  3 and Figure  4 with  a lock -out func tion to avoi d accidental firing .  The 
applicator  provides a spring- driven piston to apply the patch with consistent impact energy of 
0.26 Joules.  The  user  presses the h andheld r eusable ap plicator onto the patch ring a ssembly for 
attachment, then the appli cator is un -locked by twisting the cap.  The user applies the patch by 
pressing the applicator/patch ring assembly onto the skin site  and holding it t o the  arm for 
3 seconds  (Figure  4).  The system was used in the  Zosano Phar ma Phase 1 study CP -2015- 007, 
conducted in Australia under Clinical Trials Authorization (CT A), two phase 1 PK studies , 
CP-2018- 002 and CP -2019- 001 conducted in the U S, a Phase 2 efficacy  study CP -2016- 001 and 
a long- term safety study CP -2017- 001, conducte d in the US .  The intended regimens for this 
clinical s tudy will be 1.9 mg plus one placebo patch, two patches of 1.9 mg  (3.8 mg total dos e), 
or tw o placebo patches d elive red to the upper arm .

4.2 Method o f Assigning Subject s to Treat ment Group  
Approximately 120 subjects w ill be ran domly assigned to receive one  of the three treatments  in a 
1:1:1 ratio:  C213 1.9 mg administered as one active and one placebo patch , C213 3.8 mg 
administered as two active patch es, or placebo  administered a s two placebo patches .  
Randomization w ill be str atified by study center a nd cluster headache subtype (chronic or 
episodi c).  Zosano will employ R TSM random ization system for randomization and subseque nt 
clinical trial materia l (CTM) kit assignme nts.  A contract research or ganization wil l be 
respo nsible for gene rating the r andom ization sche dule.   
At randomization ( Day 1), once it has been established that a subject  qualifies for the study, 
study staff will log in to Medidata using appr opriat e credentials and input  subject -specif ic 
informa tion.  In accordance wit h the random ization s chedule, the R TSM will assign the 
randomization number and the unique  CTM  kit number to the subject .  Each subject  must be 
given only the CTM  kit as signed by t he RTSM randomization s ystem.  The study sta ff will 
document t he kit number  assigned  in the e CRF .  Subject s are t o be randomized in the order in 
which they qualify from the screening phase for inclusion in the study. 
4.3 Dose, Dose Schedule, and Route of A dministration  
The study drug will be dispensed only to qualifie d, randomized subject s included in thi s study in 
accor dance with the  eligibility criteria specified in the study protocol. 
When a subject experiences a qualifying headache (as confirmed by answ ering questions in the 
eDiary), the s ubject  will self -administer the study drug.  Subjects will b e trained on how t o 
administe r the patches using the  C213 applicator supplied in the kit. 
4.4 Packaging, Labeling, and R eceipt of Supplies  
In this study, C213 acti ve and placebo pat ches will  be double -blinded.  
The C213 patches  (active or placebo)  are individua lly pack aged in cu ps.  Two  patches  per dose 
and one applicator will be packaged in a CTM  kit based on the randomization schedule .  The kit 
labels will contain at minimum the man ufacturer ’s name, C TM kit  number, storage condit ions, 
and a statement indicatin g tha t the study dru g is for inves tigational use only.  
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 33 of 68 
 The on- site pharmacist  or designee  will inventory and acknowledge receipt of all shipments of 
study drug.  The study site  personne l will a ccess the RTSM in Medidata to confirm receipt of 
each study dr ug shipment.  
4.5 Study Dru g Stability , Storage , and R etention  
C213 patches are stable at 20- 25°C.   The  patches and handheld applicators, packaged in 
individual subject kits, should be store d at control led room t emperature ( 20-25◦C/68◦F-77◦F).  All 
CTM  kits mus t be kept in a locked area with access restricted to designated study personnel.  
Sites do not  need to report excursions in the range of 15°C  to 20°C.  Sites must report all 
excursions unde r 15°C and ove r 25°C.  
4.6 Study Drug  Kit A ssignment, D ispensation, and  Accountability  
A kit  will be supplied to each subject based on the kit  number as signed by the R TSM in 
Medidata. The pharmaci st or designee will  record the CTM kit number dispensed to each subject  
on the drug accountability rec ord.  The designated site mon itor will periodi cally  check the 
supplies of CTM to ensure accountability of used a pplicators  and unused kit s. Final study dr ug 
accountability w ill be completed afte r the last subject visit.  All d rug accountability re cords wil l 
be filed in the site file a nd TMF as appropr iate.  The kits dispensed and us ed for each subject 
must be documented. Any discrepancies must be documented. 
4.7 System Performance  
A C213 Site User’s Manual will be provide d.  An ap plicator  asso ciated w ith field  observations of 
atypical app earance or sys tem performance that cannot be resolved after consulting the C213 
Site User’s Manual  should be  returned directly to Zosano Pharma  following the instructions  
provide d in the m anual .  A descrip tion of the f ield obse rvation should accompany the s hipm ent. 
Only de fective applicators will be returned to Zosano.   A t the end of  the study, a ll unus ed kits 
will be dispositioned per Zosano Pharma instructions. 
4.8 Medication Compliance  
The investigator will emphasize the importan ce of correctly s elf-adminis tering the study 
medication  once a qua lifying cluster head ache is con firmed thro ugh the eDiary.  S ubject s will be 
instructed to bring the following items to the  final clinic visit following administr ation of their 
dose: 
• eDiary  
• C213 applicator  
• Any unused C2 13 pa tches   
 
Subje cts may d iscard use d patches.  Date and  time of dos e and  infor mation regarding the 
subject’s study drug administration will be r ecorded in the  eDiary .

 5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ANALYSIS  VARIABLES  
5.1 Efficacy  
The co -primary efficacy en dpoint s are the  proportion of  subjects  who achie ve pain relief at 
15 minutes  and the propor tion of subjects who achieve sustained pain relief from 15 minutes  to 
60 minutes .  Headache pain is assessed using a 4- point  scale (0 = none, 1 = mi ld, 2 = moderate, 
3 = severe).  P ain relief is  defined by a decrea se in p ain from sev ere to mild or none  without the 
use of acute rescue medicat ion.  Sustained pain relief re quires a pain rating of mild or none at 
each timepoin t from 15 minutes to 60 minut es without the us e of acute rescue medication.    
The se condary  efficacy e ndpoints for this study are:   
• Proportion of subjects  that achieve pain relief at 5 , 10, 20, a nd 30 minutes  post  patch 
application  
• Proportion of subjects  that achieve sustained  pain relief from  5 to 60 minutes an d from 
10 to  60 minute s post pa tch applic ation 
• Proportion of s ubjects  that achieve p ain freedom at 10 minutes and 15 min utes post patch 
applic ation  
• Proporti on of subjects  that achieve sustained pain freedom from  10 to 60 min utes and 
from 15 to 60 minutes p ost patch application  
• Proportion of subje cts using rescue the rapy within 20 minutes  post patch application 
• Proportion of  subjects able to perf orm their usua l daily activities  as assessed by  the 
subject  
 
5.2 Safety  
Safety assessm ents will be initiated  after the inf ormed consent form  (ICF) ha s been sig ned and 
will conclud e when the p ost-study procedures are completed (or early di scontinuation) .   
Safety will be ass essed through the following:  
• Incidence of adver se events  
• Physical ex am including height an d weight  
• Vital signs  including blood pres sure 
• Clinic al labo ratory deter minations in cluding coagulation studies  
• Serum pregnancy and  urine pregnancy for w omen of child- bearing potential

in a S tatistical A nalysis P lan (SAP),  which wil l be finalized pr ior to da tabase lock and 
unblinding of  the s tudy. 
Unless other wise note d, significance tests o f treat ment diff erences will be tested at the two -sided 
0.05 leve l. 
7.1 Analysis Populations  
Modified Intent-to-Treat ( mITT) Popul ation 
All randomize d patients who ha ve a qu alifying hea dache and at least one post -application pai n 
score r ecorded within the firs t 15 mi nutes pos t-application  will be included in the mITT 
popul ation.  This is the primary populatio n for efficacy analyses a nd patien ts will be  analyzed 
based o n their  randomized t reatment.    
Safety Popul ation 
The safety p opulation will include all patie nts who  received  any amount of study drug. All safety 
analyses w ill be performed using this population, analyzed as treated .    
7.2 Estimate of Sampl e Size 
It is antic ipated  that 20% of  subjects receiving place bo and 55% of subj ects receiving active 
treatment w ill ac hieve pai n relief at 1 5 minutes and sustained pain relief  from 15 minutes to 60 
minutes post -dose.  Based on a two- sided chi -square test w ith continuity cor rectio n and an alp ha 
level of 0 .05, 40 subj ects/arm will prov ide approximately 80% power to de tect t his same 
difference between two treatment groups, assuming a  15% dropout rate.  
   
7.3 Demographic and Base line Characteris tics 
Demog raphic and  baseline charact eristics such  as ag e, gender, ra ce/ethnicity , height, and weig ht, 
will be summarized by treatm ent group using descriptive s tatistics.  Medical History will be  
coded using MedDRA and summarized by SOC and  Preferred Term us ing freq uency counts.   
Baseline dis ease ch aracteristic s will also b e summarized . 
7.4 Efficacy Analysi s 
7.4.1 Primary  Analysis  
The co -prima ry effi cacy endpoint s are the  proportion of subjects  who achieve  pain relief at 
15 minutes and the pr oportion who  achieve sus tained pai n relief f rom 15 minutes to  60 min utes 
post pa tch applicati on.  These t wo endpoints  will be analyz ed separately using a C ochran Ma ntel 
Haenszel test s tratified by cluster headache subty pe (episodic or chronic) and will utilize  the 
mITT population.  A signi ficance test of the treatme nt diffe rence compa ring each C213 dose  to

 placebo will be tested at the two -sided 0.05 level, and odds ratios a nd their cor responding 95% 
confidence intervals  will be calculated.  Headache pain will be  assessed using a 4- point sc ale 
(0 = none , 1 = mild, 2 =  moder ate, 3 = sev ere), with pa in relief de fined by a decreas e in pain

requires  a pain rating of mi ld or none at each timep oint from 15 minutes  to 60 minutes  without 
the use of ac ute rescue medication.  H andling of missing data as well as sensitivity ana lyses will 
be de scribed in th e SAP.  
7.4.2 Secondary Analyses  
Secondary  endpoin ts will be analyzed using sim ilar methods  as the prim ary endpoi nts and wi ll 
utilize  the mI TT popul ation. 
To adjust for mul tiplicity an d to control for overall ty pe I error, a fixed seq uential  testing 
procedure wil l be applied to the primary analyse s for the two C213 arms and the secon dary 
efficacy analyses .  If the pr imary effi cacy analys es for t he 3.8 mg a rm bot h produce a r esult that 
is statistically significant  at the 0.05 level, a s ignific ance level  of 0.05 wil l be used for the 
primary analys es of the 1.9 mg arm and for the seconda ry efficacy analyses  in an ordered  
fashion.  If any subsequent  analy sis does not  produce a st atistically si gnificant result  at the 0 .05 
level, then the rem aining an alyses w ill automatically be considered non -significant .  The order of 
testing  for each endpoint and each C213 dose gr oup will be provided in the SAP . 
7.5 Safety An alysis 
Safet y analyses wi ll be perfor med using the Safe ty popula tion.  Safety will be a ssessed  by: 
• Incidence of adverse events  
• Physical exam including hei ght and weight  
• Vital signs including blood pressure  
• Clinic al laborat ory determ inations including serum  chemi stries  and hematological 
paramete rs 
• Pregnancy tes ting for women of child- bearing potenti al 
• 12-lead ECGs  
• Assessment of concomitant medications  
• Investigator visual skin assessments  
 
Adverse events will be co ded using the latest  version of MedDR A and w ill be summa rized 
overall  and by pref erred term and sys tem organ  class.  Adverse events  will a lso be sum marized 
by severity and relationship to study dr ug.  Se rious AEs and AEs leading to disconti nuation of 
study drug will  also be s umm arized.

 8 ADVERSE E VENTS  
All sy stemic and s kin AEs, regardles s of trea tment group or suspecte d causal relatio nship to the 
investigational products, will be r eported as described in the following section s. 
For all syste mic and sk in AEs, th e investigator mus t obta in adequate  information both to 
deter mine the outcome o f the AE and to assess whether i t meets  the crit eria for clas sification as a 
SAE (see Section 8.2.1.1 ) requiring  immediate  notification (within 24 hour s) to the M edical  
Monitor  (MM)  and Pharmacovigilance  Group ( PV) by completing a SAE Report F orm.  
Sufficient  information should also be obtained by the inve stigator to determine the causality o f 
the AE , since he/she  is required to assess ca usality.  For s ystemic  and skin AEs with a cau sal 
relation ship to the invest igational  product , including all  applic ation sit e reactions , investigator is 
required to follow -up unt il the event or its sequelae resolve or  stabilize at a level acceptable to 
the investigator, a nd Zo sano Pharma c oncurs with that assessm ent. 
Pregnancy:   In the eve nt that a pregnancy occ urs, it  will not be considere d an AE but requires 
notification w ithin 24 hours of investigator awareness to t he Medical Monit or and 
Pharmacovigil ance Group by com pleting  a Pregnancy R eport Form.   The invest igator will follow  
the preg nancy  through the time of birt h and rep ort the outcome .  Information about the subject’s 
newborn or subject’s pregnant partner will be followed for up to 1 m onth after the birth. 
8.1 Report ing Peri od 
Collection of systemi c and skin AEs  will be initiat ed after the ICF has been signed  and wi ll 
conclu de when the p ost-study procedures are completed ( or Early Discontinuation).  The 
investigator  will also repor t to the M edical Mon itor and Pharmac ovigilan ce any SAEs  that come 
to his/her attention that occur w ithin 30 days after study drug a dministra tion.   
8.2 Adverse Even t Definitions  
8.2.1 Adverse Events (Adver se Experiences)  
An AE is any untoward medical  event that occu rs in a cl inical inv estigation, wher e a subj ect is 
admi nistered a med icinal (invest igational) product or med ical device, and which does not 
necessa rily have a  causal relationship between the even t and th e treatment.  An AE can be an y 
unfavorable and uninte nded sign or symptom , including clini cally signifi cant a bnormal 
labor atory result, concomitant illn ess, or w orsening of an existing medical conditi on. 
A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is  an event that emerges during treatme nt havin g 
been absent pr e-treatmen t or worse ns relative to the  pre-treatment st ate. 
Collectio n of systemic and skin AEs wil l be initiated after the ICF has  been s igned and conclude 
when the post -study procedures are com pleted (or Early Discontinuation).  T his incl udes the time 
between scre ening and th e first dosing.  
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 51 of 68 
 Abnor mal laborat ory tests that  are clinicall y significant, a s determined by the investigator , 
shoul d be repo rted as AEs i f: 
• the test result is associated wit h accom panying symptoms;  
• the test r esult re quires additiona l diagnost ic testing  or medical/surg ical inte rvent ion;  
• the test resu lt leads to discontinuation fr om the st udy, significant additi onal co ncomitant 
drug treatme nt, or other therapy;  
• the test resu lt is considered to be an AE by the i nvestiga tor or sponsor.  
 
Merely repeating an  abnormal test, i n the absence  of any of the above conditions, does not 
constit ute an AE .  Any abnormal test re sult th at is det ermined to be  an error does not require 
reportin g as an AE. 
8.2.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Def initions  
A serious  adver se event ( SAE) or re action is any unt oward m edical  occu rrence that at  any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (immediate r isk of de ath); 
• Requires inpat ient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  (Emergency 
depa rtment outpatien t visits f or an even t not fulfilling  any of t he ot her d efinitions of SAE 
given do not qualify as hospitaliza tion.  If an emergency departm ent visit leads to 
inpatient hospitalization, it would qu alify as an SAE. ); 
• Results in persist ent or s ignificant disab ility/inca pacity; or  
• Is a congenital  anomaly /birth  defec t. 
• Other i mportant medical events that may not resul t in death, be life -threatenin g, or 
require hospital ization may be considered serious w hen, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopar dize the p atient or su bject and may r equire m edical or s urgical 
intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Ex amples of  such 
medical  events include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive treatment in a n 
emergency room or at ho me, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do  not r esult  in 
inpatient hospitalizatio n, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
 Definit ion of disabi lity:  A substantial disruption of a  person’s ability to conduct  normal life 
functions. 
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 52 of 68 
 Life-threatening SAE:   Any A E that places th e subjec t, in the v iew of the investigator, at 
immediate risk o f death f rom the reaction as it occurre d (i.e., i t does not i nclude a reaction that  
had it occur red in a more severe form, might have  caused death).  
Hospital ization:   AEs report ed from clinical s tudies  resul ting i n hospitaliza tion or prolongation 
of hospit alization  are considered serious .  Hosp italizati on does not i nclude the following:  
• Rehabilitatio n facilities; 
• Hospice facilities; 
• Respite car e (e.g., caregiv er relief);  
• Skilled nur sing facilitie s; 
• Nurs ing homes;  
• Routine emergency department  admissions; or  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatien t/same da y/ambul atory procedu res). 
 
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of  hospitalization in the absence  of a pr ecipitating, clini cal AE i s 
not in i tself an SAE.  E xamples i nclude:  
• Admission for tr eatment of a p reexisting condi tion not associated with the dev elopment 
of a ne w AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condi tion (e .g., for work- up of 
persisten t pre-treatment lab abno rmality);  
• Social adm ission (e.g., su bject has no place t o sleep);  
• Adm inistrative ad mission (e.g., f or yearly  PE); or  
• Pre-planned tr eatment s or surg ical procedur es that have been noted in the base line 
documentation for the entire pro tocol an d/or for the indi vidual su bject . 
 
8.2.1.2 Unexpected Adverse E vent 
An unexpected AE is any AE  the nature or  severity of whi ch is not  consistent with the ap plicabl e 
product  information (e.g., current investigator ’s brochure ); or if an investigator ’s brochur e is not  
required or ava ilable, th e specificity or severity of  which  is not con sistent with the risk 
inform ation described in the ge neral investigational p lan or el sewhere in the current application, 
as amended.  
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 53 of 68 
 8.2.1.3 Severit y Ratings  
The investigator will evalu ate the severity of each  AE using the follow ing definitions:  
Mild - event may b e noticeable t o subject ; doe s not influence daily act ivities; usually does n ot 
require inter vention. 
Moderate - event may be of sufficient s everity to make a subject  uncomfortab le; perf ormance of 
daily  activitie s may be i nfluenced; inter vention m ay be  need ed. 
Severe -  event may cause severe discomfo rt; usual ly interferes with daily activ ities; su bject  may 
not be able to continue in the study; t reatmen t or other intervention usual ly neede d. 
Life-Threaten ing - Even t that, in  the view of the  investi gator,  place s the subject  at immediate 
risk of death fr om the re action as it occurred ( i.e., it does not  include a r eaction that, had it 
occurred in a m ore severe form, might have caused death) . 
Note the distincti on between the severi ty and the ser iousness of an  AE.  A  severe even t is not 
neces sarily an SAE.  For examp le, a headache may be s evere ( interferes  significant ly with 
subject 's usual function) but w ould not be classified as serious  unless it met one of th e criteria  for 
SAEs,  listed above .  Additionally, an SA E of abdominal  pain in an el derly patient th at result s in 
hospitalization to  rule o ut divert iculitis may be mild, whereas severe abdominal p ain (that 
interferes with most daily activities) in a younger , stoic pa tient may not  result in hos pitalization, 
and t hus be a severe non -serious  AE.  
8.2.1.4 Relationsh ip to Stu dy Drug 
The investigator ’s asses sment o f causality m ust be provided for all systemic and s kin AEs 
(serious and non- serious).  An investigator’s caus ality asse ssment is th e determinatio n of 
whether there e xists a reaso nable possibil ity or likelihoo d that th e investigational produc t caus ed 
or cont ributed to a n AE.  If the investigator’s final det ermination of causality is unknown and the  
investigator doe s not know whether  the investigatio nal product caused t he event, the n the event 
will be handled as  “related  to investigational product” f or report ing purposes.  Thus, it is 
imperative that all initi al SAE reports include an assessm ent of c ausality.  If the investig ator's 
causality assessmen t is "unknown but not  related to investigationa l product", this  should be 
clearly documented on study re cords.  
In addition, if the investigator determines an S AE is associated with study procedure s, the 
investigator must  record th is causal re lationship in t he sour ce document s and e CRF, as  
appropriate, and report such an assess ment in accordance with  the SA E reporti ng requiremen ts, 
if applicable.  
After careful me dical consideration, the investigator  will ev aluate the relat ionship of  each AE t o 
study drug appl ying the  following definitions:  
Zosano Phar ma Corporation  Protocol No.  CP-2019- 001v 4 
   
15 April 2020 Confide ntial Page 54 of 68 
 Probably Related  
An AE that i s likely  due to the use of the s tudy dr ug.  The r elationship in time is suggestive.  An 
alternat ive explanation is unlikely, e.g., concomitan t drug(s), concu rrent illn ess(es). 
Possibly Related  
An AE th at mig ht be  caused using the study drug.  The relations hip in ti me is reasonable; 
theref ore, a  causal r elationship c annot be excluded.  An alternative explanation is inconclusive, 
e.g., concomitan t drug(s), concur rent illn ess(es), but unlikely. 
Not Related  
An AE  that is judged to be clearly due  only to extrane ous cause s (disease  or illness , environme nt, 
etc.).   
The cau se must be noted on the appropriate  source document and on the AE e CRF p age. 
8.3 Documentation and R eporting of Adverse Ev ents by Invest igator  
Each AE  is to be assessed to determine if it meets the c riteria f or an SAE.  If an SAE oc curs, 
expedited  reporting wi ll follow local and international r egulations, as appropriate.  
All AEs, both expected and unexpe cted, occu rring duri ng this clinical t rial must be  reco rded on 
the AE  page of the eCRF .  AEs will b e describ ed in precise medical t erms, a long with the date 
and time of onset and the date and tim e of resolution, action taken and out come.  I n order to 
avoid vague, am biguous or  colloquial expr essions, the A E sho uld be recorde d in standard 
medical terminology rathe r than the subject’s ow n words .  Whenev er possible, the Investigator 
should group toget her into a single term signs and symptoms whi ch constitute a s ingle dia gnosis.  
Each AE is to be e valuated for durat ion, severity, seriousness a nd causal relati onship to the 
investigational dr ug.  The severit y of the AE a nd its relationship to the test produc t will be 
assessed by the Investig ator.  When reporting SA Es, the AE  form of t he eCRF and the S AE form  
must be co mpleted in a c onsistent manner.  For example, the sam e AE term should be use d on 
both forms.   
8.3.1 Reporting R equirements for Serious Adverse Eve nts 
ALL SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS, REGAR DLESS OF  CAUSE(S) OR REL ATIONSHIP 
TO STUDY DRU G, MUST BE REP ORTED IM MEDIAT ELY  TO PHARMACOVIGI LANCE  
GROUP  (PV) AND MEDICAL M ONITOR  (MM) BY TELEPHONE  (24/7 S afety L ine), FAX, 
OR EMAIL  (Contact info are provided in Section  8.5).  
All SAE r eporting w ill adhere  to 21 CFR 312.32 f or IN D safety reporting, appli cable FDA and 
ICH-GCP regulati ons. 
If an SAE occurs , PV and MM  are to  be notif ied within 24 hours of awareness of the event by 
the investigator.  In particular, if  the SAE  is fatal or lif e-threaten ing, notif ication to PV an d MM

 must be m ade i mmediately, ir respective of the extent of av ailable A E information.  This 
timeframe a lso appl ies to additional new information (follow -up) on pr eviously forwarded SAE 
reports.   An initial assessment of  causality  must be i ncluded in all S AE repor ts. 
To repo rt an SAE, t he investigator must complete th e SAE Rep ort Form , and to report  a 
pregnancy, th e investigator must complete the Pregnancy Repor t Form.  Occurrence of any 
SAE /pregna ncy must  be reported imm ediately ( within 1 w orking day) once  the inv estiga tive s ite 
has knowl edge of the ev ent.  The invest igator mu st also provide any rel evant i nformatio n 
regarding t he SAE and respond to requests for f ollow-up in a timely manner.  All SA Es will also 
be reported  on the AE  eCRF page  and concomitant  medicat ions a dmini stered in asso ciation with 
the SAE will be d ocumented on the appropriate e CRF . 
If an SAE  occurs and comes  to the attention of the investigat or after study termination within 
30 days of the last dose of  study drug(s), it m ust be reported i mmediat ely to the s ponsor in the  
same way as t he SAEs occurrin g during the study. 
8.3.1.1 Investigator  Report ing Responsibilities to the Independent Ethics Committee 
and Ot her Agencies  
The investigator m ust prom ptly report to t he IRB/IEC  or indepe ndent ethics com mittees ( IEC) 
all changes in the research activ ity and all unanticipated  problems involving ris k to huma n 
subje cts or others .  This includes all SAEs that have  occurred at the study site and all s tudy-
related SAEs that h ave result ed in an e xpedited safety r eport t o the FDA ( serious, unexpected 
SAEs pos sibly or probabl y related  to study drug).  The  investig ator must  send all IRB /IEC 
documentation (including notif ications and acknowledgements)  to the  sponsor  or its designee .  
The investigator mu st not make an y change s in the res earch without  IRB/IEC appro val, except 
wher e necessary to eliminate apparen t immed iate hazar ds to human subject s. 
8.3.2 Reporting Requirements for  Non-Serious Adverse Event  
Non-serious syst emic and skin AE s experien ced after th e randomizatio n phase of the  study will 
be repo rted on the AE  eCRF pages, whi ch will b e submitted to the spons or or its desig nee.   
8.4 Follow  up of Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be  followed up until resolution or, in the i nvestigator’s opi nion, a s table cond ition 
is reached , or unt il the subj ect is lost to  follow up.  All follow up rep orts should be made by 
completin g the S AE Report  Form and by utilizing the same reporting proc edures as the initial 
report . 
Based on the medi cal judgment of t he invest igator, al l non- serious sy stemic a nd ski n AEs  will be 
follo wed until 14 days after the last visit.   All non- resolved, non- seriou s systemi c and skin AE s 
beyond such date will be recorded as  “ongoing” without further follow up.

 9 EME RGENCY P ROCEDURES  
9.1 Emergency Contact  
In emergency situations, t he invest igator shoul d contact the m edical m onitor by t elephone at t he 
numbers lis ted on the title  page of the protocol.  If an SA E occur s, the PV  Group is to be notified 
within 24 hours of awar eness of the event by the investigator.  In particular, if th e SAE is f atal or 
life-threatening, not ification to the  PV Group  and the sponsor  must be made immed iately, 
irrespective of the exte nt of a vailable A E informatio n. 
9.2 Unblinding Procedures  
If a medic al emergency occurs and a decision re garding the subject ’s clinical tre atment req uires 
knowledge of  the t reatme nt assignment, the study blind ma y be broken for the speci fic subject .  
Unless th e medic al emergency is deemed  to be life -threatening, the medica l monitor must first be 
consulted bef ore unbl inding.  The inve stigator would then a ccess Medidata for unbl inding. 
The date, time, and reason for  unblinding m ust be documented in the sourc e doc umen ts and on 
the applicable e CRF.  Investigators should note that t he occu rrence of a SA E should not  
routinel y trigger i mmediate unblin ding.  If the  medic al monitor was not notified prior to br eaking 
the bli nd, the inves tigator must notify the medica l mon itor of any  and all blinds broken within 24 
hours  of each occurrence . 
9.3 Emerg ency Treatment  
During and following a s ubject ’s participation  in the study, the investig ator/in stitution should 
ensure that adequate medi cal care is provided to a subject  for a ny system ic or skin AE s, 
including clinically significant labor atory val ues, rel ated to the st udy.  The 
investigato r/instituti on should infor m a subject  when medical car e is n eeded for intercurrent 
illness(es) of whic h the investigator becomes aware.

 12 ETHICS  
12.1 Ethics Rev iew 
The IRB/IE C will r eview and ap prove the study protocol, t he ICF  and other relev ant substanti ve 
data before the st udy is initiated.  A cop y of the IRB/I EC approval l etter for the protocol and the  
consent form/ subject information sheet which specifically  iden tifies th e protoc ol name and th e 
Zosano pro tocol num ber, must be  sent to Zosan o (or designe e) prior to ini tiatin g the study.  
Subsequent ly, the Invest igator is res ponsible for keeping the IRB/I EC advised of the progre ss of 
the study as deemed appropri ate b ut, in any case, at least onc e a year d uring the course  of the  
study and for keeping the IR B/IEC  informed  of any  significant adverse reactions.  
12.1.1 Ethica l Conduct of the Study 
This study will be c onduc ted in strict  com pliance with GCP, IRB/IEC  and other relev ant 
regul atory re quirements.  The Inves tigator must ens ure that  each subject ’s anonymity is  
maintained as  descri bed within this protocol .  On the eCRF s or other do cuments submitted to 
Zosano or  its desi gnee, s ubject s must be identified only by their i nitials and a s ubject  number. 
Docu ments that  are not for subm ission  to Zosano and/or its designe e (i.e., signe d ICFs)  should be 
kept in stric t confidence by the Investi gator, in compliance with Fede ral regulations an d ICH 
GCP Guidelines.  The  Investigator and i nstitutio n must p ermit author ized represent atives of  
Zosano or  its designee, o r the regulat ory ag ency(s) a nd the  IRB/IEC  direct access t o review the

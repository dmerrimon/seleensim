4.1 Amendments
There are no amendments. This is the first version of the protocol.
5INTRODUCTI ON
5.1 Rationale and Backgr ound
A recent paper has demonstrated that soft contact lenses continue to dominate contact lens 
prescribing and in the year 2018, soft contact lenses accounted for over 90% of lens fits. 
(Morgan 2019). Furthermore, it was reported th at almost 32% of soft contact lenses were 
prescribed in a dail y disposable modality . DDT2 is a new dail y disposable silicone hydrogel 
contact lens with a material that combines high oxygen transmissibility  with a low modulus 
of elasticity . The lens was rec ently approved b y the FDA  and will be marketed as 
Precision1™ (verofilcon A) Soft Contact Lenses. 
The rationale for this study  is the need to compare the objective and subjective performance 
of the new DDT2 lenses to an alread y marketed daily  disposable c ontact lens (Acuvue 
Moist).
The primary  endpoint for this study  was selected to fulfill the primary  objective. Procedures 
for measurement of these endpoints were selected based on common practice for these 
assessments. The design of this study is justified based upon previous preclinical and clinical 
testing, as described within the package insert. Moist contact lenses were chosen as the 
control product because these lenses have the same wear modality .
5.2 Purpose of the Study
The primary  objective of this stud y is to demonstrate noninferiorit y in distance VA when 
wearing DDT2 contact lenses compared to Moist contact lenses.

At the end of the study , a clinical study  report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements and standards.
The resu lts from this study  may  be submitted as an abstract to be presented at conferences or 
as a manuscript to a journal if the data generated are of scientific interest.
5.3 Risk s and Benefits
Contact lenses have several benefits in that they  may  offer improved per ipheral vision and the 
added convenience of not wearing spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics 
of DDT2 contact lens are features consistent with successful contact lens wear . Based upon 
the pre -clinical and existing clinical data, DDT2 is known to be non- toxic and biocompatible 
for on -eye use. 
Acuvue Moist lenses are intended and marketed for daily  wear use under a daily  disposable 
wear modalit y; further details on any  known potential risks and benefits can be found in the 
package inser t. 
Neither the DDT2 nor the Acuvue Moist contact lenses are intended for use with a 
cleaning/disinfecting solution, and the biocompatibility  with lens care solutions and any  
associated clinical ef fects are unknown. 
A summary  of the known potential risks and benefits associated with DDT2 can be found in 
the package insert. Risks are minimized by  compliance with the eligibility  criteria and stud y 
procedures, and through close supervision b y a licensed clinician during exposure to the 
study  lenses. The potential harms associated with on- eye exposure to the new lens materials 
include toxicity  response, blurred vision, and ocular discomfort. In general, the risks 
associated with the wear of DDT2 are anticipated to be similar to other marketed dail y 
disposable soft contact lenses.
There may  also be unknown risks to use of DDT2 contact lenses. Any risk to subjects in this 
clinical study  will be minimized by  compliance with the eligibility  criteria and study  
procedures, clinical oversight and monitoring.
The site p ersonnel will educate subjects on proper hy giene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to

for distance correction in both ey es during the past 3 months for a minimum of 5 day s per 
week and 8 hours per day . This will avoid confounding subjective and safety responses in 
non-adapted subjects. Moreover , the subjects will not be permitted to use artificial 
tears/rewetting drops during the course of th e study  as this may  confound the primary  
effectiveness variable. The study will exclude any habitual wearers of Moist or DT1 in order 
to reduce potential bias of wearers to their habitual contact lenses.   This study  will also 
exclude subjects who for the l
ast 3 months have worn contact lenses in an extended wear 
modality .  This study  aims to compare the performance of two daily  disposable contact 
lenses, therefore, subjects wearing lenses in an extended wear modality  will be excluded as 
extended wear modali ty is known to impact the ocular phy siology .
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/ Follow
-Up
Subjects will wear the lenses in a daily  disposable wear modalit y for 8 -1/+2 day s. The lenses 
will be provided by  a qualified unmasked study  staff member in such a manner that the 
subject and the Investigator remain masked to the lens ty pe. As both the lenses are daily  
disposable lenses, they  will be prescribed to be used in a dail y disposable modality . The 
subjects will be asked to wear the lenses for at least 7 day s, therefore, they  are likel y to have 
adapted to the lens material prior to collecting objective and subjective measurements.
7.4 Rationale for Choice of C ontrol Product
Both DDT2 and Acuvue Moist are soft contact lenses and are to be prescribed for single use , 
daily  disposable wear . Acuvue Moist contact lenses are indicated for the optical correction of 
refractive ametropia (m yopia and h yperopia) in phakic or aphakic persons with non -diseased 
eyes. The lenses are not intended to be cleaned or disinfected and s hould be discarded after a 
single use.
7.5 Data Monitoring Committee
Not applicable.
8STUDY  POPULA TION
The study  population consists of male and female subjects age 18 years or older who are 
wearers of soft daily  contact lenses. Subjects who wear contact lenses in extended wear 
modality  or are 
previous or current wearers of Acuvue Moist or DT1 contact lenses will be 
excluded. The study  aims to enroll approximately  92subjects at approximately  5 sites in the 
US,with a target of 82 completed subjects. Site -specific targets may vary based upon

9.2 Other Medical Device or Medication Specified for Use During the 
Study
No other medical devices or medications are required to be used in conjunction with the 
treatments during the clinical study .
9.3 Treatment Assignment / Randomization
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment in a crossover sequence of 
DDT2 then Acuvue Moist or Acuv ue Moist then DDT2, respectively .
Only  after signing the ICF , a subject will be assigned a subject number by  the electronic data 
capture s ystem. 
A randomization list will be generated using a validated sy stem that automates the random 
assignment of treatment sequences to randomization numbers in the specified ratio. Subjects 
will be assigned treatment sequences according to the randomization list uploaded in the IR T 
system. The randomization list will be generated and maintained by  the Study  Sponsor .
At V isit 1, all eligible subjects will be randomized via the EDC/I RT integration sy stem to one 
of the treatment sequences. The Investigator or delegate will access the respective s ystem 
after confirming that the subject meets all the eligibility  criteria. A randomization number 
will be automatically  assigned to the subject according to the subject randomization list but 
will not be communicated to the site user . The EDC/I RT integration s ystem will inform the 
site user of the treatment sequence assignment to be dispensed to the subject.
9.4 Treatment mask ing
This study  is double -masked, with subjects randomized to use DDT2 and Acuvue Moist in 
the assigned sequence for the duration of 2 weeks (1 week for each period). Subjects, the 
Investigator ,and masked study  personnel (site and Sponsor) will be masked to the assigned 
treatment sequence.

trial design, execution, or 
reporting.
This level of masking will be maintained throughout the conduct of the study . Unmasking 
will occur only  after all planned study  data have been validated, and the database locked. 
Masked study  personnel must avoid seeking information that may  compromise masking. 
Unmasked study  personnel must not disseminate information that is potentially  unmasking to 
any masked personnel. The masked and unmasked site personnel must coordinate all s tudy 
activities as necessary  to protect masking and minimize bias during the study . 
In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of subject treatment is required, an 
individual I nvestigator will have the ability  to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific 
subject after contacting an appropriate Stud y Sponsor representative if time allows. 
Unmasking must be done according to the instructions provided for the study IRT system. 
Refer to Section 1 1.5.
9.5 Accountability Procedures
Upon rec eipt of the IPs, the Investigator or delegate must conduct an inventory . During the 
study , the masked Investigator must designate unmasked staf f to provide the I Ps to the 
subjects in accordance with their randomization assignment. Throughout the study , the
Investigator or delegate must maintain records of IP  dispensation and collection for each 
subject. This record must be made available to the study monitor for the purposes of 
verify ing the accounting of IP  supplies. Any discrepancies and/or deficiencies b etween the 
observed disposition and the written account must be recorded along with an explanation. All 
IPs sent to the Investigator must be accounted for by  Study  Sponsor personnel, and in no case 
be used in an unauthorized situation.

11ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES
11.1 General Information
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device (test article). Refer to the 
Glossary  of Terms and figures below for categories of AEs and SAEs.

Page 41of 55
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions:
“Have you had an yhealth problems since y our last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters evaluated during the 
study  are to be reviewed by  the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change in a pr otocol -specific parameter that is clinically  relevant, 
in the opinion of the I nvestigator , is to be report ed as an AE. These clinically  relevant 
changes will be reported regardless of causality .
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject p rior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period. 
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if ap plicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control articles on the Device Deficiency eCRF . The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study  Sponsor 
immediately  as follows:
ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency  eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns. Refer to the 
MOP  for additional information on product returns.

Page 42of 55
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report, 
Certificate of Death ,etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Ef fect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system beco me non- operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device 
Deficiency Form. The completed form is faxed or emailed to the Study Sponsor at 1 -817-
302-1927 or MSUS.safety @alcon.com according to the timelines outlined above; 
however , the reported information must be entered into the EDC sy stem once it becomes 
operational.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contacted for any  protocol related question and their 
contact information is provided in the Manual of Procedures that accompanies this protocol
(page 1) .
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicable portions of the subject
’s medical records. The 
Investi gator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.

For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as show n below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related  
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possib ility that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor wi ll assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelat ed to related.
11.4 Return Product Analysis
Study Sponsor representatives and their contact information are provided in the MOP  that 
accompanies this protocol.
11.4.1 Alcon Mark eted Product
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the C omplaint # which will be provided by  Study  Sponsor after the 
case is entered in the Study  Sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management Sy stem 
(GPCMS).
11.4.2 Non-Alcon Marketed Product
When study  products include non-Alcon marketed products, and such products are associated 
with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs, in the I nvestigator should report 
complaints directly  to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer’ s instructions or local 
regulatory  requirements, if applicable.
11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y (see Section 9.4 ). If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of 
subject safet y, the Investigator is encouraged to contact an ap propriate Study  Sponsor

representative prior to unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon 
the individual circumstances (ie, medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to 
contact with the Study  Sponsor . The Stud y Sponsor mu st be informed of all cases in which 
the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  
be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting 
requirements .
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects wit h Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock). 
Any additional data received up to 1 month after subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s req uest. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements.
The Investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study  entry  are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy  should be included in the Medical History  section 
of the eCRF when a pregnant woman enters the study  or if a woman becomes pregnant 
during the stud y. Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; howev
er, complications may  be 
reportable and will be decided on a case -by-case basis.
12ANAL YSIS PLAN
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum, as well as confidence inte rvals (CIs) or 
confidence limits where applicable. Categorical variables will be summarized with counts

and percentages from each category . Any deviations to the analy sis plan will be updated 
during the course of the study  as part of a protocol amendment or will be detailed in the 
clinical study  report.
12.1 Subject Evaluability
Final subject evaluability must be determined prior to breaking the code for masked treatment 
sequence assignment and locking the database, based upon the Deviations and Evaluability  
Plan (DEP).
12.2 Analysis Sets
12.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y anal ysis set on a treatment- emergent basis. 
As such, the safety  anal ysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any stud y lenses 
evaluated in this study , except for the lenses used at Visit 1 for the purpose of parameter 
optimization and fitting, as they  are not intended for the assessment of safety . For treatment -
emergent safet y anal yses, subjects/ey es will be categorized under the actual study  lenses 
expo sed in the corresponding lens sequence.
12.2.2 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (F AS) is the set of all randomized subjects who are exposed to any  study  
lenses evaluated in this study , except for the lenses used for optimization and fitting.
12.2.3 Per Protocol Analysis Set
The per protocol (PP) analy sis set is a subset of F AS and excludes all data/subjects that have 
met any  of the critical deviation or evaluability  criteria identified in the DEP .
12.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  lens sequence and overall. 
Counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables such as sex, age group, 
race, and ethnicity . Number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum 
will be presente d for continuous variables such as age.
12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
This study  defines 1 primary ,  
endpoints.  will use the F AS as the primary

analysis set.  
 
 
 
The primary  endpoint of distance VA will be tested at one -sided α=0.05 for noninferiority   
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint (s)
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate noninferiorit y in distance VAwhen 
wearing DDT2 contact lenses compared to Acuvue Moist contact lenses. The primary 
endpoint is distance VA with study  lenses, collected separatel y for each eye in logMAR.
12.4.1.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority :
H0: µ(T) –
µ(C) ≥ 0.05
Ha: µ(T) – µ (C) < 0.05
where µ (T) and µ (C)denote the mean distance V A for DDT2 and Acuvue Moist, respecti vely, 
on the logMAR scale.
12.4.1.2 Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hy potheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by  visit interaction, period, and sequence. Within-
subject correlation due to e ye and the crossover design will also be accounted for in the 
model. L ens dif ference (DDT2 minus Moist) and the corresponding one-sided 95% upper 
confidence limit will be computed. Noninferiorit y in distance V A will be declared if upper 
confidence limit is less than 0.05.

12.5 Handling of Missing Data
All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analy sis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out  
12.6 Safety Analys es
The safet y endpoints are:
AEs
Biomicroscop y findings
Device deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accou nted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular 
and nonocular AEs will be presented by  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
Preferred T erms. AEs leading to study  discontinuation, significant non- serious AEs, and 
SAEs will be identified. Individual subject listings will be provided, as necessary . 
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after sign ing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.
Each biomicroscop y parameter will be tabulated by its grade. For each biomicroscop y 
parameter , counts and percentages of ey es that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from 
baseline (last assessment prior to study  lens exposure) to an y subsequent visit within the 
same period will be presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will include all

increase.
Two listings for device deficiencies, prior to exposure of stud y contact lenses and treatment-
emergent, will be provided. Additionally , each device deficiency  category  will be tabulated. 
No inferential testing will be done for safet y anal ysis.
12.7 Interim Analyses and Reporting
There are no plans to conduct an interim anal ysis and no criteria b y which the study would be 
terminated early  based upon statistical determination.
12.8 Sample Size Justification
Sample size calculation is based on a prior clinical study  (CLE383 -C004) which evaluated 
performance of DDT2 and 3 marketed soft contact lenses, including Acuvue Moist. 
Primary  Effectiveness
To demonstrate noninferiority  (margin = 0.05 in logMAR; ½ line in Snellen) in distance VA 
as a one -tailed hy pothesis with α=0.05, and using a standard deviation of 0.068 for paired 
differences, 80% power can be attained with a sample size of 14 (7 per sequence).

13DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Subject C onfidentiality
The Investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anony mity is maintained throughout the 
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each stud y participant. At the end of the clinical study , the Study  Sponsor will collect a copy  
of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information . All documents submitted 
to the Study  Sponsor will identify  the subje cts exclusively  by number and demographic 
information. No other personally  identify ing information will be transmitted to the Study  
Sponsor .
The Study  Sponsor may  release anony mized study data to external researchers for purposes 
of future research directl y related to the study  objectives, or future research that is bey ond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study  
subjects. Anon ymization means that all identifiable information will be removed from the 
datase t and all links to the subjects in the study  will be removed. Anon ymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality  of the subjects who participate in the study  so that they  cannot 
be identified b y external researchers. The anon ymized data set will conta in records from all 
of the subjects in the current study , but the anonymization process might change the data set 
in some way s, so external researchers will be informed that they  might not be able to 
duplicate some o f the results from this study .
13.2 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Case Report Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the CRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor , 
and all discre pancies shall be appropriately  documented via the query  resolution process. Site
monitors are appointed by the Stud y Sponsor and are independent of stud y site staf f.
If electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in
advance of starting the study . 
At a minimum, source documents include the following information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicit y)
Documentation of subject eligibility
Date of informed consent

It is required that the author of an entry  in the source documents be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical re cords) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that 
the data recorded on the CRF are consistent with the original source data.
Only  designated individuals at the site will complete the CRFs. The CRFs must be completed 
at regular intervals following th e clinical study  visit schedule. I t is expected that all data 
reported have corresponding entries in the source documents. The Principal I nvestigator is 
responsible for reviewing and certify ing that the CRFs are accurate and complete. The onl y 
subject iden tifiers recorded on the CRFs will be subject number , and s ubject demographic 
information.
13.3 Data Review and Clarifications
A review of CRF data to the subject’ s source data will be completed by  the site monitor to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After the CRFs have been completed, additional data 
clarifications and/or additions may  be needed as a result of the data cleaning process. Data 
clarifications are documented and are part of each subject’ s CRF .
13.4 Sponsor and Monitoring Responsibilities
The Study  Sponsor will designate a monitor to conduct the appropriate site visits at the 
appropriate intervals according to the stud y monitoring plan. The clinical investigation will 
be monitored to ensure that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the
reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from the source documents, and the study 
is conducted in compliance with the current approved protocol (and amendments[s], if 
applicable), with current GCP , and with applicable regulatory  requirements.

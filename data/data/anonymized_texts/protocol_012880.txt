produce local analgesia.  Use of intraoperative opioi ds, acetaminophen, ketorolac, or other non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will be permitted in accordance with the study site’s standard of care.  Avoid 
additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following the administration EXPAREL .    
 
There is no required length of stay in the hosp ital; subjects may be discharged based on the medical judgment of 
the treating physician.  For subjects discharged from the hospital before all protocol-specified assessments till 
96 hours are completed, a nurse will perform follow-up visits at the subject’s home to perform the required 
postsurgical assessments and collect PK samples till 96 hours.  
A follow-up phone call will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 7.  For the assessment of adverse events (AEs), a 
final follow-up visit will be made on Day 30 to all subjects who would have received the study drug.   
Postsurgical Pain Management 
Use of postsurgical pain medication in cases of insufficient analgesia will be permitted according to the 
institution’s standard of care.  Th e investigator must record all postsurgical pain management medications 
provided to the subjects till the hospital discharge.  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours 
following the administration EXPAREL.    
 
Postsurgical Assessments 
Postsurgical assessments to be done till 96 hours include pain intensity using the 11-po int Numeric Rating Scale at 
Rest (NRS-R; Appendix 1) for subjects aged 12 to less than 17  years and the Color Analog Scale (CAS; 
Appendix 2) for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years; neurological assessment ( Appendix 3 ); clinical laboratory 
tests (Appendix 4 ); and vital signs.   
 
AEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed/assent is given till Day 30.   
 
In case a cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs during the study, if the 
investigator or medical monitor consid ers that the event may be related to study  treatment or suggests the possible 
occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; with or without the need for tr eatment [e.g., intralipids]), 
or if a plausible etiology for the event cannot be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 
12-lead ECG, vital signs, and clinical lab oratory tests (hematology and complete metabolic profile [CMP]) 
according to the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Section 13.1.7  and Appendix 6 for additional 
information on handling of AESIs. 
 
Cardiac AESIs include chest pain, abnorm al/irregular heart rate, and shortne ss of breath requiring intervention.  
Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altere d mental status/altered sensorium, rigi dity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, 
visual disturbance, and severe or worsening dizziness (s ee below).  Additionally, the following events may be of 
special interest if they persist or oc cur beyond 72 hours post dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, 
and tingling/paresthesia.  Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.  Mild dizziness is defined as mild unsteadiness or 
sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is defined as moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting 
instrumental activities of daily liv ing (ADL); and severe dizziness is defi ned as severe unsteadiness or sensation of 
movement that limits self-care ADLs.  Dizziness will be captu red as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persists

 Cardiac or neurological AEs that do not meet one of these three criteria for AESI should be reported as described 
in Section 14.1 (Adverse Events) and captured in the database as an AE. 
 
Pharmacokinetic Assessment (Part 1 only)  
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws for each individual subject.  On 
Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two PK sampling groups shown below based on surgery type 
(see the table below for PK sample collection schedule).  A total of 8 blood samples will be collected from each 
subject at the specific time windows shown for the determination of bupivacaine plasma concentrations.  Having two separate PK sampling sequences for sp ine and cardiac surgeries will help to  guard against clustering of PK 
samples.

h: hour; min: minutes; PK: pharmacokinetic. 
 
These sampling time points will not only characterize overall PK of bupivacaine from EXPAREL, but will also 
characterize the PK of immediate release bupivacaine and thoroughly characterize the early peak for both 
treatments.  
 Note that a new needle stick may not be necessary for each blood draw.  The subject may be fitted with a 
peripheral venous line at the discretion of the investig ator to facilitate the collection of blood for PK assessment. 
 In the situation where PK blood draws and other assessments  coincide with or occur at about the same time, the 
blood draw for PK analysis must be conducted first, and the pain intensity assessment conducted second, as 
applicable, followed by other assessments. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to m onitor the safety and dosing data on an ongoing basis 
for all treatment groups.   
 
Number of Subjects (Planned): 
Approximately 90 subjects are planned for this study: 45 in Part 1 and 45 in Part 2.  Overall, 60 subjects will 
receive EXPAREL and 30 subjects will receive immediate release bupivacaine. 
Eligibility Criteria: Inclusion Criteria 
1. Subjects whose parent(s) or guardian(s) has/have signed and dated the IC F for the subject to participate in 
the study, and subjects who have provided written assent to participate in the study (if capable).

Pharmacokinetic Analysis (Part 1 only):
A total of 8 blood samples will be collected from each subject at specific time windows for the determination of 
plasma bupivacaine concentrations.  Population PK modeling will be performed using all PK data collected during 
the study.  The population PK model will characterize overall PK of bupivacaine from EXPAREL and will also characterize the PK of immediate release bupivacaine.   
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints (Part 1 only):  
The following PK endpoints will be predicted from the model:  
xArea under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) 
xMaximum plasma concentration (C max) 
xThe apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2el)
xApparent clearance (CL/F) 
xApparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) 
Safety Assessments: The following safety assessments will be  conducted at the time points specified: 
xVital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respirat ory rate, oxygen saturati on, and blood pressure) at 
screening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU); at 2, 
4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; 
and on Day 30. 
xNeurological assessment at screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 h ours after the end of study 
drug administration; at hospital discha rge; and on Day 30 (Part 1 only, see Appendix 3 ).  
xClinical laboratory tests (hem atology, chemistry, and urinalysis) at sc reening; at baseline (on Day 1 prior to 
surgery); and at 96 hours  after the end of stud y drug administration (see Appendix 4 ). 
xAEs from the time the ICF is signe d/assent is obtained till Day 30. 
Safety Endpoints: 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed based on  the safety measurements conducted at the specified time 
points: 
xChange from baseline in vital signs (temperature, res ting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and 
blood pressure). 
xSummary of neurological assessments (proportion of subjects who are oriented, and proportion of subjects 
who have any neurologic events).  Note: Events identified during the neurologic assessment should be 
recorded as AEs. 
xChange from baseline in  clinical laboratory data. 
xIncidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs till Day 30. 
Other Assessments:  The following efficacy measurements will be done for exploratory purposes only:   
xPain intensity scores at screening; at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after  the end of study drug 
administration; immediately prior to each administration of postoper ative opioid pain management medication 
till 96 hours; and at hospital discharge.  If a subject is too anesthetized at the ti me of a scheduled pain intensity

subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, a nd maximum) will be provided for continuous data.  
Tabulations (number and percentage of subjects) by categor y will be provided for categorical data.  This study is 
not powered for efficacy. 
 
A prospective population PK analysis plan will be developed.  Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling will be used to 
analyze the sparse concentration-versus-time data.    
 
Population and individual PK parameters will be estimated.  Individual PK parameters estimated for each subject 
will be used to compute PK exposures (AUC and C max).  All PK parameters will be presented in listings and 
descriptive summary statistics, including the arithmetic mean, median, range, sta ndard deviation, and coefficient of 
variation.  Details and results of this mixed-ef fect modeling analysis will be reported separately. 
 
Sample Size 
The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of EXPAREL in 
pediatric subjects with the precision required by the Food and Drug Administration.

Note: Postsurgical assessments will be conducted at the time points specified after the end of study drug administration.   
In the situation where PK blood draws and other assessments coincide or occur at about the same time, the blood draw for PK analysis must be conducted first, and the pain 
intensity assessment conducted second, as applicable, followed by any other assessments. 
1 ECG abnormalities that are clinically significant should be recorded as AEs.  May also conduct a 12-lead ECG if a subject exp eriences an AESI (i.e., cardiac AE or neurological 
AE), or an SAE; see footnote 7. 2 A baseline 12-lead ECG must be recorded prior to surgery and may be performed either at the screening visit or in the preoper ative holding area on Day 1. 
3 May also conduct clinical laboratory tests if a subjec t experiences an AESI or an SAE; see footnote 7. 
4 Vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure) will be measured after the subject has rested in a supine position for at least 
5 minutes.  May also measure vital signs if a subject experiences an AESI  (i.e., cardiac AE or neurological AE), or an SAE; see  footnote 7. 
5 Pain intensity will be measured using the 11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years ( Appendix 1 ) and CAS for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years 
(Appendix 2).  The preoperative pain intensity assessment should be conducted immediately prior to each administration of postoperative op ioid pain management medication till 
96 hours.  If a subject is too anesthetized at the time of a sche duled pain intensity assessment, the assessment should be skip ped. 
6 Instruct subject to discontinue prohibited medications.  Record date/time of all medications starting at least 30 days prior to study drug administration till 96 hours after study 
drug administration.  Record medications administered  for treatment of an AE till Day 30. 
7 In case a cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs during the study, if the investiga tor or medical monitor considers that the event may 
be related to study treatment or suggests the possible occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; with or without the need for treatment [e.g., intralipids]), or if a 
plausible etiology for the event cannot be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 12-lead ECG, vital sig ns, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and 
complete metabolic profile [CMP]) according to the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Section 13.1.7  and Appendix 6  for additional information on handling of 
AESIs.  Cardiac or neurological events that do not meet one of these three criteria should be reported as described in Section 14.1 .  
Cardiac AESIs include chest pain, abnormal/irregular heart rate, and shortness of breath requiring intervention.  Neurologic AE SIs include seizure, altered mental status/altered 
sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, visual disturbance, and severe or worsening dizziness.  Additionally, the f ollowing events may be of special interest if they persist 
or occur beyond 72 hours post dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and tingling/paresthesia.  Severity of dizzin ess will be assessed based on NCI CTCAE 
(Version 5.0).  Dizziness will be captured as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persist beyond 72 hours post dose (see Section 13.1.7 ).

7. INTRODUCTION
With the identification of acute pain by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a problem of 
global proportions ( Gureje 1998 ) and the publication of the Joint Commission on Accreditation 
of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) pain standards, there is increasing acceptance of pain as the fifth vital sign, on par with blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate (Lynch 2001). 
Postsurgical pain is one of the most common forms of acute pain ( Schug 1993; Carr 1999).  
In contrast to chronic pain, for which no adaptive value has been demonstrated, acute pain is the 
normal physiological response to tissue insult or injury and has adaptive value by serving as a 
warning of danger or damage.  Most acute pain is either treatable or avoidable, especially when it 
occurs in a clinical setting.  However, if acute pain is poorly or inappropriately treated, it may 
progress to chronic pain ( Perkins 2000; Petersen-Felix 2002 ).  Thus, effectively modulating the 
response to acute pain may be considered a primary step in the prevention of chronic pain (Stephen 2003 ).  The suboptimal management of acute pain has been recognized as a problem by 
clinicians for more than 50 years ( Papper 1952; Marks 1973) and has been formally identified as 
a public health concern by various societies and government institutions worldwide.   
In 1992, the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research developed guidelines for the 
management of postoperative pain in the hopes of increasing awareness of the consequences of 
poor pain control in the postoperative setting and promoting better pain management techniques 
(Stephen 2003 ).  These consequences, which include delayed healing, longer hospitalization, and 
the development of chronic pain, are significant not only from the patient’s perspective (decrease in functionality and quality of life) but also from the health economic perspective (increase in 
healthcare resource utilization and costs). 
Each year, more than 5 million children undergo surgery in the US, and it is estimated that up to 
75% of these patients experience significant postoperative pain and receive postoperative 
analgesia ( Owen 1990).  Opioid use is ubiquitous among hospitalized patients undergoing 
surgical procedures ( Kessler 2013 ).  One consequence is a growing epidemic of opioid use, 
misuse, and diversion ( Morris 2015; Joranson 2006 ).  Specific to the pediatric population, 
prescription opioid use before the 12
th grade is a predictor of future opioid misuse, with a 33% 
increase in future risk of misuse after high school ( Miech 2015).  
A multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia, using a combination of agents (e.g., opioids, 
local anesthetics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and delivery techniques 
(patient-controlled analgesia [PCA], epidural and regional blocks) is currently recognized as

CONFIDENTIAL 20 of 58 01-OCT-2018 best practice for pain management ( Breivik 1995a; Breivik 1995b; American Society of 
Anesthesiologists [ASA] Task Force 1995; Dahl 2000).  EXPAREL® was developed to extend 
pain relief with a single-dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters and to 
decrease the requirement for supplemental opioid medications.   
A New Drug Application (NDA) for EXPAREL was submitted as a 505(b)(2) application and 
subsequently approved by the US FDA on October 28, 2011 (NDA 022-496).  As part of the 
approval for EXPAREL, Pacira is required to conduct pediatric studies as a Post Marketing 
Requirement (PMR). 
7.1. Indication
EXPAREL was initially approved by the US FDA in 2011 for single-dose administration into the 
surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.  The indication was amended and approved by the 
US FDA in 2018 to read: “EXPAREL is indicated for single-dose infiltration in adults to 
produce postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus block to produce 
postsurgical regional analgesia.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in other nerve 
blocks.”   
EXPAREL was developed to provide a prolonged period of decreased pain and decreased opioid 
use with a single-dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in patient recovery following surgery, 
as the majority of patients may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.  
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster patient mobilization, 
shortened hospital stays, and reduced healthcare costs (ASA Task Force 1995). 
7.2. Current Therapies/Treatments 
Current modalities of postsurgical analgesic treatment include infiltration and nerve block with 
local anesthetic agents, usually combined with the systemic administration of analgesics 
(multimodal therapy).  Multimodal therapy usually includes opioid medications, NSAIDs, and/or 
acetaminophen provided through a variety of routes including intravenous, transdermal patch, 
and oral administration.  Opioids are widely used and considered amongst the most powerful 
analgesics; however, they also have considerable drawbacks, including time and resources 
required for monitoring opioid-related side effects.  A reduction in the use of postoperative 
opioids is desirable to decrease the incidence and severity of opioid-induced adverse effects, 
such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, pruritus, and urinary retention.   
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postoperative pain is a ubiquitous 
condition among the US population.  While it is a predictable component of the postoperative 
process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life, 
and extend length of stay, thereby increasing hospital expenditures ( Oderda 2007) and reducing

other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like delay in regaining bowel 
function or an inability to tolerate liquid a nd solid oral intake), and conserve healthcare 
resources.  As such, the JCAHO requires that all healthcare facilities practice adequate pain management and monitor opioid-related adverse events (AEs) ( Apfelbaum 2003).
 
Opioid analgesics have long been established to be the most effective agents used for the management of moderate to severe postoperative pain, and are currently considered the mainstay 
of treatment.  However, AEs related to opioid administration (e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus, 
confusion) represent one important reason to develop opioid-sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of 
gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, as well as respiratory depression, 
present major limitations for the widespread use of opioid analgesics ( Chernin 2001 and 
Viscusi 2009 ).
  Furthermore, management of opioid-related events often requires medical 
attention (e.g., opioid antagonists, antiemetic agents) and increased pharmacy/nursing time, 
which may raise healthcare expenses ( Carroll 1994 ).   
7.3. EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) 
Bupivacaine is one of the longer-acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of action after local administration, usually less than 8 hours.  EXPAREL is a bupivacaine 
liposome injectable suspension.  It consists of microscopic spherical, multivesicular liposomes 
(DepoFoam
® drug delivery system), organized in a honeycomb-like structure comprising 
numerous non-concentric internal aqueous chambers containing a bupivacaine base at a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  Each chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by lipid 
membranes.  The lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or 
close analogs of endogenous lipids.  Bupivacaine is slowly released from the DepoFoam 
particles by a complex mechanism involving reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and 
subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time.  EXPAREL has been noted in 
infiltration studies to have a bimodal curve ( Apseloff 2013 ), with an initial peak occurring at 
approximately 0 to 2 hours and a second peak at approximately 24 to 48 hours ( Hu 2013).  
7.4. Summary of Human Clinical Experience with EXPAREL 
The EXPAREL clinical development program assessed the efficacy and safety across a wide range of body regions and applications, investigating its use in the management of acute pain 
when administered as a peripheral nerve block for regional analgesia, and as a field block for local analgesia.  Pacira has conducted 31 clinical studies (13 Phase 1, 7 Phase 2, and 11 Phase 3).  
Across the 31 completed studies in the clinical program, safety data were collected on 
3644 subjects (2141 subjects received EXPAREL, 850 subjects received IR bupivacaine alone, 
and 653 subjects received placebo). 
Across these studies, a total of 2141 adult human subjects received EXPAREL at doses ranging 
from 9 to 665 mg and by various routes, including field block, peripheral nerve block, 
subcutaneous, and epidural routes of administration.  EXPAREL was well tolerated and had a

nerve block in varying degrees of vascularity in subjects undergoing various surgical procedures.  
The frequency and types of events are consistent with the profile of other local anaesthetics.  
At doses up to 665 mg of EXPAREL, no central nervous system or cardiovascular system AEs 
observed with high doses of bupivacaine HCl solution have been observed with 
EXPAREL.  Two thorough QTc studies have been conducted; EXPAREL did not cause 
significant QTc prolongation even at the highest dose evaluated.   
Across all studies, the types and the incidence rates of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were 
similar between the EXPAREL All Doses group (all doses combined) and the bupivacaine HCl 
group.  The incidence rate for each of the three most common TEAEs (nausea, constipation, and 
vomiting) was lower in the EXPAREL All Doses group than in the bupivacaine HCl group.   
In terms of efficacy, three positive Phase 3 studies (402-C-316, 402-C-317, 402-C-331) 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain intensity scores compared to placebo 
or bupivacaine HCl in the postoperative period when administered as a field block (infiltration).  
All three studies also showed a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo or 
bupivacaine in total opioid consumption; Studies 316, 317 and 331 additionally show a 
significantly higher percentage of opioid-free patients and a significantly longer time to first 
opioid use compared to placebo or IR bupivacaine. 
EXPAREL was demonstrated to produce statis tically significant and clinically meaningful 
analgesia in adult patients in two pivotal placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (317 and 316) 
involving both orthopedic and soft tissue procedures over 36 and 72 hours, respectively.  The 
primary endpoints (area under the curve [AUC] of the numeric rating scale at rest [NRS-R] pain 
intensity scores till 72 hours [316] and till 24 hours [317]) were met.  Key secondary endpoints 
(percentage of subjects who received no supplementary opioid medication; total amount of postoperative consumption of opioid medication; and time to first use of opioid medication) were 
also met, demonstrating prolonged analgesia and reduction of opioid use by various measures.  
Robust nature of the efficacy results in both pivotal studies, 316 and 317, was demonstrated 
across subgroups of subjects with various prognostic features and across demographic 
subgroups.   
Study 331 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 
EXPAREL in adult subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spinal anesthesia to 
investigate pain control and total opioid consumption following a field block.  Study 331 
compared EXPAREL 266 mg admixed with bupivacaine HCl 100 mg to an active comparator of 
bupivacaine HCl 100 mg alone.  Seventy (70) subjects treated with EXPAREL+ bupivacaine and 
69 subjects treated with bupivacaine alone were analyzed.  The co-primary efficacy endpoints 
were the AUC of VAS from 12 to 48 hours and the total opioid consumption (in oral morphine 
equivalents) from 0 to 48 hours.  The cumulative pain intensity in the EXPAREL + bupivacaine 
group (Mean AUC
12-48 = 180.8) was statistically significantly lower than the bupivacaine alone 
group (mean AUC 12-48 = 209.3), so the first co-primary efficacy endpoint was met (P = 0.0381).

CONFIDENTIAL 23 of 58 01-OCT-2018 The LS geometric mean total opioid consumption from 0 to 48 hours after surgery was 
statistically significantly lower in the EXPAREL + bupivacaine group than the bupivacaine alone 
group, so the second co-primary efficacy endpoint was met (16.7 mg vs 84.0 mg; P = 0.0029).  
In addition, EXPAREL was associated with a higher proportion of subjects who were opioid free 
through 72 hours (10% vs 0%; P < 0.01) and also significantly prolonged the time to first opioid 
rescue (median 4.1 hours vs 2.9 hours; P = 0.023) compared to bupivacaine HCl. 
An analysis was performed to compare the incidence of opioid-related AEs between the 
EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl groups in all bupivacaine-controlled, parallel-group infiltration 
studies in adults (SIMPLE TKA [total knee arthroplasty] 311, SKY0402-C-208, SIMPLE 
Hemorrhoidectomy 312, SKY0402-C-209, SKY0402-C-207, SKY0402-C-201, and SIMPLE 
Breast Augmentation 315).  There was a statistically significantly lower incidence of 
opioid-related AEs in the EXPAREL ≤266 mg group compared to the bupivacaine HCl group till 
72 hours post dose.  This was consistent with the statistically significantly lower total postoperative consumption of opioids in the EXPAREL ≤266 mg group till 72 hours post dose.  
Fewer subjects in the EXPAREL ≤266 mg group had at least one opioid-related AE compared to 
the bupivacaine HCl group (25.6% versus 45.6%; p<0.0001).  The total opioid medication 
administered (adjusted geometric mean) till 72 hours post dose was statistically significantly 
lower in the EXPAREL ≤266 mg group (7.94 mg) compared to the bupivacaine HCl group 
(15.84 mg); p<0.0001.  The EXPAREL >266 mg group did not show a statistically significant advantage favoring EXPAREL; the mean (standard deviation [SD]) of the average number of 
opioid-related AEs per subject was 0.58 (0.522), and the total opioid medication administered 
(adjusted geometric mean) till 72 hours post dose was 22.82 mg in the EXPAREL >266 mg 
group.

7.5. Postmarketing Exposure in Adults and Children 
As of May-2018, more than 4 million patients have received EXPAREL in the postmarketing 
setting.  While EXPAREL is not approved for use in patients less than 18 years of age, there is 
evidence that it has been widely used off-label in pediatric cases. 
The Premier PerspectiveTM Database (PPD) is the largest inpatient drug utilization database in 
the US and contains de-identified hospital chargemaster data from approximately 600 hospitals, 
which accounts for approximately 15% of all hospitalizations nationwide ( McDonald 2013 ).  
Recent inquiries into the PPD between 01-Jan-2011 and 31-Mar- 2017 found that it contains data for 2461 patients aged less than 18 years who had been exposed to EXPAREL in both inpatient 
and outpatient settings, including 1796 patients between 6 and <17 years of age.

CONFIDENTIAL 24 of 58 01-OCT-2018 In addition, The Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio) currently uses EXPAREL off-label as part 
of its postsurgical multimodal analgesia for patients under the age of 18 years across several 
surgical procedures.  A retrospective chart analysis is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
profile and clinical benefit of EXPAREL in this setting.

participation.  After the ICF is signed by the subject’s legal guardian and written assent is 
provided by the subject (if capable), medical history, surgical history, physical examination, 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, neurological assessment, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), pain intensity score, urine pregnancy 
test for females of childbearing potential, urine drug screen and alcohol breath test will be 
conducted. 
On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive the study drug intraoperatively at the end of surgery via 
local infiltration to produce local analgesia.  Use of intraoperative opioids, acetaminophen, 
ketorolac, or other NSAIDs, will be permitted in accordance with the study site’s standard of 
care.  
Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following the administration EXPAREL. 
There is no required length of stay in the hospital; subjects may be discharged based on the 
medical judgment of the treating physician.  For subjects discharged from the hospital before all 
protocol-specified assessments till 96 hours are completed, a nurse will perform follow-up visits 
at the subject’s home to perform the required postsurgical assessments and collect PK samples 
till 96 hours. 
A follow-up phone call will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 7.  For the assessment of AEs, a 
final follow-up visit will be made on Day 30 to all subjects who would have received the study 
drug.  
Postsurgical Pain Management 
Use of postsurgical pain medication in cases of insufficient analgesia will be permitted according 
to the institution’s standard of care.  The investigator must record all postsurgical pain management medications provided to the subjects till the hospital discharge.  
Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 96 hours following the administration 
EXPAREL.  
Postsurgical Assessments 
Postsurgical assessments to be conducted till 96 hours include pain intensity using the 11-point 
NRS-R (Appendix 1) for subjects aged 12 to less than years and the Color Analog Scale (CAS; 
Appendix 2) for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years; neurological assessment ( Appendix 3); 
clinical laboratory tests ( Appendix 4); and vital signs.   
AEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed/assent is given till Day 30.   
In case a cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs 
during the study, if the investigator or medical monitor considers that the event may be related to 
study treatment or suggests the possible occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST;

CONFIDENTIAL 27 of 58 01-OCT-2018 with or without the need for treatment [e.g., intralipids]), or if a plausible etiology for the event 
cannot be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 12-lead ECG, vital 
signs, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and complete metabolic profile [CMP]) 
according to the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Section 13.1.7 and 
Appendix 6 for additional information on handling of AESIs.  Cardiac or neurological AEs that do not meet one of these three criteria for AESI should be reported as described in Section 14.1 
and captured in the database as an AE. 
Cardiac AESIs include chest pain, abnormal/irregular heart rate, and shortness of breath 
requiring intervention.  Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altered mental status/altered 
sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, visual disturbance, and severe or worsening 
dizziness (see below).  Additionally, the following events may be of special interest if they 
persist or occur beyond 72 hours post dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.  Mild dizziness 
is defined as mild unsteadiness or sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is defined as 
moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting instrumental activities of daily living 
(ADL); and severe dizziness is defined as severe unsteadiness or sensation of movement that 
limits self-care ADLs.  Dizziness will be captured as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persist 
beyond 72 hours post dose.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessment (Part 1 only) 
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws for each 
individual subject.  On Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two PK sampling 
groups shown below based on surgery type (Table 2).  A total of 8 blood samples will be collected from each subject at the specific time windows shown for the determination of 
bupivacaine plasma concentrations.  Having two PK sampling sequences for spine and cardiac 
surgeries will help to guard against clustering of PK samples.

CONFIDENTIAL 28 of 58 01-OCT-2018 Note that a new needle stick may not be necessary for each blood draw.  The subject may be 
fitted with a peripheral venous line at the discretion of the investigator to facilitate the collection 
of blood for PK assessment. 
In the situation where PK blood draws and other assessments coincide or occur at about the same 
time, the blood draw for PK analysis must be conducted first, and the pain intensity assessment 
conducted second, as applicable, followed by other assessments. 
9.2. Duration of the Study and Subject Participation 
Participation will begin at the signing of the ICF/obtaining written assent.  No more than 30 days 
should pass between signing of the ICF/obtaining written assent and the administration of study 
drug.  The time from study drug administration till the end of participation is 30 ± 3 days.  
Therefore, subjects may participate in the study for up to 63 days. 
9.3. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
If Pacira, the investigator, or officials from regulatory authorities discover conditions during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken 
after Pacira has consulted with appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the investigator(s).  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to monitor the safety and dosing data on 
an ongoing basis for all treatment groups, with additional expedited DSMB review conducted as 
necessary.   
9.4. Discussion of Study Design 
This study is designed to formulate specific guidance regarding dose for the safe administration 
of EXPAREL  in the pediatric population aged 6 to less than 17 years.  EXPAREL  doses 
recommended for adults are expressed as absolute values or ranges, whereas doses for pediatric subjects will be based on body weight, consistent with general prescription standards used in pediatric practice.  
A population PK modeling of the infiltration studies in adults and simulations to support 
child/adolescent dosing was performed.  Predicted values generated by the final model 
adequately described observed bupivacaine concentrations following administration of 
EXPAREL.  According to this model, a dose of 4 mg/kg would produce bupivacaine 
concentrations in pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 17 years analogous to those observed in 
the adult infiltration studies.  
In addition, the available data from The Cleveland Clinic (as discussed in Section 7.5 ) shows that 
the average dose among 375 pediatric patients was 4.1 ± 1.8 mg/kg, with no significant AEs 
attributed to EXPAREL use.  This study is designed to further characterize the PK profile and to 
confirm the safety of the 4 mg/kg dose of EXPAREL. 
A population PK sampling scheme will be used to limit the number of blood draws.  A total of 
8 blood samples will be collected from each subject at the specific post-dose time windows 
shown in Table 2 for the determination of bupivacaine plasma concentrations.

investigator, indicates an increased vulnerability to study drugs and/or procedures. 
8. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives of 
such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or 
planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the 
subject’s participation in this study. 
In addition, the subject will be ineligible to receive study drug if he or she meets the following criterion during surgery:  
9. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery 
(e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or 
complicate the subject’s postoperative
 course.  
10.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment 
Every reasonable effort should be made to maintain subject compliance and participation in the 
study.  Subjects who withdraw from the study after receiving study drug should undergo safety 
assessments till the end of the study (Day 30).   
If a subject who withdraws from the study has an ongoing AE, every effort must be made to 
follow such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained, or further follow-up is otherwise no 
longer warranted.  
10.3.1.Withdrawal Secondary to Adverse Events 
If a subject experiences an AE that renders him or her incapable of continuing with the 
remaining study assessments, then he or she will be discontinued from further participation in the 
study.  A final evaluation visit should be performed so that the subject’s study participation can 
be terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  Otherwise, the subject’s parent or guardian will be 
instructed to notify the study personnel of any abnormalities during the intervals between study 
visits and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed and the urgency of the 
situation permits.  Any subject exhibiting undesirable AEs will receive appropriate treatment at 
the discretion of the investigator.   
This study involves a single administration of the study drug; therefore, subjects should not be 
terminated from the ongoing study assessments as long as they are willing and able to continue 
with the follow-up schedule according to the protocol.  For emergencies and other unscheduled 
visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records will be obtained by the 
investigator. 
10.3.2.Voluntary or Study Investigator Withdrawal 
Subjects (or their parent or guardian) are free to discontinue participation in the study at any 
time, without prejudice to future treatment.  Nevertheless, subjects will be encouraged to 
complete at least the study safety assessments.  In addition, a subject may be discontinued from

the study will be recorded. 
If a subject is discontinued by the investigator or voluntarily withdraws from the study after 
receiving study drug, the subject will be asked to complete a final evaluation so that he or she 
can be withdrawn in a safe and orderly manner.  In the final evaluation, vital signs (temperature, 
resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure) and any changes in the 
subject's health status will be recorded.   
After termination from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring of 
AEs till Day 30.   
11. TREATMENTS 
11.1. Treatments to be Administered 
Study Drug 
Dosing of EXPAREL for this study will be based on body weight, with a starting dose of 
4 mg/kg.  This weight-based dosing applies to Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. 
The study drug will be administered prior to wound closure.  The investigator must document the 
size of the incision.  Each infiltration site should be spaced 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart and approximately 
1 to 1.5 mL should be delivered into both deep and superficial areas.  Following infiltration, the 
tissue should visibly expand with minimal leakage.   
All eligible subjects will receive a single dose of EXPAREL intraoperatively at the end of 
surgery via local infiltration into the surgical site.  EXPAREL can be administered as is or may 
be expanded with normal (0.9%) saline to increase the volume up to a final concentration of 
0.89 mg/mL (i.e., 1:14 dilution by volume).  The total volume of expansion will be dependent on 
the incision length.  Details regarding the expansion of EXPAREL are provided in the Study 
Drug Infiltration Guide. 
Total Volume of Expansion  
The investigator must document the total volume used for each surgery. 
xEXPAREL 4 mg/kg + normal saline (20–60 mL based on the incision size) = total 
volume. 
For example: If the infiltration sites are 1.5 cm apart, then a 10 cm incision would be 
10 × 2 sides × 3 layers = 60 cm.  If there is 1 mL infiltrated every 1.5 cm, the total 
volume would be 40 mL. 
In Part 1, all eligible subjects will receive a single dose of EXPAREL intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration.  EXPAREL can be administered as is or expanded to increase 
volume up to a final concentration of 0.89 mg/mL (i.e., 1:14 dilution by volume) with normal

CONFIDENTIAL 32 of 58 01-OCT-2018 saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution).  The total volume of expansion will be dependent on the 
size of the wound.   
In Part 2, all eligible subjects randomized to EXPAREL will receive a single dose of EXPAREL 
intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration.  Dosing will be informed by the 
results of Part 1 and any recommendations based on the complete safety review. 
Subjects randomized to the active control group will receive bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg, with a 
maximum dose of 175 mg. 
Postsurgical Pain Management 
The use of postsurgical pain medication in cases of insufficient analgesia is permitted according 
to the institution’s standard of care.  The investigator must record all pain management 
medications administered during hospitalization.  Avoid additional use of local anesthetics 
within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL    
11.2. Administration Instructions/Procedures 
All injections must be performed with an infiltrative moving needle technique, with frequent 
aspirations to reduce the chance for accidental intravascular injection.  If an aspiration draws 
blood, the needle must be moved and placed in a different location until the aspiration is negative.  The study drug should be infiltrated in small increments into both deep and superficial 
layers to ensure uniform distribution along the entire length of the surgical wound. 
11.2.1. Study Drug Administration Considerations 
As there is a potential risk of severe adverse effects associated with the administration of local 
anesthetics, the study site must be equipped to treat subjects with evidence of cardiac toxicity.   
EXPAREL may not be administered to a subject if the vial has been open for more than 4 hours.  
In order to prevent the study drug from settling, gently inverting and re-inverting the syringe 
several times prior to administration is recommended.  No agents should be admixed with 
EXPAREL.  
11.3. Identity of Investigational Products 
11.3.1.Description of EXPAREL 
EXPAREL is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white, preservative-free, 
homogeneous suspension of bupivacaine encapsulated into multivesicular lipid-based particles 
(the DepoFoam drug delivery system).   
Bupivacaine is present at a nominal concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  EXPAREL will be provided 
in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.   
EXPAREL vials should be stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F).

CONFIDENTIAL 33 of 58 01-OCT-2018 11.3.2.Description of Reference Product 
The reference product will be bupivacaine HCl.  All information on the drug administered, dose, 
frequency, and duration will be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
11.3.3.Description of Diluents 
Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) for injection will be used for the expansion of 
study drug.   
11.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
11.4.1. Randomization Scheme 
Approximately 90 subjects are planned for this study: 45 in Part 1 and 45 in Part 2.  The 
randomization code will be generated by a centralized randomization system, which will also be 
used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites.  All randomized subjects will have 
both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier.  No subject or random code 
identifiers will be reused once assigned.  
11.4.2.Randomization Procedures for Treatment Assignment 
Once a subject is identified as being qualified to participate in the study (see Section 10 ), and is 
at the study site for surgery, the authorized site staff or designee will obtain a randomization 
assignment.  The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study treatment 
assignment is received. 
11.4.3. Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug may be replaced.  
Once assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who 
withdraw will be assigned a unique subject number. 
11.5. Selection of Doses in the Study 
The dose of EXPAREL  (4 mg/kg) was selected to provide similar exposure in pediatric subjects 
as was seen in adults.  A Population PK model was developed using all data obtained from the infiltration studies in adult subjects (SKY0402-C-201, SKY0402-C-208, SKY0402-C-316, 
SKY0402-C-317, and SKY0402-C-401).  Simulations from this model were performed to 
predict bupivacaine plasma concentrations in pediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 17 years.  The 
dose of EXPAREL
 administered will not exceed 266 mg, regardless of the weight of the subject. 
The selection of the 4 mg/kg dose is also supported by real world evidence collected at the Cleveland Clinic, where 375 pediatric patients have received EXPAREL at a mean dose of 
4.1 ± 1.8 mg/kg, with no significant AEs attributed to EXPAREL use. 
11.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy and Medications
All medications taken within 30 days prior to study drug administration till Day 30 after study drug administration or until the subject is withdrawn from the study, whichever is sooner, will be

Any shipment of EXPAREL for the study will contain an investigational drug transmittal and 
receipt form to assist the investigator or designee (e.g., pharmacist) in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records.  At a minimum, th e pharmacist or designee will maintain accurate 
records demonstrating dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom drug was administered, and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately.  The investigator 
must retain vials containing used, unused, or expired EXPAREL for return or destruction, as 
instructed by Pacira, following confirmation of drug accountability data by an unblinded study 
monitor.  A record of drug return or destruction will be maintained and provided to Pacira.  
Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the unblinded study monitor and 
appropriate regulatory authorities at any time.  A copy of the inventory records, drug 
accountability information, and notice of return or destruction will be returned to Pacira at the 
end of the study.  Only authorized personnel identified by the investigator will have the ability to 
access and administer the drug. 
12. STUDY ENDPOINTS AND MEASUREMENTS

13. STUDY PROCEDURES 
A time and events schedule for study procedures is provided in Table 1.  PK Sampling times are 
provided in Table 2.   
13.1. Instructions for Conducting Procedures and Measures 
All post-dose assessments will be timed from the end of study drug administration. 
Day 1 is defined as the day on which study drug is administered.  The beginning of surgery is 
defined as the time of the first incision.  The end of surgery is defined as the time of the last 
suture/staple.  Postsurgical is defined as after the end of surgery.  
13.1.1. Pain Intensity Assessment 
Pain intensity will be assessed using age-specific tools at screening; at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 
72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; immediately prior to each 
administration of postoperative opioid pain management medication  till 96 hours; and at hospital 
discharge.  Pain intensity scores will be collected using the following instruments: 
x11-point NRS-R for subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years ( Appendix 1) 
xCAS for subjects aged 6 to less than 12 years ( Appendix 2 ) 
13.1.2.Neurological Examination 
A neurological assessment will be conducted during Part 1 only at the following time points: at 
screening; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.  The examination will include the subject's 
orientation.  Additionally, subjects aged 6 years or older will be asked whether he or she is 
experiencing any numbness of the lips, the tongue, or around the mouth; hearing problems; or 
muscle twitching (see Appendix 3).  If the subject answers "yes" to any of these questions, the 
event should be recorded as an AE and additional safety procedures should be conducted as appropriate (see Section 13.1.7).    
13.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The scheduled clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be conducted 
at screening; baseline (on Day 1 prior to surgery); and at 96 hours after the end of study drug 
administration (see Appendix 4).  Clinical laboratory tests, as appropriate, may also be conducted 
if a subject experiences an AESI, or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7).

CONFIDENTIAL 38 of 58 01-OCT-2018 13.1.4. Vital Signs 
The scheduled vital signs (temperature, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, 
and blood pressure) will be measured after the subject has rested in a supine position for at least 
5 minutes at screening; upon arrival at the PACU; at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours 
after the end of study drug administration; at hospital discharge; and on Day 30.  Vital signs may 
also be measured if a subject experiences an AESI or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7).  The subject 
will remain in a supine position during the assessment. 
13.1.5.Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be conducted at screening.  Superficial abnormalities that may 
interfere with participation in the study will be noted.  A follow-up physical examination will be 
conducted on Day 30 and will include examination of the surgical site.   
13.1.6.Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening or on Day 1 before surgery.  A 12-lead ECG 
according to the study site’s standard of care may also be conducted if a subject experiences an 
AESI or an SAE (see Section 13.1.7 ).   
13.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
All AEs will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed/assent is given till Day 30.  In case a 
cardiac or neurological AE of special interest (AESI) or serious AE (SAE) occurs during the 
study, if the investigator or medical monitor considers that the event may be related to study 
treatment or suggests the possible occurrence of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST; with 
or without the need for treatment [e.g., intralipids]), or if a plausible etiology for the event cannot 
be found, an unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected and a 12-lead ECG, vital signs, 
and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and complete metabolic profile [CMP]) according to 
the study site’s standard of care may be conducted.  See Appendix 6 for additional information 
on handling of AESIs.  
Cardiac AESIs include chest pain, abnormal/irregular heart rate, and shortness of breath 
requiring intervention.  Neurologic AESIs include seizure, altered mental status/altered 
sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, tremors, tinnitus, visual disturbance, and severe or worsening 
dizziness (see below).  Additionally, the following events may be of special interest if they 
persist or occur beyond 72 hours post dose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Dizziness will be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe based on the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0.  
Mild dizziness is defined as mild unsteadiness or sensation of movement; moderate dizziness is 
defined as moderate unsteadiness or sensation of movement limiting instrumental ADL; and 
severe dizziness is defined as severe unsteadines s or sensation of movement that limits self-care 
ADLs.  Dizziness will be captured as an AESI if it is severe or worsens or persist beyond 72 hours post dose.

14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Consistent with the current regulatory guidance provided by the US FDA CFR Part 312 and the 
ICH GCP, AE and SAE are defined in Section 14.1.1 and Section 14.2.1, respectively.   
The concepts of AEs and SAEs represent regulatory instruments used to evaluate and monitor the safety of clinical study subjects.  Therefore, these terms only apply in light of their regulatory definition.  The term serious, in a regulatory sense, does not necessarily mean severe.  The SAE 
concept is used primarily to identify, during the conduct of the study, those SAEs that may 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
See Section 13.1.7 for a description of AESIs. 
14.1. Adverse Events
14.1.1. Definitions
Adverse Event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use in combination with 
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.  AEs 
include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.  The AE may 
involve any organ or system and can be represented by the new onset or deterioration of a 
disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by findings and results of instrumental examinations and laboratory tests.  Any medically relevant and untoward change 
after the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating condition 
(e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 43 of 58 01-OCT-2018 An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is 
identified as a pre-treatment AE (PTAE).  An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a TEAE.   
Adverse Reaction: Any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected 
adverse reactions for which there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
"reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event. 
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs), with an 
onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur till Day 30 
must be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to the study drug.  
Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest possible level 
of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as individual signs or 
symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE case report form (CRF); for 
example, an AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of 
nausea and the event of vomiting.  If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on 
the AE CRF, the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (removed; i.e., lined 
through and initialed).  Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia). 
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity should be recorded as one AE.  The highest 
grade of severity experienced by that subject during the course of the continuous AE should be 
recorded. 
Any condition noted before the subject signs the ICF will be listed as medical history and is 
considered a pre-existing condition.  If a pre-existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration, 
it is considered an AE.  Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition (e.g., new high 
blood pressure medication) does not necessarily indicate an AE. 
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with subject due to an AE, and the 
outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable.

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 44 of 58 01-OCT-2018 14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events 
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities. 
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday activities. 
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities. 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
14.1.4.Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
The investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case-by-case basis.  General guidelines for determining the causality of an AE 
to the study drug are provided below: 
Unrelated: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be easily ruled out 
(e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological 
mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause). 
Unlikely:  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug administration which 
makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals, or 
underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. 
Possible: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Probable: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Definite:  The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the substance class, and 
the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if applicable, after rechallenge, and/or 
specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the 
occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists. 
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events 
The investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a 
case-by-case basis.  General guidelines are provided below: 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 45 of 58 01-OCT-2018 Recovered/Resolved: The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE. 
Recovered/Resolved 
with Sequelae: The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition 
as a result of the AE. 
Not Recovered/ 
Not Resolved: At the time of the last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an undetermined outcome.  Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered 
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving: At the time of the last assessment, the event was decreasing in 
frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected. 
Fatal: The AE directly caused death. 
Unknown: There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’s records to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was 
lost to follow-up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Because of an Adverse Event 
The investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic 
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
xNone. 
xMedication. 
xNon-pharmaceutical therapy.  (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the CRF.) 
xDiscontinued from study. 
xOther.  (The specific action taken must be recorded in the CRF.) 
14.2. Serious Adverse Events 
14.2.1.Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in 
the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
xDeath1 
xA life-threatening adverse event2 
xInpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization3 
xA persistent or significant incapacity4 
xCongenital anomaly/birth defect 
xMedically significant5 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 46 of 58 01-OCT-2018 1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE.  However, death, 
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome.  The cause of death is the AE.  Therefore, the 
investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects 
who die during the study.  If, despite all efforts, the cause of death remains unknown, the AE 
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.” 
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3Hospitalization : It should be noted that hospitalization, in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospitalization that becomes “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care.  Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospitalizations for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study.  However, 
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospital (i.e., prolonged 
hospitalization) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medically significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2.2.Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through Day 30, 
whether or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by the investigator or designee to Pacira 
Drug Safety within 24 hours of discovery by either email ( drugsafety@pacira.com ) or fax 
(973-201-0649).  In addition, the investigator or designee is encouraged to contact the medical monitor to discuss the case, as needed.   
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE.  The fax or email report should be 
followed by a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE 
in question.  Where applicable, information from relevant hospital records and autopsy reports 
should be obtained and all subject-identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira.  
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, any required follow-up must be provided to Pacira 
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the 
condition stabilizes and further follow-up is not warranted. 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  402-C-319 (Pediatric Infiltration) 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 47 of 58 01-OCT-2018 If the investigator is made aware of any SAEs after Day 30, these should also be reported to 
Pacira Drug Safety or designee, provided the SAE is considered related to EXPAREL.  The site 
would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.  
15. STATISTICAL METHODS 
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study.   
15.1. Study Hypothesis 
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. 
15.2. Study Endpoints  
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Pharmacokinetic 
Endpoints), Section 12.4 (Safety Endpoints), and Section 12.6 (Other Endpoints). 
15.3. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK profile of 
EXPAREL in pediatric subjects with the precision required by the FDA. 
15.4. Analysis Populations 
The following study populations are planned:  
xThe PK population will consist of all subjects who receive study drug and provide at least one quantifiable plasma concentration.  
xThe safety population will consist of all subjects who underwent the planned surgery and received study treatment.   
15.5. Handling Subject Dropouts and Discontinuations 
Subjects who discontinue after dosing will not be replaced. 
15.6. Statistical Analyses 
Continuously valued data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n [number of subjects 
contributing data], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  Discretely valued data will be tabulated (n and percentage) by category.  The denominator for all percentages will be the 
number of subjects who underwent the planned surgery. 
15.6.1.Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate. 
15.6.2.Efficacy Analyses 
Pain intensity scores will be summarized by time point.

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol 
 
   
CONFIDENTIAL 48 of 58 01-OCT-2018 Area under the pain scale versus time curve will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule and 
summarized. 
15.6.3.Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A prospective population PK analysis plan will be developed.  Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling 
with NONMEM® software ( Beal 2011 ) will be used to analyze the sparse 
concentration-versus-time data.  Population and individual PK parameters will be estimated.  Individual PK parameters estimated for each subject will be used to compute PK exposures 
(AUC and C
max).  PK parameters will be presented in listings and descriptive summary statistics, 
including the arithmetic mean, median, range, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.  Details and results of this mixed-effects modeling analysis will be reported separately. 
15.6.4. Safety Analyses 
The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Subjects 
reporting the same AE more than once will be counted only once within each tabulation category 
for that AE. 
15.7. Significance Testing 
Not applicable.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND STUDY SYNOPSIS  73 
 74 
1.1 Background Information 75 
1.1.1 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications and Public Health Impact  76 
The age -adjusted incidence of diabetes mellitus in the United States has reportedly doubled in 77 
recent history.1 Estimates suggest that by the year 2035, approximately 592 million individuals 78 
worldwide will be affected by this chronic disease.2 The increasing global epidemic of diabetes 79 
implie s an increase in rates of associated vascular complications from diabetes. At present at 80 
least 5 million people over the age of 40 in the United States are estimated to have diabetic 81 
retinopathy (DR) in the absence of diabetic macular edema (DME), and an additional 800,000 82 
have DME, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control.3 Despite advances in 83 
diagnosis and management of ocular disease in patients with diabetes, eye complications from 84 
diabetes mellitus continue to be a leading cause of vision loss and new onset blindness in 85 
working-age individuals throughout the United States.4, 5 86 
 87 
1.1.2 DME and Its Treatment  88 
DME is manifestation of diab etic retinopathy that produces loss of central vision.  DME is 89 
currently a leading cause of moderate vision loss in patients with diabetes.6  Without 90 
intervention, 33% of 221 eyes in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) with 91 
center -involved DME (CI- DME) experienced “moderate visual loss” (defined as a 15 or more 92 
letter score decrease in visual acuity) over a 3 year period.7  The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical 93 
Research Network ( DRCR.net ) study “Intravitreal Ranibizumab or Triamcinolone Acetonide in 94 
Combination with Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Macular Edema” (Protocol I) indicated 95 
that treatment for DME with intravitreous anti- VEGF ther apy (0.5 mg ranibizumab) with prompt 96 
or deferred focal/grid laser provides visual acuity outcomes at 1 year and 2 years that are 97 
superior to focal/grid laser alone or focal/grid laser combined with intravitreous corticosteroids.8  98 
Results of that study provided definitive confirmation of the important role of vascular 99 
endothelial growth factor (V EGF ) in DME and the superiority of anti-VEGF agents in the 100 
treatment of DME.  Additional phase 3 studies have since confirmed the superiority of anti- 101 
VEGF agents to manage DME.9-11 102 
 103 
1.1.3 Rationale for Comparing Aflibercept to Bevacizumab + Deferred Aflibercept  104 
Three anti -VEGF agents, aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab, have been shown to be 105 
effective for treatment of d iabetic macular edema.  Based on results from DRCR.net Protocol T, 106 
when visual acuity loss is relatively mild, there are not meaningful differences in visual acuity 107 
outcomes, on average, among the three agents.  However, at worse levels of visual acuity, 108 
aflibercept is more effective at improving vision than the other 2 agents at 1 year and more 109 
effective at improving vision than bevacizumab at 2 years. There are considerable cost 110 
differences among aflibercept ($1961/dose), bevacizumab (current Medicare all owable charge: 111 
$67/dose), and 0.3-mg ranibizumab ($1189/dose).   112 
 113 In Protocol T, although a flibercept treatment in P rotocol T resulted in better visual acuity 114 
outcomes for eyes with worse levels of visual acuity, bevacizumab was effective for many eyes 115 
and a cost -effectiveness analysis showed that bevacizumab was more cost effective than 116 
aflibercept.
12  The cost difference between aflibercept and bevacizumab might limit availability 117 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       1-2 of aflibercept for some patients.  According to the 2016 ASRS PAT Survey, approximately 50% 118 
of United States  retinal specialist indicated that insurance requires use of bevacizumab as the 119 
first line treatment for at least some  of their patients.  In the subgroup of Protocol T eyes with 120 
baseline visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, 60% of bevacizumab treated eyes had a 10 or more 121 
letter improvement and 41% had a 15 or more letter improvement at 1 year. At 2 years, 66% of 122 
eyes with w orse baseline visual acuity had a 10 or more letter improvement and 52% had a 15 or 123 
more letter improvement.13 Thus, many eyes initially treated with bevacizumab for DME might 124 
gain enough vision with bevacizumab therapy that they might not derive greater benefit if given 125 
another anti-VEGF agent such as aflibercept.  Many clinicians initiate treatment with 126 
bevacizumab for patients with decreased visual acuity from DME (61% of PAT Survey 127 
respondents start with bevacizumab for decreased visual acuity from DME).  However, there is 128 
no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy of switching treatment from bevacizumab to 129 
aflibercept among eyes not improving is as effective at improving vision as  initiating treatment 130 
with aflibercept.  It is unknown if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual 131 
acuity compared with starting with aflibercept.   132 
 133 
Given this, a study assessing a switch from bevacizumab to aflibercept only in cases in which 134 
bevacizumab was not judged to be successful is perceived to be of great public health interest.   135 
   136 1.1.4 Summary of Previous Research  of Switching Anti -VEGF Agents   137 
Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME.  In 138 
eyes with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also 139 
shown to be successful in many eyes.  However, aflibercept was shown to be m ore effective at 140 
improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years.  Due to the large cost difference between 141 
the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab 142 
and then switch to aflibercept depending on t he eye’s response to bevacizumab treatment.  143 
However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as effective at improving 144 
vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept.  Patients and clinicians do not know if this 145 
approach ultimatel y has deleterious effects on visual acuity. If starting with aflibercept is not 146 
better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to aflibercept if needed, the potential cost 147 
savings to future patients and the health care system would be substantial.  However, if starting 148 
with aflibercept is better, then patients, clinicians, and health care providers can make informed 149 
decisions for how to best treat patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.    150 
 151 1.2 Study Objective s 152 
To compare the efficacy o f intra vitreous afl ibercept with intravitreous bevacizumab  + deferred 153 
aflibercept  if needed  in eyes with CI DME  and moderate vision loss.   154 
 155 1.3 Study Design and Synopsis of Protocol 156

corticosteroids) 178 
 Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample 179 
size with any history of anti- VEGF treatment  for DME in the study eye. 180 
Once this number of eyes has been enrolled, any history of anti- VEGF 181 
treatment  for DME  in the study eye will be an exclusion criterion.  182 
o No history of major ocular surgery in the study eye within prior 4 months or 183

meets switch criteria  191 
 192 
Study participants may have one or two study eyes, if both eyes are eligible at the time of 193 
randomization.  Study participants with two study eyes will be randomized to receive aflibercept 194 
in one eye and bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept  (if switch criteria is met)  in the other eye.   195 
Further details on randomization are located in section 2.4. 196 
  197 
D. Sample Size 198

 252 
1.4 General Considerations  253 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the DRCR.net Policies 254 
document, with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 255 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice. 256 
 257 
The DRCR.net Procedures Manuals (Visual Acuity-Refraction Testing, OCT, photography, and 258 
Study procedures manuals ) provide details of the examination procedures and intravitreous 259 
injection procedures.   260 
 261 Photographers, OCT technicians, and visual acuity testers, including refractionists, will be 262 
masked to treatment group at the annual visits.  Study participants will be initially  masked to 263 
their treatment group assignment, but may find out the identity of the drug from billing 264 
documents.  Investigators and study coordinators are not masked to treatment group. 265 
   266 Data will be  directly collected in electronic case report forms, which will be considered the 267 
source data.  268 
 269 There is no restriction on the number of study participants to be enrolled by a site. 270 
 271 A risk -based monitoring approach will be followed, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for 272 
Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach to Monitoring” (August 273 
2013). 274 
 275 The risk level is considered to be research involving greater than minimal risk. 276

STUDY PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT  278 
 279 
2.1 Identifying Eligible Subjects and Obtaining Informed Consent  280 
A minimum of 312 eyes ( 260 participants assuming 20% have two study eyes) are expected to be 281 
enrolled into the randomized trial.  As the enrollment goal approaches, sites will be notified of 282 
the end date for recruitment.  Study participants who have signed an informed consent form can 283 
be randomized up until the end date, which means the recruitment goal might be exceeded.   284 
 285 Potential eligibility will be assessed as part of a routine -
 care examination.  Prior to completing 286 
any procedures or collecting any data that are not part of usual care, written informed consent 287 
will be obtained.  For patients who are considered potentially eligible for the study based on a 288 
routine-care exam, the study protocol will be discussed with the potential study participant by a 289 
study investigator and clinic coordinator. The potential study participant will be given the 290 
Informed Consent Form to read.  In addition, participants will be required to watch a short 291 
informational video about the trial and answer a few short questions to confirm understanding of 292 
the study.  Potential study participants will be encouraged to discuss the study with family 293 
members and their personal physician(s) before deciding whether to participate in the study.   294 
 295 C
onsent may be given in two stages (if approved by the IRB).  The initial stage will provide 296 
consent to complete any of the screening procedures needed to assess eligibility that have not 297 
already been performed as part of a usual-care exam.  The second stage will be obtained prior to 298 
randomization and will be for participation in the study.  Study participants will be provided with 299 
a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form. 300 
 301 Once a study participant is randomized, that participant will be counted regardless of whether the 302 
assigned treatment is received.  Thus, the investigator must not proceed to randomize an 303 
individual until he/she is convinced that the individual is eligible and will accept assignment to 304 
either of the two treatment groups. 305 
 306 2.2 Study Participant Eligibility Criteria  307 
2.2.1 Participant -level Criteria  308 
Inclusion 
309 
To be eligible, t h e following inclusion criteria  must be met:  310 
1. Age ≥ 18 years  311 
• Individuals <18 years old are not being included because DME is so rare in this age 312

The study participant must have at least one eye meeting all of  the inclusion criteria and none of 355 
the exclusion criteria listed below.   356 
 357 Study participants can have two study eyes only if both eyes are eligible at the time of 358 
randomization.  For study participants with two eligible eyes, the logistical complexities of the 359 
protocol must be considered for each individual prior to randomizing both eyes.   360 
  361 The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:

Exclusions 377 
The following exclusions apply to the study eye only (i.e., they may be present for the nonstudy 378 
ey
e): 379 
e. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.  380 
• A n eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to be 381 
related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT 382 
suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or 383 
epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.  384 
f. A n ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual acuity loss 385 
would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, pigment 386 
abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).  387 
g. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the investigator, 388 
might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein 389 
occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glauco ma, etc.).  390 
h. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be decreasing visual 391 
acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye 392 
was otherwise normal).  393 
i. History of an anti- VEGF tre atment  for DME in the past 12 months or history of any other 394 
treatment for DME at any time in the past four months (such as focal/grid macular 395 
photocoagulation, intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids).  396 
• Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample size with any 397 
history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Once this number of eyes has been enrolled, 398 
any history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME will be an exclusion criterion.  399 
j. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation within four months prior to randomization or 400 
anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six months following randomization. 401 
k. History of anti-VEGF treatment for a disease other than DME in the past 12 months. 402

intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior four months or anticipated within the next six months 404 
following randomization.  405 
m. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months prior to randomization. 406 
n. Aphakia. 407 
o. Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or significant 408

• Intraocular pressure must be <30, with no more than one topical glaucoma 411 
medication, and no documented glaucomatous field loss for the eye to be eligible  412 
 Note – combination therapies are considered  more than one medication  413 
 414 
2.3 Screening Evaluation and Baseline Testing  415 
2.3.1 Historical Information 416 
A history will be elicited from the potential study participant and extracted from available 417 
medical records.  Data to be collected will include:  age, gender, ethnicity and race, diabetes 418 
history and current management, other medical conditions, medications being used, as well as 419 
ocular  diseases, surgeries, and treatment.  420 
 421 
2.3.2 Baseline Testing Procedures  422 
The following procedures are needed to assess eligibility and/or to serve as baseline measures for 423 
the study.   424 
• If a procedure has been performed (using the study technique and by study certified 425 
personnel) as part of usual care, it does not need to be repeated specifically for the 426 
study if it was performed within the defined time windows specified below.  427 
• The testi ng procedures are detailed in the DRCR.net Visual Acuity -Refraction 428 
Testing Procedures Manual, OCT Procedures Manuals, Photography Testing 429 
Procedures Manual, and Study Procedures Manual. Visual acuity testing, ocular 430 
exam, fundus photography, and OCT will be performed by DRCR.net certified 431 
personnel.  432 
 433 
1. Electronic -ETDRS visual acuity testing at 3 meters using the Electronic Visual Acuity 434 
Tester (including protocol refraction) in each eye. (within eight days prior to randomization)  435 
• This testing procedure has been validated against 4-meter ETDRS chart testing.14 436 
2. OCT on study eye (within eight days prior to randomization)  437 
• For a given study participant, the same machine type should be used for the duration 438 
of the study, unless circumstances do not permit (e.g., replacement of damaged 439 
machine).  If a switch is necessary, the same machine type should be used for the 440 
remainder of the study. 441 
3. Ocular examination on each eye including slit lamp, measurement of intraocular pressure, 442 
lens assessment, and dilated ophthalmoscopy  (within 21 days prior to randomization) 443 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       2-5 4. Digital fundus photography in the study eye.  (within 21 days prior to randomization)  444 
5. Measurement of blood pressure (see study procedures manual for collection procedure.)  445 
6. Laboratory Testing- Hemoglobin A1c  446 
• Hemoglobin A1c does not need to be repeated if available in the prior three months.  447 
If not available at the time of randomization, the individual may be enrolled but the 448 
test must be obtained within three weeks after randomization.  449 
 450 
2.4 Enrollment/Randomization of Eligible Study Participants  451 
Study participants can have two  study eyes.   452 
1. Prior to randomization, the study participant’s understanding of the trial, willingness to 453 
accept the assigned treatment group, and commitment to the follow-up schedule should be 454 
reconfirmed.  455 
2. The baseline injection must be given on the day of randomization; therefore, a study 456 
participant should not be randomized until this is possible.  For study participants with two 457 
study eyes, it is strongly recommended that both eyes are treated on the day of 458 
randomization.  If the investigator is not willing to perform bilateral injections on the same 459 
day, the second study eye must receive the injection within 7 days. 460 
3. Randomization is completed on the DRCR.net website.   461 
• S tudy participants with one study eye will be randomly assigned  with equal probability 462 
stratified by site to receive either:  463 
 G roup A: 2.0 mg intravitreous aflibercept  464 
 Group B: 1.25 mg intravitreous bevacizumab + deferred intravitreous 2.0 mg 465 
aflibercept if the eye meets switch criteria  466 
 467 
• S tudy participants with two study eyes (both eyes eligible at time of randomization)  will 468 
be randomized with equal probability to receive either: 469 
 G roup A in the eye with greater visual acuity  and Group B in the  eye with lower 470 
visual acuity  471 
 Group B in the eye with greater visual acuity  and Group A in the eye with lower 472 
visual acuity  473 
 474 
Note: if both eyes have the same visual acuity, the right eye will be considered the eye 475 
with greater visual acuity.  476

TREATMENT REGIMENS  478 
3.1 Introduction 479 
The study eye is assigned to one of the two treatment groups. 480 
 481 
The treatment groups are as follows: 482 
• 2.0 mg intravitreous aflibercept  483 
• 1.25 mg intravitreous be vacizumab + deferred intravitreous 2.0 mg aflibercept if the eye 484 
meets switch criteria  485 
 486 The initial injection will be given on the day of randomization.  For study participants with two 487 
study eyes, it is strongly recommended that both eyes are treated on the day of randomization.  If 488 
the investigator is not willing to perform bilateral injections on the same day, the second study 489 
eye must receive the injection within 7 days.  490 
 491 Treatment procedures are described below.  The timing and criteria for retreatment are outlined 492 
in chapter 4. 493 
 494 
3.2 Intravitreous  Injections  495 
3.2.1 Intravitreous  Aflibercept Injection (Eylea)  496 
Eylea® ( intravitreous aflibercept injection) is made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and is 497 
approved by the FDA for the treatment of neovascular age- related macular degeneration, 498 
macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion, macular edema due to branch retinal vein 499 
occlusion, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy in eyes with diabetic macular 500 
edema.   501 
 502 Study eyes assigned to receive aflibercept will receive a dose of 2.0 mg in 0.05 cc.  Aflibercept 503 
will be obtained commercially by the clinical site.  The physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical 504 
properties and formulation of aflibercept are provided in the Package Insert .   505 
 506 
3.2.2 Bevacizumab (Avastin) 507 
Bevacizumab ( Avastin) is made by Genentech, Inc. and is approved by the FDA for the 508 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as well as the treatment of non-squamous non- small cell 509 
lung cancer, glioblastoma, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma .    510 
 511 
Study eyes assigned to receive bevacizumab will receive a dose of 1.25 mg either obtained by 512 
the clinical site  or provided by a single compounding pharmacy identified by the Network and 513 
distributed by the Network.  The volume of the injection will be 0.05 cc.  The physical, chemical, 514 
and pharmaceutical properties and formulation of bevacizumab  are provided in the Clinical 515 
Investigator’s Brochure.     516 
 517 
3.2.3 Intravitreous  Injection Technique  518 
The injection is preceded by a povidone iodine prep of the conjunctiva.  In general, topical 519 
antibiotics in the pre -, peri-, or post-injection period should not be used.  520 
 521 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       3-2 The injection will be performed using sterile technique.  The full injection procedure is described 522 
in the protocol- specific s tudy procedures m anual.  523 
 524 
3.2.4 Deferral of Injections Due to Pregnancy  525 
Female study participants of child-bearing age must be questioned regarding the possibility of 526 
pregnancy prior to each injection. In the event of pregnancy, study injections must be 527 
discontinued during the pregnancy and any post-partum period of breastfeeding.   528 
 529 
3.2.5 Delay in Giving Injections  530 
If a scheduled inject ion is not given by the end of the visit window, it can still be given up to one 531 
week prior to the next visit window opening.  If it is not given by that time, it will be considered 532 
missed.  533 
 534 
If an injection is given late, the next scheduled injection should occur no sooner than three  weeks 535 
after the previous injection. 536 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-1 CHAPTER 4                                                                                                                   537 
FOLLOW -UP VISITS AND TREATMENT  538 
 539 
4.1 Visit Schedule  540 
The schedule of protocol- specified follow -up visits is as follows: 541 
 542 First Year  
543 
• V isits every 4±1 weeks (with a minimum of 21 days between visits) through 1 year  544 
 545 
Year 2  546 
• V isits every 4±1 weeks (with a minimum of 21 days between visits) as long as 547 
intravitreous injections are given  548 
• Otherwise, visits every 4 to 16 weeks ( ±1 week windows)  549 
 The first two times an injection is deferred, the subject will return in 4  550 
weeks for re-evaluation. If deferral continues, the subject will return in 8 weeks for 551 
re-evaluation before beginning the every 16 week schedule. 552 
 553 Additional visits may occur as required for usual care of the study participant.  554 
 555 4.2 Testing Procedures  556 
The following procedures will be performed at each protocol visit unless otherwise specified. A 557 
grid in section 1.3 summarizes the testing performed at each visit.   558 
 559 Visual acuity testers and OCT technicians will be masked to treatment group at the annual visits.  560 
Study participants will be  initially  masked to their treatment group assignment, but may find out 561 
the identity of the drug from billing documents.  The investigators and the study coordinators 562 
will not be masked to the treatment group assignment.        563 
 564 1. E- ETDRS visual acuity testing in each eye (best corrected).  565 
• A protocol refraction in the study eye is required at all protocol visits.  Refraction in the 566 
non-study eye is only required at the 1 and 2 year  visits .  When a refraction is not 567 
performed, the most-recently performed refraction is used for the testing. 568 
2. OCT on the study eye   569 
• For a given study participant, the same machine type should be used for the duration of 570 
the study, unless circumstances do not permit (e.g., replacement of damaged machine).  If 571 
a switch is necessary, the same machine type should be used for the remainder of the 572 
study.  573 
3. Ocular exam on both eyes at the annual visits and study eye only at all other follow-up visits, 574 
including slit lamp examination, lens assessment, measurement of intraocular pressure and 575 
dilated ophthalmoscopy.   576 
4. Digital f undus photography on the study eye only. 577 
5. A blood pressure measurement will be collected at the annual visits. 578 
6. Laboratory testing of Hemoglobin A1c at annual visits only. 579 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-2 • HbA1c does not need to be repeated at annual visits if available in the prior 3 580 
months.  581 
All of the testing procedures do not need to be performed on the same day, provided that they are 582 
completed within the time window of a visit and prior to initiating any retreatment.  583 
 584 
Testing procedures at unscheduled visits are at investigator discretion.  However, it is 585 
recommended that procedures that are performed should follow the standard DRCR.net protocol 586 
for each procedure. 587 
 588 4.3 Treatment During Follow Up  589 
The treatment groups are as follows: 590 
• 2.0 mg intravitreous aflibercept  591 
• 1.25 mg intravitreous bevacizumab with deferred intravitreous 2.0 mg aflibercept if the 592 
eye meets switch criteria  593 
 594 
4.3.1 Intravitreous  Injection Re -Treatment  595 
At the baseline visit all treatment groups will receive an intravitreous injection according to their 596 
assigned treatment group.  After the initial injection each eye will be treated according to 597 
retreatment protocol.  In general, an eye will continue to receive an injection if the eye is 598 
improving or worsening on OCT or visual acuity.  The first time an eye has not improved or 599 
worsened, the eye will receive an injection.  If the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 600 
2 consecutive injections and OCT CSF  thickness is less than the gender- specific spectral domain 601 
OCT thres hold (see below) and visual acuity is 20/20 or better, the injection will be deferred.  If 602 
the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2 consecutive visits and OCT CSF  thickness is 603 
≥ the gender- specific spectral domain OCT threshold  or visual acuity is worse than 20/20, the 604 
following will be done: 605 
• Prior to the 24-week visit, an injection will be given. 606 
• At and after the 24-week visit, the injection will be deferred.   607 
 608 
For study participants with two study eyes, if the re- treatment protocol determines that both eyes 609 
are to receive an intravitreous injection at the visit, it is strongly recommended that both eyes are 610 
treated on the same day.  If the investigator is not willing to perform bilateral injections on the 611 
same day, the second study eye must receive the injection within 7 days. 612 
 613 
The protocol chair or designee must be contacted prior to deviating from the injection protocol.  614 
See the DRCR.net Procedure Manual for additional details. 615 
 616 Spectral domain OCT central subfield gender-specific thresholds: 617 
 Zeiss Cirrus: 290µm in women and 305µ m in men  618 
 Heidelberg Spectralis: 305µm in women and 320µ m in men  619 
 620 
4.3.2 Switch Criteria (Bevacizumab + Def erred Aflibercept group)  621 
At the 12, 16 and 20 week visits, study eyes assigned to the bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept 622 
group will switch from bevacizumab injections to aflibercept injections when all of the following 623 
criteria have been met : 624 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-3 • OCT CSF thickness is above the following cutoffs: 625 
 Zeiss Cirrus  CSF : ≥290µm in women or ≥  305µm in men  626 
 Heidelberg Spectralis  CSF : ≥ 305µm in women or ≥ 320µm in men  627 
• VA not improved at least 5 letters from the prior two visits    628 
• OCT CSF not improved at least 10% from the prior two visits  629 
• Visual acuity is 20/50 or worse 630 
 631 
Beginning at the 24 week  visit through the end of the study, study eyes assigned to the 632 
bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group  that have not already switched to aflibercept will 633 
switch from bevacizumab injections to aflibercept injections when all the fo llowing criteria have 634 
been met : 635 
• OCT CSF thickness is above the following cutoffs: 636 
 Zeiss Cirrus  CSF : ≥290µm in women or ≥  305µm in men  637 
 Heidelberg Spectralis  CSF : ≥ 305µm in women or ≥ 320µm in men  638 
• VA not improved at least 5 letters from the prior two visits    639 
• OCT CSF not improved at least 10% from the prior two visits  640 
• Visual acuity is 20/32 or worse 641 
 642  Note – If bevacizumab injections are deferred according to the criteria in section 4.3.1, and 643 
then the eye worsens, injections will resume using bevacizumab.  Then, if the criteria above 644 
is met following two consecutive bevacizumab injections, the eye will switch to aflibercept.    645 
 646 Eyes that meet the switch criteria will switch to aflibercept injections and receive 2 monthly 647 
injections of aflibercept, then continue with aflibercept injections through the end of the study 648 
according to the retreatment protocol described in section 4.3.1. 649 
 650 The protocol chair or designee must be contacted prior to deviating from the injection protocol.  651 
See the DRCR.net Procedure Manual for additional details. 652 
 653 
4.3.3 Failure Criteria  654 
For study eyes in both treatment groups, when failure criteria is met, treatment is up to the 655 
investigator discretion .   656 
 657 
At or after the 24 week visit, if all  
 of the following criteria are met, the eye has met failure 658 
criteria and treatment is up to investigator discretion  659 
• O CT CSF thickness ≥ eligibility machine and gender specific threshold  660 
 Zeiss Cirrus  CSF : ≥290µm in women or ≥ 305µm in men 661 
 Heidelberg Spectralis  CSF : ≥ 305µm in women or ≥320µm in men  662 
• VA is 10 or more letters worse than baseline at 2 consecutive visits 663 
• DME present on clinical exam that the investigator believes is the cause of the visual 664 
acuity loss 665 
• There has been no improvement in VA (>5 letters) or OCT ( >10% OCT CSF thickness) 666 
since either of the last two injections  667 
 668 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       4-4 For eyes in the bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group, the failure criteria cannot be applied 669 
prior to the eye switching to aflibercept and receiving 3 monthly injections of aflibercept.  670 
  671 
4.3.4 Laser for DME  672 
Treatment with focal/grid laser will not be permitted in the study eye(s) during the study unless 673 
failure criteria are met .  If the failure criteria listed in 4.3.3 is met, treatment (including laser) is 674 
up to investigator discretion. 675 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       5-1 CHAPTER 5                                                                                                    676 
MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATI ONS IN FOLLOW -UP 677 
 678 
5.1 Endophthalmitis  679 
Diagnosis and treatment of endophthalmitis is based on investigator’s judgment.  Obtaining 680 
cultures of vitreous and aqueous fluid is highly recommended prior to initiating antibiotic 681 
treatment for presumed endophthalmitis.  682 
  683 5.2 Use of Intravitreous  Anti -VEGF for Conditions Other than DME in the Study Eye  684 
Treatment for conditions other than DME is at investigator discretion.  If a participant develops a 685 
diabetic eye disease, e.g. proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the study eye, for which the 686 
investigator intends to administer anti- VEGF treatment, it is recommended that the eye is treated 687 
with the same anti-VEGF drug being given for DME. 688 
 689 
5.3 Treatment in Non -study Eye  690 
Treatment of  PDR or  DME in the non-study eye is at investigator discretion.  691 
 692 5.4 Diabetes Management  693 
Diabetes management is left to the study participant’s medical care provider.  694 
 695 5.5 Study Participant Withdrawal and Losses to Follow- up 696 
A study participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  If s/he is considering 697 
withdrawal from the study, the principal investigator should personally speak to the individual 698 
about the reasons, and every effort should be made to accommodate the study participant to 699 
allow continued participation if possible.   700 
 701 The goal for the study is to have as few losses to follow-up as possible.  The Coordinating Center 702 
will assist in the tracking  of study participants who cannot be contacted by the site.  The 703 
Coordinating Center will be responsible for classifying a study participant as lost to follow-up. 704 
 705 Study participants who withdraw will be asked to have a final closeout visit at which the testing 706 
described for the annual study visits will be performed.  Study participants who have an adverse 707 
event  attributable to a study treatment or procedure will be asked to continue in follow-up until 708 
the adverse event has resolved or stabilized.  709 
 710 Study participants who withdraw or are determined to have been ineligible post-randomization 711 
will not be replaced.  712 
 713 5.6 Discontinuation of Study  714 
The study may be discontinued by the DRCR.net  Executive Committee (with approval of the 715 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of follow-up for all 716 
study participants. 717 
 718 5.7 Contact Information Provided to the Coordinating Center  719 
The Coordinating Center will be provided with contact information for each study participant.  720 
Permission to obtain such information will be included in the Informed Consent Form.  The 721 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       5-2 contact information will be maintained in a secure database and will be maintained separately from 722 
the study data. 723 
 724 
Phone contact from the Coordinating Center may  be made with each study participant in the first 725 
month after enrollment, and approximately every six months thereafter.  Additional phone 726 
contacts or mailings from the Coordinating Center will be made to fa cilitate the scheduling of the 727 
study participant for follow-up visits.  A study participant- oriented newsletter may  be sent twice 728 
a year.  A study logo item may be sent once a year.    729 
 730 Study participants will be provided with a summary of the study result s in a newsletter format 731 
after completion of the study by all study participants.  732 
  733 5.8 Study Participant Reimbursement  734 
The study will be providing the study participant with a  $25 merchandise or money card per 735 
completed non- annual study visit and $100 in merchandise or money cards per completed annual 736 
visit.  Additional travel expenses will be paid in select cases for study participants with higher 737 
expenses.  738

ADVERSE EVENTS  740 
6.1 Definition  741 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective of 742 
whether or not the event is considered treatment- related.  An adverse event can therefore be any 743 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal lab finding), symptom or disease 744 
temporally associated with the use of the treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. This 745 
includes preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by the 746 
investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character. 747 
 748 
6.2 Recording of Adverse Events  749 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible adverse 750 
events or untoward findings.  The first concern will be the safety of the study participant, and 751 
appropriate medical intervention will be made. 752 
 753 All adverse events whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study personnel during 754 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 755 
reported on an adverse event form online.  Each adverse event form is reviewed by the 756 
Coordinating Center to verify the coding and the reporting that is required.      757 
 758 The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelated 759 
by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused 760 
by the treatment.  761 
 762 To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 763 
following general guideline when de termining whether an adverse event is related:  764 
 765 Yes 
766 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 767 
a
dministration of the study treatment, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the 768 
subject’s clinical sta te, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event 769 
follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment; and/or the adverse event abates or 770 
resolves upon discontinuation of the study treatment or dose reduction and, if appli cable, 771 
reappears upon re- challenge.  772 
 773 No 
774 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment (e.g., 775 
pr
eexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 776 
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment 777 
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug).    778 
 779 The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three-point scale:  (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 780 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity:  thus, a severe adverse 781 
event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, 782 
but may not be clinically serious. 783 
 784 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-2 Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  785 
 786 
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the DRCR.net website data entry form.   787 
 788 Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the 789 
study will be followed until their med ical outcome is determined or until no further change in the 790 
condition is expected.   791 
 792 6.3 Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  793 
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that: 794 
• Results in death  795 
• Is life -threatening; (a non- life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 796 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event) 797 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 798 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 799 
to conduct normal life functions (sight threatening)  800 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 801 
• Is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical judgment (e.g., 802 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 803 
the outcomes listed above) 804 
 805 
Unexpected adverse events are those that are not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 806 
the cur rent Clinical Investigator’s Brochure, protocol, or informed consent form. 807 
 808 Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the Coordinating Center immediately 809 
via completion of the online serious adverse event form. 810 
 811 The Coordinating Center will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is 812 
both serious and unexpected.  Notification will be made within 10 days after the Coordinating 813 
Center becomes aware of the event.   814 
 815 Each principal investigator is responsible for informing his/her IRB of serious study- related 816 
adverse events and abiding by any other reporting requirements specific to their IRB.  817 
 818 6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Review of Adverse Events 819 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will advise the  Coordinating Center 820 
regarding the protocol, template informed consent form, and substantive amendments and will 821 
provide independent monitoring of adverse events. Cumulative adverse event data are semi- 822 
annually tabulated for review by the DSMC.  Following each DS MC data review, a summary 823 
will be provided to institutional review boards.  A list of specific adverse events to be reported to 824 
the DSMC expeditiously, if applicable, will be compiled and included as part of the DSMC 825 
Standard Operating Procedures document. 826 
 827 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-3 6.5 Risks  828 
6.5.1 Potential Adverse Effects of Study Drugs  829 
6.5.1.1 Aflibercept  830 
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept  were 831 
conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous floaters, intraocular pressure increased, and 832 
vitreous detachment.   833 
 834 
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of 835 
intravitreous injections with aflibercept  including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. 836 
 837 The DA VINCI study, a phase II study evaluating aflibercept for treatment of DME, reported 838 
common adverse events that were consistent with those previously seen with intravitreous 839 
injections.  Over one year of follow-up, two cases of endophthalmitis and one case of uveitis 840 
occurred (all in aflibercept treatment groups).  Seven deaths (4.0%) occurred in the groups 841 
randomized to aflibercept  treatment as compared with 1 (2.3%) in the group treated with laser.  842 
Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident occurred in 6 (3.4%) participants treated with 843 
aflibercept as compared with 1 (2.3%) participant treated with laser alone.
15  Percentages of 844 
study participants that experienced events meeting APTC c riteria were 5.1% (N  = 9) in the 845 
combined aflibercept groups and 4.5% ( N = 2) in the laser group.16  846 
  847 The DRCR.net Protocol T study assessed ocular and systemic adverse events in eyes with center- 848 
involved DME treated with aflibercept over 1 year.
17  In the aflibercept -treated study eyes, there 849 
were no cases of endophthalmitis and 2 cases of ocular inflammation. Non- study eyes treated 850 
with aflibercept had 1 case of endophthalmitis and 3 cases of ocular inflammation. Systemic 851 
adver se events were infrequent with only 6 APTC events (4 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 2 852 
deaths from a potential vascular cause or unknown cause, 6% of participants) over the 1 year 853 
period in the aflibercept group. 854 
 855 Additional safety data were published from phase III studies VISTA and VIVID, which included 856 
872 eyes with  DME  with central involvement that received either intravitreous aﬂibercept every 857 
4 weeks , intravitreous aflibercept every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses , or macular laser 858 
photocoagulation.  Overall, the incidences of ocular and non- ocular adverse events were similar 859 
across treatment groups at 52 weeks.
18  The  incidence of APTC -defined thromboembolic events 860 
was similar across treatment groups.  There were no reported cases of endophthalmitis, and 861 
intraocular inflammation occurred in less than 1% of injections.  Through 100 weeks, an 862 
integrated safety analysis found that the most frequent serious ocular adverse event was cataract 863 
(2.4% and 1.0% in the aflibercept groups compared with 0.3% in the laser group).19   864 
 865 There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.   866 
 867 6.5.1.2 Bevacizumab  868 
In a meta-analysis performed by Genentech, Inc on all clinical trial results using intravenously 869 
administered bevacizumab (usually dose 5 mg/kg every 14 days), it was found that study 870 
participants were at an increased risk for certain adverse events, some of which were potentially 871 
fatal.  These included wound healing complications, bowel perforation, hemorrhage, stroke, 872 
myocardial infarction, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and proteinuria. Warnings and 873 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-4 precautions included in the bevacizumab package insert for intravenously administered drug fall 874 
under the categories of gastrointestinal perforations, surgery and wound healing complications, 875 
hemorrhage, non- gastrointestinal fistula formation  and fistulae, arterial thromboembolic events, 876 
venous thromboembolic events, hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, 877 
proteinuria, infusion reactions, embryo- fetal toxicity  and ovarian failure.20  878 
 879 
In contrast, available data suggest that intravitreally -administered bevacizumab in substantially 880 
smaller doses (1.25 or 2.5 mg) appears to have a good safety profile with regard to ocular and 881 
systemic adverse events. No increased rates of thromboembolic events or death in bevacizumab 882 
versus control groups have been reported in smaller, prospective randomized studies including 883 
the DRCR.net Protocol H or the BOLT study.21 Retrospective, observational data from larger 884 
patient groups also does not appear to indicate an increased risk of ocular or systemic events with 885 
intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. In 2006, an internet-based survey of 70 international sites 886 
from 12 countries was reported that described outcomes after 7,113 injections given to 5,228 887 
patients.  Rates were 0.21% or less for each category of doctor- reported adverse events, 888 
including blood pressure elevation, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, death, 889 
endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, uveitis, or acute vision loss.22  The PACORES group 890 
reported 12 month safety of intravitreal injections of 1.25 and 2.5 mg doses of bevacizumab 891 
given for a variety of conditions in a large group of study participants including 548 patients with 892 
diabetes.23  A total of 1,174 patients were followed for at least 1 year.  Systemic adverse events 893 
were reported in 1.5% (N = 18), including elevated blood pressure in 0.6% (7), cerebrovascular 894 
accidents in 0.5% (6), myocardial infarctions in 0.4% (5), iliac artery aneurysms in 0.2% (2), toe 895 
amputations in 0.2% (2), and deaths in 0.4% (5) of patients.  The overall mortality rate of 896 
diabetic patients in this study was low at 0.55% (3/548).  Ocular complication were reported as 897 
bacterial endophthalmitis in 0.2% (7), traction retinal detachments in 0.2% (7), uveitis in 0.1% 898 
(4), and a single case each of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage.  899 
Finally, when bevacizumab is used to treat DME it does not appear to have a worse safety profile 900 
than other anti-VEGF agents.  In the DRCR.net Protocol T randomized trial of 660 participants, 901 
Anti-Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) events occurred in 5% with aflibercept, 8% with 902 
bevacizumab, and 13 % with ranibizumab (global P = 0.047; aflibercept vs. bevacizumab, P = 903 
0.34; aflibercept vs. ranibizumab, P = 0.047; ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab, P = 0.20).13  904 
 905 Recently reported results from the CATT Research Group also suggest that intravitreal 906 
bevacizumab is well tolerated.  At one year, four of 286 participants (1.4%) in the monthly 907 
bevacizumab group had died and 11 of 300 participants (3.7%) in the bevacizumab given as 908 
needed group had died.  Arteriothrombolic events occurred at a rate of 2.1% and 2.7% in the 909 
monthly bevacizumab and as needed bevacizumab groups, respectively.  Venous thrombotic  910 
events occurred at rates of 1.4% and 0.3% in the monthly bevacizumab and as needed 911 
bevacizumab groups, respectively.  Endophthalmitis occurred after 0.07% of injections in 912 
patients treated with bevacizumab.  Although a higher rate of s erious systemic adverse events was 913 
present in the bevacizumab group as compared with the ranibizumab group, the excess events in 914 
the bevacizumab group were primarily hospitalizations due to events not previously attributed to 915 
anti-VEGF treatment.
24 Differences in rates were largest for hospitalizations for infections (e.g., 916 
pneumonia and urinary tract infections) and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., hemorrhage and 917 
nausea and vomiting). Tw o year follow-up safety data from the CATT study did not reveal 918 
significant differences in rates of arterial thromboembolic events or death between bevacizumab 919 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-5 and ranibizumab treated participants.  Overall rates of serious adverse events, however, were 920 
higher among bevacizumab-treated patients (39.9%) than ranibizumab-treated patients (31.7%), 921 
with the greatest imbalance in gastrointestinal disorders not previously linked to anti- VEGF 922 
therapy.25  In contrast,  at 1 year in the IVAN study, fewer arteriothrombotic events or heart 923 
failure cases were seen in the bevacizumab treated group and there was no difference in the 924 
percentage of patients experiencing serious adverse events between the bevacizumab and 925 
ranibizumab treatment groupS.26   926 
 927 
As noted in the introduction, bevacizumab has been given intravitreally to several thousand 928 
patients with age -related macular degeneration or diabetic macular edema in doses generally of 929 
1.25 or 2.5 mg per injection (a fraction of the systemic dose).  There have not been consistent 930 
reports suggestive of adverse systemic effects of the drug. This likely rules out serious systemic 931 
events being common but does not rule out the possibility of such events occurring rarely.  932 
Patients with diabetes are at increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal disease.  933 
Thus, if a study participant develops a cardiovascular or renal problems, it may be due to the 934 
vascular effects of diabetes and other sys temic factors and not related to bevacizumab.  It is 935 
likely that only in a large study comparing adverse event rates between a bevacizumab- treated 936 
group and a control group will it be possible to determine if there is an excess of systemic 937 
adverse events with bevacizumab.  At this time, we believe the chances of a serious systemic 938 
effect of bevacizumab are very small.  However, we cannot rule out this possibility and there is 939 
evidence that systemic concentrations of VEGF may be reduced to an even greater ex tent with 940 
intravitreal bevacizumab as compared with ranibizumab treatment.26  In view of the large 941 
number of eyes treated with bevacizumab injections, it also seems unlikely that the drug has a 942 
deleterious effect on the retina or other part s of the eye. 943 
 944 6.5.2 Potential Adverse Effects of Intravitreous Injection  945 
Rarely, the drugs used to anesthetize the eye before the study drug injections (proparacaine, 946 
tetracaine, or xylocaine) can cause an allergic reaction, seizures, and an irregular heartbeat .   947 
 948 Subconjunctival hemorrhage or floaters will commonly occur as a result of the intravitreous 949 
injection.  Discomfort, redness, or itching lasting for a few days is also likely. 950 
 951 Immediately following the injection, there may be elevation of intraocular pressure. It usually 952 
returns to normal spontaneously, but may need to be treated with topical drugs or a 953 
paracentesis to lower the pressure.  The likelihood of permanent loss of vision from elevated 954 
intraocular pressure is less than 1%. 955 
 956 As a result of the injection, endophthalmitis (infection in the eye) could develop.  If this occurs, it is 957 
treated  by intravitreous injection of antibiotics, but there is a risk of permanent loss of vision including 958 
blindness.  The risk of endophthalmitis is less than 1%. 959 
 960 As a result of the injection, a retinal detachment could occur.  If this occurs, surgery may be 961 
needed to repair the retina.  The surgery is usually successful at reattaching the retina.  962 
However, a retinal detachment can produce permanent loss of vision and even blindness.  The 963 
risk of retinal detachment is less than 1%.  964 
 965 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       6-6 The injection could cause a vitreous hemorrhage.  Usually the blood will resolve 966 
spontaneously, but if not, surgery may be needed to remove the blood.  Although the surgery 967 
usually successfully removes the blood, there is a small risk of permanent loss of vision and 968 
even blindness.  The risk of having a vitreous hemorrhage due to the injection is less than 1%. 969 
 970 
6.5.3  Risks of Eye Examination and Tests  971 
There is a rare risk of an allergic response to the topical medications used to anesthetize the eye 972 
or dilate the pupil. Dilating drops rarely could cause an acute angle closure glaucoma attack, but 973 
this is highly unlikely since the study participants in the study will have had their pupils dilated 974 
many times previously.   975 
 976 
There are no known risks associated with OCT or fundus photographs.  The bright flashes used 977 
to take the photographs may be annoying, but are not painful and cause no damage. 978 
 979 
For fluorescein angiography, both the skin and urine are expected to turn yellow/orange for up to 980 
24 hours after the injection of fluorescein dye.  There is a small risk of discomfort or phlebitis at 981 
the site of the injection.  Patients occasionally experience lightheadness or nausea after dye 982 
injection which are usually transient and resolve after a few minutes without further intervention.  983 
An allergic reaction to the dye used to do the fluorescein angiography imaging is rare.  A rash or 984 
pruritus (itching) can develop, but true anaphylactic reactions are very rare.   985

STATISTICAL METHODS  987 
 988 
The approach to sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below.  A detailed statistical 989 
analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to any tabulation or analysis of study data.   990 
 991 7.1 Primary Outcome 992 
The sample size has been computed for the primary outcome, mean change in visual acuity over 993 
two years, measured using area under the curve (AUC).  994 
 995 7.2 Sample Size 996 
7.2.1 Outcome Pro jections  997 
Data from DRCR.net Protocol T was used to estimate visual acuity outcomes in the two groups.  998 
Based on the switch criteria, it is estimated that approximately 58% of the bevacizumab group 999 
will receive aflibercept during the 2 years of the trial.  It is anticipated  that approximately half of 1000 
these eyes will switch during the first 24 weeks of the trial, with the other half of the eyes that 1001 
switch distributed across the remai ning 18 months of the study. 1002 
 1003 Projected group means and required sample sizes were estimated for various scenarios after 1004 
switching. Figure 1 presents estimates of change in visual acuity over 2 years (AUC) assuming 1005 
that switching to aflibercept increases visual acuity  at each visit in the bevacizumab group from 1006 
1 to 9 letters  over what was observed in Protocol T. 1007

Table 1 below shows sample size estimates under varying assumptions for the effect of the 1014 
switch to aflibercept in bevacizumab eyes (for the primary outcome of change in visual acuity 1015 
AUC over  2 years) .  These calculations assume a Type I error rate of 4.9% (0.1% allocated for 1016 
DSMC review) , 90% power, and a two -sided test of superiority with a null hypothesis of no 1017 
difference between groups . 1018

group, which had a larger standard deviation than the bevacizumab group, making these estimates conservative.  1022 
 1023 
The final sample size was calculated with the following assumptions: 1024 
 1025 
• Mean change in visual acuity AUC  in the aflibercept group = 17.4 letters 1026 
• Mean change in visual acuity AUC  in the bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group = 1027 
13.9 (assuming eyes that switch to aflibercept gain 5 letters more than they would have if 1028 
the eye had  remained on bevacizumab)  1029 
• Treatment group difference = 3.5  letters; Adjusted standard deviation = 8.7 letters 1030 
• Type I error rate = 4.9%; Power = 90% 1031 
• 15% increase for expected lost to follow-up 1032 
 1033 Based on the above assumptions, the total sample size is  312 participants  (156 per treatment 1034 
group) . 1035 
 1036 
7.3 Primary Analysis Plan  1037 
7.3.1 Principles for Analysis  1038 
 1039 
The primary analysis consists of a treatment group comparison of mean change in visual acuity 1040 
AUC  over 2 years adjusted for baseline visual acuity.  A linear mixed model with a random 1041 
intercept term  for participant  will be used to control for correlations arising from participants 1042 
contributing two study eyes to the analysis.  AUC will be calculated for each participant by the 1043 
trapezoidal rule using the following formula: 1044 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       7-3 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 =  ��𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+1
2× (𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖+1−𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖)�𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1  1045 
Where Vi is the change in visual acuity measured at the ith visit, d i is the number of days between 1046 
randomization and the ith visit, and n is the number of outcome visits included in the analysis.  1047 
For presentation, AUC will be divided by the number of days b etween baseline and the nth visit 1048 
so that the value shown will have units of letters rather than letter ⋅days.  This statistic can then be 1049 
interpreted as the average change in visual acuity over the time period between baseline and the 1050 
nth visit.  1051 
 1052 
All 4 -week visits through 52 weeks as well as the 104 week visit will be included in the 1053 
calculation of AUC as these are common to both treatment groups.  Since visits can occur every 1054 
4 to 16 weeks in year 2, depending upon disease progression, analysis windows will be defined 1055 
around 68 and 84 weeks for the purposes of calculating AUC.  Thus, the visits to be included for 1056 
calculation of the primary outcome are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 68, 84, and 1057 
104 weeks. 1058 
 1059 The primary analysis is an “inten t to treat analysis” that will include all randomized eyes 1060 
according to treatment group assignment at randomization. M ultiple imputation will be used to 1061 
handle missing data.   1062 
 1063 
7.3.2 Sensitivity Analyses 1064 
A sensitivity analysis using only observed data from eyes that complete the 104 -week visit also 1065 
will be conducted. If the analyses of imputed and observed data differ substantially, then 1066 
exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate factors that may h ave contributed to the 1067 
differences.  1068 
 1069 
A per -protocol analysis will be conducted to estimate the treatment effect for each group among 1070 
those not receiving any alternative treatment for DME (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroids). This 1071 
analysis will include  observed data from all randomized up to the time of alternative treatment 1072 
for DME. Data collected after the alternative treatment will be set to missing prior to imputation. 1073 
Imputation will otherwise be similar to the primary analysis.  1074 
 1075 Imbalances between gro ups in important covariates are not expected to be of sufficient 1076 
magnitude to produce confounding.  However, the presence of confounding will be evaluated 1077 
using only observed data from eyes that complete the 104- week visit by including factors 1078 
potentially associated with the outcome for which there is an imbalance between groups.  1079 
 1080 
7.3.3 Subgroup Analyses  1081 
Pre-planned subgroup analyses, using observed data from eyes that complete the 104- week visit 1082 
will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan  and will includ e analyses by prior treatment for 1083 
DME, OCT CSF  thickness, and baseline visual acuity. There are no data to suggest that the 1084 
treatment effect will vary by gender or race/ethnicity.  However, both of these factors will be 1085 
evaluated in exploratory analyses.   1086 
 1087 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       7-4 7.3.4 Interim Analysis Plan  1088 
There will be no formal interim analys is for efficacy or futility.  1089 
 1090 
7.4 Secondary Outcomes for Treatment Group Comparison  1091 
The treatment groups will be compared on the following secondary outcomes of interest at the 52 1092 
and 104- week visits: 1093 
 1094 
• Mean change in visual acuity from baseline (also compared at the 24- week visit)  1095 
• Percentages  of eyes with a gain (increase) or loss (decrease) of at least 10 or at least 15 1096 
letter s of visual acuity from baseline 1097 
• Percentages of eyes with visual acuity 20/20 or greater, 20/40 or greater, and 20/200 or 1098 
worse  1099 
• Mean change in OCT central subfield thickness from baseline (also compared at the 24- 1100 
week visit)  1101 
• Percentage of eyes with OCT central subfield thickness below the gender -specific 1102 
spectral domain  OCT equivalent of 250 µm  on Zeiss Stratus OCT 1103 
• Mean change in OCT retinal volume 1104 
• Percent ages of eyes with worsening or improvement of diabetic retinopathy on fundus 1105 
photographs 1106 
• Percentage of eyes  receiving panretinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, or occurr ence of 1107 
vitreous hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment, neovascularization of the iris, or 1108 
neovascular glaucoma from proliferative diabetic retinopathy  1109 
• Number of visits through 2 years  1110 
• Number of injections 1111 
• Percentage of eyes that met switch criteria by the 12, 24, 52, or 104- week visit s 1112 
(bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept group only) 1113 
 1114 
Binary outcomes will be analyzed using binomial regression with generalized estimation 1115 
equations ( GEE ) to control for correlations arising from participants contributing two study eyes 1116 
to the analysis.  If binomial regression fails to converge in one or more outcomes, then logistic 1117 
regression with a random intercept for participant, conditional standardization, and the delta 1118 
method (to estimate the risk difference)27 may be used instead for all binary outcomes.  Analyses 1119 
will be adjusted for baseline measures where appropriate.  All model assumptions, including 1120 
linearity, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity, will be verified .  If model assumptions 1121 
are not  satisfied, then a transformation or a nonparametric analysis  will be considered.  Methods 1122 
for handling missing secondary outcome data will be specified  in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  1123 
 1124 7.5 Economic Analysis 1125 
The purpose of the economic ana lysis is to compare the treatment groups with respect to cost.  1126 
 1127 An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER)  will be calculated.  Data from the clinical trial on 1128 
number of clinic visits completed, number of procedures performed (e.g., OCT, fundus 1129 
photographs), and number of aflibercept and bevacizumab treatments will be used to estimate an 1130 
average cost per patient for each treatment arm, using the Medicare Fee Schedule to estimate 1131 
medical costs.   1132 
 1133 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       7-5 For outcomes measured at the participant level, bilateral  participants are non -informative with 1134 
respect to the treatment comparison and will not be included in the analyses. 1135 
 1136 
7.6 Safety Analysis Plan 1137 
Ocular adverse events  will be tabulated separatel y for the two treatment groups.  The frequency 1138 
of each event occurring at least once per eye will be calculated.  The percentage of eyes 1139 
experiencing each outcome will be compared between treatment groups using Barnard’s 1140 
unconditional exact test  and considering the number of eyes in each treatment group as fixed. It 1141 
is noted that this method does not adjust for the potential correlations arising from participants 1142 
with two study eyes; however, given the low expected frequency of adverse events, and small 1143 
proportion of bilateral subjects, the impact should be minimal. 1144 
 1145 The following ocular adverse events are of primary interest:  1146 
o Endophthalmitis 1147 
o Retinal detachment  1148 
o Traumatic cataract  1149 
o Vitreous hemorrhage  1150 
o Ocular i nflammation  1151 
o Intraocular pressure elevation  1152 
o Neovascular glaucoma  1153 
o Iris neovascularization  1154 
 1155 Systemic adverse events  will be reported in three groups : 1) unilateral participants randomized to 1156 
bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept, 2) unilateral participants randomized to aflibercept, and 3) 1157 
bilateral participants randomized to bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept in one eye and 1158 
aflibercept in the other eye.  The frequency of each event occurring at least once per participant 1159 
will be calculated.  The percentage of participants experiencing each outcome will compared 1160 
with Fisher’ s exact test.  If the overall test has P ≤  0.05, then pairwise comparisons between 1161 
groups also will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test without further adjustment for multiple 1162 
comparisons.  1163 
 1164 The following systemic adverse events are of primary interest:  1165 
o Death  1166 
o Serious adverse event (at least one)  1167 
o Hospitalization (at least one)  1168 
o Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events according to Antiplatelet Trialists’ 1169 
Collaboration (excerpted from BMJ Jan 8, 1994): 1170 
 Non-fatal myocardial infarction  1171 
 Non-fatal stroke (counted only if symptoms lasted at least 24 hours) 1172 
 Death attributed to cardiac, cerebral, hemorrhagic, embolic, other vascular 1173 
cause (does not need to be ischemic in origin), or unknown cause 1174 
• Notes: Transient ischemic attacks, angina, and possible myocardial 1175 
infar ction or stroke are not counted. Nonfatal myocardial infarction or 1176 
stroke require that the participant be alive at the end of the study.  If 1177 
not, only the death is counted. 1178 
 1179 
 
Aflibercept Switch Protocol 4 .0 6-28-21       7-6 o Secondary systemic adverse events of interest:  1180 
 For each MedDRA system organ class, percentage of participants with at least 1181 
one event  1182 
 1183 
A tabulation of all study eye ocular, non- study eye ocular, and systemic adverse events will be 1184 
tabulated according to treatment group as described above. 1185 
 1186 7.7 Additional Tabulations and Analyses  1187 
The following will be tabulated according to treatment group: 1188 
 1189 
1) Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics  1190 
2) Visit completion rate  1191 
3) Treatment adherence  1192 
 1193 
7.8 Multiple Testing  1194 
 1195 
The primary analysis will be conducted at alpha of 0.05. If the primary analysis demonstrates a 1196 
significant treatment group difference, then mean change in visual acuity from baseline at 104 1197 
weeks and mean change in OCT central subfield thickness from baseline at 104 weeks will be 1198 
tested  as secondary outcomes . The Holm method will be used to provide strong control of alpha 1199 
at 0.05.
28 If the primary analysis fails to show a significant difference, then outcomes will be 1200 
described with summary statistics , model-based point es timates,  and between -group 95% 1201 
confidence intervals without P values. This approach controls the family- wise error rate at 5%.  1202 
 1203 There will be no formal adjustment for multiplicity in sensitivity, subgroup , or safety analyses . 1204 
For exploratory subgroup analyses, the number of significant results expected by chance given 1205 
the number of comparisons will be noted. 1206

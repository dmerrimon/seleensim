Study Title  
Social norms, messengers, and processing fluency to increase hypertension medication adherence   
 
Objectives  
Aim 1: Test the effect of dynamic social norms, messenger effects, and processing fluency messages on 
hypertension medication adherence. The study team  will identify 59,997  Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 
insured by Humana who are not fully adherent to hypertension medications  and randomize them to one of 
six mailed communications to increase medication adherence or control. The primary outcome will be 
medication adherence (measured by pharmacy refill claims).  
 
Aim 2: Assess association of claims and demographic characteristics with intervention responsiveness. The 
study team will  evaluate the impact of the interventions as a function of baseline levels of adherence, 
demographic characteristics, and clinical como rbidities to determine the association of patient 
characteristics with intervention responsiveness. These profiles could be used to target future message 
content and framing to specific patients most likely to respond.  
 
Design and Outcomes   
Design:  random ized controlled  clinical trial of patient -facing messages to test the impact of social norms, 
messengers, and processing fluency on hypertension medication adherence in individuals 65 to 79 years of 
age taking medication for hypertension with adherence lev els (based on the proportion of days covered 
metric [ PDC ]) between 60 % and 85 %. 
 
The primary outcome will be the average end -of-year PDC in each arm.  A secondary outcome will be the 
proportion of study participants with end -of-year PDC ≥80%.  
See Figure 1 for an overview of the study design . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interventions and Duration  
Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of seven conditions:  
1. A scorecard from Humana reporting patients’ medication adherence using a “refill score”  
2. The Arm 1 scorecard plus dynamic social norms messaging (noting the proportion of Humana 
members improving their medicatio n refill scores)  
3. The Arm 1 scorecard, coming from the trusted messenger of a Humana -identified pharmacist 
taking the same medication

Sample Size and Population  
Target population: 59,997  Humana Medicare patients 65 to 79 years of age taking hypertension 
medications with adherence level  (based on the proportion of days covered metric [PDC])  between 60 % and 
85%. Divided across 7 arms, there will be 8,571  participants in each arm. Randomization will be 
stratified by whether participants are on a 30 -day medication refill cycle (~ 26% of overall study 
population) or a 90 -day medication refill cycle (~ 74% of overall study population).

1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
Hypothesis: M essages using dynamic social norms, messenger effects, and processing 
fluency in combination will more effectively increase average end -of-year adherence 
level  compared to usual care . 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
Secondary objective:  identify baseline clinical and  demographic characteristics to predict 
the efficacy of each message . 
 
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Hypertension substantially increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke ,1 but 
medicati ons that can effectively control hypertension (are not always taken as 
prescribed: adherence rates for hypertension medications range from about 40% to 
74% for most Americans.2-4 Non-adherence is therefore a potent contributor to 
preventable disability and death among middle -aged and older adults.5 There also 
exist disparities by race and ethnicity among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, Black 
and Hispanic patients are 38% and 45% more likely, respectively, to be nonadherent 
compared to white pat ients.6 
2.2 Study Rationale  
Interventions to improve medication adherence have had modest success;7,8 even the 
most effective interventions combining behavioral, educational, and logistical 
interventions for providers, health systems, and patients have limited effects.9-11 
Leveraging behavioral principles of social norms, messenger effects, and processing  
fluency may improve their impact.  
 7 Social norms describe perceptions about the behavior of others, which can influence 
one’s own behavior. Making information about others’ behavior more salient can 
encourage those behaviors when base rates are high. When t hey are low, dynamic 
norms, or information about how others’ behavior is changing , may be more 
impactful.12 Dynamic norms have shown impact in a range of healthy behaviors.13  
The effectiveness of a message also often depends on who is communicating it. 
Messenger impact can differ depending on factors such as how trusted they are, or 
how much they have in common with the people they are communicating with. 
Messenger effects have been successfully leveraged in HIV prevention and 
management14 and diabetes scr eening.15 Leveraging pharmacists in hypertension 
medication adherence interventions has shown promise, mainly in direct phone calls 
from pharmacists.16,17 Having medication -related messaging come from an insurance 
company’s pharmacist rather than the insur ance company itself may increase its 
impact, especially with pharmacists who are taking the same medications, and with 
lower cost through written communication rather than a phone call.  
Processing fluency is the subjective ease with which information is un derstood, which 
can influence its actionability. Increasing processing fluency has been impactful for 
exercise18 and other health behaviors ,19 including treatment adherence for juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis20 and cancer screening.21 Studies providing patie nts with summary 
information for statin medication adherence have demonstrated null22 or limited23 
results, but incorporating measures to ease processing fluency through tactics such as 
visual metaphors that emphasize goal progress and attainability may in crease their 
impact, especially as low health literacy is a key barrier to medication adherence.24 
Messages may have varied effectiveness based on patients’ level of adherence and/or 
demographic factors, which are also associated with differences in adhere nce.4,6 
Tailoring a message based upon these factors could optimize future intervention 
effectiveness.  
Thus, the study team propose s a randomized trial to test the effects of mailed 
communication leveraging social norms, messenger effects, and processing fluency 
on hypertension medication adherence for patients w ho are not fully adherent , 
followed by analyses identifying intervention r esponsiveness by patient 
characteristics.

 9 4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
Patients must meet all inclusion criteria to participate in this study:  
• Medicare Advantage beneficiary insured by Hum ana 
• Between the ages of 65 and 79  
• Having at least two unique fills of any class of hypertension medication within the 
calendar year   
• Adherence level (as measured by the proportion of days covered [PDC ] metric ) 
between 60 % and 85 % 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Humana policy specifies that certain subgroups of members should not be included in 
research studies per contractual agreements, privacy policies and rules, or legal 
requirements. These excluded entities and groups should not be considered part of the 
overall Humana Research Population.  Members that meet the following criteria will be 
excluded:  
• Commercial Fully Insured Groups to be excluded from Research (These are 
actually employer  groups that provide Medicare Group coverage to their retired 
employees).  Each quarter Data Offerings revises and updates the file of excluded 
Commercial Groups.  
a.       Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida  
b.       Employees Retirement System of Texas,  
c.       Georgia Department of Community Health  
d.       Ohio Operating Engineers  
e.       Ohio Public Employees Retirement System  
f.        School Board of Broward County  
g.       Public Employees Insurance Agency, an agency of the State of West 
Virginia,  
h.       Missouri Blind Pension Program  
• Florida Medicaid members  
• Illinois MMAI members  
• Puerto Rico state of residence and from any other geographical areas that are 
outside of the 50 states (residents of the District of Columbia are not excluded).  
A few mem bers have residence in the Virgin Islands or other US territories (i.e. 
Guam, American Samoa). They constitute a small count of patients and cannot be 
assigned to the 4 geographical areas typically reported for research.  
• Administrative Services Only (ASO)  
• All Group Medicare members  
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
For this study, potential participants will be identified through Humana -based datasets. 
The interventions in this study will be integrated in the usual patient messaging 
workflow. All Medicare Advant age beneficiaries have provided addresses to Humana 
 10 that can be used for mailed communications. 59,997 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries 
insured by Humana who are no t fully adherent to hypertension medications, defined as 
patients with  adherence level (as measured by the Proportion of Days Covered metric 
[PDC )) between 60 % and 85% (i.e., a “refill score” between 60 % and 8 5%).  
Study arms include six intervention arms and a usual care arm. All interventions will 
specifically target hypert ension medication adherence. All participants in the six 
intervention arms will receive t wo mailed letters . As with other minimal -risk, quality 
improvement studies the study team  has performed that involve the use of routine clinical 
tools such as patient portals and reminder letters  and where informed consent is 
impracticable, the study team  is requesting a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization . There are several reasons for this. One, the nature of this quality 
improvement intervention involv es testing different framing types in patient letters using 
a similar infrastructure as used during regular insurance communications. Second, the 
ability to understand the true effect of the intervention as it is delivered in the real world 
would be diffic ult to ascertain if formal informed consent from patients were sought. 
Third, obtaining formal informed consent would predictably reduce the number of 
patients participating in the study, especially those from under -represented populations, 
and therefore u ndermine the generalizability of the study results, a foundational aspect of 
pragmatic clinical trial principles. In our prior work, the study team has received a waiver 
of informed consent from the IRB for similar interventions.

5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
Study arms : 
1. A scorecard from Humana reporting patients’ medication adherence using a “refill 
score”  
2. The Arm 1 scorecard plus dynamic social norms messaging (noting the proportion of 
Humana members improving their medication refill scores)  
3. The Arm 1 scorecard, coming from the trusted messenger of a Humana -identified 
pharmacist taking the same medication  
4. A modified scorecard increasing processing fluency through a visual metaphor of 
“closing t he ring”

pharmacist taking the same medication  
7. No mailed message  (usual care)  
 
Study participants will be randomized into one of  7 arms . Participants in a treatment arm 
(arms 1 -6 above) will receiv e 1 of 6 variations of a mailed message informing them of their 
medication refill score . Participants in the usual care arm will  not receive a  message. All 
participants in the six i ntervention arms will receive two mailed letters  in total . The first 
message will contain the baseline refill score. The second message  will be sent within 60 
days of the first message and note any changes in the refill score.  
 
 11 5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
Quality control will be completed and messages will be sent by Humana’s internal 
communications teams, who have extensive experience sending similar messages and 
conducting similar studies. All messages will have similar overall design and l anguage, 
with the exception of specific sections of the messages that contain the behavioral elements 
to be tested.

7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The study team  believe s that the risks to participation for members are no more than 
minimal for several reasons.  First, the interventions encourage the refill of hypertension 
medications  indicated for and prescribed by patients’ physicians. Second, the study team 
will not be pr oviding any direct care to patients, and all hypertension medication refill 
decisions will ultimately be made by the patient, who will have the option of contacting 
their medical team and/or Humana for advice or specific recommendations. To minimize 
the ri sks to privacy from use of patient data, the study team  will safeguard any identifiable 
information and limit access to the information to study investigator actively involved in 
the research who have all undergone human subjects research training, using a  study ID in 
all other circumstances .  
 13 In this pragmatic trial, the study team  does not anticipate the occurrence of any incremental 
adverse events as a result of patients receiving information that encourages them to refill 
their prescribed hypertension m edications on time. All patients involved in the study have 
been prescribed these medications, and the study team  will exclude patients with refill 
scores that are already ≥85 %. Any adverse events from the medications themselves will be 
handled in the cour se of regular clinical care, as they are currently.  
 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
Not applicable due to the minimal risk profile of the proposed study.   
 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Eve nt (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. , abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in 
the res earch, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  
Given the minimal risk nature of the study, in which the intervention involves 
enhanced communication about hypertension medi cation adherence for Humana 
Medicare Advantage beneficiarie s for quality improvement purposes, the study team  
does not expect any SAEs or AEs related to the messages delivered in this trial.  
7.3.1 Reporting Procedures  
No additional SAEs or AEs are expected as e xpected to take place as a result of 
participation in this study, as the study team will not be providing any direct care to 
members and all hypertension medication adherence decisions will ultimately be 
made by the patient, with the potential consultation  of their medical team. If the study 
team becomes aware of any AEs or SAEs throughout the course of the study, the 
study team will collect this information.  
AE/SAE reporting to the IRB of record will also be completed in compliance with 
IRB reporting stan dards.  
7.3.2 Follow-up for Adverse Events  
No additional SAEs or AEs are expected to take place as a result of  participation in 
this study, as the study team will not be providing any direct care to members and all 
hypertension medication adherence decisions will ultimately be made by the patient, 
with the potential consultation of their medical team. However, the study team  will be 
 14 notified if patients reach out to Humana with feedback about the intervention 
messages. If the study team becomes  aware of any AEs or SAEs throughout the 
course of the study, the study team  will collect and document this information. All 
AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will 
be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study 
participant’s condition deteriorates at any ti me during the study, it will be recorded as 
an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as 
intermittent require documentation o f onset and duration of each episode.  
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION   
Not applicable —due to minimal risk of proposed study, there are no discontinuation 
criteria.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues  
The study team  hypothesize s that messages using dynamic social norms, messenger 
effects, and processing fluency in combination  will more effectively increase 
adherence compared to usual care, and can identify baseline clinical and 
demographic characteristics to predict the efficacy of each message.  
The primary outcome will be the average end -of-year adherence level  in each arm, 
stratified by refill cycle. The study team  will use Humana claims data for outcome 
measurement, which contains information on prescription claims from pharmacies, as 
well as patient information. L inear  regression will be used to compare outcomes 
between ea ch intervention arm versus usual care.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
The study team  estimate s a sample size of 59,997 (8,571 per arm) will provide 80% power 
to observe a ~1% difference in end -of-year adherence level  compared to the usual care arm, 
conservatively assuming a usual care arm rate of 70% and a Holm -Bonferroni corrected 
alpha of 0.05 to adjust the familywise error rates for multiple hypotheses testing. This 
difference is significant as the focus of CMS Sta r ratings measure interventions and are 
comparable to improvements seen in other similar large -scale behavioral communication 
studies. In secondary analyses, the study team  will compare arms against each other and 
adjust for any imbalanced baseline charact eristics . 
9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Study participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio with a random number 
generator into one of 7 arms, stratified by whether participants are on a 30 -day 
 15 medication refill cycle (~ 26% of overall study po pulation) or a 90 -day medication 
refill cycle (~ 74% of overall study population).  
 
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stopping Rules  
Not applicable —interim analyses are not planned.   
 
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1 Primary outcome   
The primary outcome will be the average end-of-year adherence level  in each 
arm, stratified by refill cycle  and adjusting for age, sex, and race .  
9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   
The secondary outcome will be the proportion of study participants with end -of-year 
PDC≥80%.  
In secondary analyses, the study t eam will compare arms against each other and 
adjust for any imbalanced baseline characteristics .  
 
9.5 Data Analyses  
The study team  will use Humana claims data for outcome measurement, which contains 
information on prescription claims from pharmacies, as well as patient information. 
Regular l inear regression will be used to compare outcomes between each intervention arm 
versus usual c are adjusting for the stratified randomized design, age, gender, and race. 
These adjustments are necessary as  the baseline differences in adherence in each of these 
groups could influence their responses to our intervention.  
 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY AS SURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
The study team  will use the Humana claims data for outcome measurement, which contains 
information on prescription claims from pharmacies, as well as patient information.  
 
10.2 Data Management  
Individually identifiable data are maintained for administrative purposes at Humana and are 
needed to identify members to contact for the intervention. Without use of individual level 
data, the study team  could not fulfill the study’s objectives. To protec t the confidentiality of 
these data, only Humana  associates with the appropriate data privileges will have access to 
personal identifiers while linking the data and constructing study variables for the trial.  
 16 10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1  Training  
All members  of the research team have completed or will complete appropriate 
human subjects research training and patient privacy training related to the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) . 
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Not applicable —no study q uality control committee.  
10.3.3  Metrics  
Quality control metrics for outcome measures will include checks that messages are 
being a) correctly received based on randomization assignment and b) correctly 
targeted to 30 - vs. 90 -day refill  cycles . The study team  will conduct random checks 
that targeting is being done correctly.  
10.3.4  Protocol  Deviations  
The principal investigator will review study conduct (e.g., protocol deviations) on a 
monthly basis. The principal investigator will also ensure that all protocol devia tions 
for the trials are reported to the IRB according to the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
10.3.5  Monitoring  
The study team  will be notified if patients or staff reach out to Humana  with feedback 
about the intervention messages.  If the study team become s aware of any AEs or 
SAEs throughout the course of the study, the study team  will collect this information. 
Any reports of deaths will be submitted to the IRB within 24 hours. Any unexpected 
SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 48 hours of the study’s kn owledge of the 
SAE. All other reported SAEs and AEs received by the study team will be reported to 
the IRB quarterly.  
 
11 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB 
responsible for oversight of the study.    
 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
As with other minimal -risk, quality improvement studies the study team  has performed that 
involve the use of routine clinical tools such as patient portals and reminder letters and 
where informed consent is impracticable, the study team  is requesting a waiver of informed 
consent and HIPAA authorization . There are several reasons  for this. One, the nature of this 
quality improvement intervention involves testing different framing types in patient letters 
using a similar infrastructure as used during regular insurance communications. Second, the 
ability to understand the true effec t of the intervention as it is delivered in the real world 
 17 would be difficult to ascertain if formal informed consent from patients were sought. Third, 
obtaining formal informed consent would predictably reduce the number of patients 
participating in the s tudy, especially those from under -represented populations, 
and therefore undermine the generalizability of the study results, a foundational aspect of 
pragmatic clinical trial principles. The study team has received a waiver of informed 
consent from the IR B for similar interventions.   
 
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Individually identifiable data are maintained for administrative purposes at Humana and are 
needed to identify members to contact for the intervention. Without use of individual level 
data, the st udy team  could not fulfill the study’s objectives. To protect the confidentiality of 
these data,  only Humana associates with the appropriate data privileges, will  have access to 
personal identifiers while linking the data and constructing study variables for the trial.   All 
data will be maintained at Humana, where the IRB -approved analyses will be performed. 
Only aggregated study results will be shared externally . All study team members a re 
trained in research management . 
To protect against the risk of inappropriate disclosure of personal health information, no 
identifiable or individual level data will be shared outside of Humana and all data will be 
stored securel y, as they are at present. All members of the research team have completed or 
will complete appropriate human subjects research training and patient privacy training 
related to HIPAA.  
To protect against the risk of inappropriate disclosure of personal heal th information, only 
Humana team members will access study data with encrypted identifiers. As described, all 
members of the research team have completed or will complete appropriate human subjects 
research training and patient privacy training related to the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA).  
 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are  
protected.  
 
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
General oversight of the project by the principal investigator  will occur throughout the 
study period, including regular contact with  the study team  to obtain ongoing feedback.   
The study team will not be providing any  direct care to patients, and all medication 
decisions will ultimately be made by the patient, with the potential consultation of their 
medical team. Any adverse events will be handled in the course of regular clinical care. 
Given the minimal risks involve d in participation in this study, the study team  does not 
anticipate any unacceptable adverse events. However, our plan for data and safety 
 18 monitoring does include multiple mechanisms to ensure minimal risk of participation in the 
research.  
If the study team  become s aware of any AEs or SAEs throughout the course of the study, 
the study team  will collect this information. Any reports of deaths will be submitted to the 
IRB within 24 hours. Any unexpected SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 48 hour s of 
the study’s knowledge of the SAE. All other reported SAEs and AEs received by the study 
team will be reported to the IRB quarterl y.

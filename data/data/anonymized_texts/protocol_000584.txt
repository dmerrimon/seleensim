I. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
A. Introduction:  
The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with and without 
diabetes is well established (1-5). Extensive data from observational and prospective randomized controlled  
trials in hospitalized patients have reported a strong association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical 
outcome, such as mortality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), infections and overall complications ( 1, 4, 6-8).  
Most clinical trials in critically ill and general medicine and surgery patients have reported that improvement of glycemic control reduces LOS, risk of multiorgan failure and systemic infections ( 9-11), as well as short - 
and long- term mortality (6, 11) in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes.   
 
Clinical guidelines from professional organizations ( 12-14) recommend the use of subcuta neous (SQ) 
insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with T2D.  The 
two most common SQ insulin regimens for inpatient glycemic management are sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) and basal bolus insulin therapy in combination with correction insulin scale ( 15, 16).  The use of 
basal bolus regimen results in better glycemic control and in lower rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) (16-19).  The basal bolus regimen; however, requires multiple insulin 
daily injections and is associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia reported in up to 32% of non- ICU 
patients with T2D (16, 18, 19).   
 
We recently completed a randomized two- center pilot open label trial aiming to determine differences 
in glycemic control between treatment with sitagliptin (Januvia ) alone or in combination with glargine 
compared to a standard basal bolus regimen in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D (see preliminary result section).  We found no differences in mean daily BG, number of BG re adings within target, 
frequency of hypoglycemia, LOS and hospital complications.  We also found that patients treated with sitagliptin alone required less insulin dose (p<0.001) and lower number of insulin injections per day (p<0.001) compared to treatment with basal bolus regimen. These results suggest that treatment with a DPP -
4 inhibitor is safe and effective for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with T2D.  T hese results 
are of great clinical importance and may represent a major improvement in management of hospitalized 
patients with T2D; however, they need to be confirmed by a large multicenter RCT.  Accordingly, we propose to determine the safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitor therapy for in-hospital and post- discharge 
management of general m edicine and surgical patients with T2D. 
 
B. Hypothesis: 
We hypothesize that treatment with linagliptin (Tradjenta®) once daily plus correction 
(supplemental) doses with a rapid- acting insulin analog before meals will result in a similar glycemic control 
than treatment with glargine (Lantus ) once daily plus rapid-acting insulin before meals in general surgery 
patients with T2D.   
 
C. Specific Aims:  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine whether in -hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean daily blood 
glucose concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between treatment with  
linagliptin (Tradjenta®) plus correction doses with a rapid -acting insulin analog before meals and a 
basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and rapid- acting insulin analog before meals in general 
surgery patients with T2D.   Surgery patients with T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic agents (OAD) or 
with low total daily dose insulin therapy ( ≤0.5 unit/kg/day) will be randomized to receive linagliptin (group 
1) or basal bolus insulin regimen (group 2).  If needed, patients in both groups will receive supplemental 
(correction) doses of rapid- acting insulin (lispro, aspart or glulisine) before me als for BG > 140 mg/dl.   
 
Specific Aim 2:   To determine the efficacy and safety of an HbA1c based discharge algorithm in controlling 
BG after discharge in surgery patients with T2D.  Patients who participate in the in -hospital arm (Aim 1) will 
 3 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
be invited to enroll in this open label prospective outpatient study.  The total duration of the study is 3 
months.  Patients with an a dmission HbA1c <7% will be discharged on their same outpatient antidiabetic 
regimen or linagliptin 5 mg once daily.  Patients with an  HbA1c between 7% and 9% will be discharged on 
their outpatient treatment plus linagliptin once daily.  Patients with an admission A1C ≥ 9% will be 
discharged on a combination of metformin plus linagliptin  and 50% of basal insulin used in the hospital stay. 
 
II. BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS OF WORK IN THE FIELD.  
A large body of evidence suggests that in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes, the 
presence of hyperglycemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes (1-6, 20-23).  Evidence from 
observational studies indicates that hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of complications and 
mortality, a longer hospital stay, a higher admission rate to the ICU, and a higher likelihood that transitional or nursing home care after hospital discharge will be required ( 1, 2, 6, 24- 28).  Prospective randomized trials 
in critical care patients have shown that glycemic control reduces short- and long- term mortality, multiorgan 
failure and systemic infections, length of hospital and ICU stay [7, 9-11], and to lower total hospitalization cost (29).  Similarly, attainment of targeted glucose control in the setting of cardiac surgery is associated 
with a significant reduction in deep sternal wound infections and mortality rate ( 9, 30, 31). Based on these 
observational and interventional studies, improved glycemic control is recommended in patients with critical illness (3, 6, 23, 26, 28, 32).  
 
The importance of hyperglycemia also applies to adult patients admitted to general surgical and 
medical wards.  In such patients, the presence of hyperglycemia is associated with prolonged hospital stay, infection, disability after hospital discharge, and death (1, 4, 6).  Over the short- term, hyperglycemia can 
adversely affect fluid balance and immune function, and it can promote inflammation ( 26, 33).  Our r esearch 
group reported that inpatient hyperglycemia (defined as a fasting blood glucose ≥  126 mg/dl or random 
blood glucose ≥  200 mg/dl on two or more occasions) in subjects with and without history of diabetes was 
associated with longer length of hospital stay and increased hospital mortality (1).  In general surgical 
patients, a serum glucose > 220 mg/dL on postoperative day one has been shown to be a sensitive predictor of the later development of postoperative nosocomial infection ( 4).  In patients with hypergly cemia (BG > 
220 mg/dL) on postoperative day one, the infection rate was 2.7 times that observed (31.3% versus 11.5%) in diabetic patients without hyperglycemia.  These data strongly indicate that hyperglycemia from any etiology is a predictor of poor outcome in hospitalized patients in critical care units or in general medicine or surgical services, and that improvement in outcomes can be achieved with improved glycemic control.     
 
Recent prospective, randomized multi- center trials have shown that basal b olus insulin regimens 
result in improved glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale regular insulin (SSRI) in general medical and surgical patients with T2D (16, 18, 19).  In the Rabbit-2 
medicine trial ( 34), insulin naïve patients with T2D were randomized to receive glargine once daily and 
glulisine before meals or SSRI four t imes daily.  Patients treated with glargine + glulisine had greater 
improvement in blood glucose control than SSRI ( 19).  The Rabbit Surgery trial compared the safety and 
efficacy of a basal bolus insulin regimen with glargine once daily and glulisine before meals to SSRI in patients with T2D undergoing general surgery.  We observed a lower mean daily glucose concentration after the 1st day and a reduction in the frequency of hospital complications with basal bolus as compared with SSRI treatment (19).  These results indicate that basal/bolus insulin regimen is a pref erred regimen over 
SSRI alone in the hospital management of patients with T2D.  The use of basal bolus approach; however, is labor intensive requiring multiple daily insulin injections (4 to 6), and have a significant risk of hypoglycemia (19, 35) reported in up to 32% of hospitalized patients with T2D in general wards.   
 
We recently completed the first pi lot study on the safety and efficacy of treatment with sitagliptin 
(Januvia) alone or in combination with basal insulin in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D 
(see preliminary result section).   In this study, 90 patients with T2D randomized to sitagliptin once daily,

Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
In summary , our preliminary studies indicate that 1) treatment with basal bolus regimen results in better 
metabolic control and in a lower rate of hospital complications than treatment with SSRI in patients with 
T2D, and 2) the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor alone or in combination with basal insulin may represent effective alternatives to basal bolus insulin regimen for the management of hospitalized patients with T2D.   
  IV. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN.  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine whether in -hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean daily glucose 
concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between treatment with  linagliptin 
(Tradjenta®) plus correction doses with a rapid-acting insulin analog before meals and a basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and rapid -acting insulin analog before meals in general surgery patients with T2D.   
 
IV.a. Rationale. The result of several observational and interventional studies indicate that hyperglycemia is associated with poor hospital outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, increase rate of wound and systemic infections, disability after hospital discharge, and death (1, 26).  Previous studies have 
shown that basal bolus regimens in patients with T2D result in a significant improvement in glycemic control and in lower rate of hospital complications compared to SSRI in patients with T2D (40-42). In our 
preliminary study, the use of sitagliptin  alone or in combination with basal insulin was proven to be as 
effective in improving glycemic control compared to basal bolus insulin regimen.   Linagliptin  has a unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that makes it an a ttractive agent for 
the treatment of inpatients with T2D  including its rapid -onset of action in improving glycemic control, low 
risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy, large volume of distribution into tissues, and lack of relevant alterations in linagliptin  pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Linagliptin  
is a new orally active small -molecule inhibitor of DPP-4, licensed in the US in 2011 to improve glycemic 
control in adults with T2D ( 36). Based on our preliminary experience and the proven efficacy of linag liptin 
in improving glycemic control, safety and excellent tolerance, we believe that linagliptin may represent an excellent alternative to basal bolus treatment in subjects with T2D.   
 IV.b. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
A total of 280 randomized (300 patient s consented  to account for screen failures ) general surgery 
patients with T2D treated with diet, oral hypoglycemic agents, or low -dose (≤ 0.5
 units/kg/day) insulin 
therapy prior to admission will be included in this prospective, randomized, open label trial to compare the safety and efficacy of  linagliptin  once daily versus b asal bolus regimen with glargine once daily plus rapid -
acting insulin before meals.  Both treatment groups will receive  corrective doses of rapid -acting insulin  
analogs (aspart, lispro or glulisine) before meals for BG > 140 mg/dl.  
 
Study Outcomes:  
The primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control as measured by mean daily 
BG concentration between linagliptin and basal bolus therapy.    
Secondary outcome is to compare differences between treatment groups in any of the following measures:  
1. Number of hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe hypoglycemic events (<40 mg/dl).  
2. Number of episodes of hyperglycemia (BG > 300 mg/dl) after the first day of treatment.  
3. Total daily dose of insulin. 
4. Length of hospital stay.

IV.c. Overall Design and Study Interventions  
 This multicenter randomized clinical trial will include male or female subjects with known history of 
diabetes between 18 -80 years of age admitted to general surgery (non-ICU) service.  Due to the design of 
this study (i.e. enrollment of subjects in need of acute care), there will be no run-in period.  Upon arrival to the Emergency Department or surgery service, subjects will be screened for the study.  Patients with a known 
history of T2D treated with diet alone, any combination of oral hypoglycemic agents or low-dose insulin therapy (≤0.5 unit/kg/day) prior to admission will be considered potential candidates in this study.  The goal 
of therapy is to maintain fasting and pre-meal BG < 140 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia.  Treatment assignment will be coordinated by a research pharmacist at each institution following a computer -generated 
block randomization table.  Diabetic patients with a BG > 140 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL without ketosis will be randomized consecutively (using a randomization table) to receive:  
 
• Group 1.  Linagliptin onc e daily*  
• Group 2.  Basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and lispro, aspart or glulisine before meals*  
 
* Supplemental (correction) doses rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro, aspart or glulisine) will be given for BG > 140 per sliding scale if needed.  Rapid- acting insulin may vary at different institutions.  
 
 
The primary medical team (PMT)  will decide on the treatment for the surgical and other medical problem(s) 
for which patients are admitted.  The PMT will also decide patient’s discharge orders  for the treatment of 
their primary diagnosis.  At discharge, patients will be followed by the ir primary care physician, surgery 
team, and the diabetes research team .   The recommended insulin therapy at discharge will be based on the 
degree of glycemic co ntrol (HbA1c level) as described in Aim 2. After discharge, a member of the diabetes 
research team will contact patients via telephone call every 2 weeks for a total of 3 months.   In addition, 
patients will be asked to attend an outpatient clinic visit within one month and after 3 months of hospital 
discharge to assess level glycemic control (fasting and premeal BG levels, presence of hypoglycemia), and to determine the presence of complications after discharge (wound or systemic infection, hospital readmission, cardiac events, etc).     
 IV.e. Treatment Groups:  
 
            
          Glargine once daily plus rapid- acting insulin before meals  (n=140) 
  
   N= 280  
Linagliptin once daily plus correction doses of rapid- acting insulin  (n=140)

GROUP 1.  Linagliptin Group.  
 
• Discontinue oral antidiabetic drugs (sulfonylureas, repaglinide, nateglinide, metformin, pioglitazone), 
insulin and non- insulin injected antidiabetic medication (pramlintide, exenatide) on admission.  
 
• Linagliptin 5 mg once daily  
 
• Supplemental (correction) insulin.   Supplemental (lispro, aspart or glulisine) insulin will be 
administered following the “supplemental/sliding scale” protocol (Table 1).   
• If a patient is able and expected to eat all or most of his/her meals, supplemental ( lispro, 
aspart or glulisine)  insulin will be administered before each meal and at bedtime following the 
“usual” dose of the sliding scale protocol. 
• If a patient is not able to eat, supplemental (lispro, aspart or glulisine)  insulin will be 
administered ever y 6 hours (6-12-6-12) following the “sensitive” dose of the sliding scale. 
 
• Insulin adjustment.  The supplemental ( lispro, aspart or glulisine) insulin dose will be adjusted as 
follow:  
• If the fasting and pre- meal plasma glucose are persistently >140 mg/dl  in the absence of 
hypoglycemia, the supplemental (lispro, aspart or glulisine) insulin scale could be increased 
from sensitive to usual, or from  usual to resistant scale.   
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the supplemental (lispro, aspart or glulisine) insulin 
should be decreased from insulin resistant to usual scale or from usual to sensitive scale.   
• The attending physician may consider using the total supplemental insulin dose, patient’s 
nutritional intake, and results of blood glucose testing to adjust insulin regimen.    
• Blood glucose monitoring.  Blood glucose will be measured before each meal and at bedtime (or 
every 6 hours if a patient is not eating) using a glucose meter.  In addition, blood glucose will be 
measured at any time if a patient experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia or if requested by the treating physician.

• Glargine insulin w ill be given once daily, at the same time of the day.   
• Patients will receive the full-dose of glargine insulin (even if NPO).     
• Prandial insulin (lispro, aspart or glulisine) will be given in three equally divided doses within 30 
minutes before/after each meal.  To prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, the dose 
of lispro, aspart or glulisine will be held.  
• Insulin adjustment.  The total daily insulin dose will be adjusted as follow:  
• Fasting and pre- meal BG between 100 -140 mg/dl without hypoglycemia the previous day: no 
change  
• Fasting and pre- meal BG between 141 -180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 10% every day 
• Fasting and pre-meal BG >180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 20% every day  
• Fasting and pre- meal BG between 70 -99 mg/dl: decre ase glargine dose by 10% every day  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 20%.   
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 30 -40%.

glulisine)  insulin will be administered before each meal and at bedtime following the “usual” 
dose of the sliding scale protocol. 
• If a patient is not able to eat, supplemental (lispro, aspart or glulisine)  insulin will be administered 
every 6 hours (6-12-6-12) following the “sensitive” dose of the sliding scale. 
• Blood glucose monitoring.  Blood glucose will be measured before each meal and at bedtime (or 
every 6 hours if a patient is not eating) using a glucose meter.  In addition, blood glucose will be measured at any time if a patient experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia or if requested by the treating physician.

V. Specific Aim 2:   To determine the efficacy and safety of an A1C based discharge algorithm in 
controlling BG after discharge in patients with T2D.    
Patients who participate in the in -hospital arm (Aim 1) will be invited to enroll in this open label prospective 
outpatient study.  The total duration of the study is 3 months.   
 
V.a. Rationale.  Few studies have addressed the efficacy of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents after 
hospital discharge. In a recent pilot study we assessed the efficacy of an HbA1c based algorithm for the 
management of patients with T2D (see preliminary results section, Fig. 5). Patients with a high HbA1c were discharged on a combination of OADs and basal insulin or on a basal bolus regimen. The admission HbA1c on admission of 8.75% decreased to 7.9% and 7.35% after 4 and 12 weeks of hospital discharge (p<0.01). These data indicate that the admission HbA1c is beneficial in designing the discharge treatment algorithm after discharge in non -ICU patients with T2D.  Linagliptin has a unique pha rmacokinetic and pharmaco -
dynamic profile that makes it an attractive agent for the treatment of with T2D  including its rapid -onset of 
action in improving glycemic control without weight gain and the low risk of hypoglycemia. Based on our preliminary exper ience and the proven efficacy of linagliptin in improving glycemic control, we believe that 
linagliptin may represent an excellent alternative to insulin therapy after discharge in subjects with T2D.   
 IV.a. Study Outcomes:  
The primary outcome of the outpatient arm is to explore the safety and efficacy of linagliptin after hospital 
discharge.  D ifferences from baseline (hospital admission) in HbA1c concentration will be assessed at 4 
weeks and 12 weeks after discharge.    
 
Secondary outcome will include: 
1. Fasting and postprandial BG concentration 
2. Number of hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe hypoglycemic events (<40 mg/dl).  
3. Number of patients with HbA1c <7.0%  
4. Total daily dose of insulin. 
5. Number of emergency room visits and hospital readmissions 
6. Number of complications: wound infection, pneumonia, acute renal failure and mortality.    
 
IV.b. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
The trial is a 12-week, open label trial investigating the efficacy and safety of linagliptin as add -on to 
existing oral antidiabetic drug  (OAD) or insulin therapy in patients T2D after hospital discharge.   
 
 
 
V.a. Inhospital Diabetes Education.  Prior to discharge, participants will be trained on: 
1. Diabetes education if not received within 1 year of admission or if discharge on insulin ther apy.   
2. ADA targets for fasting and premeal BG between 90 to 130 mg/dL. 
3. Use of glucose meters for home glucose self -monitoring (meters may vary at different institutions).   
4. Keeping BG records, and will receive a log -book to record glucose tests results. 
5. Hypoglycemia recognition and management (see VI.B.) 
6. Insulin administration (if needed). 
 
V.b. Follow- up Care:  
• Insulin therapy is the standard of care at discharge, therefore, glargine or rapid- acting insulin analogs 
will not be provided to participants. The choice of rapid -acting analogs will be based on formulary 
availability at each institution.  
• Patients to be discharged on linagliptin will receive 1 -month supply by the research hospital 
pharmacy.  
 11 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
• After discharge, a member of the diabetes research team will contact patients via telephone call every 
2 weeks for a total of 3 months.   
• Patients will be asked to attend an outpatient clinic visit within one month of hospital discharge.  During this visit, patients will receive a 2 month supply of linagliptin and  will be asked to return to 
clinic 2 months later (3 month after discharge visit).  
• Recommendation on insulin adjustment will be provided to patients and their PCP after each telephone contact and clinic visit by a license physician (fellow or study physic ian) (see section Vf).

VIII. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES   
 
VIII.a.  Admission Laboratory Studies  
Standard of care laboratory studies including glucose, HbA1c, chemistry, hematology, and urine will be measured on admission and as determined by the treating physician.   
 
 
VIII.b. Treatment of Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL) 
 15 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level < 70 mg/dL will be treated following standard 
hypoglycemia protocols available at both institutions.  Patients with hypoglycemia will be treated as per 
protocol: For blood glucose < 70 mg/dL, follow hypoglycemic orders below: 
• If patient is alert and can tolerate oral intake, give 20 grams of fast -acting carbohydrate (6 oz. fruit juice 
or regular soda, crackers).  
• If patient not alert and cannot tolerate oral intake, give1ampule (50 mL) of D 50. 
• Check finger stick BG q 15 minutes and repeat above treatment until BG > 100 mg/dL. 
• Once BG > 100 mg/dL, repeat finger stick BG 1 hour later and treat as follows: 
o If BG < 70 mg/dL, call MD and follow y hypoglycemia orders (above) 
o If BG 70 – 100 mg/dL, give snack/scheduled meal and check BG q1 h until BG >100 mg/dl 
o If BG > 100, no further treatment needed. 
 
VIII.c.    Assessment and Monitoring of Hospital Mortality  
All study subjects will be followed daily by the investigators and th e date and presumed cause of death will 
be recorded.  Information on the attending physician’s summary of events surrounding subject’s demise will 
also be documented.    
VIII.d.  Assessment and Monitoring of Nosocomial Infections  
Nosocomial infections will be diagnosed based on standardized CDC criteria (44).  New nosocomial 
infections will not be diagnosed until 48 hr after study initiation to minimize the chance that the infection 
was actually present (but undiagnosed) prior to stu dy initiation.   
The investigators will review each subject’s records regarding potential new infection diagnosis daily on each weekday from Monday to Friday. Data from the weekends will be collected on the following Monday.  The coded infection diagnosis and the presumed causative microorganism will be determined daily on a Monday to Friday basis, with weekend data entered on the following Monday by the coordinators.   
 
IX. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
This study is randomized multicenter, open- label controlled trial. The overall hypothesis is that in non- ICU 
patients with T2D, treatment with linagliptin once daily will result in a similar improvement in glycemic control and in a lower frequency of hypoglycemic events than treatment with basal bolus insulin regime n 
with basal bolus insulin regimen .   
 
IX.a. Sample Size and Power Calculations: The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control 
measured by mean daily BG concentration between treatment groups. To show the non- inferiority of 
linagliptin to basal bo lus in terms of glycemic control, we set the equivalence margin as 18mg/dl, from a 
view that a BG difference less than 18 mg/dl is usually not considered as clinically significant. Based on the preliminary data from Rabbit medicine and Rabbit Surgery trials, it may be reasonable to assume the standard deviation of mean daily BG is bounded above by 50 mg/dl. With two- sample t tests or Wilcoxon 
tests, one sided, alpha=0.05, 121 subjects for each treatment arm would be needed to ensure 80% power to reject the hypothesis that the mean daily BG in patients treated with linagliptin is no more than 18 mg/dl 
higher than that in patients treated with Basal Bolus.  In our calculation, we applied Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons across four time points during follow-up. Accounting for 10- 15% attrition 
rate, we would need 140 patients per treatment group. This leads to a final total sample size estimate of 280 randomized patients.  
 
Secondary outcomes of major interest in this study are outcomes on hypoglycemia (BG<70 mg/dl) and the   composite of hospital mortality and perioperative complications. The assessment of group difference in hypoglycemia will mainly be based on the comparison of proportions of patients who have any hypoglycemia event during the study between the two treatment groups. Based on the Rabbit Surgery trail, 23% of patients that received Basal Bolus had at least one hypoglycemia episode. Assuming the same rate of hypoglycemia in the Basal Bolus group in this study, given the sample size of 121subjects per treatment 
 16 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
group, based on a two sided Fisher’s exact test with alpha=0.05, we would have 80% power to detect an odds 
ratio in hypoglycemia rate of 0.33 in linagliptin group (versus Basal Bolus group), which corresponds to a smaller difference in hypoglycemia rate than that observed in Rabbit Surgery study. In the following table, we give the estimated power under different assumed group differences in hypoglycemia rate, represented by four hypothesized odds ratios. 
 
Table: Estimated power with 121 subjects per group (after attrition) and the anticipated hypoglycemia rate of 23% based on two-sided Fisher’s exact test with alpha=0.05. 
 
Odds Ratio  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 
Power >0.99 0.96 0.85 0.67 
   
For the composite outcome of hospital mortality and perioperative complications, we consider complications including wound infection, bacteremia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and major cardiovascular events. Based on the Rabbit Surgery trial, the rate of the composite outcome is about 10% in the Basal Bolus group. Assuming the same rate for patients receiving Basal Bolus in this study, we would have 80% power to detect an odds ratio in the composite outcome of 0.09 in linagliptin group (versus Basal Bolus group).   
IX.b. Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control measured by mean daily BG concentration . We will 
first perform cross -sectional analyses using one- way ANOVA, followed by repeated measures ANOVA to 
estimate and test the difference between the two treatment groups while simultaneously examining mean 
daily BG across multiple days during treatment. A mixed effect model may be used to further account center effect or other potential confounders for the BG outcome. Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model checking procedures will be applied to examine the fit of the developed models. 
 
IX.c. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
Secondary endpoints in this study include rate of hypoglycemia, number of hypoglycemia events, number of episodes of severe hyperglycemia, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality and differences between groups 
on a composite of hospital mortality and perioperative complications including wound infections (deep and superficial), bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and major cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias).  For hypoglycemia outcomes, we 
will first conduct nonparametric comparisons of the rate of hypoglycemia based on a two-sided Chi- square 
test (or Fisher’s exact test in the presence of low incidence rates), followed by the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel 
test which adjusts for the potential center effect. Univariate Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial regression) will be performed to assess whether there is any difference in the number of hypoglycemia events between the two treatment groups. We will further conduct m ultivariate Logistic regression, Poisson 
regression (or negative binomial regression) to estimate the difference in the rate and frequency of hypoglycemia while adjusting for relevant covariates.  Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model checking procedures, such as deviance residual plot and Hosmer- Lemeshow test, will be applied to 
examine the fit of the developed models. Similar analy ses will be conducted to severe hyperglycemia, 
composite of hospital mortality and perioperative complications. For continuous outcomes, such as length of hospital stay, we will use two -sample t-tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests to compare them between  the 
intensive BG control group and the conventional BG control group. Transformations will be applied if normality violation is detected.  Multivariate linear regression will be further conducted to assess the difference in continuous secondary outcomes between the two groups while other relevant covariates. We will use standard model selection and model checking procedures for linear regression to decide the final models and assess their fits to the data.

X. Potential Risks to the Subject:  
Hypoglycemia.    It is possible that following the proposed protocol, patients receiving basal bolus insulin 
regimen or linagliptin in combination to insulin may develop hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL).  The risk of 
hypoglycemia in non- ICU patients treated with subcutaneo us insulin in previous RCT has varied between 
4% and 32%.  We expect that approximately 10-20% of subjects treated with basal bolus protocol will experience one or more episodes of hypoglycemia.  The frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D treated with linagliptin is similar to placebo, thus, we expect to have a frequency of hypoglycemia similar to 
that reported during SSRI alone (< 5%).   
 
The number of reports of hypoglycemia will be analyzed statistically.  For the purpose of this 
analysis, hypogl ycemia is defined as a capillary and/or laboratory BG < 70 mg/dL.  Severe hypoglycemia is 
defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia in which the subject required the assistance of another person and blood glucose less than 40 mg/dL. 
 
Hyperglycemia.    In the Rabbit Trial, 14% of patients treated with SSRI  remained with blood glucose of > 
240 mg/dL despite increasing the SSI dose to the maximal or insulin resistant scale.  In such patients, glycemic control rapidly improved in all of the SSI  failure subjects after starting basal bolus insulin, and the 
glucose target of < 140 mg/dL was achieved within 4 days of initiating basal bolus insulin therapy.  Queale et al (
15) reported that more than 25% had more than 1 episode of hyperglycemia during the first 4 days of 
hospitalization.  We expect that approximately < 20% of subjects treated with insulin glargine or with linagliptin plus lispro, aspart or glulisine insulin will have severe hype rglycemia.  The number of reports of 
severe hyperglycemia will be analyzed statistically.  For the purpose of this analysis, severe hyperglycemia is defined as a capillary and/or laboratory BG >300 mg/dL.   
 
Blood samples will be taken.  Risks associated with drawing blood are pain, bruising at the site of the 
needle stick, bleeding, and on rare occasions, fainting, light- headedness and infection.   
 
XI. Protection against Risks:   
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor capillary 
blood glucose at the bedside using a hand-held glucose meter, b) only experienced nurses/or phlebotomist will draw blood samples, and c) women of reproductive age who are sexually active will undergo a urine pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study.  To prevent significant clinical events that may result with the use of insulin, no patients with significant liver and renal impairment will be recruited in this study.    
 
Hypoglycemia:  We expect that approximately 20% of subjects treated with basal bolus insulin will 
experience one or more episodes of hypoglycemia and less than 5% of linagliptin patients will experience hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia will be treated with dextrose infusion.  Dextrose 50% solution will be given for glucose values < 70 mg/dl.  If the patient is awake, 25 ml (1/2 amp) will be given IV.  If the patient is not awake:  50ml (1 amp) will be given STAT.  Blood glucose levels will be repeated in 15 minutes and dextrose administration will be repeated as  needed for values < 70 mg/dl.  If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the 
total daily insulin dose will be decreased by 10% to 30% in the basal bolus group and by moving to a less sensitive supplemental insulin column (see appendix 3).   
Hyperglycemia:  supplemental insulin will be given up to 4 times daily to cover for BG >140 mg/ dl (see 
appendix 2).  Patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 glucose readings ≥ 400 mg/dl, ≥ 3 consecutive glucose 
readings >240 mg/dl, or with a mean daily blood glucose concentration ≥240 mg/dl) will be considered as failure and discontinued from the study.  Patients receiving linagliptin therapy will be switched to basal bolus insulin or continuous insulin infusion.  Dose of insulin will be adjusted and if needed, patients treated with basal/bolus insulin will be started on continuous insulin infusi on.   
 
 18 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
Acute renal failure: the total daily dose of insulin will be adjusted as per serum creatinine concentration.  The 
total daily insulin dose will be reduced to 0.3 unit/kg in patients with creatinine >2.0 mg/dl.  The dose of linagliptin does not need to be adjusted in patients with renal dysfunction.     
XII.  DATA handling and record keeping:  
Data collection records with personal identifiers will be stored in locked file cabinets.  Blood samples drawn 
and stored in conjunction with this study will not be labeled with information that could directly identify study subjects.  Blood samples will be stored at Dr Umpierrez Research Laboratories in the Grady Diabetes Clinic.  Presentation of the study results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to research and confidential records will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, and the IRB at Emory University. 
 
XIII. Study drugs and materials:  
Clinical trial materials will be labeled and should be handled and stored according to the respective 
hospital’s regulatory requirements.  After discharge, patients will be re -started on their pre- admission OADs 
(except for DPP4-inhibitors, GLP-1, and selected drugs in the presence of contraindicatio n, i.e., metformin 
and renal failure).  
 
Storage and Drug Accountability of Study Medication(s)  
Linagliptin  will be stored and dispensed by the research pharmacy at each institution.  Linagliptin  will be 
dispensed to each subject as required according to t reatment group. The research/clinical staff will perform 
drug accountability by asking patients to return all unused, partly used and unused at each visit.   
 
Stock bottles of linagliptin will be stored at the hospital research pharmacy at a controlled roo m temperature 
between 59 to 86o Fahrenheit.   A daily room temperature will be documented (Monday - Friday) s well as 
the minimum and maximum daily temperature reached.   The minimum and max temperatures during 
weekends will be recorded on Monday morning.   
 
Study drug will be stored at the Investigational Drug Office inside the hospital pharmacy, and will be kept 
locked when not in use.  For the inpatient trial, unit-dose bottles would be stored in a pharmacy Pyxis.  The 
room temperature is also captured for drug kept in the pharmacy pyxis.   
 
Drug received for investigational use will be logged by Lot number specific log per study.  All drug received 
and dispensed will be recorded on the study specific / drug specific / lot specific log.  
 XIV. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open label randomized controlled trial.  Patients will be randomized consecutively using a 
computer generated randomization table provided by Dr. Limin Peng at the Emory School of Public Health.  The randomization table will be mailed to the research pharmacist at each institution who will be in charge of the randomization and group assignment.  
 
XV. Adverse events:  
XV.a. Definitions of adverse events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre -
existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
 
XV.b. Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse e vent (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life -threatening, 
results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical 
 19 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Patients may be hospitalised for administrative or social reasons during the study (e.g. days on which infusion takes place, long distance from home to site,). These and other hospitalisations planned at the beginning of the study do not need to be reported as a SAE in case they have been reported at screening visit in the source data and have been performed as planned. 
XV.c. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on regulatory recommendation that is based on the experience with other compounds in the 
DPP -4 inhibitor class, the following events should be defined as adverse events of special interest.  
• Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, angioedema- like events, and  anaphylaxis  
• Skin lesions such as exfoliative dermatitis, and exfoliative ras h 
• Renal adverse events (e.g. renal failure, >=2x increase of creatinine from baseline)  
• Pancreatitis  
• Hepatic adverse events such as hepatitis, liver injury, and increased liver enzymes. Hepatic injury is 
defined by the following alterations of liver parameters: For patients with normal liver function (ALT, 
AST and bilirubin within normal limits) at baseline an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN 
combined with an elevation of bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample.  
 
Refer to the appendix 1 for a list of prefered terms (PT’s) that are considered as AEs of Special Interest.  
 
Protocol-specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious Adverse 
Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousnes s criteria. 
 
XV.d. Intensity of adverse event  
The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following: • Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated  
• Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity • Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
 
XV.e. Causal relationship of adverse event  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de- challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as 
concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms.  
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship betwe en the investigational product administered and the AE.  
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product administered and the 
AE.  
 
XV.f. Worsening of the underlying disease or other pre- existing co nditions 
Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions will be recorded as an (S ) AE in the 
(e) CRF. 
 XV.g. Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination, and laboratory test results 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results will be recorded as an (S ) AE 
in the (e) CRF, if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator. 
XV.h. Responsibilities for SAE reporting  
The Sponsor  shall report  (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the trialdefined follow -up 
period)  all SAEs and  non-serious AEs  occurring at the same time and/or which are medically related to the 
 20 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
SAE and Adverse Events of Special Interest by fax or other secure method to the BI Unique Entry Point  in 
accordanc e with timeline  specified in the pharmcovigilance agreement  
 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity, treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The investigat or will determine the 
expectedness of the investigational drug to the AEs as defined in the Listed Adverse Events section of the 
Boehringer Ingelheim’s (BI’s) Investigator Brochure for the Product or BI Drug Information e.g. Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or Product Information (PI) for the authorised Study Drug provided by BI. 
 
XVI. Ethics 
XVI.a.   Informed Consent.   
After identification of eligible patients these individuals will be provided basic information regarding the 
study and, if interes ted, a member of the research staff using inclusion/exclusion criteria delineated 
elsewhere in the protocol will then screen patients.  Informed consent will be obtained before any trial 
related procedures including screening procedures . The consent form, potential risks and benefits, and the 
rights of research participants will be explained to the participant by the investigators or research coordinator.  Individuals will be asked if they have questions, and a member of the research staff will answer questions.  The principal investigator will also be available at all times to answer questions that participants 
may have during the consent procedure or during the time a participant is enrolled in the study.  The consent form will be completed in accordance w ith the IRB guidelines of Emory University.  A signed copy of the 
consent form will be provided to the participant and a copy will be placed in the file that is maintained for each participant in the study office.   
 Informed consent will follow the procedure of Emory University Institutional Review Board.   Every potential participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the important and key points of the study.   One of the investigators or research coordinators will obtain a witnessed informed consent prior to inclusion of a patient into the study.    The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. The sponsor- investigator will comply with all applicable 
regulatory and legal requirements, ICH GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki in obtaining and documenting the informed consent. 
 
XVI.b. Potential Benefits to the Subject:  We believe that all subjects will benefit greatly from this study.  
Intensified blood glucose monitoring and blood glucose control may significantly reduce hospital complications associated with hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.   
 
XVI.c. Potential Benefits to Society:  This study will provide important information on the benefits of oral 
antidiabetic agents (linagliptin) in the inpatient management of patients with type 2 diabetes.  We will determine whether glycemic control is different among insulin and linagliptin  therapy. 
 
XVI.d.   Risk/Benefit Assessment:  Insulin therapy is the mainstay of diabetes management in hospitalized 
patients with diabetes.   There are no prospective, randomized studies to assess the efficacy and safety of oral antidiabetic agents for the inpatient management of diabetes.  Most patients with type 2 dia betes are treated 
with a sliding scale or basal bolus insulin therapy.  This study will test the efficacy of the inpatient use of oral antidiabetic agents and to determine whether glycemic control is different between linagliptin and basal bolus regimen in surgical patients with type 2 diabetes.    
 
 21 
Linagliptin Inpatient_07.19.2016 
 
XVI.e. Therapeutic Alternatives:   Patients can be treated with other insulin formulations (regular insulin, 
NPH, glargine, lispro, aspart or glulisine currently available at Grady Hospital, Emory University Hos pital 
and other Medical centers for the treatment of T2D.   
 
XVI.f. Inclusion of women:  We anticipate that ~50% of the study subjects will be female.  No patients 
under the age of 18 and no pregnant women will be included in the study.  Absence of pregnancy must be 
demonstrated by blood or urine testing prior to randomization (in female of child bearing potential only).   
 
XVI.g. Inclusion of minorities:  Patients will not be excluded based on race or ethnic origin.  We anticipate 
that half of patients will be African Americans, 10% Hispanics, and the rest Caucasians.   
 
XVI.h. Inclusion of children:  No patients under the age of 18 will be recruited in this study. 
 
XVII. Confidentiality  
Informed consent will follow the procedure of Emory University Institutional R eview Board.   Every 
potential participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the impo rtant and key points of the study.   
One of the investigators or research coordinators will obtain a witnessed informed consent prior to inclusion of a patient into the study.  Data collection records with personal identifiers will be stored in locked file 
cabinets.  Blood samples drawn and stored in conjunction with this study will not be labeled with information that could directly identify study subje cts.  Blood samples will be stored at Dr Umpierrez 
Research Laboratories in the Grady Diabetes Clinic.  Presentation of the study results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to research and confidential records will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, and the IRB at Emory University.

Not applicable.  
 
XXIV. DSMB and Monitoring. 
All adverse events (AEs) will b e graded as to their attribution (unrelated to protocol, or possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to protocol).  Any AE that is reported to either the PI or her designated research 
associates by a study subject or medical staff will document caring for  the subject and which meets the 
criteria as such.  This study will be entered into the Emory GCRC computerized database system to permit tracking of adverse events.  This system will then be used by all investigators to report “expected” AEs (predefined AEs which will be monitored over the course of the trial – see below), “observed” AEs (AEs which occur but which may or may not have been anticipated), and all serious adverse events (SAEs, see below); this system will be used in this trial.  Serious advers e events are predefined as:  any experience that 
suggests a significant hazard, such as events which: a) are fatal, b) are life threatening, c) result in permanent disability, d) require inpatient hospitalization, or e) involve cancer, a congenital anomaly, or drug overdose.   
 
Any AEs will be reported to the Emory GCRC Research Safety Advocate (RSA), within 15 days of the event and any SAEs will be reported to the RSA and the Emory IRB within 24-48 hours of the event.  The standard Emory IRB reporting guidelines for AE and SAE reporting will also be followed.  The investigators and staff will enter all AEs into the RSA database, and evaluate the SAEs, in close coordination with the Emory IRB.  The IRB annual report from the P.I. will also be transmitted to the RSA and stored both in the RSA database 
and as a hard copy file.  The P.I. will also personally discuss the study and any observed AEs or SAEs on a regular basis with the RSA (at least once a year and more often as indicated).   
 The Emory PI will be monitoring all sites (including non -Emory sites). Th e Emory PI and Emory study team 
will have a teleconference at the beginning to introduce the protocol, specific aims, plan and methods, and statistical analysis.  
The PI will ensure that each site will have  a regulatory binder that contains the following documents and 
forms; 
Contact info, and CVs of all the study members. Delegation of authority form Financial disclosure form

Supplemental” dose is to be added to the scheduled dose of lispro/aspart insulin.  If a patient is able and expected to eat all or most of his/her meals, supplemental insulin will be administered before each meal following the “usual” column dose.  Supplemental insulin at bedtime = half of premeal insulin dose at BG > 220 mg/dl.  Example, a patient with blood glucose of 240 mg/dl will receive 8 U before a meals or 2-4 U at bedtime of supplemental insulin.     If a patient is not able to eat (NPO), supplemental insulin will be administered every 6 hours (6-12-6-12) following the “sensitive” column dose.  Example, a patient kept NPO with blood glucose of 240 mg/dl will 
receive 4 U of supplemental insulin.

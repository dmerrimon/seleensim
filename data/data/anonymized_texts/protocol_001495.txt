Statistical Analysis Plan  
Pilot Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Certolizumab Pegol for Interstitial  
 
Sample size  
Previous IC/BPS studies demonstrated an approximate 20% placebo response rate [29]. 
Monotherapy response rate of certolizumab pegol in rheumatoid arthritis was 45% [21]. To 
achieve an 80% power using 2:1 randomization and a 2- sided p = .05 a minimum of 39 subjects 
was required. The sample size was increased by 3 subjects to account for potential participant withdrawals.  
 
Randomization  
Eligible participants were computer randomized and received either subcutaneous certolizumab pegol 400gm or placebo (steril e saline) in a 2:1 ratio at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8. The study drug and 
placebo were provided in ready to use syringes that were identical other than the blinded ID number on the side of the syringe.  
 
Statistical analysis  
 
Any patient who withdrew from the s tudy, for whatever reason, was classified as a non -
responder.  
All statistical summaries and 2- sample t -tests were performed using the Data Desk® 
version 6.3. Comparison of these changes between treatment groups are also shown as 95% 
confidence intervals (C I). The chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test was applied to analyze 
baseline demographics, improvement with GRA treatment responders, and the proportion of patients with a reduction from baseline of 30% or greater in their pain intensity score between 
treatment groups.

You ar e being invited  to participate in a research study.  A research study is designed to answer 
specific questions  about new ways to prevent, detect, and treat disease.  Being in a research study 
is different from being a patient.  The purpose of this document is to provide a written summary 
of the discussion and exchange of research information you had with  the research team.   It is also 
for use as a reference during the study.   
 
Please note:  
 You are being asked to participate in a research study  
 Ask as many questions as needed so you can make an informed decision.  
 Carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the rese arch  
 Your decision to participat e is completely voluntary and will have no effect on the 
quality of your medical care if you choose not to participate. You can also withdraw 
from the study at anytime.  
 
1. INFORMATION ON THE RESEARCH  
Why is the research study being done?  
Women who have a laparoscopic removal of the uterus  (total laparoscopic hysterectomy)  are at 
risk of having problems urinating after surgery, called urinary retention.  At this time, the risk of 
urinary retention is anywhere from 4% to 34%.  Urinary retention may lead to re -admission to 
the hospital, the need for draining of the bladder using a catheter, the need for self -
catheteriza tion at home, temporary or perman ent bladder dysfunction , bladder rupture, or kidney 
failure .  The risk factors  for developing urinary retention after total laparoscopic hysterectomy 
are not well known.  Additionally, prevention of urinary retention has not been made standard in 
the medical literature. This research study is being performed in order to determine th e risk 
factors for developing urinary retention as well as the best method of checking bladder function 
after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.  
 
What is involved if you decide to take part in this research study?  
Pre-Surgery  
The study team will  review this  consent with you and ask you to sign.  If you decide to 
participate, the study team will  use your electronic medical record to collect information about 
you including your age, race, body mass index, obstetric and gynecologic history, smoking 
status, surg ical history, and the reason for your surgery .  You will be asked to complete a 
questionnaire which should take less than 5 minutes of your time.  Additionally, an ultrasound of 
your bladder will be performed  by a member of the study team or by a nurse in the clinic  after 
 
Version  1, 3/1/2017  2 you completely empty your bladder . This ultrasound will be used to  measure the amount of urine 
you normally have left in your bladder  after you urinate . 
 
Day of Surgery  
Surgical Procedure (total laparoscopic hysterectomy)  
If you decide to take part in this research st udy, your surgery will occur as it normally would.  
On the day of your surgery, you will meet your surgeons, anesthesi ologist , and nursing teams 
before your surgery starts. You will then be taken to the operating room, laid dow n on the 
operating room bed, and receive anesthesia , like standard care.  Next, your surgeon  will place a 
Foley catheter into your bladder and proceed  with your surgery as he normally would.  
 
Research Procedure  
After your hysterectomy is complete, an envel ope will be opened to indicate your study group.  
This process is called randomization and like the flip of a coin, there will be 2 possible groups.  
Neither the research team nor you can choose the group assignment; the assignment will be 
chosen by chance .  One group of patients will be randomly assign ed to keeping  the Foley 
catheter in the bladder  surgery and the other group of patients will be randomly assigned to not 
keeping the  Foley catheter in the bladder after surgery. If you are a part of the group  of patients 
with a Foley catheter after surgery, then you will have a “backfill” bladder challenge in the 
recovery room once you are awake and alert. If you are a part of the group of patients without a 
Foley catheter after surgery, then you will have an “autofill” bladder challenge in the recovery 
room. The details of each bladder challenge are outlined below.  
 
Group A: Backfill Bladder Challenge  
In the recovery room, you will have about 300 mL of sterile water instilled into your bladder 
through the Fol ey catheter.  The Foley catheter will then be removed and you will be allowed to 
urinate in the restroom over a collection bin.  The amount of urine that you make will be 
measured.  A bladder ultrasound will be performed to measure the amount of urine left  in your 
bladder.  If the am ount of urine is greater than 10 0 mL, you will have a new Foley catheter 
placed in your bladder and will be discharged home.  
 
Group B: Autofill Bladder Challenge  
In the recovery room, you will be asked to urinate over a collecti on bin when you are awake and 
able to walk to the restroom.  The amount of urine that you make will be measured.  A bladder 
ultrasound will be performed to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder.  If the am ount 
of urine is greater than 10 0 mL, yo u will have a Foley catheter placed in your bladder and will be 
discharged home.  
 
Bladder Challenge Follow Up  
If you are discharged home without a Foley catheter, you will follow up in the office 10 -14 days 
after your surgery as you normally would after th is type of surgery. If you are discharged home 
with a Foley catheter, you will be asked to come to the gynecology office the day after your 
surgery to have a repeat bladder challenge using the “backfill”  method.  If you have greater than 
100 mL of urine left in your bladder after the challenge is complete, a new Foley catheter will be 
placed in your bladder again, which is standard protocol. The bladder challenge will then be 
repeated 1 week later . If once again, greater than 10 0 mL of urine  remain in your bladder, then 
 
Version  1, 3/1/2017  3 you will follow up with Urogynecology for follow up and you will be taught self -catheterization  
to be performed at home .  
 
Post-Surgery Follow up  
You will have a post -operative appointment in the gynecology office 10 -14 days after your 
hyster ectomy as is standard protocol. As a study participant, you will be asked to complete a 
questionnaire which should take you about 5 minutes to complete. During the appointment, you 
will also have an exam performed and will be able to ask any questions you may have about your 
surgery at that time. Please note, t he study described is for research purposes only. It is not the 
purpose of this study to look for or provide you with any medical information or diagnoses 
relating to your present condition or any oth er disease or illness.  Therefore, you will not receive 
results from these research studies.   
 
2. ALTERNATIVES  
What are the alternatives to participat ion in the research  study ?   
If you do not wish to participate in this study, you will receive the standa rd su rgical and post -
surgical care. Currently, all patients  undergoing hysterectomy  also receive a bladder challenge; 
however, the type of bladder challenge performed will be  under th e discretion of your surgeon.   
 
3. RISKS  
What are the  risks of participat ing in the research  study ? 
When a Foley catheter is placed into the bladder, a risk of developing a urinary tract infection 
exists.  However, in the context of this study, the risk of a urinary tract infection is not greater 
than if you were not a part of this study since a Foley catheter is a standard step in all of the total 
laparoscopic hysterectomies performed in Cleveland Clinic Florida. Aside from this risk, s ome 
of the questions asked as part of the study may make you feel uncomfortable.  You may ref use to 
answer any of the questions. Additionally, t here is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality of 
your data.  Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential through the use of 
several safeguards.  All of your completed forms and qu estionnaires will be stored in a locked 
filing cabinet at Cleveland Clinic Florida. The key will only be accessible to the research team. 
Additionally, any electronic information collected will be maintained on a secure database on a 
password -protected com puter at Cleveland Clin ic Florida.  
 
     4. BENEFITS  
      What a re possible benefits  of participating in the research ? 
The knowledge  gained  from this study may benefit future patients. However, you will not have 
direct benefit from participating in this r esearch study.  
 
5. COSTS  
Are there any cost s to you if you participate in this study?  
The materials  used in this study will not cost you any extra money since they are all standard 
materials used for your surgery. Additionally, any extra visits to the offi ce for urinary testing will 
be billed as part of your post -operative care and should not incur extra costs to you as a result. 
Hence, participating in this study will not incur any extra charges to you.  Additionally, 
participating in this research will not  cause your surgery to be prolonged so the costs of the 
surgery should remain the same as if you were not participating in this study.

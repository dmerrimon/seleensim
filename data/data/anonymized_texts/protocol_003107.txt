- 4 - 1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1.11 To estimate the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or 
partial).  
 1.12 To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with veliparib (ABT- 888) as assessed by the Active Version of the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.21 To determine the duration of progression- free survival (PFS) an d overall 
survival (OS).  
 1.22 To determine the proportion of patients who survive progression- free for at least 
6 months. 
 
1.3 Translational Research Objectives  
 
1.31 To explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
DNA repair genes (e.g., BRCA1, Fanconi) and clinical characteristics, response, 
and patient outcome (PFS and OS). 
 2.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Ovarian Cancer and PARP Inhibition  
PARP -1 is essential to the repair of DNA single -strand breaks via the base excision 
repair pathway. Poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a key role in DNA repair 
mechanisms by detecting and initiating repair after DNA strand breaks. Inhibition of PARP in DNA repair -defective tumors (like those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations) 
can lead to gross genomic instability and cell death.  Recent in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that PARP inhibitors could be used not only as chemo/radiotherapy sensitizers, but also as single agents to selectively kill cancers defective in DNA repair, specifically cancers with mutation in th e breast cancer -associated genes, BRCA1 and 
BRCA2.  
 Much of the proof of concept and proof of principle single agent studies performed to date have centered on olaparib.  A phase I study of olaparib in 60 patients with advanced solid tumors evaluated doses of olaparib beginning at 10 mg daily, two out of three weeks, up to 600 mg BID.  The maximum tolerated dose was deemed to be 400 mg twice daily.  Objective responses were observed only in confirmed carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, apart from one patient with a strong family history of BRCA mutation who declined mutational testing.  Of the 60 patients entered, there were

NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 5 - 9 partial or complete responses by RECIST criteria (8 with ovarian cancer and 1 with breast cancer).  Of the 9 responders, 4 received 400 mg BID, 4 received 200 mg BID  
 and one 100 mg BID.  A total of 21 patients with ovarian cancer and 9 patients with breast cancer were entered on the study.
1   
 A phase II trial evaluating two sequential cohorts of women with recurrent ovarian cancer ( with confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and measurable disease) 
enrolled 33 women treated at 400 mg BID and then 24 women treated at 100 mg BID.  Objective response rate (RECIST) was 33% (11/33 patients) in the 400 mg BID cohort and 13% (3/24 patients) in the 100 mg BID cohort.
2  A Similar study was performed in 
metastatic breast cancer patients with confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and measurable disease.  In this study, the objective response rate (RECIST) was 41% (11/27 patients) in the 400 mg BID cohort and 22% (6/27 patients) in the 100 mg BID cohort.
3   
 In a further phase I study, 50 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and measurable disease were treated with doses of olaparib ranging from 40 mg daily for 2 of 3 weeks, to 600 mg BID (11 patients).  There was then a dose expansion cohort in which all patients received olaparib at 200 mg BID (39 patients).  Objective response rate was 28% (14/50 patients).  Objective response rates were reported accordi ng to platinum- sensitivity:  Platinum-sensitive 46% (6/13 patients); 
Platinum-resistant 33% (8/24 patients); and Platinum-refractory 0% (0/13 patients).
4  
A potential explanation for the variable response according to platinum- sensitivity is the 
development of secondary mutations restoring BRCA 1/2 function.5-9   
 Olaparib has also been evaluated as a single agent in a trial that included patients without germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.  In this phase II trial, 86 patients were treated and evalu able for response (63 with ovarian cancer and 23 with breast cancer).  
Patients were entered with recurrent high grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian cancer or triple negative breast cancer.  Patients were stratified according to whether they had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or not.  In ovarian cancer, objective responses were seen in 41% (7/17 patients) with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and 24% (11/46 patients) without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.  No objective responses were seen in breast cancer patients (8 BRCA; 15 non- BRCA).
10    
 A three- arm randomized , open label, phase II trial of olaparib 200 mg BID (n=32), 
olaparib 400 mg BID (n=32) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)  (n=33), in 
women with recurrent ovarian cancer , germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutatio n and 
recurrence within 12 months of prior platinum therapy has been conducted.   PLD was given at 50 mg/m
2 every 4 weeks.  The primary endpoint was investigator assessed 
progression-free survival.  The progression free survival (PFS)  and objective respons e 
rates  (RR)  were similar between the 3 arms .11  The efficacy of olaparib was consistent 
with previous studies.  The efficacy of PLD was greater than expected.  (07/09/2012) 
 A randomized phase II maintenance trial of olaparib (400 mg BID) vs placebo was conducted in women with platinum sensitive recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer 
(with and without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) who had achieved a response (partial

- 6 - or complete) following 2
nd line (or greater) platinum -based therapy. The time to 
progression in the 265 patient cohort was extended from 4.8 months to 8.4 months (HR: 0.35, P<0.001).  Patients were not required to undergo BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing and they were not stratified as to whether they had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or not.

The olaparib formulation used in all the above detailed trials is a 50 mg capsule.  To achieve the recommended dose of 400 mg BID, 16 large (size 0) capsules are required which may compromise patient convenience and compliance.  In a phase I-pharmacokinetic study (24 patients), an equivalent tablet formulation dose of olaparib to the 400 mg BID capsule formulation (16 capsules) was established as 200 mg BID (4 tablets).
13  This tablet formulation is now entering efficacy trials.     
 
Currently several phase I/II studies with Veliparib are ongoing in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy  (50 trials listed in Clincialtrials.gov).  (See 
Section 2.22 for details of the phase I clinical experience)  Currently, in recurrent 
ovarian cancer, Veliparib is being combined with temozolomide in a randomized phase II study versus PLD (Doxil) in women with recurrent serous ovarian cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); and in combination with metronomically delivered cyclophosphamide versus sequential metronomic cyclophospham ide and Veliparib in patients with 
recurrent serous ovarian cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The GOG is also conducting a phase I trial in combination with bevacizumab and the cytotoxic agents, paclitaxel and carboplatin in frontline ovarian cancer (GOG9923; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The dosing and schedule under each of these trials is profoundly influenced by the agents being co-administered.  Currently, there are no clinical efficacy data of single agent 
Veliparib, which is the primary objective of the current proposal.  
The s ingle agent, dose-finding, phase I trial of ABT-888 is still ongoing 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  This study is open to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, triple negative metastatic breast cancer, platinum -refractory ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, 
prostate cancer p atients.  The primary goal of the study is to determine the 
recommended phase II dose.  The requirement for entered ovarian cancer patients to have platinum-refractory disease is concerning, as this is the group previously shown not to respond to olaparib, even when entry criteria were restricted to BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers .
4  Thus a true evaluation of the activity of veliparib in recurrent, 
measurable disease, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation ovarian cancer has not been under taken.  
 2.2 ABT -888 
 
ABT -888 is a potent PARP inhibitor that delays the repair of DNA damage induced by 
chemotherapeutics.  ABT -888 increases sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA damaging 
agents  in vitro, and demonstrates PARP inhibition in murine tumors in vivo and human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ex vivo.  
 ABT -888 is a novel small molecule that is a potent inhibitor of both PARP-1 and PARP 
2, with Ki‘s of 5 nM and 3 nM, respectively.  In cells under oxidative stress, ABT-888 inhibits the PARP -induced formation of poly- (ADP -ribose) (PAR) with an EC50 of 
GOG-0280 
NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 7 - 2.4nM.  Consistent with the conclusion of mechanism based efficacy, significant inhibition of PAR levels was observed with doses of ABT-888 capable of delivering significant anti- tumor efficacy in preclinical models.  A facile, enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of PAR formation has been developed that can be used for analysis of pharmacodynamic effects of ABT -888 in human PBMC 
and tumor clinical samples.
14,15 
 In cellular assays, ABT -888 increases sensitiv ity of tumor cells to DNA -damaging 
agents including temozolomide (TMZ), irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, BCNU, cisplatin, and radiation.  In pre- clinical tumor models, ABT -888 enhances the anti-
tumor efficacy of alkylating/methylating agents (TMZ, cyclophosph amide), cross -
linking agents (cisplatin, carboplatin), topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan), and radiation.  
 
2.21  Pre-Clinical Experience  
 
2.211  Pharmacokinetics  
 
In rats and dogs, ABT- 888 is primarily cleared in the urine as intact 
parent drug, with minor contributions from metabolism.  The renal clearance and minimal metabolism observed in rats and dogs, and the minimal metabolism observed in vitro in all species evaluated are consistent with the low molecular weight (244.296 g/mol) and good solubilit y of ABT -888.  These data support the prediction that in 
humans, ABT- 888 will be primarily cleared as intact parent in urine.  
 
ABT -888 is not a potent inhibitor, nor an inducer, of the major human 
cytochrome P450s (CYPs), suggesting a minimal potential for drug -drug 
interactions at the anticipated therapeutic concentrations.

2.22  Cl
inical Experience 
 
A Phase 0 dose- ranging pharmacokinetic and pharmacodyna mic study has been 
completed (NCI IND).  In this trial, 13 subjects with various types of advanced cancer received a single dose of single-agent ABT-888 (10 mg, n = 3; 25 mg, n = 3; 50 mg, n = 7).  The pharmacokinetic results from this study demonstrated that ABT -888 is orally bioavailable and primarily cleared through renal 
excretion, with a half -life of 4 to 5 hours.  Additionally, this study provided 
proof of mechanism, as tumor PARP inhibition (> 90%) was demonstrated in 5 out of 6 human tumor biopsies that were obtained 3 to 6 hours after dosing with ABT -888.   No serious adverse events, dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs), or deaths 
were reported for this study.
16 
 Multiple Phase I studies of ABT-888 in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents are on-going. Study M06-862 is a dose- escalation 
study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of ABT -888 in combination with TMZ.

 The A10-153 study is a Phase I study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of ABT -888 in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel.  In this trial 
ABT -888 is given orally on Days 1- 7, and carboplatin/paclitaxel are given on 
Day 3 of a 21-day cycle.  The trial is accruing subjects to the dose level of 40 mg ABT -888 plus carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m
2). Thus far, 
the treatment has been tolerated well with heavily pre- treated patients receiving 
a median number of 6 cycles on study.  Of the six patients treated at carboplatin AUC 6, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and ABT-888 40 mg BID, three were able to complete all 6 cycles at the full dose.  Three patients required dose reductions of 
paclitaxel secondary side effects.  The MTD has not been reached in this study.  
An additional Phase I dose escalation study of ABT-888 monotherapy in BRCA carriers with soli d tumors is ongoing.  Treatment in this study is continuous BID 
dosing beginning at a dose of 50 mg BID.   The recommended phase II dose 
from this continuous monotherapy study is 300 to 400 mg BID.  Patients can experience nausea.  If nausea is seen with th e 400 mg BID dose, the 
recommendation is to lower the dose to 300 mg BID (Personal Communication:  Alice Chen, MD and Shannon Puhalla, MD). 
 
2.3 Translational Research Background  
 
Polymorphisms in Fanconi pathway genes may alter DNA repair efficiency.  This 
alteration may predispose individuals to sensitivity to PARP  inhibition. Thus, the 
optional translational research component of this study will examine s ingle nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes. To examine SNPs  that may alter DNA 
repair efficiency, f ormalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor and whole blood will be 
collected from patients who agree to participate.  SNPs  in DNA repair genes (e.g., 
BRCA1, Fanconi) will be examined using the best platform identified at the time of testing. The association between SNPs and response, survival, and clinical characteristics will be examined.  
 
2.4 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) and GOG participating institutions will not exclude potential subjects from participating in this or any study solely on the basis of ethnic origin or socioeconomic status.  Every attempt will be made to enter all eligible

- 16 - 4.0 STUDY MODALITIES  
 
4.1 ABT -888 Capsule, Veliparib, A -861695.0 (IND #77840) (NSC #737664) 
 
4.11 Chemical Name/Molecular Formula: 1H-Benzimidazole -7-carboxamide, 2-
[(2R)-2- methyl-2- pyrrolidinyl] - 
  C13H16N4O  M.W.:  244.29 
 
 
 
 
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.13 Mode of Action: ABT -888 inhibits the formation of poly (ADP- ribose) (PAR) 
polymers in vitro and in vivo.  It inhibits the repair of DNA when the DNA is damaged by cytotoxic agents.  ABT- 888 increases antitumor efficacy when 
added to DNA-damaging therapies such as temozolomide, cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan, or radiation therapy.  
 
   
 
  
 
4.16 Route of Administration : Oral  
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
   
4.19 Potential Drug Interactions : Clinical studies evaluating the metabolism of ABT -
888 have not been conducted.  However, results from the in vitro analysis reveal that this agent is metabolized by multiple isoenzymes – CYP1A1, 2D6, 2C19 
and 3A4.  ABT-888 is neither a potent inhibitor nor a potent inducer of the

NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 17 - CYP -450 isoenzymes.  Use caution when concomitantly administer ed with 
drugs that are substrate, inhibitor, inducer of CYP1A1, 2D6, 2C19 and 3A4. 
  ABT -888 clears primarily in the urine as intact parent drug along with 
metabolites suggesting that renal function plays an important role in the drug clearance and its metabolites. Use caution when concomitantly administer ed 
with oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin, and topotecan in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.  
 
    4.110 Drug Ordering and Accountability : NCI-supplied agents may be requested by 
the Principal Investigator (or their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  The responsible 
investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Fina ncial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating 
investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied investigational agents for the 
study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
       Active CTEP -register ed investigators and investigator-designated shipping 
designees and ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application (https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx).  Access to OAOP requir es the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account (https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/) and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status and a “current” password.  For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call 240-276-6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) or email PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov anytime. (  )  
 
4.111 Agent Inventory Records : The investigator, or a responsible party designated by 
the investigator, must maintain a caref ul record of the inventory and disposition 
of all agents received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF).  (See the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage.)  
 
  4.112 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) For Veliparib 
(ABT -888, NSC 737664) (08/21/2012) (  )  
 The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold

- 18 - and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited repor ting to NCI via AdEERS (except 
as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguid
elines.pdf  for further clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 2310 
patients. Below is the CAEPR for Veliparib (ABT -888). 
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

             5.2 Treatment Plan  
 
  5.21 T reatment : 
 
Veliparib 400 mg will be taken orally twice daily (about the same time every 
day).  The doses should be taken about 12 hours apart.  If a patient is more than 4 hours late in taking a dose, the dose should be skipped.  Pills may be taken with or without food.  Pills should be swallowed with approximately 8 ounces of water.  One cycle = 28 days.  Patients will receive therapy until disease progression or adverse effects prohibit further therapy.  
 Patients will self administer Veliparib and record doses on a pill calendar.  See Patient Pill Calendar (Appendix III).  Patients should be instructed to bring any 
unused pills, pill bottles and completed pill calendar to each appointment. 
   5.22 See the GOG General Chemotherapy Guidelines (Appendix II) 
 5.3 Criteria for removal from treatment  
 
 5.31 Inability to tolerate veliparib (ABT -888) at the lowest doses because of toxicity. 
  5.32 Patients who experience a seizure while on study should be removed from study 
therapy . 
  5.33 Patients who become pregnant while on study should be removed from study 
therapy . 
  5.34 Patients may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  Patients with evidence of disease progression or significant side effects will be removed from study.

daily  300 mg oral twice 
daily  400 mg oral twice 
daily  
 
Please note:  Patients may manifest nausea.  Dose reduction for non- tolerable grade 1 -2 
nausea is allowed.  Dose reductions can be made during a treatment  cycle or at the start 
of the next cycle.  Dose reduction is preferable to prolonged treatment interruption or 
study discontinuation.  Grade 3 (or greater) nausea requires reduction of one dose level 
and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.   
See section 6.21. 
 
Please note all CTCAE grading below refers to version 4.0. 
 A maximum of two dose reductions is allowed for each patient.  Patients experiencing toxicity (hematologic or non -hematologic) that meets criteria for further dose reduction, 
after this maximum, will be removed from study therapy.  
 
6.1 Hematologic toxicity  
 
6.11 Initial treatment modifications will consist of cycle delay and/or dose reduction as indicated below. The use of hematopoietic cytokines and protective reagents are restricted as noted:  
 
6.111 Patients will NOT receive prophylactic G -CSF.  
 6.112 Patients will NOT receive prophylactic thrombopoietic agents.  
 6.113 Patients may receive erythropoietin (EPO), iron supplements, and/or 
transfusions as clinically indicated for management of anemia. Treating physicians should be aware of the recent changes in prescribing information for the erythropoiesis stimulating agents (including Aranesp, Epogen and Procrit) which note that there is a potential risk of shortening the time to tumor progression or disease-free survival, and that these agents are administered only to avoid red blood cell transfusions. They do not alleviate fatigue or increase energy. They should not be used in patients with uncontroll ed hypertension. They can cause an increased 
incidence of thrombotic events in cancer patients on chemotherapy. The updated package inserts should be consulted.   http://www.fda.gov/Medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm
  
 
6.12 Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rather 
than the total white cell count (WBC).

- 23 - 6.13 Subsequent cycles of therapy will not begin until the ANC is ≥  1500 cells/mcl 
and the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/mcl.  Therapy will be delayed for a 
maximum of three weeks until these values are achieved.  Patients  who achieve 
adequate counts  after  a delay  will receive ABT -888 with a 1  dose level 
reduction. Patients who fail to recover adequate counts within three weeks will 
be removed from study therapy. 
 
6.14 For febrile neutropenia, and/or documented grade 4 neutropenia persisting ≥ 7 
days, reduce ABT -888 by one dose level on subsequent cycles. 
 
6.15 There will be  no dose modifications on the basis of uncomplicated granulocyte 
nadirs lasting less than 7 days. 
 6.16 Patients with grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or active bleeding will have a 1 
level dose reduction. 
 
 6.2 Non-hematologic toxicity  
 
6.21 Patients may man ifest nausea.  Dose reduction for non- tolerable grade 1 -2 
nausea is allowed.  Dose reductions can be made during a treatment cycle or at 
the start of the next cycle.  Dose reduction is preferable to prolonged treatment 
interr uption or study discontinuation.  Grade 3 (or greater) nausea requires 
reduction of one dose level and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 
weeks until recovered to grade 1.   
 6.22 Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral neuropathy requires reduction of one dose level 
and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  
 6.23 Grade 2 (or greater) renal toxicity (and elevations in creatinine), requires reduction of one dose level and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to  grade 1.  
 6.24 Grade 3 (or greater) elevations in AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin 
requires reduction of one dose level and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.  
 6.25 There will be no dose modificatio ns for alopecia or fatigue.  
 
 6.26 It is expected that patients with diarrhea or constipation will receive appropriate medical management without dose modification. However, patients with persistent (greater than 24 hours) grade 3 (or greater) toxicity in spite of optimal medical management  require reduction of one dose level and delay in 
subsequent therapy for a maximum of 3 weeks until recovered to grade 1.

disease progression) for the first 6 months; then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression is 
confirmed; also repeat at any other time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs 
suggestive of progressive disease.  Responses (CR and PR) require confirmation at greater than or equal to 4 weeks from initial documentation (see section 8).  
6. CT scan or MRI every other cycle (or equivalent time frame for patients off treatment prior to disease 
progression) for the first 6 months; then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression is confirmed;

9. Patients enrolled on this trial are required to have a known germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
Submission of the reports detailing this testing is required.  The following is the usual method for BRCA 
testing: If the patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish/Eastern European Jewish descent, testing begins with 
Multisite3 BRCAnalysis, continuing on to (“Reflex to”) Comprehensive BRCAnalysis if negative. Testing of non- Ashkenazi patients starts with Comprehensive BRCAnalysis.  Patients who are negative for the 
above testing can have BRCAnalysis Rearrangement Testing (BART).  Genetic counseling is strongly recommended before and after BRCA1/2 testing.

- 28 - 8.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
8.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest 
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor  lesions and the shortest diameter 
in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
 8.11 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10 mm with CT scan, as >20 mm by chest x- ray, or >10 mm with calipers 
by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in decimal 
fractions of centimeters.  
 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be considered measurable unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short ax is), are considered non- measurable disease.  Leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal/pelvic masses ( identified by 
physical exam and not CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note s: 
Bone lesions :  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable 
soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.  Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.   ‘Cystic lesions’ thought 
to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
GOG-0280 
NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 29 -  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and  in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in  the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
 8.12 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported 
lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are  assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm 
diameter as assessed  using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the ass umption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If 
CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans), but NOT lung.   
 
GOG-0280 
NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 30 - Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furt hermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As 
with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline, and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, subsequent image acquisitions should use the same type 
of scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible.  If 
possible, body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques.  
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  PET -CT scans are not always done with oral and IV 
contrast.  In addition, the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  For 
these reasons, the GOG will not allow PET -CT use for RECIST 1.1 
response criteria.  
 
FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need add itional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is 
a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is 
not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of 
the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note:  A “positive” FDG -PET s can lesion means one that is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement .  Ultrasound examinations cannot be 
reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the nex t.  If new lesions are

NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 31 - identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utiliza tion of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete respo nse (CR) or surgical 
resection is an endpoint. 
 
CA-125 (Ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer trials): CA125  
cannot be used to assess response or progression in this study.   If CA125 is 
initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 
2004].    In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 
progression criteria that are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use only in first- line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases , e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.  
  It is mandatory to obtain cytolog ical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when measurable disease has met criteria for response or stable disease.  This confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or stable disease versus progressive disease, as an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment.  
 
  8.13 Response Criteria  
 
  Determination of response should take into consideration all target (See 8.131) 
and non-target lesions (See 8.132) and, if appropriate, biomarkers (See 8.133). 
 
    8.131  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
       
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study ( this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  
GOG-0280 
NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 32 - In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progr essions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
    8.132  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions . 
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If CA -25 is initially above the upper normal limit, it must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not 
a single lesion increase.  
 
Not evaluable (NE):  When at least one non- target lesion is not 
evaluated at a particular time point.  
 
Although a clear progression of only “non- target” lesions is 
exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
8.133 Evaluation of Biomarkers 
 
If serum CA -125 i s initially above the upper normal limit, it must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Progression cannot  be based upon biomarkers, such as serum CA-
125, for this study. 
  
    8.134  Evaluation of Best Overall (unconfirmed) Response 
 
The best overall response is the best time point response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest sum

*If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any disease seen at a 
subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).  However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR or SD, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR or SD and the best response is PR or SD.  
 In non-randomized trials where response is part of the primary endpoint, confirmation of CR or PR is needed to deem either one the “best overall response.”   Responses (CR and PR) require confirmation at greater 
than or equal to 4 weeks from initial documentation.  
 For this study, the minimum criteria for SD duration is 8 weeks.  
 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment or die without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported to be off study treatment due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

  8.14 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since date of study entry , including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
 8.15 Progression- Free Survival  
 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry  to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

9.1 Patients will receive therapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity intervenes. The patient can refuse the study treatment at any time.  
 
9.2 All patients will be treated (with completion of all required case report forms) until disease progression, initiation of a subsequent cancer treatment or study withdrawal.  Patients will then be followed every three months for the first two years and then every six months for the next three years.  Patients will be monitored for delayed toxicity and survival for this 5- year period with Q forms submitted to the GOG Statistical and Data 
Center, unless consent is withdrawn.  Q forms will no longer be required if the study is terminated prior to the completion of the 5- year follow -up period.  
 
9.3  A patient is considered off study therapy when the patient has progressed or died, a 
subsequent drug or therapy (directed at the disease) is initiated or all study therapy is 
discontinued. Report all treatment received on Form D2R and adverse events on Form T until the patient qualifies as being off study therapy.

 10.0 STUDY MONITORING & REPORTING PROCEDURE  
  
10.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR AN INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT (CTEP IND)  
   
10.11 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) 
 Adverse event (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related.  
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
). The CTCAE v4.0 
Manual is also available on the GOG member web site ( http://www.gog.org  
under MANUALS). 
 
10.12 Reporting Expedited Adverse Events 
  Depending on the phase of the study, use of investigational agents, and role of 
the pharmaceutical sponsor, an expedited AE report may need to reach multiple destinations.  For patients participating on a GOG trial, all expedited AE reports should be submitted by using the CTEP automated system for expedited reporting (AdEERS).  All AdEERS submissions are reviewed by GOG before final submission to CTEP.  Submitting a report through AdEERS serves as notification to GOG, and satisfies the GOG requirements for expedited AE 
reporting. All AdEERS reports will be immediately directed to the Study Chair for further action.  
 
 The requirement for timely reporting of AEs to the study sponsor is specified in 
the Statement of Investigator, Form FDA-1572.  In signing the FDA -1572, the 
investigator assumes the responsibility for reporting AEs to the NCI.  In compliance with FDA regulations, as contained in 21 CFR 312.64, AEs should be reported by the investigator .

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are 
considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH 
E2A and ICH E6). 
 
ALL  SERIOUS  adverse events  that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via AdEERS 
within the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1

≥ 24 hrs Not required 7 Calendar Days  
NOTE:  Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR 
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 3 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via AdEERS within 24 hours of learning of 
the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 3 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report. 
o “7 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within 7 calendar days of 
learning of the AE. 
1Serious adverse events that occur more than  30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by complete report within 3 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs 
Expedited 7 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 3 adverse events  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above applies after this rep orting period.

Additional Instructions or Exceptions to AdEERS Expedited Reporting Requirements: 
 
• Reference the SPEER (Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Report) for the subset of AEs 
that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting via AdEERS.  Report AEs on the 
SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  If 
the CAEPR for a protocol agent is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  For questions or comments regarding the SPEER or CAEPR, please contact the AdEERS MD Help Desk at 
adeersmd@tech -res.com . 
 
10.14 Procedures for Expedited Adverse Event Reporting: 
 
10.141 AdEERS Expedited Reports: Expedited reports are to be submitted using 
AdEERS available at http://ctep.cancer.gov. The CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for expedited adverse event reporting requirements are also available at this site.   
  AML/MDS events must be reported via AdEERS (in addition to  routine 
AE reporting mechanisms). In CTCAE v4.0, the event(s) may be 
reported as either: 1)  Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy, 2) 
Myelodysplastic  syndrome, or 3) Treatment related secondary 
malignancy.  Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment 
(including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. (07/09/2012) 
 
 In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted a 24-hour 
notification is to be mad e to NCI by telephone at: 301-897-7497. An 
electronic report MUST  be submitted immediately upon re -establishment 
of internet connection. Please note that all paper AdEERS forms have been removed from the CTEP website and will NO LONGER be accepted.

- 42 - 11.0     STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the study agent in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a 
germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation .  The primary measures of efficacy will be objective 
response.  11.1 This is a Phase II study and no randomization is involved, however, patient registration 
will be accomplished in the usual fashion. 
 
11.11 Primary Endpoints: 
 
11.111 The frequency of patients who have objective tumor response. 
 
11.112 Frequency and severity of adverse effects as assessed by CTCAE v 4.0. 
 
11.12 Secondary Endpoints: 
 11.121 Duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.  11.122 The proportion of patients who survive progression- free for at least 6 
 months. 
 11.13 Translational Research and Exploratory Endpoints:  
11.131 SNPs with DNA repair genes, tumor response, PFS, OS, and patient 
demographics (e.g. age, race, tumor grade). 
 11.132 BRCA mutation in primary tumor tissue.  
 11.2 The anticipated annual accrual is 50 patients.  
 
11.21 The anticipated period of active accrual for the first stage is 5.5 months. 
 11.22 The anticipated period of active accrual for the s econd stage is 6.0 months. 
 11.3 The study plan is a single arm, 2 -stage phase II clinical trial.  
 End point and design selection The agent studied in this particular protocol is expected to reduce tumor burden, producing objective responses.   The guiding principle in selecting the design for this study is to limit the number of patients treated with clinically ineffective therapies; yet tend to estimate efficacy with reasonable precision for those agents that are clinically active.  Strict adherence to a two-stage sampling design with ‘optimal’ early stopping rules is not practical because 
the accrual is complicated by the logistics of managing a multi- center phase II study.  
Instead, flexible stopping rules are used that tend to maximize the probability of

NCI Version Date:  05/02/2016                                                                                                                               
- 43 - rejecting the treatment when the agent is indeed not active.  When the targeted sample size is attained, those patients who have already been approached will be permitted to register.  
 Historical Data and Design Parameters  
There is not a subst antial historical control available that examines the proportion of 
patients responding or PFS who have germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.   Audeh et al.
2 studied a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in a phase II study with recurrent ovarian 
cancer patients at two dose levels: 100 mg BID and 400 mg BID.  The first cohort of 33 patients enrolled on the study evaluated the dose at 400 mg.  Another cohort of 24 patien ts was enrolled at the 100 mg dose.  11 of 33 (33%; 95% CI 20-51%) evaluable 
patients responded to the drug at the 400 mg dose whereas 3 of 24 (13%; 95% CI 4-31%) responded to the 100 mg dose.  Approximately 15 of 33 (45%) patients remained progression- free at 6 months with the 400 mg dose, and 5 of 24 (21%) remained 
progression-free at 6 months with the 100 mg dose.  Another internal ancillary study of 
patients with high grade serous cancer, which are believed to have a higher proportion of patients with B RCA mutations, concluded that the proportion of patients responding 
or PFS at 6 months was approximately the same as the general ovarian cancer 
population (at least for inactive agents).  Based on this data, we propose the following null hypothesis for uni nteresting  activity:  
H
0: πr≤ 0.10  
 To evaluate this hypothesis in a two-stage design, a method provided by Chen and Ng will be used to decide whether there are sufficient numbers of patients with objective responses to continue study in a second stage (at the interim analysis) or deem the drug worthy of further investigation in a randomized study (at the end of stage 2 ).
17  In 
particular, the following decision rule will be applied where X r(1) is the number of 
patients with objective tumor responses (parti al or complete) after the first stage, X r is 
the cumulative number of patients with responses after stage 2, C r(1) is the critical value 
for X r(1), and C r is the critical value for X r: 
 Decision Rule:  If X
r(1)> C r(1) after the first stage, then the study w ill open to a second 
stage of accrual to further evaluate the activity of the drug.  If X r > C r after the second 
stage and clinical judgment indicates, then the agent will be deemed clinically 
interesting and worthy of further investigation. 
 The targeted accrual for the first stage will be 23  eligible and evaluable patients b ut 
permitted to range from 19 to 26 for administrative reasons.  The cumulative targeted accrual  for the second stage will be 48 eligible and evaluable patient s but permitted to 
range from 44 to 51 for administrative reasons.  Critical values for each stage are 
provided below:

11.4 Evaluability for efficacy and toxicity  
Only those patients who are deemed "ineligible" or who receive no therapy will be eliminated from the analysis.   All patients who receive any therapy will be evaluated for 
both treatment efficacy and toxicity.  While on occasion, circumstances may prevent the determination of treatment efficacy, such patients will be included in the analysis and labeled as "indeter minate".  This category will be listed and be reflected in the 
calculation of the response rate or proportion surviving progression- free for at least 6 
months.  
11.5 Data Safety and Monitoring 
Data sheets from studies on this protocol will be reviewed before each semi -annual 
meeting and will also be reviewed by the Study Chairperson in conjunction with the Statistical and Data Center.  In some instances, because of unexpectedly severe toxicity,

- 45 - the Statistical and Data Center may elect, after consultation w ith the Study Chairperson 
and the Medical Oncology Committee, to recommend early closure of a study.  
 The frequency and severity of all toxicities are tabulated from submitted case report forms and summarized for review by the study chairperson, Developmental Therapeutics Committee, and GOG Safety  Review Committee  (SRC) in conjunction 
with each semi -annual GOG meeting. For studies sponsored by the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), standardized toxicit y reports are also submitted to the drug and disease monitors at the 
Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) and Clinical Investigation Branch (CIB).  The initial overall review of toxicity is usually performed after completion of the first stage of accrual, at which point accrual is generally suspended pending formal analysis of 
response and toxicity.  All serious and/or unexpected events are communicated to the Study Chair, sponsor, and regulatory agencies as mandated in the protocol. These reports are reviewed  by the 
Study Chair (or designated co -chair) for consideration of investigator notification, 
amendment, or immediate study suspension.  All participating institutions will then receive notification of the toxicities and reason for study suspension.   Under these circumstances, accrual cannot be re- activated until the study is reviewed by the GOG 
SRC.  However, patients currently receiving treatment may continue to receive treatment in accordance protocol guidelines at the discretion of their physicians, unl ess 
directed otherwise.  
 
11.6 Secondary Endpoints and Exploratory Analyses 
 Overall survival and progression- free survival will be characterized with Kaplan -Meier 
plots and estimates of the median time until death or progression.  
 If the clinical trial goes to the second stage and there is sufficient variability in the SNPs, then patients can be categorized by the nature of their SNPs and assessed for prognostic value through survival analysis (e.g. log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards modeling).  These analyses will be conducted as hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing.  If the variability in SNPs is relatively low, assessment of prognostic value can be conducted with odds ratios of patients responding or surviving progression- free for  at least 6 months.  These techniques will use exact methods such as 
Fisher’s Exact Test.  In addition, associations with demographic characteristics, for example race, cell type, and tumor grade, will be examined with methods that use categorical data (e.g. exact Chi -square tests), and tables may be provided for those 
associations deemed interesting.  
 BRCA mutational status will be tabulated against the germline mutation to see what proportion of patients have a mutation reversal within the tumor and whether such reversals can explain resistance to the regimen under study.

- 51 -  Appendix II  - GOG General Chemotherapy Guidelines  
 
 
• For 21 or 28 day cycles, a patient will be permitted to have a new cycle of 
chemotherapy delayed up to 7 days (without this being considered to be a protocol 
violation) for major life events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be re-scheduled).  Documentation to justify this decision should be provided. 
• It will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be delivered within a “24-
hour window before and after the protocol-defined date” for “Day 1” treatment of 21 or 28 day cycles.  If the treatment due date is a Friday, and the patient cannot be treated on that Friday, then the window for treatment would include the Thursday (1 day earlier than due) through the Monday (day 3 past due). 
• For weekly regimens, it will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be 
delivered within a “24-hour window,” for exa mple; “Day 8 chemotherapy” can be 
delivered on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and “Day 15 chemotherapy” can be given on Day 
14, Day 15, or Day 16. 
• Chemotherapy doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without 
being considered a protocol violation ( most institutions use a rule of approximately +/- 
5% of the calculated dose ). 
• Chemotherapy doses are required to be recalculated if the patient has a weight change 
of greater than or equal to 10%.  Patients are permitted to have chemotherapy doses recalculated for <10% weight changes.

liquid) from the fibrin clot and blood cells. 
 
 When the appropriate equipment is available, centrifuge blood at 3500g at 4°C 
for 10 minutes. Blood must be centrifuged at a minimum of 1000g at room 
temperature for 15 minutes* (the longer centrifugation time will help compensate for the slower speed).  
 
 *Avoid centrifugation without refrigeration longer than 15 minutes as excess 
heat may damage the serum.

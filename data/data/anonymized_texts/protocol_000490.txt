groups, Group A for TempSure  treatments only and Group B for TempSure and Icon treatments. 
Randomization will not be required as subjects will only be enrolled in Group B and treated with 
the Icon device if they present with pigment and/r vascular lesions . Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as the treatment visit.  
Subjects  in Group A  will receive up to 4 treatments with the TempSure device on the face . 
Subjects in Group B will receive 2 treatments  with just the TempSure device and 2 treatments with 
both the TempSure and Icon device.  Some subjects may be asked to return for an optional 5th 
treatment (2 – 3 weeks post last treatment) with the Icon  device  (and/or TempSure device ) after the 
completion of their 4 treatments at the discretion of the Investigator.  Subjects may receive a phone 
call 1 week (1 -7 days) after each treatment to record side effects.  Subjects will return for follow up 
visits at 4 and 12 weeks  post last treatment for efficacy and side effects assessments . An 
unscheduled visit or phone call may be performed at any time during the study at the request  of the 
subject  or as deemed necessary  by the site Investigator.  
  
 Analysis:  
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non -ablative aesthetic treatments and will 
drive demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.1 Due to this shift in patient 
base, practices need to evolve to adapt to the newer generational ideologies. There have been rapid 
advances in RF technology over the past few years and the nonsurgical treatment using this energy 
source offers great promise to our aging population.2 Radiofrequency technology for the treatment 
facial wrinkles  and skin laxity needs  to be further investigated to optimize treatment parameters for 
safe and effective non -ablative aesthetic treatments.  
 
Relevance:  
Over time, skin structure degrades due to a variety of internal and external conditions. As enzymes 
break down collagen and elastin, skin loses its suppleness and becomes loose.  UV exposure, diet, 
and smoking among other behaviors all contribute to the skin becoming lax.   Body wrinkles, 
particularly on the abdomen, are a sign of aging and are also a prevalent concern with postpartum 
women or subjects who have lost weight. It is estimated that adult skin loses approximately 1% of 
its dermal collagen content on an annual ba sis due to increased collagen degradation and decreased 
collagen synthesis.2 Radiofrequency, ultrasound, non -ablative fractional technology, and ablative 
technology have all been used to varying degrees of success.  The limitations of current products 
on the market include different side effect profiles and modes of administration.  
 
Testability:  
The TempSure device  is currently cleared for use for non -ablative treatment of mild to moderate 
facial wrinkles and  rhytids  (K171262 ). The Icon device is currently cleared for used for the Max 
Series Intense Pulsed Light Handpieces  for the treatment of benign pigmented epidermal  
and cutaneous lesions, including warts, scars and striae; removal of unwanted hair from  
skin types 1 -VI, and t o effect stable long -term, or permanent, hair reduction; treatment  
of benign pigmented lesions, including lentigines, nevi, melasma, and cafe -au-lait; and  
treatment of vascular lesions, including port wine stains, hemangiomas, angiomas,  
telangiectasias, ro sacea, facial and leg veins  (K103664 ). This study will utilize the collection of 
data and imaging to support current and additional marketing claims.

In earlier stages of facial wrinkles  and skin laxity , and therefore younger subjects, ther e is 
normally minimal appearance of those conditions , allowing for less aggressive and therefore safer 
overall treatments. Younger subject’s bodies are also capable of responding to the treatment 
quicker due to their ability to produce more collagen quicker than an older subject. As a subject 
gets older the ir condition  becom ing more severe, this may result in the subject needing more 
overall treatment and more aggressive treatments to get their body to respond the same way that a 
younger subject may be able to respond.   
 
Predictive power:  
While this study will observe the efficacy of the device  on the face , this treatment could potentially 
be applied to a variety of body areas and other potential application s. Assuming  there an 
acceptable safety profile , it would be appropriate to expect re sults in different areas.  
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design  
This is a  prospective , open label , multi -cente r clinical st udy to collect efficacy  data on the 
TempSure device  and may also collect data on the Icon device .

• The subject  has any embedded electronic device that gives or receives a signal, the device 
should be turned off or removed prior to treatment.  
• The subjec t has an embedded pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), 
the client’s cardiologist must be con sulted prior to treatment.  
NOTE : This device has not been tested on patients implanted with electronic devices that 
receive or emit signals, such as: Pacemakers, Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators (ICD), or 
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices.  
• If the neutral pad would need to be placed on a subject  that has a metal plate, rod, or any 
metal implant that could conduct heat from the Smart Handpiece or surgical handpiece.  
• The subject is allergic to adhesives, such as glues on medical tape, they shou ld be alerted 
that a rash may occur on the neutral pad site and an over the counter solution may be used 
to treat the area.  
• The subject  is allergic to gold, such as the metallic covering of the TempSure handpieces.  
• The subject  is allergic to corn, such as the corn derivative ingredient in Parker Aquasonic 
Gel. 
• If the subject  has an unhealthy expectation of the results – this is not plastic surgery and all 
subject  should be fully informed of the treatment’s expected results.  
• The subject  has severe laxity or  sagging that causes redundant folds of tissue or hanging 
skin in the area to be treated – this treatment will be ineffective.  
• The subject  has used Accutane (Isotretinoin) six to twelve months prior to treatment, as this 
can thin the skin and make it brittle.  
• Studies of the use of the RF generator on subjects  that have any of the following conditions 
is unknown:  
o Autoimmune Disease  
o Diabetic  
o Herpes Simplex  
• Use caution when treating areas that have  scars,  tattoos, permanent makeup, and permanent 
brows.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  for Icon Treatments Only : 
• The subject is using  systemic steroids (e.g. prednisone, dexamethasone) prior to or durin g

• The subjec t is currently taking blood thinning medications or anti -coagulants. The subject  
should discontinue the use of these medications if determined to be safe to do so by their 
prescribing physician. With the prescribing physician’s approval, the subject  should  stop 
taking the medication at least 2 weeks prior to and throughout the treatment course.  
• The subject has a condition or is taking medications that alters the ability of the blood to 
coagulate.  
• The subject is currently using Tretinoin and topical retinoid s, e.g., Retin -A®, Renova® and 
exfoliating products. Although use in the area to be treated is not absolutely 
contraindicated, it is known to make skin more sensitive and prone to exfoliation. 
Candidates for Icon ™ treatment should be advised to discontinue  the use of exfoliating 
creams and other exfoliating products two (2) weeks prior to and during the entire 
treatment course.  
• The subject has a history of heat urticaria. They may develop hives with exposure to light 
pulses.  
• The subject has Herpes I or II within the treatment area. Before a treatment, candidates 
should consult their primary care physician for medical evaluation and possible prophylaxis 
to minimize the chance of a herpetic breakout. A small percentage of persons may 
experience an activation of oral herpes simplex virus infection within 5 -10days after the 
procedure, even with appropriate prophylaxis.  
• The subject has received Botulinums treatments in the treatment area. There is the 
possibility for increased diffusion of Botulinums, such as Bot ox®, as a result of edema 
associated with facial light -based treatment, which may result in facial asymmetry when 
these procedures are performed at the same visit. Many physicians recommend waiting for 
a minimum of 2 weeks after a Botox injection before pe rforming facial light -based 
treatments. Cynosure has conducted no clinical trials and cannot recommend any specific 
waiting time.  
• The subject has Pigmented Lesions in treatment area. If treating over a pigmented lesion, 
the lesion must be diagnosed as beni gn by a qualified practitioner prior to treatment. 
Inaccurate diagnosis and inadvertent treatment of a skin cancer may lead to a delay in the 
person receiving proper medical care.  
• Th subject has Cosmetic Dermal Fillers/Implants in treatment area. This Hand piece has not 
been evaluated or tested on areas with cosmetic dermal fillers, neurotoxins, or implants.  
• The subject has had unprotected sun exposure or use of tanning beds or creams in areas to 
be treated. Protected sun exposure means wearing protective cl othing and the daily use of a 
SPF-45 or greater sunscreen. Those being treated should be advised to discontinue indoor 
and outdoor tanning at least four (4) weeks prior to treatment, during the treatment course, 
and four to six (4 to 6) weeks after treatme nt. This will reduce the chance of skin color 
changes and manifestation of new pigmented lesions.  
• The subject has a history of Menstrual dysfunction/Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). 
Those with menstrual dysfunction, such as PCOS and/or ovarian hyperandr ogenism, may 
have unpredictable results. These subjects tend to have hirsutism secondary to their disease 
and should consult a primary care physician before a light -based treatment.  
• The subject has a history of vitiligo, eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermati tis, any diseases 
affecting collagen including Ehlers -Danlos syndrome, and scleroderma may affect response 
to treatment.

• The subject is of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent. They may have an ill -defined 
hair line with no obvious transition of the ha irline to the face which may put them at risk of 
paradoxical hair growth. These clients are at a high risk for hair stimulation and should be 
advised of this phenomenon before treating.  
 
Be sure to list a ll concomitant medications  taken  or procedures  perfo rmed  before, during and after 
the trial   
 
Subjects will be recruited for the study through  the existing  patient database and may also be 
recruited through  advertisements . 
 
Subject populations will not  be eligible to  participate in the study if they are vulnerable 
populations such as children, pregnant women, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, and any 
persons requiring a legally authorized representative as part of the consenting process.  
 
Subject population characteristics that will not be eligible to participate in participate in the study 
include non-English  speaking individuals and people who ca nnot read or comprehend English.  
Employees of the Investigator will be  participat ing in the study.   
 
2.4 Screening  
Subjects will be asked questions  about their medical history, may have a limited physical and their 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be verified.  Discontinuation of any concomitant medications  will 
be discussed , and pretreatment instructions and p ost treatment instruction will be reviewed with 
the subject.  
 
Procedure for the Limited Physical Exam:  
If the investigator determines that a limited exam is necessary, the exam will be like a basic annual 
physical exam performed by a primary care doctor to determine general overall health. The limited 
medical exam may include all or any of the following; vi tal signs such as blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate and body temperature, general appearance, listening to the heart, lungs and 
abdomen with a  stethoscope, head and neck exam,  in addition to examining the throat, tonsils , 
teeth, ears, eyes and n ose as well as a  neurological exam such as testing muscle strength, reflexes, 
balance, sensory changes of the extremities and mental state.  
 
2.5 Informed Consent Process and Enrollment  
Subjects will be asked to review the pre and post treatment instructions prior to  signing the 
informed consent form and  their involvement in the study. Subjects will be informed of site’s  
COVID -19 procedures that adhere to federal and state guidelines  at this time . Subjects who sign 
the informed consent will be scr eened to confirm eligibility and , if eligible , will be assigned a 
subject identification number. Subjects will be de -identified through their subject identification 
number, which will be stored in a secure location.  Subject identification numbers will be 
generated chronologically and assigned only to subjects who have met all the study selection 
criteria and have signed the informed consent form.  The informed consent will be obtained prior 
to a subject’s involvement in any study related procedures.  A sub ject will be considered enrolled 
in the study once they have signed the informed consent form.

2.6 Pre-Treatment  Procedures  
If the subject is of childbearing potential (i.e. females not post -menopausal or not surgically 
sterile) , they will be asked if they are pregnant , the date of their last menstrual cycle , and perform a 
urine pregnancy test  at the site prior to their first treatment . Pregnancy verification will be 
performed by verifying the  date of their last menstrual cycle  at each subsequent treatment . A urine 
pregnancy test may  also be conducted  at the Investigator ’s discretion  at any time  during the study . 
If a urine  pregnancy test is conducted , then a negative result must be obtained within  24 hours 
prior to the treatment . 
 
Urine Pregnancy Test Procedure : 
1. A urine sample is tested mid -stream  or by cup sample with an indicator stick.   
2. Negative results are  indicated  on the indicator stick .  
 
• Photographs will be taken prior to the first treatment  and may be taken prior to each 
subsequent treatment .  
• The following Pre -Treatment instructions will be reviewed:  
o Shave any visible  hair on the area to be treated .

o An air -cooling system may  be used during treatment. The air -cooling system allows for 
the continuous flow of cold air on the treatment area to ease the sensation from the 
pulse.  
• Parameters may be adjusted throughout the treatment to increase subject comfort.  
• Subjects will be asked  to report the general level of treatment discomfort/pain on a scale of 0 
(none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain).  
• Photographs may be taken during treatment.  
• The additional treatments will follow the same procedure.  
• Subjects will receive up to 4 treatments  on the face . Subjects in group B may be asked to return 
for an optional 5th treatment with the Icon device ( and/or TempSure device) at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
 
2.8 Post Treatment  Procedures  
• Adverse events will be documented after treatment.  
• Photographs may be taken post treatment.  
• After treatment 1 only, s ubjects will be asked to complete a Post Treatment 1 Questionnaire . 
• The following p ost treatment instructions  will be reviewed :  
o If the skin is slightly pink or red in areas following the treatment, avoid hot water when 
washing or showering until any erythema (redness) has subsided.  
o Soothing creams  or moisturizers , such as Aveeno,  may be used.  
o Gently massage the treated area  daily  for 5  minutes  for the duration of your 
involvement in the study.  
o Use a sun block with  UVA and UVB protection with  SPF of 30 or greater to prevent 
sun damage.   
o Maintain the same weight and exercise routine throughout the study.  
• If the subject is treated with the Icon device, the following p ost treatment instructions will  also 
be reviewed : 
o  A mild sunburn -like sensation is expected. This usually lasts two to twenty -four (2 -24) 
hours but can persist up to seventy -two (72) hours. Mild swelling and/or  redness may 
accompany this, but it usually resolves in two to three (2 -3) days. Apply wrapped ice or 
gel packs to the treatment area for ten to fifteen (10 -15) minutes every hour for the next 
four hours, as needed. Never apply ice directly to skin. An ora l, over -the-counter anti -
inflammatory (ibuprofen such as Advil®) or an analgesic (acetaminophen such as such 
as Tylenol®) may be taken to reduce discomfort. Use medicine according to 
manufacturer’s recommendations.  
o Until redness has resolved, it is recomme nded to avoid the following:  
o Applying cosmetics to treated areas.  
o Swimming, especially in pools with chemicals, such as chlorine.  
o Hot tubs, Jacuzzis, and saunas.  
o Activities that cause excessive perspiration or any activity that may raise core 
body temperature.  
o Sun exposure and tanning in treated areas. Apply a SPF 45 or greater sunscreen 
to prevent skin color changes.  
o Aggressive scrubbing and use of exfoliants on the treated area.  
o Bathe or shower as usual. Treated areas may be temperature -sensitive.

o Pigmented  lesion s may initially look raised and/or darker with a reddened perimeter.  
o Pigmented lesions  will gradually turn darker over the next twenty -four to forty -eight 
(24-48) hours. It may turn dark brown or even black.  
o Pigmented lesions  will progress  to darkening and/or crusting and will start flaking off 
in an average of seven to twenty -one (7 -21) days.  
o Vascular lesion s may undergo immediate graying or blanching, or they may exhibit a 
slight purple or red color change. The vessels will fully or parti ally fade in about ten to 
fourteen (10 -14) days.  
o Do not pick or pull at darkened lesions as scarring may occur.

2.13 Evaluation Methods  
Photographs:  
Photographs will be taken at baseline and at the 4 and 12 week follow up visit, and may be taken at 
eat treatment visit  to assess the efficacy  and safety  of treatment.  
 
Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation:  
Subjects will be  asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 
10 (maximum intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (Appendix B)  
 
Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Severity Scale  
The Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Severity Scale will be used  to evaluate outcomes. Live evaluation will be 
performed at Baseline and the 4 and 12 week  follow up visits. The results will be compared to 
determine improvement.    
 
 
 
Subject Treatment  Questionnaire : 
Subject  treatment  questionnaire s may be collected  from each subject  to obtain feedback on their 
treatment experience .  
 
Blinded Evaluation:  
Three blinded independent reviewers will perform a photographic evaluation in which they will be 
asked to identify pre -treatment images when compare d to post treatment images. The reviewers 
will be Board Certified Dermatologist s and/or Surgeons and will be chosen based on availability 
and have relevant clinical experience. They will attend a training session prior to grading.

2.14 Adverse Event Recording  
All data captured must be supported by the Investigator’s timely assessment and documentation of 
the adverse event in the case report forms or source documents.  All documented adverse events 
will be reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to determine whether the adverse event meets 
regulatory reporting requirements and to ensure timely adverse event reporting to me et local and 
global regulatory requirements. All adverse events must be followed until their resolution.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the TempSure  Device:  
Mild discomfort during treatment may be experienced by the subject. Typically, the discomfort is 
temporary and localized within the treatment area. Mild edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) 
may occur. Initial studies indicate that these side effects typically resolve within 2 to 24 hours.  
 
Other anticipated side effects may include; p ain, skin burns, bleeding, scarring, crusting, bruising, 
infection, itching,  prolonged edema (swelling) and  erythema (redness), hardness, and nodules. Loss 
of hair pigment may also occur within and adjacent to the treatment area.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining  to the Icon Device :  
Adverse effects can include discomfort /pain , redness, swelling, pinpoint bleeding, skin peeling , 
itching, scabbing, crusting,  purpura,  and bruising, which are usually transient and resolve without 
intervention.  
 
Possible adverse effects include pustules  (such as ingrown hairs) , skin burns, hypopigmentation, 
hyperpigmentation,  removal or lightening of freckles, scarring, infection and all ergic reaction  
(such as a rash) . There is also r isk of incidental hair reduction or removal in the treated areas.  
 
People of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent and those who have an ill -defined hair line 
with no obvious transition of the hairline to the face are at a high risk for hair stimulation  
(paradoxical hair growth) . 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Gel: 
The gel is a water -based gel that may be placed on the skin during the TempSure® treatment. No 
known adverse events are documented. However, an a llergic reaction is always possible when 
placing a topical gel onto the skin. Allergic reaction may include a mild reaction such as skin redness, 
irritation, or hives.  
 2 Much Improved - Marked improvement in appearance form the initial 
condition, but not completely optimal for this subject.   
3 Improved - Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition, but a 
re-treatment is indicated.  
4 No Change - The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.  
5 Worse - The appearance is worse than the original condition.

Adverse Events Pertaining to Neutral Pad : 
Mild heat  or hot spots  may be felt during treatment by the subject.  If the subject  reports heat at the 
pad site, evaluate  the site, check for epidermal injury . Skins burns may occur if subject does not 
report if the pad becomes too hot.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Cooling:  
Anticipated transient side effects associated with forced air/contact cooling may include tingling, 
itching, decreased sensation, numbness, redness and pain.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Surgical Marker:  
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may  produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. Markings may remain visible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol.  
 
Other Cautions:  
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.  
 
2.15 Statistical  Analysis  
 
2.15.1 Hypothesis  
For this study to be considered a success, of pre -treatment images when compared to post 
treatment (90 day) images will be ≥80%.  
 
For the additional assessments to be considered a success, the following must be true: 
 
• In cases where the subject’s improvement is being graded on a scale, such as the  FWSS and  
GAIS scale, we will test the statistical significance of our results against a hypothetical 
population that would have no change (average score of 4).  
• Subject treatment and clinician usability questionnaires are collected.  
• The side effect profile (adverse events) and the average pain score is acceptable to the 
Physician as it relates to the type of treatment.  
 
2.15.2 Sample Size Rationale  
Based on the need for data collected from this study, it was determined that a total of 50 subjects 
will be required, including departures.  
  
2.15.3 Patient Populations  
Interim results may be collected and reported.  All data will be analyzed at the end of  the study.  
The primary analysis will be performed by the intention -to-treat approach.  Everyone who begins 
the treatment is part of the study whether he or she completes the study or not.  Additional per -
protocol analysis may also be performed on subject s who complete the entire clinical trial 
according to the protocol.  The most appropriate method of handling missing values will be chosen 
based on the individual trial goals, endpoints and context.  
 
The analysis of demographic, medical history, and effica cy variables will be based on all patients 
who are randomized and receive at least one treatment. The analysis of safety data will be based on 
all patients who are randomized, receive at least one treatment, and have at least some safety data.

2.15.4 An alysis of Demographic and Medical History Variables  
Summaries will be prepared for all important demographic and medical history variables.  For 
quantitative variables summaries will include the sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and ma ximum.   For these variables the treatment groups will be compared using either a 
t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate.   For categorical variables the summaries will 
include the sample size and the number and percent of patients for each outco me.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.   Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two -sided p -value is < 0.05.  
  
2.15.5 Analysis of Efficacy Variables  
Additional  efficacy variable is the change from baseline to Visit 7 (12 week follow up visit). 
Baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first treatment. The change from baseline to 
visits 6 and 7  will be analyzed using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance.  A 
pairwise treatment group comparison at visit 7 will be performed using the results of this analysis.  
If a patient has no post -baseline assessment of the primary efficacy vari able it will be assumed that 
the change from baseline to visit 7 is zero.  The changes to visits 6 and 7 will be left as missing.  
Statistical significance with respect to the treatment group comparison at visit 7 will be declared if 
the two -sided p -value is < 0.05.  For each treatment group , summaries will be prepared for both the 
observed assessment and the change from baseline.  The summaries will include the sample size, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The statistical significan ce of the 
mean change from baseline for each treatment group will be determined using a paired t -test. 
 
2.15.6 Analysis of Safety Variables  
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to the procedure (universal 
pain scale) and th e collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and 
percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables.  
 
3.0  RISK  ANALYSIS AND M ANAGEMENT   
3.1 Risk Determination  
This device study used in this study does not meet  the FDA definition for a Significant Risk 
Device study per 21 CFR 812.3(m).  The refore , the sponsor determines that this is a non-
significant risk device study.  
 
Significant risk device means an investigational device that:  
(1) Is intended as an implant a nd presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject;  
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a  subject;  
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or  similar systems and industry  experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing sub ject risk in this trial.  
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in 
conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.   The value of the compensation to 
the clinical investigator for con ducting the study is not influenced by the study outcome.  If 
photographic results are listed as the primary objective , they are to be evaluated by blinded 
evaluators who did not partake in the study.  If information concerning investigator assessment of 
improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected , then it is not listed as an objective for the study.  
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are vo lunteers, it can be assumed that their signature on 
the informed consent is indicative of their agreement to accept the risks involved.  
 
The risks to the subjects who participate in this study are the same as those for the subject 
undergoing similar non-ablative  radiofrequency treatment. It is possible to have an adverse 
reaction to the TempSure device  use. There may be some side effects that w e don’t know about 
yet. 
 
3.3 Risk Analysis  
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION : 
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, noninvasive treatments and 
aesthetic applications. RF technology is a safe method for non -ablative (A non -wounding device 
treatment which heats underlying skin) treatment because energy can be pre cisely delivered 
through the skin to the dermal tissue beneath without damaging the epidermis.  
 
Aging skin shows decreased collagen synthesis and alteration of fiber networks. By gently heating 
dermis tissue (which is comprised of collagen, elastic fibers and ground substance), both 
immediate effects (collagen contraction) and long -term effects (woun d-healing response with 
neocollagen production) will occur. RF -induced thermal injury to the dermal tissue will produce a 
microinflammatory response to induce collagen denaturation, contraction, and subsequent 
synthesis  as well as elastin and ground substa nce production.3 This, in turn, creates a tightening 
effect that helps to eliminate  facial wrinkles , and is also used  for other cosmetic treatments on the 
body.4 
 
The extent of collagen shrinkage, fibroblast activation, fibroplasia and neocollagenesis in the 
different skin layers is based on a complex multivariate mechanism, which depends on the 
temperature distribution and timing.2 Further investigation of paramete r optimization is necessary 
to achieve safe and efficacious results.

__________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version  4.0: January 20, 202 2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 35 
 
The risk identified with the overall clinical investigation is the integrity of the data collected. There 
are multiple clinical miti gation strategies for the risk identified. Proper training on the protocol will 
be performed. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize subject and data risks.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have improvement in  their facial wrinkles . 
 
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of radiofrequency devices for non -invasive cosmetic treatments 
due to current patient satisfaction of co smetic results with the currently available devices. 
However, there is still a level of interest in novel technologies that could reduce the need for future 
treatments.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY:  
There is uncertainty of efficacy results while using the TempSure  device in this study.  
 
CONCLUSION:  
This device is determined to be a non -significant risk study  and will be using a handpiece not cleared 
for use by the FDA . The Icon device is cleared for u se by the FDA but may not be used within its 
currently cleared instructions for use.  The risks posed to the subjects and integrity of data are 
acceptable .

14.0  ADVERSE REACTIONS  DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
All adverse events that occur, starting from the time of the first treatment , will be recorded in the 
source documents  and Case Report Forms (CRF) . 
Adverse Events (AE) occurring will be captured and followed until the co ndition resolves, 
stabilizes,  is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Subjects will be instructed tha t 
they may contact the  Investigator at any time throug hout the course of the study.  
The Investigator and/or desig nated study staff will review each event and asse ss its relationship to 
the study device  (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the TempSure® treatments:  
• Not rela ted – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’ s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications admini stered to the subject.

Version  4.0: January 20, 202 2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 35 
 
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other fac tors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stopping the investigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity.  Using t he following 
definitions for rating severity will be used:  
• Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday  
activities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adver se device experience, in -patient hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life -
threatening,  or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed i n this definition  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within 24 hours of ackno wledgment to the Sponsor  whether or not the serious events are deemed 
sampling session -related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21  CFR part 812 and the IRB 
will be notified accordingly.  
   
The SAE information will be entered into the database and a desk copy o f the complete SAE report 
will be submitted to the study file .  
 
Adverse events, whether serious or non -serious, will be followed until the condit ion is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained  or the subject is lost to follow -up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow -up.  Following the resolution of any study -
associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports for that subject.

STUDY PROTOCOL  
The purpose of this study is to generate longitudinal pilot data that investigates 1) which factors (stressful life 
events, psychiatric characteristics, and work environment characteristics) are associated with stress and 
subsequent suicidal ideation; and 2) to explore the preliminary impact of an existing evidence -based sleep 
intervention, Somni©14, on stress, psychological health, and suicidal ideation in working nursing 
professionals. The specific aims  are: 
Aim 1.  To investigate associations between sleep, stressful life events (life stressors, discrimination, 
lateral violence), psychiatric characteristics (psychiatric diagnosis, subjective mood), work 
environment characteristics (workload, shift type and duration,  overtime, nurse work environment, 
and team relations) and stress (self -reported and heart rate variability) in working nursing 
professionals while controlling for standard covariates known to influence stress. Hypothesis 1: 
Suboptimal work environment characteristics are positively associated with self -report and physiologic 
indicators of stress [heart rate variability  (HRV)]. Hypothesis 2: Poor sleep (duration and quality) will be 
positively associated with self -report and physiologic indicators of stress (HRV).  
Aim 2.  To determine if stress exposure (self -report and HRV) are associated with predisposing 
factors (sleep, stressful life events, additional psychiatric characteristics, and work environment 
characteristics), and to explore whether stress mediates the effect of predisposing factors on suicidal ideation in working nursing professionals. Hypothesis: Nurses with low HRV are at higher risk 
for suicidal behavior when exposed to poor sleep, the presence of psychiatric characteristics (e.g. 
Depression), stressful life events, or suboptimal work environment characteristics (e.g., poor team relations).  
Exploratory Aim.  To explore the preliminary impact of an existing sleep intervention ( Somni©) on self - 
reported stress, HRV, sleep, and psychiatric health outcomes including depression, burnout, and suicidal ideation.  
 
STUDY DESIGN . This study is a prospective pragmatic pilot trial to generate data needed to inform a fully -
powered longitudinal study consisting of nurses across a wider geographic region.   There are 4 study 
components:  
1. Electronic  Quantitative Surveys (baseline, Week 4 & Week 8) will consist of demographic questions and 
validated measures for personal characteristics, sleep, stressful life events, psychiatric characteristics, work environment factors, and all psychological health outcomes. (Table 1). The surveys will be administered 3 
times (baseline, week 4 and week 8) to generate pilot longitudinal data. 
 
2. Psychological Assessment (baseline) . To confirm a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis, a Structured 
Clinical interview for DSM -5 Diagnosis (Research version) ( SCID -5-RV) will be administered in -person by a 
Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) at baseline. SCID -5-RV is a semi- structured interview 
guide for making major DSM -5 diagnoses such as mood disorders, psychotic symptoms, substance use, 
sleep, and trauma - or stressor -related disorders and takes approximately 45- 60 minutes to administer. 
Studies suggest that prior history of mental illness, such as depression, has been linked to suicide.  
3. Physiologic Biomarkers (Weeks 1- 8). Heart rate and sleep (hours/day) will be collected using a wearable 
device, Oura ring©, a piece of jewelry that can be custom fit to each participant. Heart rate variability (HRV), a 
highly sensitive physiologic metric for stress, is the constant variation in milliseconds between beats, and 
controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Low HRV is a strong indicator of physiologic stress (fight or flight response) and has been associated with increased risk for suicide at tempt. Studies have demonstrated high 
validity in the assessment of HRV and sleep using the Oura ring
©. The device will also collect activity levels 
(steps/day) and sleep cycles, known confounders for stress levels.  
 
4. Sleep Intervention (Weeks 4 -8) Somni© is an evidence- based personalized sleep intervention aimed at 
promoting optimal sleep health and has demonstrated effectiveness in shift workers outside the healthcare 
sector (e.g. Disney). Somni© consists of a sleep kit and a smart phone application. The sleep kit is box of 
items with demonstrated past evidence of improving sleep health: Blue light blocking glasses, white noise 
machine, lavender spray , ear plugs, light blocking eye mask, and herbal tea. Rather than dictate a “one size 
fits all” approach to optimize sleep health, there is current evidence that individualized sleep interventions are 
recommended to optimize sleep quality. Somni© permits individualized sleep quality promotion and 
participants are able to select their preferred use, timing, and duration of each of the box contents. The kit is accompanied by a Somni
© smartphone app that prompts participants to input the use of each component in 
the kit and provide a subjective sleep quality rating each day. Drs. Norful and Shechter have partnered with the developers of Somni
© who will provide free sleep kits and app access to our study participants. The 
Somni© app is interoper able with the Oura Ring© and will automatically sync all physiologic and sleep data 
together in one location, fully accessible to the participants, and displayed in graphs in the Somni© app that 
are easy to read and interpret (e.g. total daily steps; daily sleep hours). Somni© will be implemented Weeks 4 
through 8 to investigate its preliminary impact on stress and suicidal ideation by comparing survey and 
physiologic metrics  from Weeks 1 -4.  
 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
First, we will calculate composite scores of individual measures (sleep, stressful life events,  psychiatric 
characteristics, and work environment characteristics). Descriptive statistics will be calculated including means 

𝑌𝑌 and standard deviations (normally distributed values), median and interquartile range (non - normally distributed 
variables), or absolute and relative frequencies (categorical variables). Outliers and missing data will be 
assessed (outliers > 3 standard deviations from the mean will be removed). Significance level will be set at 𝛼𝛼 = 
0.05.  
Aim 1.  We will calculate bivariate Pearson or Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficients as well as simple 
linear regression and univariate ANOVAs. We will use linear mixed models to examine the relationships 
between individual and composite scores of factors  (sleep, stressful life events; psychiatric characteristics; 
work environment characteristics) and 1) self -report stress and 2) HRV, while controlling for personal 
characteristics (age, sex, highest degree earned, years of experience, years of practice in current environment, 
smoking status). We propose the following model to test all hypotheses:  
   𝑔𝑔[𝐸𝐸( 𝑖𝑖)] = 𝛽𝛽𝑜𝑜 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2𝐹𝐹 where Y𝑔𝑔 represents the outcomes measure (self -report and HRV separately) for 
each participant i. X i are the individual- level covariates (e.g., sex, gender, race, age, mental health history), 𝐹𝐹 
represents each job stressor and work environment variable. As the primary outcome is stress (mean score and mean HRV), possible distributions such as Poisson, zero- truncated Poisson, negative binomial, or zero - 
truncated negative binomial will be assessed to determine the best fit link function.  
 
Aim 2. We will classify nurses into quartiles of high (top 25%), medium (middle 50%), and low (bottom 25%) 
HRV. We will use descriptive statistics to examine individual measures and composite scores of factors (sleep, 
stressful life events, psychiatric characteristics, work environment characteristics) and suicidal behavior [C -
SSRS score]). To evaluate the change in suicidal ideation over time and the impact of each factor composite score, we will fit conditional latent growth curve models using 3 data points. The models will be expressed such 
that, given mean HRV and baseline composite scores for each factor category: 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 + 𝜇𝜇𝛽𝛽𝜆𝜆
𝑖𝑖  + 𝛾𝛾1𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖  + 
𝛾𝛾2𝑊𝑊𝐸𝐸𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖) + (𝜁𝜁𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 + 𝜁𝜁𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 i
s the C -SSRS score for nurse i at time t, 𝜇𝜇𝑎𝑎 is the latent variable for 
the intercept value (baseline score), 𝜇𝜇𝛽𝛽 is the random latent variable for slope (growth over time) for nurse i 
multiplied  by the vector of factor loadings specifying time, 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the time -specific residual for nurse I, 𝜁𝜁𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 
and 𝜁𝜁𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 are r
andom components of the latent intercept and slope variables, respectively. Sleep, stressful life 
events and psychiatric characteristics are fixed (time- invariant) predictors. The factor loadings for time on slope 
can be fixed to adjust for gaps in outcomes, which would allow for modeling more distant (e.g., 2025) data from 
baseline without increasing the number of timepoints included in the model. Further, we anticipate fluctuations in HRV over time. To accommodate the change in trend, we will explore both linear and quadratic growth 
functions. Baseline global sleep scores (PSQI), stressful life events, psychiatric and work environment characteristics will serve as predictors of suicidal ideation change over time. Individual nurse characteristics 
and psychiatric characteristic controls will be included as an interaction term to compare curves across nurses. 
To explore whether stress mediates the effect of predisposing factors on suicidal ideation, we will compare the models assessing the effect of predisposing factors on suicidal ideation with and without the mediator outlined by Barron and Kenny difference method which be used to gauge the size of the mediation effect.  
 
Aim 3.  We will calculate descriptive statistics, percentages, and frequencies for 1) each Somni© sleep kit 
component  2) subjective sleep quality via Somni© app 3) global sleep scores (PSQI score) and HRV. We will 
test differences in global sleep scores (PSQI), mean sleep duration ( Oura ring), mean subjective sleep quality 
and use of sleep kit components at the individual level between the 3 data points. We will report the effect 
sizes and will test for significance in the model for each psychosocial and work environment factor, each 
Somni© sleep kit component (mean weekly frequency), and the mean PSQI score while controlling for age, 
sex, gender, race, and history of psychiatric diagnosis. We will repeat the same analysis modeling mean C -
SSRS as the dependent variable. To evaluate the change in suicidal behavior over time and the impact of 
global sleep (PSQI score) and eac h Somni© sleep kit component (mean weekly frequency), we will fit 
conditional latent growth curve models.

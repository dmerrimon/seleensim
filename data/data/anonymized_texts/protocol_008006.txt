STUDY PHASE  Phase 3  
TITLE  A Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized -Withdrawal , Multicenter Study of 
the Efficacy and Safety of JZP-258 in Subjects with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy  
LOCATIONS  This study will be conducted at multiple international sites  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objective:  
To evaluate the efficacy of JZP-258 in the treatment of cataplexy in subjects with 
narcolepsy  
Key Secondary objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of JZP-258 in the treatment of excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) in subjects with narcolepsy  
Secondary objective: 
To evaluate the safety of JZP-258 in the treatment of subjects with narcolepsy  
with cataplexy  
Exploratory  objective : 
To characterize the conversion from non-Xyrem anticataplectic treatment 
regimens to JZP-258 in subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy  
DESIGN  This is a 2-part study consisting of the MAIN Study (a double -blind, pl acebo -
controlled, randomized -withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of 
JZP- 258) followed by a 24-week  Open-Label  Extension  study.  
 
MAIN STUDY  
The Main Study consists of the following periods, which are described further below:  
• Screening Period for up to 30 days  
• Optimized Treatment and Titration Period for 12 weeks  
• Stable -Dose Period for 2 weeks  
• Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period for 2 weeks  
• Safety Follow -up Period for 2  weeks  
 
Subjects are eligible to enter the Main Study if they meet all eligibility criteria and 
their treatment status is:  
• Currently treated with a stable dose of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) for at least 
2 months prior to screening 
• Currently treated with a stable dose of Xyrem and an additional 
anticataplectic for at least 2 months prior to screening  
• Currently treated with an anticataplectic and not treated with Xyrem  
• Not currently treated with any anticataplectic at screening.  
 
All subjects will be allowed to continue with their stimulant or non -Xyrem alerting 
agent therapy, if applicable, if doses h ave been unchanged for 2  months.

 DESIGN (continued)  Screening Period (up to 30 days)  
All subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Screening Period.  
Rescreening  
Subjects may be allowed to rescreen (one time) if they previously did not meet all 
eligibility requirements  at Visit 1 . Rescreening may occur following resolution of 
transient exclusionary conditions or stabilization of conditions that were exclusionary 
in the unstable state (e.g., unstable hypothyroidism) and is permitted only with the 
permission of the Medical Monitor. Subjects who are approved for rescreening must 
be re- consented and repeat all screening procedures.  
Optimized Treatment and Titration Period (12  weeks) 
During this period subjects will be transitioned to JZP -258 base d on their treatment 
status at study entry. All subjects will begin JZP -258 treatment at the beginning of 
this period and continue through Week 12. They will be treated with JZP -258 alone 
for the final two weeks of this 12 -week period. Once the JZP -258 dos e has been 
optimized per the Investigator’s judgment, these subjects may enter the 2 -week 
Stable -Dose Period with that dose. For the purposes of describing the transition to 
JZP- 258, these subjects’ pretreatment status will be defined as Pre- randomization 
Groups 1 -4. 
• Pre-randomization Group 1(Subjects on Xyrem at study entry):  Subjects who 
are only treated with Xyrem as an anticataplectic at study entry will be 
switched from Xyrem gram for gram to JZP -258 and remain on this JZP -258 
dose for a minimum of 2 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP -258 may then be 
titrated during the subsequent 8 weeks to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose. Subjects must be maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, and effective 
dose of JZP -258 for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the Stable- Dose Period. 
 
• Pre-randomization Group 2 (Subjects on Xyrem and an additional 
anticataplectic at study entry): Subjects who enter the study on Xyrem and an 
additional anticataplectic will be switched from Xyrem gram for gram to 
JZP- 258 and remain on this JZP -258 dose for a minimum of 2  weeks. 
Following this 2 -week period subjects will be tapered off the additional 
anticataplect ic over a minimum period of 2  weeks and up to 8  weeks. 
If needed, the dose of JZP -258 may be further titrated to a stable, tolerable, 
and effective dose during this 8 -week period. Subjects must be maintained on 
an unchanged, tolerable, and effective dose o f JZP -258 alone for at least 2 
weeks prior to entering the Stable- Dose Period.  
• Pre-randomization Group 3 (Subjects on a non -Xyrem anticataplectic at study 
entry):  Subjects who enter the study on a non- Xyrem anticataplectic and are 
not treated with Xyrem will be titrated to a tolerable dose of JZP -258 over a 
minimum of 2  weeks at the start of this period.  After initial titration to 
JZP- 258, subjects will be tapered off other anticataplectics over a minimum 
of 2 weeks and up to 8 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP -258 may be further 
titrated to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose during this 8 -week period. 
Subjects must be maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, and effective dose 
of JZP -258 alone for at least 2  weeks prior to entering the Stable -Dose Period.  
• Pre-randomization Group 4 (Subjects not treated with an anticataplectic at 
study entry):  Subjects who are not treated with any anticataplectic at the study 
entry will be initiated and titrated with JZP -258 over a minimu m of 2 weeks 
and up to 8 weeks to  achieve a stable, tolerable, and effective dose during this 
period. Subjects must be maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, and effective 
dose of JZP -258 alone for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the Stable -Dose 
Period.

 DESIGN  (continued)  Stable-Dose Period (2 weeks)  
All subjects must have been titrated or converted to a tolerable  and effective JZP- 258 
dose.  Subjects will remain on this stable JZP-258 dose, unchanged, during this 
2-week period. The baseline number of  weekly cataplectic attacks and baseline EDS 
scores , as well as other secondary endpoints (as applicable),  will be determined in 
this period. 
Double-Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period (2 weeks) 
Subjects are eligible to enter the Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period if the 
dose of JZP -258 remains unchanged during the Stable -Dose Period and, in the 
judgment of the Investigator, no clinically significant worsening in narcolepsy 
symptoms or clinically significant adverse events (AEs) due to JZP -258 treatment 
have occurred  and subjects have completed daily dosing and cataplexy diaries in the 
Stable -Dose Period as described in Section 6.7 and Section 6.12.7 . 
Randomization will be stratified based on each subject ’s pre-randomization group , as 
defined at study entry. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of the 
following two treatments during the 2 -week Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  
Period:  
JZP-258: JZP-258 will be continued as a doubl e-blind treatment at the stable  dose 
taken in the prior 2  weeks  
JZP-258 Placebo : Placebo will be initiated as a double -blind treatment at a 
volume equivalent to the JZP-258 dose taken in the prior 2 weeks.  
Safety Follow -up Period  (2 weeks)  
Subjects  who do not enter the open label segment of the study will return for a Safety 
Follow -up visit 2 weeks after the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period.  The 
Safety Follow -up visit will not take place if the subject directly rolls over into the 
Open -Label Extension at Visit 16 . 
 
OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION   
Subjects who complete the double -blind treatment during the Main Study are eligible 
to enter a 24 -week Open -Label Extension which consists of the following:   
• Open -Label Extension Period for 24 weeks  
• Open -Label Safety Follow -up Period  for 2 weeks   
 
During this period subjects will receive open -label JZP -258.  
Subjects are eligible to enter the Open -Label Extension if they meet all eligibility 
criteria and their treatment status is:  
• Completed double -blind treatment in the Main Stu dy and rolling over into the 
Open -Label Extension  
• Completed the Main Study and currently treated with Xyrem alone or Xyrem 
plus an additional anticataplectic  
• Completed the Main Study and currently treated with a non -Xyrem

• Completed the Mai n Study and not currently receiving treatment  
DESIGN (continued)  Open-Label Extension Period (24  weeks) 
Subjects can enter the Open -Label Extension dire ctly from the Main Study (enter  at 
Visit 16) or after completion of the Main Study (enter at Visit 18).  
• Rollover Subjects:  those who enter the Open- Label Extension at Visit 16 
(i.e., “rollover” directly from the Main Study [after a few additional 
procedures ]) (see Section 7.2.1.1 ). Their Visit 16 has the dual purpose of 
being the last day of the Main Study and Day 1 for the Open -Label Extension.  
• Re-entry Subjects: those who enter the Open- Label E xtension following 
completion of the Main Study (i.e., require “re -entry” into the study). Their 
Open -Label Extension Day 1 is at Visit 19 and they undergo Open -Label 
screening at Visit 18.  
 
Prior to any study activity informed consent for the Open -Label E xtension will be 
obtained.   
Rollover Subjects (enter the Open -Label Extension at Visit 16 ) 
They will undergo additional procedures from Amendment  4 at Visit 16, including 
study drug dispensing of open- label JZP -258 (see Section 7.2.1.1 ).  
Re-entry Subjects (enter the Open -Label Extension at Visit 18 ) 
Those subjects who complete the double -blind treatment prior to regulatory approval 
of Amendment 4 will be required  to have the 2 -week Safety Follow -up visit and must 
re-enter at the Open -Label Extension prior to the last subject completing the Main 
Study. Subjects re -entering will undergo screening (up to 30 days) and receive Open -
Label JZP -258 at Visit 19. 
 Open-Label Extension Safety Follow -up Period  (2 weeks)  
Subjects will return for a Safety Follow -up visit 2 weeks after the Open- Label 
Extension Period.  
ESTIMATED DURATION 
OF STUDY It is anticipated that enrollment will be completed in approximately 18 months . The 
estimated duration of the study ( Main Study and Open -Label Extension ) is 
approxi mately  2 ½ years . 
STUDY POPULATION  The study will enroll subjects who are diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 
who have signed the informed consent form in accordance with local ethics 
committee requirements. Approximately 185 subjects will be enrolled  into the study 
from the four therapy groups (pre -randomization groups) described above.  An effort 
will be made to include  at least 50 subjects  previously  on Xyrem and 60  subjects 
previously using Xyrem plus other anticataplectics or non -Xyrem anticataplectics 
alone in the study . A minimum of 130  subjects (65  subjects per the two treatment 
groups: JZP -258 and JZP -258 placebo ) are planned to be randomized into  the 
Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period. However, due to the potential limited 
availability of study participants (e .g., current Xyrem patients unwilling to interrupt 
therapy for potential placebo therapy), the minimum numbers of subjects in the prior 
therapy groups may be adjusted as necessary to ensure enrollment completion in a 
timely manner.

 EFFICACY  ASSESSMENTS  Efficacy assessments in general will be comparisons of the measurement (s) made 
during or at the end of the 2 weeks of the Stable -Dose Period compared with the 
2 weeks or the end of the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period.   
Primary endpoint:  
Change in wee kly number of cataplexy attacks  from the  two weeks of the Stable -
Dose Period to the  two weeks of the  Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  
Period 
Key secondary endpoint:  
Change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score from the end of the Stable - 
Dose Period to the end of the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period  
Other secondary endpoints:  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) for narcolepsy overall  at the end of 
the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period 
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) for narcolepsy overall  at the end of 
the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period 
Change in Quality of Life (QoL) (SF -36) from the end of the Stable -Dose Period 
to the end of the Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period  
Change in Qol (EuroQol 5 Dimensions Self -Report Questionnaire ) from the end 
of the Stable -Dose Period to  the end of the Double -Blind Randomized -
Withdrawal  Period  
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  Safety will be assessed at time points specified in the schedule of events, as well as 
throughout the study. Safety assessments will include the following:  
• Treatment- emergent adverse event s (TE AEs) 
• Vital signs  
• Physical examinations (including weight)  
• 12-lead ECG s 
• Clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis)  
• Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) for emergent suicidality  
• Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ-9) for emergent depression  
 During the study all subjects will be carefully monitored for emergent depression and 
suicidality using the PHQ -9 and the C -SSRS. The subject will be evaluated and an 
assessment of risk will be made by a qualified mental health professional if major 
depres sion is suspected or active suicidal ideation is identified.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  A sample size of 65 subjects randomized per treatment group will provide at least 
90% power to assess the difference  in the change in mean weekly number of 
cataplexy attacks , from the Stable- Dose Period to the Double -Blind Randomized -
Withdrawal  Treatment Period,  between JZP- 258 and placebo. Assuming a 30% 
dropout rate prior to randomization, up to 185 subjects will be enrolled (including  at 
least 50 subjects on Xyrem, and 60 subjects using Xyrem plus other anticataplectics 
or non -Xyrem anticataplectics alone, as applicable) to ensure that a minimum of 
130 subjects enter the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal  Period.  
A hierarchical group s equential testing strategy, as described in  Section  9.14 and 
Section 9.15, will be used to control the family -wise Type I error rate at the  
0.05 significance level for two -sided testing across the primary and key secondary 
endpoints.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
(continued)  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to assess the primary 
efficacy endpoint. The model will include treatment group and Pre -randomization 
group as fixed effect s. The weekly number of cataplexy attacks during the Stable -
Dose Period will be included in the model as a covariate. The estimate for the 
treatment difference of JZP-258 versus placebo and the 95% confidence intervals will 
be presented. The normality assumption of the ANCOVA model will be examined by 
residual analysis using the Shapiro -Wilk test. If the normality assumption is 
considered violated at the 0.05 signif icance level, a non -parametric ANCOVA with 
the data replaced by their ranks will be used.  
Analyses of the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be similar to the primary 
endpoint.  
For the other secondary efficacy endpoints, CGIc and PGIc  ratings will be ana lyzed 
as response frequencies using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for the row 
mean score difference. All other non -categorical parameters will be analyzed by 
ANCOVA or non -parametric ANCOVA, similar to the primary endpoint, as 
appropriate.  
Safety  analyses will be descriptive in nature, and no formal statistical testing 
performed.  
Final Safety Analysis  
A fi
nal safety analys is will be performed once all subjects have completed or 
terminated from the study.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Narcolepsy is a life-long neurologic disease for which no cure has been identified. The 
worldwide prevalence of narcolepsy is estimated to be 0.02% to 0.067% ( Ohayon 2007), and in 
the United States  (US) , the disease afflicts approximately 1 in 2000 individuals ( Majid & 
Hirschkowitz 2010). Narcolepsy has been defined as a rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder resulting from the dysregulation of the sleep- wake cycle ( Nishino 2007). It is 
characterized by pathological sleepiness, commonly termed excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, and includes disrupted nighttime sleep (DNS) and abnormal REM sleep manifestations, including cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations ( Boscolo-
Berto et al. 2012, Dauvilliers et al. 2013).  
Xyrem
® (sodium oxybate) oral solution was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in 2002 for the treatment of cataplexy and in 2005 for the treatment of EDS, both in 
patients with narcolepsy ( Xyrem US Prescribing Information (PI) 2015) : Clinical Program in 
Cataplexy and EDS in Patients with Narcolepsy . In 2005, Xyrem was also approved by Health 
Canada’s Therapeutic Products Directorate for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy ( Xyrem Canadian Product Monograph 2014), and by the European Agency for the 
Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the European Union (EU; Xyrem  EU Summary of Product 
Characteristics 2015) for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adult patients and the 
Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy.  
Xyrem has been available in the U S since 2002, and is the only approved treatment in the US for 
cataplexy in narcolepsy as well as the only approved treatment for both cataplexy and EDS, the 
two primary symptoms of narcolepsy. Since first approval, cumulative exposure to Xyrem in the US up to July 16, 2015 is estimated to be over 54,400 unique patients and 75,849 patient- years 
on therapy (data on file).  
Xyrem is dosed at night and has an effective dose range of 6 to 9 g per night, with a 
recommended starting dose of 4.5 g per night. Dos es are administered as two equally divided 
doses taken at bedtime and 2.5 to 4 hours later . Section 1.3 provides summaries of information 
about the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profile of Xyrem. 
The active ingredient in Xyrem is sodium oxybate, a Schedule III substance and the sodium salt 
of the endogenous neurotransmitter gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which is found in many 
tissues of the body. The sodium salt is used in the current Xyrem formulation because GHB is unstable at neutral pH, spontaneously forming its lactone (gamma butyrolactone).  
Although proven to be safe and effective when prescribed according to the recommended 
regimen, the current formulation of Xyrem adds a significant amount of sodium to a patient ’s 
diet. Administration of 9 g/night, the maximum recommended dose of Xyrem, results in a daily intake of an additional 1.64 g sodium, 109% of the adequate intake ( CDC 201 0).

Page 23 of 130 
 For patients on a restricted salt diet who are allowed 2 g of sodium a day, the 1.64 g sodium from 
a 9 gram Xyrem dose can pose difficulties. The current prescribing information for Xyrem 
(sodium oxybate) oral solution includes a warning to monitor patients who are sensitive to 
sodium intake (e.g., those with heart failure, hypertension, or impaired renal function). These conditions are not uncommon in the narcolepsy population, which is known to have a high incidence of cardiovascular comorbidity. In one retrospective study ( Ohayon 2013) comparing  
organic diseases in 320 patients with narcolepsy versus age - and sex -matched controls in the 
general population, patients with narcolepsy had a much higher risk of heart diseases (adjusted odds ratio [AOR; 95% confidence interval, CI] of 2.07 [range 1.22-3.51] primarily in male patients compared to the general population) and a higher risk of hypertension (AOR 1.32 [range 1.02-1.70]). Epidemiological studies indicate an association of increased risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke, with 
increasing sodium intake ( EFSA 2006).  
JZP-258 could provide the known benefits of Xyrem treatment with an improved safety profile, particularly for patients with sodium -sensitive conditions but also for an y patient concerned 
about sodium intake. It could also enable patients with narcolepsy and cardiovascular, hypertensive, or renal conditions to continue on their Xyrem treatment or initiate oxybate treatment.

 1.3 Summary of Data on Xyrem (sodium oxybate)  
1.3.1 Pharmacokinetics  
Following oral administration, sodium oxybate oral solution is absorbed rapidly and consistently 
across the clinical dose range, with an absolute bioavailability of 88%. The average peak plasma concentrations (1
st and 2nd peak) following administration of a 4.5 g total daily dose, divided into 
two equivalent doses given under fasting conditions 4 hours apart, were similar: 84 and 93 micrograms/milliliter (mcg /mL), respectively. The average time to peak plasma concentration 
(T
max) ranged from 0.5 to 1.25 hours in eight pharmacokinetic studies. Following oral 
administration, the plasma levels of sodium oxybate increase more than proportionally with increasing dose, with blood levels increasing 3.7-fold as dose is doubled from 4.5 to 9 g. Administration of sodium oxybate immediately after a high- fat meal resulted in delayed 
absorption (average T
max increased from 0.75 h to 2.0 h) and reductions in peak plasma leve l 
(Cmax) by a mean of 58% and systemic exposure ( area under the curve; AUC) by a mean of 37%. 
Therefore, patients should allow at least 2 hours after eating before taking the first dose of sodium oxybate. Pharmacokinetics is not altered with repeat dosing. In a study of 18 female and 18 male healthy adult volunteers, no gender differences were detected in the pharmacokinetics of sodium oxybate following a single oral dose of 4.5 g. The half- life (t
1/2) is typically 0.5 to 1 hour.

 1.3.2 Pharmacodynamics and Mechanism of Action 
Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of GHB, an endogenous compound and metabolite of the 
neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The primary neural actions of GHB are inhibitory ( Pardi & Black 2006). Gamma hydroxybutyrate binds t o the GHB receptor (GHBR) 
(Snead 2000 ) and the B subtype of the gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABABR) 
(Mathivet et al. 1997, Lingenhoehl et al. 1999 ).  
Sodium oxybate is a central nervous system depressant. The precise mechanism of action of sodium oxybate is not known. It is hypothesized that its effects on cataplexy and EDS are mediated through neuropharmacologic, GABABR-mediated actions on noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as on thalamocortical neurons ( Xyrem US PI , Pardi & Black  
2006). Clinical trials have shown that sodium oxybate increases delta (slow- wave or restorative) 
sleep and improves sleep continuity. Other effects include increases in brain acetylcholine, and depression of glucose utilization, but not oxygen consumption, in the brain (Pardi & Black 2006). 
1.3.3 Clinical Program in Cataplexy and EDS in Patients with Narcolepsy  
The effectiveness of sodium oxybate in the treatment of cataplexy was established in two 
randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials (GHB -2 and S XB-21) in patients with 
narcolepsy. In GHB -2, both the 6 and 9 g/night doses resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in the frequency of cataplexy attacks. In SXB-21, patients randomized to placebo after discontinuing long-term open-label sodium oxybate therapy experienced a significant increase in cataplexy attacks, providing evidence of long-term efficacy of sodium oxybate.  
The effectiveness of sodium oxybate in the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy was established in 
two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials (SXB -15 and SXB- 22) in patients with 
narcolepsy. In SXB -15, statistically significant improvements were seen on the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) at the 6 and 
9 g/night doses of sodium oxybate. In SXB-22, a statistically significant improvement in the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score was seen in the sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate plus modafinil groups. Approximately 80% of subjects used concomitant stimulant therapy during the controlled clinical trials.  
In addition, five uncontrolled trials (OMC -SXB-20, OMC- GHB-3, OMC- SXB- 6, OMC SXB-7, 
and OMC- SXB-19) provide additional data supporting the use of sodium oxybate in patients 
with narcolepsy. Clinical and postmarketing experience with sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy is summarized in the Xyrem prescribi ng information (Xyrem US  PI).

 1.3.4 Safety Data from Clinical Trials in Narcolepsy  
Xyrem was studied in three placebo -controlled clinical trials (Trials GHB -2, OMC- SXB -15, and 
OMC- SXB-22; Xyrem US PI ) in 611 patients with narcolepsy (398 subjects treated with Xyrem, 
and 213 with placebo). A total of 781 patients with narcolepsy were treated with Xyrem in 
controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials.  Table 2 presents adverse reactions from th ree pooled, 
controlled trials (GHB -2, OMC- SXB -15, and OMC- SXB-22) in patients with narcolepsy. 
1.3.4.1 Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation  
Of the 398 Xyrem-treated patients with narcolepsy, 10.3% of patients discontinued because of adverse reactions compared with 2.8% of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was nausea (2.8%). The majority of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation began during the first few weeks of treatment. 
1.3.4.2 Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and twice the rate seen with placebo) in Xyrem -treated patients were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, enuresis, and tremor.  
1.3.4.3 Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or G reater 
Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any treatment group 
for three controlled trials and were more frequent in any Xyrem treatment group than with placebo. Adverse reactions are summarized by dose at onset. Nearly all patients in these studies initiated treatment at 4.5 g per night. In patients who remained on treatment, adverse reactions tended to occur early and to diminish over time.

 1.3.5 Safety Data from Healthy Volunteer Studies  
1.3.5.1 Xyrem (sodium oxybate)  
Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution was studied in 7 studies (one clinical pharmacology study 
and 6 drug-drug interaction studies). No deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred during 
any of these studies, and no subject was discontinued early for an AE. Overall, the AE profile was similar to that seen in patients.

 1.3.6 Postmarketing Experience with Xyrem   
In addition to those listed in Section 1.3.4, the following AEs that hav e a likely causal 
relationship to Xyrem exposure have been identified during postmarketing use of Xyrem: 
arthralgia, decreased appetite, fall, fluid retention, hangover, headache, hypersensitivity, hypertension, increased libido , memory impairment, nocturi a, panic attack, vision blurred, 
aggression, and weight decreased. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not 
always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.  
1.4 Summary of Data on JZP-258 Formulation  
1.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Data from Healthy Volunteer Study 
The JZP-258 formulation was studied in a single-center, open-label, randomized, single dose, 
crossover, study to compare the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, bioequivalence, and food effect of JZP -258 and Xyrem in healthy volunteers. Two formulations of oxybate (JZP-258 and 
Xyrem) were compared under fasting and fed conditions. A total of 36 subjects were enrolled, and 30 subjects completed the study and had evaluable pharmacokinetic data. 
Following the administration of single doses of JZP-258 and Xyrem under fasted condition, 
mean concentration- time profiles were generally similar for both treatments. The mean oxybate 
C
max values were 101.8 µg/mL and 135.7 µg/mL for JZP-258 and Xyrem, respectively, and th e 
mean AUC 0-inf values were 236.5 µg·h/mL and 265.2 µg·h/mL for JZP -258 and Xyrem, 
respectively. Median T max values were 0.75 hour and 0.50 hour for JZP-258 and Xyrem, 
respectively, and mean t 1/2 value was 0.57 hour for both treatments. 
Following the administration of single doses of JZP-258 and Xyrem under fed condition, mean concentration -time profiles were generally similar for both treatments). The mean oxybate C
max 
values were 77.4 µg/mL and 84.3 µg/mL for JZP-258 and Xyrem, respectively, and the mean AUC
0-inf values were 214.8 µg·h/mL and 229.6 µg·h/mL for JZP -258 and Xyrem, respectively. 
Median T max values were 0.75 hour for both treatments, and mean t 1/2 values were comparable 
with 0.62 hour and 0.57 hour for JZP-258 and Xyrem, respectively. 
Although the mean concentration -time profiles were generally similar for JZP -258 versus Xyrem 
under the fasted condition with similar AUC, T max, and t 1/2, the FDA -defined bioequivalence 
criteria were met for oxybate plasma AUC (geometric mean ratio of 88.3% with 9 0% CI of 
84.4%-92.4%) but not for oxybate plasma C max (geometric mean ratio of 74.2% with 90% CI of 
67.8%-81.2%), therefore, JZP-258 and Xyrem are not bioequivalent under fasting conditions. Under the fed condition, JZP-258 was found to be bioequivalent to Xyrem with regard to C
max 
(geometric mean ratio of 93.5% with 90% CI of 85.4%-102.4%) and AUC (geometric mean ratio 
of 94.2% with 90% CI of 90.0%-98.6%) after single dose oral administration. 
Presence of food reduced oxybate exposure (C max and AUC) for both JZP-258 and Xyrem 
treatments, although the reductions were less pronounced for JZP-258 compared with Xyrem.  Please refer to current version of the IB for additional information.

 1.4.2 Safety Data from Healthy Volunteer Pharmacokinetic Study  
No SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs occurred during the study. Most AEs were of mild 
severity, none were severe, and most were considered related to study drug or procedure. Adverse events reported in ≥5% of subjects included somnolence, dizziness, naus ea, headache, 
fatigue, euphoric mood, abdominal pain, feeling of relaxation, hyperhidrosis, vomiting, vision blurred, dry mouth, back pain, confusional state, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. Under fasting 
conditions, the incidence of nausea (31.4% versus 47.2%) and vomiting (2.9% versus 13.9%) 
was lower with JZP-258 than with Xyrem, respectively; no other clinically important differences 
in AEs were observed between the JZP-258 formulation and Xyrem. No clinically significant 
trends were noted in the results of clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, oxygen saturation, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), or physical examinations.

 3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a 2-part study consisting of the  MAIN Study ( a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized- withdrawal, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of JZP-258) followed by a 
24-week  Open-L abel Extension study .  
3.1.1 Main Study  
The Main Study consists of the following periods, which are further described be low: 
• Screening Period for up to 30 days 
• Optimized Treatment and Titration Period for 12 weeks  
• Stable -Dose Period for 2 weeks 
• Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period for 2 weeks 
• Safety Follow -up Period for 2 weeks 
 
Subjects are eligible to enter the Main  Study if they meet all eligibility criteria and their 
treatment status is:  
• Currently treated with a stable dose of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) for at least 2  months 
prior to screening  
• Currently treated with a stable dose of Xyrem and an additional anticataplectic for at 
least 2 months prior to screening 
• Currently treated with an anticataplectic and not treated with Xyrem  
• Not currently treated with any anticataplectic at screening  
 
All subjects will be allowed to continue with their stimulant or non -Xyrem alerting agent 
therapy, if applicable, if doses have been unchanged for 2 months.  
3.1.1.1 Screening Period (up to 30 days)  
All subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during the Screening Period (up to 30 days). 
Rescreening  
Subjects may be allowed to rescreen  (one time) if they previously did not meet all eligibility 
requirements at Visit 1 . Rescreening may occur following resolution of transient exclusionary 
conditions or stabilization of conditions that were exclusionary in the unstable state (e.g., 
unstable hypothyroidism) and is permitted only with the permission of the Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who are approved for rescreening must be re- consented and repeat the screening 
procedures described in Section 7.1.1. For subjects who are being rescreened, a repeat 
polysomnogram ( PSG) is not required if the results of a previous PSG  meet the current 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.

 3.1.1.2 Optimized Treatment and Titration Period (12 weeks)  
During this period subjects will be transitioned to JZP-258 based on their treatment status at 
study entry. All subjects will begin JZP-258 treatment at the beginning of this period and 
continue through Week 12. They will be tre ated with JZP- 258 alone for the final two weeks of 
this 12 week period. Once the JZP- 258 dose has been optimized per the Investigator’s judgment, 
these subjects may enter the 2 week Stable -Dose Period with that dose. For the purposes of 
describing the tran sition to JZP-258, these subjects’ pretreatment status will be defined as 
Pre-randomization Groups 1-4. 
Pre-randomization Group 1  
(Subjects on Xyrem at study entry )  
Subjects who are only treated with Xyrem as an anticataplectic at study entry will be switched  
from Xyrem  gram for gram to JZP-258 and remain on this  JZP-258 dose for a minimum of 
2 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP-258 may then be titrated during the subsequent 8 weeks to a 
stable, tolerable, and effective dose. Sub jects must be maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, 
and effective dose of JZP-258 for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the Stable -Dose Period.  
Pre-randomization Group 2  
(Subjects on Xyrem and an additional  anticataplectic at study entry ) 
Subjects who enter the study on Xyrem and an additional anticataplectic will be switched  from 
Xyrem gram for gram to JZP-258 and remain on this  JZP-258 dose for a minimum of 2 weeks. 
Following this 2- week period subjects will be tapered off the additional anticataplectic over a 
minimum period of 2 weeks and up to 8 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP-258 may be further 
titrated to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose during this  8-week  period. Subjects must be 
maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, and eff ective dose of JZP-258 alone for at least 2 weeks 
prior to entering the Stable -Dose Period.  
Pre-randomization Group 3  
(Subjects on a non- Xyrem anticataplectic at study entry )  
Subjects who enter the study on a non- Xyrem anticataplectic and are not treated with Xyrem will 
be titrated to a tolerable dose of JZP-258 over a minimum of 2 weeks at the start of this period. 
After initial titration to JZP-258, subjects will be tapered off other anticataplectics over a 
minimum of 2 weeks and up to 8 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP-258 may be further titrated to 
a stable, tolerable, and effective dose during this 8-week period. Subjects must be maintained on 
an unchanged, tolerable, and effective dose of JZP-258 alone for at least 2 weeks prior to 
enteri ng the Stable -Dose Period.  
 
Pre-randomization Group 4  
(Subjects not treated with an anticataplectic at study entry )  
Subjects who are not treated with any anticataplectic at the study entry will be initiated and 
titrated with JZP-258 over a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 8 weeks to achieve a stable, 
tolerable, and effective dose during this period. Subjects must be maintained on an unchanged, tolerable, and effective dose of JZP-258 alone for at least 2 weeks prior to entering the Stable -
Dose Period.

Page 34 of 130 
 3.1.1.3 Stable-Dose Period (2 weeks)  
All subjects must have been titrated or converted to a tolerable and effective JZP-258 dose. 
Subjects will remain on this stable JZP-258 dose, unchanged, during this 2 -week period. 
The baseline number of weekly cataplectic attacks and  baseline EDS scores, as well as other 
secondary efficacy endpoints  (as applicable) , will be determined in this period . 
3.1.1.4 Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal  Period (2 weeks)  
Subjects are eligible to enter the Double -Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period if  their dose of 
JZP-258 remains unchanged during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, no clinically significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant AEs due to JZP-258 treatment have occurred and subjects have completed daily dosing and cataplexy diaries in the Stable -Dose Period as described in Section 6.7 and Section 6.12.7. 
Randomization will be stratified based on each subject ’s pre-randomization group, as defined  at 
study entry. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of the following two treatments during the 2 -week Double- Blind  Randomized -Withdrawal Period: 
JZP-258: JZP-258 will be continued as a double- blind treatment at the stable dose taken 
in the prior 2  weeks. 
JZP-258 Placebo : Placebo will be initiated as a double- blind treatment at a volume 
equivalent to the JZP- 258 dose taken in the prior 2 weeks. 
3.1.1.5 Safety  Follow -up Period (2 weeks) 
Subjects who do not enter the Open-Label segment of the study will return for a Safety Follow -
up visit 2 weeks after the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period. The Safety Follow-up 
visit will not take place if the subject directly rolls over into the Open-Label Extension at Visit 
16.  
A study diagram for the main study is presented in Figure 1.

 3.1.2 Open- Label Extension  
Subjects who complete the double- blind treatment during the Main Study are  eligible to enter a 
24-week Open Label Extension, which consists of the following: 
• Open -Label Extension Period for 24 weeks

 3.1.3 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
This study is being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JZP-258 in the treatment of 
cataplexy in subjects with narcolepsy and treatment of EDS in subjects with narcolepsy. JZP -258 
is being developed in order to provide the same treatment bene fits as Xyrem with reduced 
sodium exposure to potentially benefit all patients, particularly  those with sodium- sensitive 
conditions. 
A double-blind placebo controlled randomized-withdrawal study of Xyrem in adult narcolepsy 
subject s (OMC -SXB-21) was one of the pivotal studies that supported FDA and European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Xyrem for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in subject s 
with narcolepsy. In this Xyrem study, the return of narcolepsy symptoms including cataplexy was studied in 55 subjects over a 2-week treatment period following long- term (greater than 
6 months) Xyrem  treatment. Relative to subjects who remained on Xyrem , subjects in the 
placebo group had a small, gradual increase in the number of cataplexy attacks during the first 
and the second week of interruption of treatment with Xyrem . The number of subject s reported 
to have AEs, were higher in the group that switched to placebo compared to the group that 
continued with Xyrem therapy in the final 2- week Double-Blind R andomized -Withdrawal 
period, but these differences were not found to be statistically significant. Therefore, this same study design, replicating the original Xyrem placebo-controlled registration study, was chosen for the current trial (Study 15 -006) in the investigation of JZP-258 (a new investigational 
reduced -sodium drug product) and was agreed upon with FDA as an adequate trial for 
registration . 
The inclusion of a placebo control group in this study is necessary to determine the efficacy and 
safety of this new i nvestigational medicinal product. Although effective doses of JZP -258 may 
be observed during Open-L abel-Titration and S table -Dose Periods of the study, t he definitive 
efficacy effect can be determined only after double-blind comparison with placebo, considering the slightly different pharmacokinetic profile of JZP -258 (lower C
max versus Xyrem).  The risks 
of placebo exposure were  taken into consideration during the protocol design. The incorporation 
of a short 2- week, randomized -withdrawal phase into  the study may allow the demonstration of 
the efficacy of JZP -258 as measured by the recurrence of cataplexy symptoms without extensive 
placebo burden to the subjects. In this 16 week long study, the maximal time during the Main 
Study that any subject will be exposed to placebo is 2 weeks (12.5% of total exposure time). 
Furthermore, the re currence of cataplexy during these two weeks, as pointed out above, is 
considered minimal to obtain statistically significant efficacy data compared to placebo. Importantly, in the case of emergency situations, as per Section 6.13.9 of the protocol, the 
Investigator will be able to unblind  a subject at any time for immediate medical management of 
the subject, if necessary.

 Jazz has recently modified the protocol (Amendment 4) to include a six month Open- Label 
Extension to the study to allow subjects who have completed the Double-Blind Randomized 
Treatment portion of the study to continue or re-enroll into the study and receive open- label 
JZP-258. This extension period was added to provide additional treatment benefit for subjects as well as to assess longer term safety with JZP -258.
 
3.2 Study Duration and Dates  
It is anticipated that enrollment will be completed in approximately 18 months. The estimated 
duration of the study (Main Study and Open-Label Extension) is approximately 2 ½ years.  
3.3 End of Trial  
The end of the trial will be the date of the last visit of the last remaining  subject in the trial.

 4 STUDY POPULATION SELECTION  
4.1 Selection of Study Population  
The study will enroll subjects who are diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy, and who have 
signed the informed consent form in accordance with local ethics committee requirements. 
Approximately 185 subjects will be enrolled  into the study from the four therapy groups (pre-
randomization groups) described in Section 3.1. An effort will be made to include at least 
50 subjects previously on Xyrem and 60 subjects previously using Xyrem plus other 
anticataplectics or non -Xyrem anticataplectics alone in the study . A minimum of 1 30 subjects 
(65 subjects per  the two treatment g roups; JZP -258 and JZP-258 placebo ) are planned to be 
randomized into the Double- Blind  Randomized- Withdrawal Period. However, due to the 
potential limited availability of study participants (e .g., current Xyrem patients unwilling to 
interrupt therapy for potential placebo therapy), the minimum numbers of subjects in the prior therapy groups may be adjusted as necessary to ensure enrollment completion in a timely manner.

allowed to rescreen (one time) if they previously did not meet all eligibility requirements 
(Section 3.1 ). Rescreening in the Main Study may occur following resolution of transient 
exclusionary conditions or stabilization of conditions that were exclusionary in the unstable state (e.g., unstable hypothyroidism) and is permitted only with the permission of the Medical Monitor.  Rescreening is not allowed in Open -Label Extension. 
Subjects will be considered eligible for the Optimized Treatment and Titration Phase of the study if they meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria. Subjects are eligible to enter the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period if the dose of JZP-258 remains 
unchanged during the Stable-Dose Period, and in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant AEs due to JZP -258 
treatment have occurred  and subjects have completed daily dosing and cataplexy diaries in the 
Stable -Dose Period as described in Section 6.7 and Section 6.12.7.

 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
5.1.1 Main Study  
5.1.1.1 Study Drug  
JZP-258 oral solution 0.5 g/mL. 
5.1.1.2 Placebo  
A matching oral solution to JZP-258 will be provided. The placebo formulation is an aqueous 
solution consisting of sodium citrate, malic acid and sucralose. All ingredients are compendial (USP/NF).   
Placebo treatment is applicable to the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period  only. 
5.1.1.3 Treatments Administered 
During the Optimized Treatment and Titration Periods all subjects will receive open -label 
JZP-258. 
Pre-randomization Groups 1 and 2  
Subjects entering the study on Xyrem alone or on Xyrem plus an additional anticataplectic will be switched from their current dose of Xyrem to JZP-258 on a gram to gram straight 
conversion at the start of the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period and remain on that 
dose for 2 weeks. If further titration is needed, titration will proceed at a rate of 1 o r 1.5 g 
per night per week during this period not to exceed a total dose of 9 g per night. 
Pre-randomization Groups 3 and 4  
Subjects entering the study receiving treatment with a non -Xyrem  anticataplectic only or 
not treated with an y anticatap lectic agent will receive an initial dose of JZP-258 4.5 g per 
night at the start of the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period. Dose adjustments will 
proceed at a rate of 1  or 1.5 g per night per week until a tolerable dose of JZP -258 is 
reached over a period of 2 weeks. If needed, the dose of JZP-258 may be further titrated to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose that does not exceed a total dose of 9 g per night. 
Pre-randomization Groups 2 and 3 will taper anticataplectics as described in Section  3.1. 
During the Stable- Dose Period subjects will receive open -label JZP-258 at the same unchanged 
dose that they received during the last 2 weeks of the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 46 of 130 
 All subjects will receive blinded study drug during the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal 
Period. At the end of the Stable -Dose Period, subjects enter the Double-Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal and will be randomized 1:1 to receive either JZP-258 at the dose taken during the 
last 2 weeks of the Stable-Dose Period or JZP- 258 placebo  (at a volume equivalent to the 
JZP-258 dose taken in the last 2 weeks of the Stable- Dose Period ).  
 
 
Study drug will be dispensed at clinic visits and, if applicable, at intervals specified by state or 
local regulations or to resolve logistical issues.  
5.1.2 Open- Label Extension  
5.1.2.1 Study Drug  
JZP-258 oral solution 0.5 g/mL. 
5.1.2.2 Treatments Adminis tered 
During the Open- Label Extension all subjects will receive open -label JZP -258. 
Subjects can enter the Open -Label Extension directly from the Main Study (enter at Visit 16) or 
after completion of the Main Study (enter at Visit 18) : 
• Rollover Subjects: those who enter the Open-Label Extension at Visit 16 (i.e., 
“rollover” directly from the Main Study [ after a few additional procedures ]) (see 
Section 7.2.1.1) . Their Visit 16 has the dual purpose of being the last day of the Main 
Study and Day 1 for the Open- Label Extension.  
• Re-entry Subjects: those who enter the Open -Label Extension following completion 
of the Main Study (i.e., require “re -entry” into the study). Their Open- Label 
Extension Day 1 is at Visit 19 and they undergo Open- Label screening at Visit 18.  
 
Rollover Subjects  
Subjects entering directly from the Main Study will be started at a dose no higher than the dose 
they received at the end of the Stable- Dose Period . A lower starting dose will be allowed at the  
discretion of the Investigator. If further titration  is require d, it will proceed at a rate of 1 or 1.5 g 
per night per week during this period, not to exceed a total dose of 9 g per night. The maximum 
dose should not be greater than 9 g/night.  
Re-entry Subjects  
Xyrem (alone or with an Additional Anticataplectic): Subjects re-entering the study 
during the Open -Label Extension on Xyrem alone or on Xyrem plus an additional 
anticataplectic will be switched from the ir current dose of Xyrem to JZP-258 on a gram 
to gram straight conversion at the start of the Open -Label Extension. If further titration is 
needed, titration wil l proceed at a rate of 1 or 1 .5 g per night per week during this period 
not to exceed a total dose of 9 g per night.

 Non-Xyrem Anticataplectic or Not Currently Receiving Treatment : Subjects re -
entering the study receiving treatment with a non-Xyrem anticataplectic only or not 
treated with any anticataplectic agent will receive an initial dose of JZP  258 4.5 g per 
night at the start of the Open- Label Extension. Dose adjustments wil l proceed at a rate of 
1 or 1.5 g per night per week until a tolerable dose of JZP-258 is reached. If needed, the dose of JZP-258 may be further titrated to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose that does 
not exceed a total dose of 9 g per night.  
Subjects should follow anticat aplectic  tapering as discussed in Section 5.6 with complete 
removal by Visit 30 . 
Study drug will be dispensed at clinic visits and, if applicable, at intervals specified by state or 
local regulations  or to resolve logistical issues. 
5.2 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Sodium oxybate has a t 1/2 of approximately 0.5 to 1 hour. Pharmacologic doses of sodium 
oxybate have clinical sedative effects that typically last 2 to 4 hours. Sodium oxybate in divided nightly doses has been studied in patients with narcolepsy and patients with fibromyalgia.  
Based on pharmacokinetic data demonstrating the generally similar mean concentration- time 
profiles for JZP-258 and Xyrem under the fasted condition with similar AUC, T
max and t 1/2, and 
FDA defined bioequivalence under fed conditions, the proposed dose range and timing of dosing 
of JZP-258 will be similar to Xyrem.  
With the following exception, all groups should dose with JZP-258 orally in two equally divided doses taken at bedtime and ag ain 2.5 to 4 hours later. Subjects who entered the study on Xyrem 
(Pre-randomization Groups 1 and 2) and have used a different nightly dosing regimen prior to 
study entry, may continue their prestudy dosing regimen throughout the study (i.e. the dosing regimen may consist of two or three equally or unequally nightly divided doses and dosing may 
begin after the first nightly awakening, however, a once nightly dosing will not be permitted during the study). Subjects entering the study on a different nightly dosing regimen may not 
change their regimen during the study. 
Subjects in all groups will be instructed to take each dose while in bed and remain in bed after 
each dose. Subjects should take the first dose of study drug at lea st 2 hours after eating.  
Investigators should caution subjects about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles or airplanes, until subjects are reasonably certain that study drug does not affect them adversely (e.g., impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills). Subjects should not engage in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, such as operating machinery or a motor vehicle or flying an airplane or going to school alone, for at least 6 hou rs after taking any dose of study drug.

 5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects are eligible to enter the Double -Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period if the dose of 
JZP-258 remains unchanged during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, no clinically significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant 
AEs due to JZP-258 treatment have occurred  and subjects have completed daily dosing and 
cataplexy diaries in the Stable -Dose Period as described in Section 6.7 and Section 6.12.7. At the 
beginning of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period, subjects will be randomized 
with equal allocation to either JZP- 258 at the stable dose established in the previous 2 weeks or 
to JZP-258 placebo at a volume equivalent to the JZP-258 dose that was established in the previous 2 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by Pre -randomization Group, as defined at 
study entry. 
During the Open -Label Periods (Optimized Treatment and T itration, Stable -Dose, and 
Open -Label Extension) all subjects will receive open -label JZP -258.  
5.4 Randomization  
A statistician selected by Jazz Pharmaceuticals will prepare and retain the master randomization 
code for the entire study. This statistician will not be involved in the analysis of this study. The randomization codes will be generated and retained according to Jazz Pharmaceuticals Standard 
Operating Procedure on the generation, distribution, and access to randomization information for clinical stud ies. Unless there is an emergency that requires the release of the subject’s assigned 
treatment, the code will not be broken or released until study data are collected and accepted for analysis as described in Section 6.13.9 and Section 9.14.  
The Investigator will access an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects.   
5.5 Blinding 
The Optimized Treatment  Titration and Stable- Dose Periods and Open- Label Extension  of this 
study will not be blinded to the subjects or the study personnel. A double-blind approach will be used during the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period. JZP-258 and JZP-258 placebo 
oral solution will be matched in volume, to ensure adequate blinding of the subject and study personnel.

5.6.1 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
In this study, the following medications are prohibited: 
a. Treatment with any central nervous system sedating agents including, but not limited to , 
benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics/hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics, 
opioids, barbiturates, phenytoin, and ethosuximide, or the MCT  inhibitor  valproate ar e 
prohibited during the study and must have been discontinued within 2 weeks prior to Day 1. (Discontinuation for the purpose of study enrollment is only permitted if 
considered safe by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor.) If a subject undergoes short-term out-patient procedures during the study and requires opioids or benzodiazepine use, study drug may be held for one night while these drugs are given. If opioid or benzodiazepine use is required for multiple days, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  
b. Other anticataplectic therapies (e.g., SNRI, SSRI, TCA or atomoxetine ) are prohibited 
during the Stable- Dose , Double- Blind , and Open-Label Extension Periods. For the Main 
Study, t hese therapies must have been tapered and discontinued during the cross titration 
in the Titration Period. (Discontinuation for the purpose of study enrollment is only permitted if considered safe by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor.) For the Open-Label Extension, tapering and discontinuation must occur by Visit 30. 
c. Oral isotretinoin (Accutane) is prohibited during the study.  
d. Investigational drugs other than study drug are prohibited during the study. 
e. Stimulants or alerting agents are disallowed during the study for subjects who were  not 
taking these medications at the start of the study.  
5.6.2 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
The following concomitant medications are permitted during the study with the following stipulations: 
a. Stimulants or alerting agents may be continued during the study  if doses were  unchanged 
for 2  months prior to dosing and doses remain unchanged throughout the study.

 All concomitant medications taken during the study by enrolled  subjects will be recorded on the 
Concomitant Medications electronic case report form ( eCRF) with indication, total daily dose, 
and dates of drug administration. 
5.7 Restrictions  
5.7.1 Prior Therapy  
Subjects who are on Xyrem alone or Xyrem plus an additional anticataplectic at the start of the 
study will be switched to JZP-258 at the start of the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period  
(Main Study) and if applicable, at the start of the Open- Label Ex tension. Subjects who are on 
any non- Xyrem anticataplectics will have these tapered and discontinued during the Optimized 
Treatment and Titration Period as th ey are cross titrated to JZP-258 (Main Study) and by Visit 30 
for the Open-Label Extension. 
All su bjects may continue prescription and OTC medications with the exception of the 
prohibited medications listed in Section 5.6. For the Main Study and the Open- Label Extension, 
subjects who plan to use an investigational drug (other than the study drug) during the study will 
not be allowed to enter the study. Additionally, subjects in the Main Study and those enrolling 
directly into the Open -Label Exten sion will not be allowed to enter if they used any other 
investigational drug (other than the study drug) within 30 days or five half- lives (whichever is 
longer) before the Screening  Visit  for the Main Study (all subjects)  or at Visit 18 for the Open -
Label Extension subjects (only those re- entering the study).  
5.7.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
Subjects should take the first dose of study drug at least 2 hours after eating. No other fluid or food restrictions are required.  
5.7.3 Other Restr ictions  
Subjects should take study drug while in bed and lie down immediately after dosing as study drug may cause them to fall asleep abruptly without first feeling drowsy.  
5.8 Treatment Compliance  
The number of bottles of clinical study medication  dispensed will be recorded on the 
investigational medicine record by the designated staff member. The volume of solution 
dispensed and returned will be recorded on the investigational medicine record. Treatment compliance will be calculated at each applic able clinic visit when drug is expected to be returned 
to the site.  
5.9 Packaging and Labeling  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals will provide the clinical site with JZP- 258 oral solution 0.5 g/mL for use 
during all phases of the study and JZP -258 placebo for use during the Double-Blind 
Randomized -Withdrawal Period.

 All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to current Good 
Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and local requirements and regulations. 
5.10 Storage and Accountability  
All study medications will be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and retained or destroyed according to applicable country and local regulations for a controlled substance and instructions from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Jazz Pharmaceuticals will specify the tem perature  conditions under 
which each study drug is stored. 
The investigator or designated pharmacist will maintain accurate records of receipt of all study drugs, including dates of receipt. Study drug supplies must be kept in a secure area and dispensed according to the protocol. Unused (or partially used) supplies must be accounted for on the drug inventory record provided by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or the Contract Research Organization (CRO). Receipt and dispensing of all study drug must be documented throughout the study and 
reconciled at study completion. Used and unused bottles of study drug will be returned or 
destroyed according to written instructions from Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee. For study 
drug returns, the return quantity (per bottle) will be recorded in a Drug Accountability log. A 
difference of 30 mL or more per bottle between the returned volume recorded by the site on the 
Drug Accountability log and the volume measured by the CRA will require a written 
explanation. After review of study drug accountability records at study completion, one copy of the drug inventory record will be retained by the CRO and the other will be retained by Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals.

 6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
All subjects will provide their written informed consent before the performance of any study 
related procedures.  
Each subject’s chart will have his or her signed informed consent form ( ICF) for study 
participation  included. When the study treatment is completed and the eCRF has been monitored, 
the ICF will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. The date of signed consent for enrolled 
subjects will be recorded on the e CRF.  Subjects will be given a copy of their signed ICF. 
6.2 Demographics  
Demographic information will be collected at Screening Visit 1 as permitted by regional or national regulations. Demographics will include the subject’s age (as indicated by date of birth, month and year of birth, year of birth or age at screening), sex, ethnicity, and race.  
6.3 Medical History  
A complete medical history for each subject will be collected during the Screening Period . The 
information will include, but is not limited to, symptoms of narcolepsy (current and past, including symptoms experienced prior to any narcolepsy treatment); concomitant medication use; any medications used for the treatment of narcolepsy since diagnosis; any prior reaction to drugs; history and treatment (if any) of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; reproductive status; and confirmation of relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any updates to the medical history (i.e., any conditions and surgeries/procedures  that occurred prior to the subject signin g the informed consent) will be 
assessed at Visit 2 prior to the start of the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period.  Conditions 
that occurred after the subject signed the informed consent will be recorded as AEs  (Section 
6.13) . 
For subjects who re-enter the study at the Open-Label Extension, their previously recorded medical history will be reviewed  and updated. New m edical history (occur ring after  completion 
of the Main Study and prior to consent for the Open-Label Extension) will be recorded  as 
medical history . 
6.4 Physical Examination  
A review of body systems should be obtained on each subject. Physical examinations will include an examination of body systems (except genitourinary examination), brief neurological examination (screening, end of Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period/Early 
Termination , Visit 18 [only for subjects who are re -entering], and Visit 33/Early Termination ), 
height (at scree ning only), and body weight measurements. Height and weight should be 
assessed in ordinary indoor  clothes without shoes. A qualified Investigator or designee should 
perform the examination.

Page 53 of 130 
 6.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs measurements will include temperature, respiration rate, sitting blood pressure, and 
heart rate. The measurements will be obtained at every clinic visit after the subject has been 
resting and seated for at least 5 minutes.  
6.6 Electrocardiography  
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be recorded prior to drawing blood samples with the subject resting 
supine for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be performed for the Main Study during the Screening  
Period  and at the end of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period  (or at Early 
Termination) and for the Open-Label Extension at Visit 18 ( Re-entry Subjects only) and at 
Visit 33 (or at Early Termination).  
Electrocardiograms will be reviewed, initially interpreted, signed, and dated by the Investigator 
after each ECG collection. All ECGs will be transmitted to a designated central ECG laboratory. 
A cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will conduct full over-read. A report based on data from this over- read will be issued to the site. The Principal Investigator or a designated physician 
is responsible for review of all ECGs.  
6.7 Study Drug Dosing Diary  
Subjects will complete the Study Drug Dosing Diary ( Appendix 3)  each morning from the start 
of the Open -label Titration Period until the end of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal 
Period . A Study Drug Dosing Diary will not be completed in the Open -Label Extension. 
Subjects must have completed the Study Drug Dosing Diary on at least 10 out of the 14 days during the Stable- Dose Period occurring prior to the start of the Double-Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Period and must have indicated that they were compliant with dosing on at least 10 of the 14 days, or they will be discontinued from the study. The stu dy staff will review the 
diary at each study visit and discuss it with the subject at each phone contact.

 6.8 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS) 
At the Screening Visit  for the Main Study, the Baseline/Screening Version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered by a trained  rater to subjects to  exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation 
or behavior (Appendix 4 ). The C -SSRS is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and 
behavior. The instrument reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had 
previously attempted suicide and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a 
person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011). Suicidal ideation 
will be assessed for lifetime and over the past 12 months, and suicidal behavior will be assessed for lifetime and over the past 5 years with the Base line/Screening Version of the C -SSRS.  
The Since Last Visit Version of the C -SSRS will be administered by a trained  rater to subjects at 
every clinic visit after their Main Study Screening Visit including the Follow -up V isit (Appendix 
5) for both the Main Study and the Open- Label Extension. 
6.9 Patient Health Questionnaire –9 (PHQ-9) 
The PHQ -9 is the nine item depression scale developed based on the nine diagnostic criteria for 
major depressive disorder in the DSM- IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition). 
The instrument can be administered in person, by telephone, or can  be self -administered and is 
used to facilitate diagnosis of major depression and assessment of symptom severity. It is validated and documented in a variety of populations and is available in a variety of languages (
Appendix 6 , Kroenke K et al . 2001 ). All subjects will be carefully monitored for emergent 
depression and suicidality. The subject will be evaluated and an assessment of risk will be made by a qualified mental health professional if major depression is suspected  or active suicidal 
ideation is identified . 
6.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.10.1 Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Clinical laboratory tests will include the following  as listed  in Table 3 . Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at the 
times indicated in  Appendix 1.

 6.10.4 Drug and Alcohol Screens 
For the Main Study, alcohol and urine drug screens will be performed a t screening and at the 
beginning of the Titration Period (Day 1) and at each clinic visit  through the Double-Blind 
Randomized -Withdrawal Period . For the Open-Label Extension, alcohol and urine drug screens 
will be done at Visits 18, 19, 30, and 33 (or at Early Termination).  
Drug screens will test for the following prohibited substances 
− Amphetamine 
− Barbiturates  
− Benzodiazepines 
− Cannabinoids 
− Cocaine metabolites  
− Opiates  
− Methadone 
− Phencyclidine (PCP) 
Results of the alcohol and drug screens must be determined to be negative at screening and 
before dosing for all subjects. If a subject takes prescribed amphetamines, a positive result for 
amphetamines will not exclude the subject.  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug  
Study drug will be dispensed during the Main Study by designated study staff to subjects at the 
beginning of the Titration Period (Visit 2) and at each clinic visit (except Visit 3) during the 
Titration Period and at the beginning of the Stable- Dose Phase (V isit 14) and the beginning of 
the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period (Visit 15) or at alternative intervals if 
necessary to comply with state and local laws and regulations or to resolve logistical issues  
(see Appendix 1, Schedule of Events). 
Rollover Subjects (entering the Open -Label Extension directly from the Main Study) will receive 
open- label JZP -258 at V isit 16  and Re -entry  Subjects (completed the Main Study) will receive 
open- label JZP -258 at Visit 19. All subjects will receive study medication at Visit 30  or at 
alternative intervals (e.g., Visits 23, 27, 31, and 32), if necessary to comply with state and local 
laws and regulations or to resolve logistical issues.  
 
 
Study drug doses should be prepared with the dosing dispenser (syringe) that is supplied in the 
study drug kit (dosing instructions provided by Jazz Pharmaceuticals). Instructions for dose administration of the study drug will be provided to subjects by the site personnel.

 6.12 Efficacy Assessments  
6.12.1 Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with 8 questions asking the subject how likely they 
would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations (Appendix 7) . Responses range from 
0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of dozing. Subjects will be asked to complete the ESS 
with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over the past 7 days at end  of the Stable-
Dose Period (Visit 15) and at the end of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period 
(Visit 16) or Early Termination from the Double-B lind Period . The ESS provides a measure of  a 
person’s general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. It is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity for assessing subjective sleepiness ( Johns  
1991, Johns 2000, Broderick et al. 2013).  
6.12.2 Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGIs) for Narcolepsy Overall  
The CGIs is a 7 -point Likert- type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness (Appendix 8) . The responses of this 
investigator- completed scale range from 1 = normal, no signs of illness to  7 = among the most 
extremely ill subjects. The Investigator, as a trained  rater,  will rate his/her impression of the 
severity of the subject’s narcolepsy overall at the end of the Stable- Dose Phase (Visit 15) relative 
to his/her experience with this patient population.  
6.12.3 Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) for Narcolepsy Overall  
The CGIc i s a 7-point Likert- type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess efficacy in 
clinical drug trials. At the end of the Double -Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period (Visit 16), 
Investigators as trained  raters will rate their impression of any change in the severity of the 
subject’s narcolepsy overall (Appendix 9) since the start of the Double -Blind Rand omized -
Withdrawal Period (i.e., since the last visit [Visit 15 end of the Stable -Dose Period]) on a 7 -point 
scale ranging from 1 = “very much improved” to 7 = “very much worse.” If the subject 
discontinues during the Double- Blind  Randomized -Withdrawal Peri od, the Investigator as a 
trained  rater will complete the CGIc for narcolepsy overall at Early Termination  (Visit 16).  
6.12.4 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) for Narcolepsy Overall  
The PGIc  is a 7 -point Likert- type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess efficacy in 
clinical drug trials. At the end of the Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period (Visit 16 or 
Early Termination), subjects will rate the change in their condition on a 7 -point scale ranging 
from 1 = “very much better” to 7 = “very much worse’ since the last visit (Visit 15 [end of the 
Stable -Dose Period]) ( Appendix 10) . If the subject discontinues during the Double-Blind 
Randomized -Withdrawal Period, the subject will complete the PGIc  for narcolepsy overall at 
Early Termination (Visit 16).

 6.12.5 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF- 36v2)  
The SF-36v2 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8 scale 
profile of functional health and well- being scores as well as psychometrically -based physical and 
mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index ( Hays & Stewart  
1992, Ware & Sherbourne 1992). Subjects will complete the SF -36v2 with a one- week recall 
period at the end of the Stable- Dose Period (Visit 15), the end of the Double-Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Period (Visit 16), or Early Termination from the Double-B lind Period  (Appendix 
11). 
6.12.6 European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels ( EuroQol /EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that includes 
a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and an EQ visual analogue scale ( EuroQol User Guide  
2013). It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D- 5L includes five levels 
of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system and was developed to improve the instrument’s reliability and sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects. Subjects will complete the EQ -5D-5L at the end of the Stable- Dose Period (Visit 15), the end of the Double-Blind 
Randomized -Withdrawal Period (Visit 16), or Early Termination from the Double-B lind Period 
(Appendix 12).  
6.12.7 Cataplexy  Frequency  Diary  
Subjects will complete a daily Cataplexy Frequency D iary (Appendix 13) each night prior to 
bedtime, to record the number of cataplexy attacks that they had each day beginning at Visit 2 
through the end of the Double-Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period . Subjects must  have 
completed the Cataplexy Frequency Diary on at least 10 out of the 14 days in the Stable -Dose 
Period occurring prior to the start of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period, or they 
will be discontinued from the study. 
The study staff will review the diary at each study visit and discuss it with the subject at each 
phone contact.

 6.13 Adverse Event Reporting  
6.13.1 Adverse Ev ents (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans , 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or 
frequency of conditions present at the start of the study ( defined as Visit 1 and Visit 18 [Re-entry 
Subjects]) ; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug 
interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values. 
• Symptoms of the underlying medical condition narcolepsy are not considered as AEs  
unless there is an exacerbation of the subject’s baseline symptoms at entry into the study.  
(Visit 1 and Visit 18 [subject s who re-enter the study for the Open -Label Extension] ). 
• Clinically significant adverse changes from baseline clinical status (Visit 1 and Visit 18 
[subjects who re-enter the study for the Open-Label Extension]) in ECGs, routine laboratory tests, and physical examinations are considered AEs. Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE .  
All AEs, whether observed by the Investigator, reported by the subject, determined from laboratory findings, or other means, will be documented. 
For Re-entry S ubjects (completed the Main Study), any new clinically significant condition not 
previously recorded as an AE during the Main Study and which occurred prior to obtaining 
informed consent for the Open -Label Extension, is considered medical history and sh ould be 
documented as such  (see Section 6.3 ). 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
specific symptom. The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs/symptoms, should be documented as the AE.  
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the Investigator to be related 
or unrelated to the study drug or procedure, must be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, in accordance with the Investigator ’s normal clinical practice. Each AE is to be 
evaluated for duration, severity  (Section 6.13.2) , seriousness ( Section 6.13.3) , and causal 
relationship to the study drug or procedure (see Section 6.13.4) .

 6.13.2 Severity Assessment  
Adverse events will be classified by the Investigator as mild, moderate, severe, life- threatening 
or fatal , as defined below. When the severity of the AE changes over time, the change in severity 
will be recorded on the AE eCRF as a new AE, and the original AE will stop when the new AE 
starts.  
Table 5 Adverse Event Severity Definitions  
Classification  Definition  
Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADLa 
Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting age -appropriate self -care 
ADLb  
Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention ind icated  
Death  Death related to AE  
a Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking  medications, and not bedridden  
A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event.  
Source: CTCAE, Version [4.03] . 
6.13.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee using the SAE Reporting form within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel. SAE Reporting forms and contact information will be provided to the study site. The event must also be entered on the AE e CRF in accordance with  the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria :  
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers  to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe) 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, defined as substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Clinical Trial Protocol: 15 -006 Amendment 5    
   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 62 of 130 
 • Is an important medical  event  
− Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE.  
− Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalization, the developme nt of drug dependency or drug 
abuse, and the occurrence of suicidal ideation. 
− Additionally, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product should be reported as an important medical event. 
 A hospitalization is NOT considered  an SAE if:  
• It is planned prior to subject entering trial or prior to entrance of O pen-Label Extension 
(only if subject is re-entering, i.e., completed the main study) 
• It is for social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s 
general condition 
• It is elective in nature and not related to worsening of an underlying condition 
 
Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the hospitalization, it is an SAE.   
“In-patient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons, for any length of time. Emergency room care without admission to a hospital is considered outpatient care.   
Overdose, medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug are SAEs only if any of the seriousness criteria are met.  
The SAE Reporting Form must be completed as thoroughly as possible before transmittal to the contact provided on the form. The Investigator should provide his/her assessment of the causality (relat ionship) to study drug and procedure at the time of the report. Where the Investigator does 
not provide causality assessment of the SAE at the time of the initial report, the event by default will be presumed “Related.” If the Investigator ’s assessment of causality changes, then a follow-
up SAE Reporting forms must be submitted.

 6.13.4 Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure 
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug and to study procedures is 
required. The relationship or associati on of the study drug or procedure in causing or 
contributing to the AE will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:  
Related or 
Suspected 
to be 
Related to Study 
Drug or 
Procedure  There is a reasonable possibility that the study dr ug or procedure caused the 
event—i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
drug or procedure and the AE.  
Some temporal relationship exists between the event and the administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is unlikely to be explained by the subject’s 
medical condition, other therapies, or accident.  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence:  
• The event follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study drug or procedure.  
• The event improves upon stopping the study drug or procedure or 
decreasing the dose ( positive dechallenge).  
• The event reappears upon repeated exposure, if medically appropriate  
(positive rechallenge) . 
Not 
Related to Study 
Drug or 
Procedure  There is not a reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or 
procedure caused the event. 
The event can be readily explained by other factors such  as the subject’s underlying 
medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event.  
 
6.13.5 Other Immediately Reportable Experiences  
The following immediately reportable experiences may occur during participation in this clinical 
trial and must be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to 
the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee:  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with a 3 -fold or 
greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in addition to an elevation of serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with no other identifiable etiology  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN 
As with SAEs ( Section  6.13.3) , the immediately reportable experiences noted above must  be 
reported on the SAE Reporting form, which should be completed as thoroughly as possible before transmittal to the contact provided on the form. The Investigator must provide his/her assessment of causality to study drug or procedure at the time of the initial report. These expe riences must also be entered as AEs on the AE eCRF  in accordance with the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines. See Section  6.13.8 for details related to reporting an immediately 
reportable experience of pregnancy.

 6.13.6 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting 
Timeframe  
The Investigator must document a ll AEs and SAEs that occur during both the Main Study and 
the Open-Label Extension until the Final Study Visit or Early termination , regardless of their 
relationship to study drug or procedure. For those subjects who participate in the Main Study only and for Rollover Subject (progress directly into the Open-Label Extension), all AEs and 
SAEs will be documented from the time written informed consent is obtained at Visit 1. For 
Re-entry S ubjects (complete the Main Study), all AEs and SAEs for the Open- Label Extension 
will be documented from the time written informed consent is obtained at Visit 18.  
SAEs and immediately reportable experiences must be reported within 24  hours of first 
knowledge of the event by study personnel as described in Section 6.13.3 and Section  6.13.5. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the 
event must be documented and reported as described in Section 6.13.3. 
Any SAE assessed as related to study drug or procedure by the Investigator must be reported 
regardless of time after study termination.  
6.13.7 Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the Final Study Visit occurs, whichever comes first.  
AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, or the subject is lost to follow up. The outcome at the time of the Final Study Visit should be documented. If resolved, a resolution date should be provided, and for SAEs, a follow-up SAE Report form 
should be submitted indicating the resolution date. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include 
additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.

 6.13.8 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy of a subject or a male subject’s partner is an immediately reportable experience and 
should be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee. If a subject or a male subject’s partner becomes pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug is taken until 90 days after the last dose of study drug is taken, the pregnancy form should be used to report the pregnancy to Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals or its designee. The pregnancy of a subject or a male subject’s partner should be 
followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known, and in the case of a live birth, for 6 months following the birth of the child. The infant follow-up form should be used to report information regarding the status of the infant.  
6.13.9 Emergency Unblinding  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is necessary  for immediate medical management of the subject. In the case of an immediate 
medical emergency, an Investigator or his/her designee will be able to unb lind a subject at any 
time via the IW RS. Every  attempt should be made to contact Jazz Pharmaceuticals or  its 
designee before unblinding a subject as long as this does not compromise the safety of the subject. If a request for unblinding is received from an Investigator , the Medical Monitor will 
discuss with the Investigator the rationale for the request. A c omment  must be entered in the 
source documentation to specify the reason for unblinding, along with the date on which the code was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. Subjects for whom the blind is broken will be withdrawn fro m the study. 
6.13.10 Regulatory Reporting  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the relevant regulatory authorities, concerned central ethics committees (CECs) and participating Investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the EU Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC) and/or local regulatory requirements.  
The reference safety information for the determination of expectedness for JZP-258 oral  solution 
is in the  Investigator’s Brochure.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) that are fatal or life- threatening will 
be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities, CECs , and participating Investigators no later 
than 7 days after knowledge of such a case, and relevant follow-up information provided within an additional 8 days. All other SUSARs ( i.e., non- fatal or non -life-threatening) will be reported 
to the relevant regulatory authorities, CECs, and all participating Investigators no later than 15 days after first knowledge of the event. 
Once a year throughout the study, a report listing of all SUSARs (and SAEs if required by local 
regulation) that have occurred during the period and a report of the subj ect’s safety will be 
submitted to the applicable authorities and CECs.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 66 of 130 
 The subject’s treatment assignment may be unblinded for regulatory reporting purposes. 
Notification of the treatment assignment is only made known to those who require it for safety reporting and submission processes. All other individuals involved in the study, including the 
Investigator, will remain blinded to treatment assignment. Subjects for whom the blind is broken 
for this reason will not be withdrawn from the study.  
Reporting of SAEs by the Investigator to his or her local ethics committee will be done in 
accordance with the standard operations procedures and policies of the ethics committee. 
Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the ethics committee was properly notified.  
6.14 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1 Reasons for Early Terminations  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw any subject from the study if the subject states that he/she wants to stop participating in the study. 
The Investigator , Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study at 
any time and for any reason. 
If any of the criteria below are met during the study, study drug administration must be stopped 
and the subject discontinued from the study. 
• Suicide risk reported or assessed by C -SSRS  
• 3-fold or greater elevation above the ULN of ALT or AST accompanied by an elevation 
of serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN 
• Creatinine > 176 µmol/L  
• Positive alcohol screen  
• Positive urine drug screen  
• Positive pregnancy test 
 
For all subjects who prematurely  discontinue from the Main Study, an attempt should be made to 
perform all early termination assessments (same assessments as those performed at the final study visit). Subjects should be asked to return 2 weeks later for a safety follow-up visit.  
The specific reason for the discon tinuation should be documented on the termination e CRF. If a 
subject withdraws informed consent, the specific reason for withdrawing the informed consent 
should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by the Investigator (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its 
designee). The data will be recorded on the appropriate e CRF.

 For all subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Open-Label Extension, an attempt should 
be made to perform all early termination assessments (same assessments as those performed at the final study visit). Subjects should be asked to return 2 weeks later for a safety follow-up visit. 
6.14.2 Handling of Early Terminations  
If a subject terminates early from the study, either at his or her request or at the Investigator ’s 
discretion, the Investigator will record the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant eCRF 
page and notify Jazz Pharmaceuticals  immediately. All subjects who terminate from the study 
early should undergo all final study visit assessments.  Early termination s ubjects from the Main  
Study should complete Visits 1 6 and 17. While early termination s ubjects from the Open -Label 
Extension should complete V isits 33 and 34. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, abnormal 
laboratory test, or ECG finding. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety 
follow-up procedures. 
6.14.3 Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Termination of Study  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or 
administrative reasons. 
Such a termination must be implemented by the Investigator, if instructed to do so by 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals in a time frame that  is compatible with the subject’s well -being. 
6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity for assessing subjective sleepiness in narcolepsy ( Johns 1991, Johns 2000; Broderick et al. 2013 ). Additional ly, the 
CGIc, PGIc, SF-36v2, and the EQ -5D- 5L have been used extensively in clinical trials to assess 
efficacy and quality of life. 
The use of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, standard AE reporting, and the questionnaires that 
have been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely 
used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical  studies and pertinent to known risks of 
JZP-258. The C- SSRS is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may 
be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011) and the PHQ -9 has been shown 
to facilitate monitoring and the assessment of symptom severity ( Kroenke K et al. 2010).

 • When necessary, a PSG may be performed, with the approval of the Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor, to evaluate the subject for evidence of sleep 
disordered breathing, if the subject has not been adequately evaluated prior to study 
entry. In addition, a  PSG and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) may also be performed, 
if necessary , with approval of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Medical Monitor for diagnosis 
of narcolepsy. The PSG  and MSLT will be performed according the study center’s 
standard procedures. 
• After screening procedures have been completed and eligibility criteria have been 
confirmed, provide eligible subjects with instructions on how to discontinue any excluded 
medications.  
• Schedule the Day 1 visit after the Investigator has thoroughly reviewed results of all 
screening procedures and has confirmed all eligibility criteria.  
Rescreening  
In the Main Study, subjects may be allowed to re screen  (one time) if they previously did not 
meet all eligibility requirements. Rescreening may occur following resolution of transient 
exclusionary conditions or stabilization of conditions that were exclusiona ry in the unstable state 
(e.g., unstable hypothyroidism) and is permitted only with the permission of the Medical 
Monitor. 
Subjects who are approved for rescreening must be re- consented and repeat the screening 
procedures described above in Section 7.1.1. For subjects who are being rescreened, a repeat 
PSG is not required (if previously done) providing the results of the previous PSG meet the 
current inclusion/exclusion/criteria.  
7.1.2 Open- Label Optimized Treatment and Titration Phase  
7.1.2.1 Week 1 to the end of Week 12 (for all subjects 12 weeks)  
For the purposes of describing the procedures during this phase of the study the subject’s 
cataplexy treatment status at study entry will be designated as follows:  
• Pre-randomization Group 1: Subjects treated with Xyrem alone at study entry.  
• Pre-randomization Group 2: Subjects treated with Xyrem and an additional 
anticataplectic at study entry .  
• Pre-randomization Group 3: Subjects treated with a non- Xyrem anticataplectic at study 
entry .  
• Pre-randomization Group 4: Subjects not being treated with any agent with 
anticataplectic properties at screening .

 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
Analyses may be provided either across the study or by study  period (i.e., Optimized Treatment 
and Titration, Stable -Dose, Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal, and Open- Label Extension 
Period s) as appropriate to describe the efficacy and safety  of JZP -258, and will be detailed in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) . In general, f or the Optimized Treatment and Titration , Stable -
Dose , and Open -Label Extension Period s, results will be summarized by Pre-randomization 
Group and overall, and for the Double-Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period results will be 
summarized by treatment group.  
Categorical variables will be reported as frequency and percen t. Continuous variables will 
be reported as number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD) , or standard error (SE), 
median, minimum and maximum. All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual subject data 
listings described below will be completed using Version 9.3 or later of the SAS Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).  
9.2 Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of JZP-258 compared to placebo on the chang e in weekly cataplexy attacks from the two weeks of the Stable-Dose Period to the 
two weeks of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period . The key secondary objective is 
to evaluate the efficacy of JZP -258 compared to placebo on the change in ESS score from the 
end of the Stable-Dose Period to the end of the Double- Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period . 
Subjects who are randomized to continue JZP-258 in the Double-Blind Randomized -Withdrawal 
Period will be treated as a single group regardless of the dose of JZP-258 received. Thus, there will be no multiplicity issues with respect to  multiple doses for hypotheses testing.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 85 of 130 A hierarchical group sequent ial testing strategy will be used to test the primary and key 
secondary endpoints during the  analyses as described in Section 9.14  and 
Section 9.15 , with the family -wise Type I error rate controlled at 0.05 for two- sided testing 
across both endpoints.  
9.3 Determination of Sample Size  
Up to  185 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure a minimum of 130 subjects (65 subjects 
per treatment group) enter the Double-Blind R andomized -Withdrawal Period.  This includes at 
least 50 subjects on Xyrem, and 60 subjects using Xyrem plus other anticataplectics or non -
Xyrem anticataplectics alone, as applicable.  
A sample size of 65 subjects randomized per treatment group will provide at least 90% power to 
detect a difference in the change i n mean weekly  cataplexy attacks, from the Stable -Dose Period 
to the Double-Blind Ran domized -Withdrawal Period, of 17.5 between JZP-258 and placebo. 
This assumes common SD of 30 and a two -sided significance level of  0.05 using a t- test. 
Assuming a 30% dropout rate prior to randomization, approximately 185 subjects will be 
enrolled to ensure that a minimum of 130 subjects enter the Double- Blind Randomized-
Withdrawal Period. Assumptions were conservatively based on previously completed Xyrem 
studies GHB -2, OMC- SXB-15, and OMC- SXB -21 and account for study design. From these 
3 studies, the  mean weekly reduction in cataplexy attacks of Xyrem compared to placebo 
(common SD) ranged from approximately 10 (30) to 16 (28 ). 
9.4 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Population will include all subjects who took at least one dose of study medication. Safety populations will also be defined for each study period (i.e., Optimized Treatment and 
Titration, Open -Label Stable -Dose, Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal, and Open- Label 
Extension periods) for by- period analyses . These populations will be used for safety evaluations 
and efficacy summaries.  
The Efficacy Population will include all subjects who are randomized to JZP-258 or placebo, 
who received at least 1 dose of study drug during the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal 
Period and have at least one set of post-baseline efficacy  assessments. This population will be 
used as the main analysis population for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
9.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively for the 
Safety  Population, Efficacy Population, and the Safety Population from the Open -Label  
Extension period. For the Efficacy Population, results will be provided by randomized treatment 
group.  
9.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
Subjects who  drop out of the study will not be replaced. Methods of addressing missing efficacy 
data are described in Section 9.10.

 9.10 Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed with the Efficacy Population by randomized treatment 
group.  
Efficacy assessments in general will be comparisons of the measurement(s) made during or at the 
end of the 2 weeks of the Stable -Dose Period compared with the 2 weeks or the end of the 
Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period.  
A hierarchical group sequential testing strategy, described in  Section 9.14  and Section 9.15,  will 
be used to control the family- wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 significance level for two-sided 
testing across the primary and key secondary endpoints. All other efficacy endpoints will be 
tested without multiplicity adjustments and nominal p -values provided. 
Sensitivity analyses including use of imputation methods, such as multiple imputations for 
missing data, on the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be used to assess robustness. These analyses and methods will be described in the SAP. 
9.10.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
For the primary endpoint, the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks from the 2 weeks of the Stable -Dose  Period to the 2 weeks of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal 
Period will be assessed. For subjects with at least one day of cataplexy attack data, the weekly number of cataplexy attacks will be the average number of daily attacks from days with non -
missing data within the 2 week period , and then m ultiplied  by 7.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be us ed to assess the endpoint. The SAS 
procedure PROC GLM will be u sed to carry out the analysis. The model will include treatment 
group and Pre-randomization group as fixed effect s. The weekly number of cataplexy attacks 
during the Stable- Dose Period will be included in the model as a covariate. The estimate for the 
treatment difference of JZP-258 versus placebo and the 95% CIs will be pre sented. The 
normality assumption of the ANCOVA model will be examined by residual analysis using the Shapiro- Wilk test. If the normality assumption is considered violated  at the 0.05 significance 
level , a non- parametric ANCOVA with the data replaced by their ranks will be used.  
The number of cataplexy attacks will be summarized by week.  
9.10.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the change in ESS score from the end of the Stable -Dose Period to the end of the Double- Blind Randomized -Withdrawal Period will be 
assessed. Analyses will be similar to the primary endpoint.

 9.10.3 Other Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints of PGIc and CGIc  for narcolepsy overall will be assessed at 
the end of the Double-Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period. The change in score from the end 
of the Stable-Dose Period to the end of the Double- Blind Treatment Period will be assessed for 
SF-36, and EuroQol 5. 
For the other secondary efficacy endpoints, CGIc and PGIc ratings will be analyzed as response 
frequencies using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for the row mean score difference. 
All other non -categorical parameters will be analyzed by ANCOVA or non -parametric 
ANCOVA, similar to the primary endpoint, as appropriate.  
9.11 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population. For the Double-Blind 
Randomized -Withdrawal Period, results will be summarized by the actual treatment. Analyses 
will be descriptive in nature, and no formal statistical testing will b e performed. 
9.11.1 Adverse Event Analyses  
Adverse events will be mapped to system organ classes and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The subject incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and fatal AEs will be summarized. This overall summary will also provide TEAEs by maximum severity. 
The subject incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, AEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation will also be presented by system organ class and preferred term. Preferred term summaries may also be provided. 
A TEAE is defined as an AE that either began after the first study drug dose or worsened after the first dose. In summarizing the subject incidence of AEs, multiple events with the same 
preferred term or with increases in severity will only be counted as one AE and summarized at the maximum severity. Subject incidence is similarly defined for multiple events within the same system organ class. Summaries by period will be based on AE s considered emergent within a 
period. 
Adverse events occurring after a subject has completed the Main Study and prior to the Open -
Label Extension Period will be recorded as medical history. Adverse events occurring after first 
dose of study drug in the Open -Label Extension Period will be considered treatment emergent. 
9.11.2 Other Safety Analyses  
Vital Signs  
For each vital sign parameter, summary statistics will be provided for observed and change from baseline values by scheduled visit.

 Physical Examinations 
Observed and change from baseline values for weight will be summarized descriptively by 
scheduled visit.  
12-lead ECG  
Observed and change from baseline values for ECG intervals will be summarized descriptively. 
QT abnormalities will be assessed; the number and percent of subjects with values or change 
from baseline values exceeding certain thresholds will be tabulated .  
Laboratory Evaluations  
Observed and change from baseline laboratory evaluations will be summarized descriptively.  
C-SSRS  
C-SSRS parameters will be tabulated by scheduled visit.  
PHQ-9 
Depression severity based on PHQ- 9 will be summarized  by scheduled visit . 
9.12 Exploratory Analyses  
To address the exploratory objective of characterizing the conversion to JZP -258 from 
non-Xyrem anticataplectic treatments, analyses including subjects from Pre-randomization 
Groups 2, 3, and combined will be provided. Analyses will include, but are not limited to, 
summaries of anticataplectic use, titration and duration of anticataplectics, as well as JZP -258 
titration during the Optimized Treatment and Titration Period. 
9.13 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the efficacy and key safety endpoints  (including, but not limited to , AEs 
during the Double- Blind Randomized- Withdrawal Period ) will be provided by 
Pre-randomization Group. 
Additional subgroup analyses by sex or other characteristics will be provided for efficacy and

1 All subjects will begin JZP -258 treatment at the beginning of this period and continue through Week 12. The subject must be maintained on a stable, tolerable and effective dose 
for at least 2 weeks, prior to entering the Stable -Dose Period.  
2 The Investigator may have the subject attend an unscheduled visit, at any time during the study, if deemed necessary.  
3 W hen necessary, a PSG may be performed, with the approval of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals Medical Monitor, to evaluate the subject  for evidence of sleep disordered breathing, if 
the subject has not been adequately evaluated prior to study entry. A PSG and MSLT may also be performed, if necessary, with approval of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Medical 
Monitor for diagnosis of narcolepsy. The PSG and MSLT will be performed according the study center’s standard procedures.  
4.  Electrolytes to include sodium (Na+), pot assium (K+), magnesium (Mg+2), and calcium (Ca+2). 
5. At Week 1 subjects in Pre -randomization Groups 1 and 2 will have a phone contact for assessments unless the Investigator elects to assess the subject i n the clinic. Only 
assessments labeled with this fo otnote will be conducted during the phone contact for Pre -randomization Groups 1 and 2. If these groups are seen in the clinic at Week 1 all 
assessments in the Week 1column should be completed.  
6. PGIc and CGIc questionnaires are not applicable for subjects who terminate the study early prior to the Double -Blind Treatment Period.  
7. The subject is expected to start Study Drug Dosing Diary completion on the morning after the  subject is dispensed study drug at Visit 2.

1 Rollover S ubjects  are those  who enter the Open- Label Extension at Visit 16 (rollover directly from the Main Study). Visit 16 for Rollover Subjects is the last day of the Main 
Study and Day 1  of the Open- Label Extension.  
2 Re-entry S ubjects are those who complete the Main Study, undergo screening for the Open-Label Extension at Visit 18, and re -enter the study at Visit 19  (Day 1 of the Open-
Label Extension ). 
3 All subjects will receive Open-Label JZP -258. 
4 The Investigator may have the subject attend an unscheduled visit, at any time during the study, if deemed necessary.  
5 Phone visit may be converted to a clinic visit if required due to logistical or regulatory constraints on IP management. If clinic visits needed dispensing may occur.  
6 Electrolytes to include sodium  (Na+), potassium  (K+), magnesium (Mg+2), and calcium  (Ca+2).  
7 Subjects should taper anticataplectic agents by Visit 30 and return to Main Study treatment regim en as described in the Main Study.  
8 Rollover Subjects (enter directly from Main Study ) will be started at Visit 16 at a dose no higher than the dose they received at  the end of the Stable -Dose Period. A lower 
starting dose will be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. If further titration is required, it will proceed at a rate of 1 or 1.5 g per night per week during this period, not to 
exceed a total dose of 9 g per night. The maximum dose should not be greater than 9 g/night.  
9 Re-entry Subjects (enter after completion of the Main Study) on Xyrem alone or with an additional a nticataplectic w ill be switched from their current dose of Xyrem to JZP 258 
on a gram to gram straight conversion at the start of the Open-Label Extension. If further titration is needed, titration will proceed at a rate of 1 or 1.5 g per night per week 
during this period not to exceed a total dose of 9 g per night.  
10 Re-entry Subjects (enter after completion of the Main Study) on a non-Xyrem a nticataplectic or  not currently receiving t reatment  will receive an initial dose of JZP 258 of 4.5 g 
per night at the start of the Open- Label Extension. Dose adjustments will proceed at a rate of 1 or 1.5 g per night per week until a tolerable dose of JZP -258 is reached. If 
neede d, the dose of JZP -258 may be further titrated to a stable, tolerable, and effective dose that does not exceed a total dose of 9 g per night.

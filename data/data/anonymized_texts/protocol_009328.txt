Glossary  
 
Apnea: the cessation of airflow at the nostrils and mouth for at least 10 seconds.  
Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI):  the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of 
sleep.   
Auto Adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Device:  A type of CPAP 
machine that monitors changes in breathing and compensates automatically by making 
appropriate therapeutic adjustments in pressure delivery.  
Average Volume Assured Pressure Support (AVAPS):  Positive airway pressure 
support that provides a gradual pressure ch ange based on the average of the preceding 
several breaths.  
Bi-Level PAP Therapy: Responds to both inspiration and expiration by the patient and 
delivers a set amount of pressure when the patient begins spontaneous inhalation and 
decreasing pressure when e xhalation begins.  
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  
CPAP Pressure:  pressure needed to maintain an open airway in a sleep apnea patient 
treated with CPAP, expressed in centimeters of water (cm H20). The positive pressure 
can range from 4 - 25 cm H 20. Different patients require different pressures. The value 
is determined in a CPAP titration study.  
CPAP Therapy: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure – delivers a constant pressure 
during inspiration and expiration.  
Hypersomnolence: Excessive daytime s leepiness.  
ODI:  4% Oxygen Desaturation Index  
EFL: Expiratory Flow Limitation  - occurs when the airways become compressed which 
usually results when a pressure outside the airway exceeds the pressure inside the 
airway  
EPAP:  Expiratory Positive Airway Pressu re-Physician prescribed pressure for the 
expiratory (breathing out) phase of an individual on Bi -level PAP therapy  
FEV 1: Forced Expiratory Volume in one second – the volume of air exhaled in the first 
second of the FVC maneuver and is the most reproducibl e measurement of airway 
obstruction.

 FOT: Forced Oscillation Technique – A method to detect the presence of expiratory flow 
limitation.  
FVC: Forced Vital Capacity – Spirometry measurement in which the patient inhales 
maximally and then exhales as rapidly a nd completely as possible.  
IPAP:  Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure - Physician prescribed pressure for the 
inspiratory (breathing in) phase of an individual on Bi -level PAP therapy.  
Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV):  mechanical ventilati on provided 
noninvasively (by mask or similar interface) rather than through an endotracheal tube or 
tracheostomy.  
Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) : Pressure in the lungs (alveolar pressure) 
above atmospheric pressure (the pressure outside of the bo dy) that exists at the end of 
expiration.  
OSA: Obstructive Sleep Apnea  - a disorder in which complete or partial obstruction of 
the airway during sleep causes loud snoring, oxyhemoglobin desaturations and frequent 
arousals.  
S Mode: Spontaneous Ventilation – provides ventilation in synchrony with a person’s 
spontaneous breathing efforts; triggering of a breath cycle is only by the patient.  
S/T Mode: Spontaneous Timed Ventilation – provides ventilation in synchrony with a 
person’s spontaneous breathing effort s; triggering of a breath cycle is by the patient or 
the ventilator, should the person fail to trigger the ventilator after a preset time. In 
Spontaneous/Timed mode a "backup" rate is set to ensure that the patient still receives 
a minimum number of breath s per minute if they fail to breathe spontaneously.  
Zrs – total impedance of the respiratory system as measured by the forced oscillation 
technique (FOT) at a forcing frequency of 5 Hz.  
Xrs – the reactance (i.e. the imaginary component of the impedance) of  the respiratory 
system as measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) at a forcing frequency of 
5 Hz.  
ΔXrs – is the difference between the mean value of X rs during expiration (
expX ) and the 
mean value of X rs during inspiration (
inspX ). A breath is classified as flow -limited if its 
ΔXrs is greater than 2.8

 Background Information  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide.   
Treatment options for COPD patients consist of medications, such as bronchodilators 
and anti -inflammatory drugs, pulmon ary rehabilitation, long term oxygen therapy 
(LTOT), lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation.  Studies have shown 
that bronchodilators and anti -inflammatory drugs show minor or no benefit on long term 
outcomes but rather are used mainly for symptomatic relief.1  Pulmonary rehabilitation 
has been demonstrated to improve functional status and symptoms but there is lacking 
evidence on long term outcomes of this therapy. 2   Lung volume reduction surgery and 
lung transplantation is only appropria te for a small number of patients; therefore, there 
is no demonstration of improved long -term survival rate.3, 4 
Of these available therapies, few have been shown to significantly improve long term 
patient outcomes.  For the severe COPD patient, LTOT is th e only treatment that 
demonstrated prolonged survival in controlled studies. 5, 6   But, despite the effectiveness 
of LTOT, COPD is still characterized by a high morbidity and mortality rate.   
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is one therap y that may prove 
beneficial to stable COPD patients.  NPPV is the use of positive pressure ventilation 
administered via a nasal or full face mask (that covers both the nose and mouth).  This 
type of ventilation has become a well-established  and increasingl y used therapeutic 
option for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) due to COPD.7  
NPPV, used nocturnally, may improve nighttime hypoventilation that is common with 
COPD patients.  An improvement in nocturnal hypoventilation would reset the 
respiratory center sensitivity for CO 2.8 9 This would result in an improvement in daytime 
gas exchange and sleep quality.  It is also known that hyperinflation in patients with 
COPD increases their work of breathing, thus fatiguing the respiratory muscles.10 It has 
been suggested that by applying nocturnal NPPV it would allow the respiratory muscles 
to rest, resulting in muscle function recovery, increased  respiratory  muscle strength, 
reduced the tendency for fatigue and improvement in pulmonary function and  gas 
exchange.11   
COPD is a disease that results in varying degrees of dyspnea, or shortness of breath.  
Spirometry is a method of diagnosing COPD with the presence of a post bronchodilator 
FEV1 <80% of the predicted value in combination with an FEV1 / FV C <70%.  This 
would confirm that there is a presence of airflow limitatio n that is not fully reversible.  
The presence of airflow limitation has been identified as one of the main causes of 
dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 1).  Expiratory Flow 
Limitation (EFL) occurs when the airways become compressed which usually results

 when the pressure outside the airway exceeds the pressure inside the airway.  As 
airflow obstruction worsens, EFL appears at much lower flows for a given lun g volume 
and it becomes present at rest or at least develops early during exercise ( 2). 
Early detection of EFL consisted of either invasive  esophageal  balloon or relatively 
complex plethysmographic techniques.  An alternative approach, and one that will be  
used in this study, involves the Force d Oscillation Technique (FOT).  
In 2003 Dellacà et al. proposed a new method to detect EFL during quiet breathing non -
invasively using the FOT. It was based on the observation COPD patients with EFL 
developed large ne gative swings in the respiratory system input reactance measured at 
5Hz during expiration. They used this observation to define a sensitive and specific 
method of determining the presence of EFL. Normally the reactance reflects the elastic 
and inertial pro perties of the respiratory system but when flow limitation is present, the 
oscillatory signal cannot pass through the choke points and reach the alveoli. This 
produces a marked reduction in the apparent compliance and , consequently, a fall in 
Xrs.  
Althoug h this X rs reduction is present at all the frequencies, the greatest difference is 
seen at the lowest frequency. Since the quiet breathing signal can interfere with the 
estimation of Zrs at frequencies below 5 Hz, this frequency was used for the forcing 
signal. The difference between the mean value of X rs during inspiration (
inspX ) and 
expX
 , is called
rsX . A breath is classified as flow -limited if its X exp,min  is greater than 
2.8

2 LsO cmH  . 
This technology has been evaluated in numerous clinical studies for both the detection, 
reduction and abolishment of expiratory flow limitation in patients with COPD.  In 1956, 
Dubios et all, demonstrated that the FOT method to be applicable to the measurement 
of airway resistance in patients, evaluation of therapeutic procedures designed to 
relieve airway obstruction, separation of airway resistance from tissue resistance, and 
study of the multiple factors that may affect airway resistance.1 And in  additional work 
2006, Dellaca et all, suggested the forced oscillation technique may be useful in chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease patients using nasal  pressure support by identifying 
continuous positive airway pressure levels that support breathing without increasing 
lung volume, as turn increase the work of breathing and reduce muscle effectiveness 
and efficiency.

 The Vector project has incorporated this method as a new feature into the Philips 
Respironics BiPAP Ventilator overall platform (K121623) . The device has been 
designed to produce a 5 Hz sine wave with peak to peak amplitude of approximately 2 
cmH 2O superimposed upon the pressure and flow generated by the device. The 
resultant feedback waveform is then filtered and analyzed to measure reacta nce 
(deltaX)  and thus determine if EFL is present . Subsequently the EPAP (and 
concurrently and proportionally the IPAP) is increased until the EFL is essentially 
abolished (falls below the predetermined EFL threshold). Since this reactance is 
analyzed cont inuously (breath by breath) during both inspiration and expiration, it is 
relatively immune to external factors such as modest leaks o r coughing / swallowing . 
Description of the Intervention Studied  
The Vector ventilator is intended to provide non -invasiv e ventilatory support to treat 
adult patients with Respiratory Insufficiency with  the primary cause being COPD .  It is 
intended to be used within the home, institutional/hospital, and diagnostic laboratory 
environments. This device is not intended for life  support. It can be used to screen for 
the presence, and abolishment of Expiratory Flow Limitation.  
The Vector ventilation method auto -titrates PEEP or EPAP on a breath by breath basis.   
Vector is a new noninvasive method to continuously detect EFL durin g spontaneous 
breathing  and minimizing it using EPAP.  
The device has been designed to produce a 5 Hz sine wave with peak to peak 
amplitude of approximately 2 cmH2O superimposed upon the pressure and flow 
generated by the device. The resultant feedback wave form is then filtered and analyzed 
to detect the change of a reactance ( ΔXrs ). Subsequently the EPAP (and concurrently 
and proportionally the IPAP) is increased until the EFL is essentially abolished (falls 
below the predetermined EFL threshold). Since thi s reactance is analyzed continuously 
(breath by breath) during both inspiration and expiration, it is relatively immune to 
external factors such as modest leaks or coughing /swallowing. Given that forced 
oscillation technique can be easily applied during no ninvasive nasal ventilatory support, 
it could be used during routine noninvasive ventilation.  
This Vector screening mode is an automated five -minute screening test can be done in 
a clinical environment under supervision  to determine if EFL is present.  
The screening test will have built in logic that determines the test’s validity during the 
screening, as well as, the conclusion of the test.  The screening test will be at a 
relatively fixed pressure (typically between 3-4 cmH2O) that will remain constant 
throughout the session.  The screening session results, which will consist of near real -
time pulmonary mechanic information will be kept on a display until the next session is 
enabled.

 Study Design Rationale  
The clinical study is designed primar ily as an engi neering evaluation to verify the 
software functionality and performance of both the screening and therapy modes of the 
Vector device. This study is nec essary in order to confirm the device is functioning as 
designed prior to use in larger clinical trials t o support product launch.  
Study Objectives and Purpose  
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to collect engineering pre-therapy screening and 
therapy data on the Vector NIV device via an overnight study on COPD patients that 
have been identified as having EFL.  
 
Study Hypothesis : 
1. Therapy provided by the Vector device will minimize COPD patients ’ EFL throughout 
the course of an overnight sleep study  
2. Clinical study staff can operate the Vector device to successfully screen patients f or 
EFL and then set up the Vector device to determine the Optimized EPAP required for 
abolishment of EFL  
Study Endpoints:  
 Ventilator -collected parameters during the therapy  night such as: Mean EPAP, 
Respiratory Rate, Minute Ventilation, and ΔXrs values . 
 Ventilator -collected parameters during the EFL screening; ΔXrs value, % flow 
limited breaths, mask leak values.  
 SpO2. 
 Patient Therapy comfort assessment via Questionnaire s 
 
Study Design:  
This study is a nonrandomized, unblinded overnight engin eering clinical evaluation of 
the Vector NIV device in COPD patients with EFL . Up to 50 individuals may be enrolled 
in order to have a total of up to 30 completed participants. Male and female participants 
who qualify per the inclusion/exclusion criteria m ay be enrolled.  
Potential participants will be identified and recruited from the site database of COPD 
patients.   Potential participants may also be identified by a local marketing company.  
These participants will complete online or phone screenings prior  to being seen at the 
clinical site.

Protocol # SRC -HRC -Vector ENG -2018 -10241  
     
 Schedule of Events:  
Participants will be contacted by designated study staff from the site database of COPD 
patients. Participants may be pre -screened over the phone to determine eligibility.  
Participants that are inte rested will be scheduled for the screening visit  at the clinical 
office.  
Potential participants may be also be found by a local marketing company. This 
marketing company will utilize their local database to find potential participants in the 
Pittsburgh, PA  area.  These participants will undergo a brief online and/or over the 
phone screening by the marketing company.  If they are found to be potentially eligible, 
Philips Respironics study staff will reach out to the participants.  A more thorough phone 
scree n will be conducted by the Philips Respironics study staff.  If the person is still 
found to be potentially eligible for the study and is interested they will either be 
scheduled by the Philips Respironics staff to come into the Pittsburgh Pulmonary 
Physic ian Practice site or will be contacted by the staff of Consolidated Clinical Trials for 
appointment scheduling .  A waiver of informed consent for screening will be submitted 
to the IRB for contacting these participants.  
Study Visit 1 (screening)   
Once th e participant arrives , the study will be explained in full detail.  If the participant 
agrees, he/she will be consented into the study and the participant will be given a copy 
of the informed consent.  
Once consent is obtained and eligibility is confirmed , the following study related 
procedures will be conducted:  
• Demographics:  gender, age, ethnicity, height and weight will be collected.  
• Current Medications:  all current medications will be collected.  
• Medical History Assessment: information will be co llected regarding historical 
spirometry data, COPD history and other relevant medical history including the 
diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing.  
• Physical examination with vital signs to include HR, BP, RR, S pO2 maintained at 
least 88%, and chest ausc ultation.  
• Administration of CAT and EFL Indication questionnaire s 
• Mask Fitting:  Participants will have a mask fitting in order to determine the best 
possible provided mask while using the Vector NIV device  during the screening for EFL.

device will be set up in fixed pressure mode (Appendix  A) for EFL.  
• EFL Determination: The participant will be asked to breath e quietly into th e 
Vector device using the selected mask for 5 minutes in the seated position, and then an 
additional 5 minutes w hile in supine or semi -recumbent position.  This device has the 
capability of detecting EFL.   If it is determined that the participant does not have EFL 
after 5 minutes by the device screening indicator, the participant will not continue in the 
study.  
• EPAP Titration: if it is determined by the Vector NIV device that the participant 
has EFL, the Vector NIV device will be changed from screening m ode to therapy mode 
to delivery BiPAP therapy.  The participant may be changed to a new mask at this time. 
The participants will then breathe on the Vector NIV device in the supine position for 
approximately an additional 20 minutes. During the additional 20 minutes of breathing, 
the device will automatically increase the EPAP (and concurrently and proportionally the 
IPAP) until the EFL is abolished ( or falls below the predetermined EFL threshold).  
• While the automatic EPAP Titration is being performed , all participants’ SpO 2 will 
be monitored via finger pulse oximetry. If the SpO 2 persistently falls below 88% during 
the titration, the participant will not be scheduled for study visit 2.  
• Patient must stay awake during the EPAP Titration. If the patient,  falls asleep, 
they will be woken by study staff.  
• The Final EPAP that is determined to abolish the participants EFL will be 
recorded. If the determined EPAP pressure is 6cmH2O or higher, the participant may 
continue to study visit 2. If the determined EP AP is below 6cmH2O , then the participant 
will not be scheduled for study visit 2.  
 EFL Screening Post Visit 1 Questionnaire  
Participants that are determined to have EFL and a titrated EPAP >6cm  H2O will be 
scheduled for study visit 2 where they will underg o an overnight sleep study with the 
Vector NIV device in a Sleep Laboratory.  
 
Study Visit 2 (Overnight Sleep Study) (within 28 days of visit 1  +/- 7 days ) 
Participants will be asked to report to the sleep lab for an overnight sleep study. 
Participants wil l be asked to come to the sleep lab at a scheduled date and time in order 
to have the trained sleep technician along with a Philips Respironics engineer prepare 
them for the sleep study and re -acclimate them to the NIV device.   The sleep testing 
will begi n near the subject’s usual bedtime and ends at you normal wake -up time.

 For the sleep study, participants will be set -up with a standard PSG montage that will 
include the following sensors:  
 Two RIP belts secured around the chest and abdomen to measure move ments 
associated with breathing effort  
 A small sensor which attaches to the chest belt to measure body position  
 Lead II ECG electrode derivation  
 EEG electrodes attached to the scalp and face to measure sleep stages 
(including at least C4, C3, A1, A2, O1, O 2, GND EEG, Left Outer Canthus (LOC) 
and Right Outer Canthus (ROC) EOG and submental EMG)  
 A flexible finger sensor placed on the finger to measure oxygen saturation 
(average signaling time of 3 seconds)  
 A microphone attached to the skin at the base of the neck to measure snoring 
sounds  
 Surface electrodes attached to the skin bilaterally over the anterior tibialis 
muscle, to measure leg movements  
 
Prior to the sleep study with the NIV device , the trained technologists will verify mask 
size, fit, and adjustme nt that was determined at study visit 1. Patients will be asked to 
bring their previously fitted mask from the study visit 1.  Once the sleep testing has 
started, technologists will have a 2 hour window from sleep onset to make any 
additional mask changes o r adjustments.   
During the Sleep study, the Vector NIV device will be connected to a laptop computer 
where all Ventilator related parameters collected by the device can be viewed and 
monitored by the sleep technician and the Philips Respironics engineer. These outputs 
include the device IPAP and EPAP pressures, EFL value, patient flow, mask leak, 
minute ventilation, and respiratory rate.  A flexible finger sensor will be placed on the 
finger in order to measure and monitor oxygen saturation  
During the slee p study, the Vector NIV device with the optimized EPAP will be tested in 
periods with both fixed pressure support as well Average Volume Assured Pressure 
Support during the night. In the event that the study participant presents with any 
obstructive or res piratory related events during the sleep study during the Vector 
therapy, the trained sleep technician will be able to make manual adjustments to the 
device pressure settings in order to address the issue (Appendix  A). 
In the event that manual titration wa s unsuccessful, the trained sleep technologist will 
refer to standard of care procedures including, but not limited to, switching to a backup 
device that the sleep lab has available.  
Comfort Assessments:  At the end of the sleep study (within two  business  days)  all 
participants will be asked to complete a comfort questionnaire  via phone.  This call will

Risk and Benefit Analysis  
 
Potential Risks and Discomforts  
 
This is a minimal risk study .  Potential risks are detailed below and will be listed in the 
ICF and discussed during the consenting process.  
 
The risks of providing noninvasive ventilation with the Vector NIV device are no greater 
than the risks encountered with other assisted positive airway pressure (PAP) devices. 
There are  no significant risks will be posed to the participants participating in this 
protocol, as the device is a non -significant risk  device and the study is non -invasive and 
will be conducted in a sleep lab and monitored by a trained clinical staff as well as 
Philips Respironics engineer. The equipment has been tested to ensure safety. Should 
the equipment not perform as designed, ther apy could increase and / or decrease more 
than desired. This affect could be uncomfortable or awaken the participant.

A trained clinician will be present monitoring the participant while the device is in use 
the sleep lab. The clinician will intervene sh ould any problems be identified. One 
possible intervention could be for the clinician to stop the study in the event that 
participant’s oxygen saturation ( SpO 2) falls below 88%. The participant can also easily 
remove their interface device should it become  uncomfortable or make breathing 
difficult. Other potential side effects of PAP therapy may include: ear discomfort, 
conjunctivitis, skin abrasions due to non -invasive interfaces and gastric distension 
(aerophagia), all of which are quite uncommon. Thus, w e believe that the ri sks and 
discomfort are minimal.  All masks used for this study are commercially available 
products.  
Oxygen saturations ( SpO 2) will be monitored throughout the duration of the nocturnal 
study.  
The patient may sleep poorly during the no cturnal sleep study and thus may be sleepy 
the next day. If the patient is too sleepy to drive home, other forms of transportation will 
be utilized.  
Should any problems be identified during the 2 week home use period, participants can 
easily remove their m ask interface during the night and discontinue use of the Study 
Vector NIV device. Those study p articipants who are on existing  PAP or NIV therapy  will 
be instructed to resume use with their current device .  
 
Potential Benefits  
Although participation in th is trial will not result in any direct benefit to the subject, they 
will be contributing to generalizable data that will help improve device design and 
function . 
Compensation for Research -Related Activities

MANUAL TITRATION PROTOCOL  
 
Vector Device Settings Fixed Pressure:  
 Press ure Support               6 cmH 2O  
 Max Pressure     26 cmH 2O 
 EPAP Min / EPAP Max    4 / 20 cmH 2O  
     
Vector Device Setting – AVAPS  
 Target Tidal Volume    8 ml/kg of ideal body weight  
 Pressure Support Min / Max   4 / 15 cmH 2O  
 Max Pressure     35 cmH 2O 
 EPAP Min / EPAP Max    4 / 20 cmH 2O  
  
 During the both the Fixed Pressure Support and AVAPS portion of the sleep 
study, if the participant has persistent obstructive events with SpO2  nadir less 
than 8 8% during events that is not fixed by the device over a 3 0 minute period of 
time, then the sleep technician may increase EPAP min at increments of 1 -2 cm 
H2O every 5 minutes to try and correct the obstructive events.  If the participant 
persists to have respiratory events with the SpO2  nadir less than 8 8% despit e the 
Vector algorithm -based EPAP changes and the manual increments to EPAP min, 
then the participant may be withdrawn from the study.  
 Once the auto algorithm has settled (~2 hours after sleep initiated), if SpO2  
remains low, tidal volume adjustments can b e made (up to 10ml/kg IBW) based 
on the sleep lab technician’s discretion.

Page 4 of 21 12/19/2017  1.0 Project Summary/Abstract  
Learned associations between a drug and the people, places and paraphernalia (cues) linked 
with drug experiences are considered critically important in the development of addiction by 
some of the leading researchers in the addiction field. These associatio ns, formed through the 
process of drug conditioning, are robust and long -lasting, inducing drug craving and relapse 
long after the user has become drug -free. However, few studies have examined the conditioning 
process in humans and little is known about ho w the associations are formed and their influence 
upon behavior and drug use. The goal of the proposed research is to provide an understanding 
of how conditioned associations between meth amphetamine, a prototypical stimulant drug, and 
distinct contexts are  formed and how the associations influence behavior, mood and responses 
to the drug using a de novo conditioning model in recreational drug users . This novel model, 
developed by the PI, is particularly well -suited for studying conditioned drug associations  
because exposure to drugs and drug -paired contexts can be carefully controlled allowing a 
comprehensive analysis of the data. Our working hypothesis is that meth amphetamine -paired 
environments will induce approach behavior and also alter acute subjective responses to d -
meth amphetamine. The rationale for the project is that vital knowledge regarding conditioned 
behavioral responses (e.g., impaired  behavioral control) in conditioned drug contexts and may 
lead to novel strategies to counteract their influence  on drug consumption. Moreover, a better 
understanding of how conditioned contexts influence behavior may inform current cue exposure 
therapy techniques which often do not translate to multidimensional drug associated  contexts. 
The hypothesis, based upon s trong pilot data collected by the PI, will be tested by three  specific 
aims:  
  
1) To determine the influence of meth amphetamine place conditioning upon time spent in 
the drug -paired context  
2) To determine the relationship between individual differences in meth amphetamine place 
conditioning and (i) acute responses to the drug, (ii) demographic characteristics  
3) To determine context -dependent responses to meth amphetamine challenge following 
place conditioning with meth amphetamine.  
 
The proposed research is innovati ve because it applies well -established pre -clinical 
methodology to the study of drug conditioning processes in humans. The project is significant  
because it will provide the first evidence of direct links between psychostimulant conditioning 
and drug takin g, and insight to the underlying behavioral mechanisms.

Page 5 of 21 12/19/2017  2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  
Learned  associations between a drug and the people, places and paraphernalia (cues) linked 
with drug experiences are considered critically important in the development of addiction by 
some of the leading researchers in the addiction field [1-5]. These associations, formed through 
the process of drug conditioning, are robust and long -lasting, inducing drug cr aving and relapse 
long after the user has become drug -free [6, 7] . However, few studies have examined the 
conditioning process in h umans and little is known about how the associations are formed and 
their influence upon behavior and drug use. Thus, there are few strategies to specifically 
address these pathological associations in the treatment of drug addiction. One behavioral 
approa ch aimed at dampening responses to conditioned drug cues is exposure therapy. This 
method consists of repeated presentations of the cue in the absence of the drug, which results 
in a gradual reduction of conditioned responses through Pavlovian extinction l earning [8]. This 
approach has been shown to work well in animal models howeve r its efficacy has been rather 
less convincing in the human clinic [9]. Therefore, responses to conditioned cues remain a 
significant barrier to the effective treatment of drug addiction. An understanding of how 
condi tioned associations between drugs and contexts are formed and their influence on 
behavior will help us to design novel approaches to counteract their powerful influences.  
 
Recently, we have developed a model to establish conditioned associations between drugs  and 
environments in human volunteers [10, 11] . In our first studies,  repeated pairings between d-
meth amphetamine and a distinct environment induced a subjective preference for the 
meth amphetamine -associated environment over one associated with placebo.  We also reported 
that administration of meth amphetamine in a consistent produced sensitization to the drug’s 
psychostimulant and incentive motivational effects. In more recent pilot studies with alcohol,  we 
have developed a behavioral measure of condition ing; individuals spen d significantly more time 
in an alcohol -paired environment than one paired with control drinks during a test of preference. 
We also found that individuals report ed less negative subjective effects after a challenge alcohol 
drink  in the  alcohol -paired environment than in the one paired with control drinks. Finally, and 
most notably, individuals consume d more alcohol in the alcohol -paired environment than the 
one paired with control drinks. These findings demonstrate for the first time th at previously 
neutral stimuli (contexts) paired with drugs  can directly influence  drug effects  and drug 
consumption . Now we aim to build upon these promising pilot  data and extend our findings with 
meth amphetamine. We will determine the influence of meth amphetamine place conditioning 
upon drug seeking (approach to and time spent in the drug -paired place), mood and acute 
responses to meth amphetamine. We will also determine how individual differences in d-
meth amphetamine place conditioning are related to acute responses to the drug and 
demographic characteristics.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  
 
The goal of the proposed research is to provide an understanding of how conditioned 
associations between  meth amphetamine , a prototypical stimulant drug,  and distinct context s are 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 6 of 21 12/19/2017  formed and how the associations influence behavior, mood and responses to the drug in 
recreational drug users.  
 
Aim 1a:  To determine the influence of meth amphetamine place conditioning upon time 
spent in the drug -paired context. We hypothesize that i ndividuals will spend significantly more 
time in a context paired with meth amphetamine at test than at the start of the experiment.  
 
Aim 1b:  To determine the relationship between individual di fferences in 
meth amphetamine  place conditioning and (i) acute responses to the drug, (ii) 
demographic characteristics.  We hypothesize that individuals who exhibit greater sensitivity 
to the acute positive subjective effects of meth amphetamine will exhibit the largest increases in 
time spent in the drug -paired context at test.  
 
Aim 2:  To determine context -dependent responses to meth amphetamine challenge 
following place conditioning with meth amphetamine. We hypothesize that (i) 
meth amphetamine will produce greater subjective stimulation  among subjects tested in the 
drug-paired room than those tested in the placebo -paired room.   
 
 
4.0 Eligibility  
 
Healthy men and women (N= 150 total ) will be recruited provided they meet the screening 
criteria; age 18 -40, body mass index 19 -26kgm -2 (previou s studies in this laboratory indicate 
that responses to 20mg meth amphetamine do not vary  within this range ), at least a high school 
education, fluency in English and a normal ECG. Exclusionary criteria are; history of a Major 
Axis I disorder [12], serio us medical condition, history of cardiac disease, high blood pressure, 
history of drug or alcohol dependence (determined in the diagnostic interview), >4 alcoholic or 
caffeinated beverages a day, or night shift  work. Subjects must report some prior recreat ional 
use of illicit drugs (incl. amphetamines ) for both safety reasons (participants who report previous 
adverse reactions can be excluded) and data validity reasons (subjects should be able to 
accurately describe drug subjective effects) . Subjects will b e randomly assigned to 4 groups; 
Paired groups 1 -3 (N= 40 each) and an Unpaired group (N= 30). The groups will be matched for 
prior stimulant use and sex.  
 
Eligibility is determined during a screening process that is approved under IRB protocol 2014 -
1060.  The criteria for the different studies that are conducted in our laboratory vary only slightly 
from study to study, and often subjects are screened for one study, yet qualify for another. 
Therefore, we find it is more cost -effective and time -efficient to con duct a general laboratory 
screening procedure after which subjects may be enrolled into one of a number of studies. The 
screening procedure is described in detail below.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Age 18 -40 
 Body mass index 19 -26kgm -2

complete the study questionnaires.  
 
 
5.0 Subject Enrollment  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 8 of 21 12/19/2017   
Recruitment and screening procedures are conducted under protocol #2014 -1060. Subjects are 
recruited using approved flyers posted in the local community and on -line (e.g., Craigslist) or 
newspaper advertisements. These flyers and adverts detail a range of ages and eligibility 
criteria for the studies being conducted in our lab  
 
Subjects respond to adverts to indicat e their interest in  participating in  the studies and then 
complet e a brief online survey or telephone interview with the research staff  to deter mine initial 
eligibility. I f they meet the initial eligibility  criteria (age, lack of medications, previous drug use 
history) , they are then invited to the laboratory for an in -person screening interview. . 
 
At the screening visit, potential subjects underg o a structured clinical psychiatric interview with 
trained research staff (to exclude persons with psychiatric disorders including substance 
dependence, APA 2013). Information is also obtained on current and recent history of medical 
problems (to exclude i ndividuals with contraindicated conditions such as cardiac disease) and 
current and recent drug use history (to exclude individuals with substance dependence). They 
also complete standardized questionnaires including a psychiatric symptom checklist (35), t he 
Beck Depression Inventory (36) and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (37). Past month 
drinking is assessed using the standardized Timeline Follow -back (38) interview. An EKG is 
also obtained by the trained research staff , which is reviewed by the s tudy physician, Dr. 
Nathan, for abnormalities.  
 
Once the screening procedures are complete  the researcher reviews the information to provide 
a preliminary determination of eligibility based on study criteria. Eligible subjects are told that the 
final deter mination for eligibility lies with the study physician.  The study design and procedures 
are then described in detail to eligible participants  to determine their interest in participating . 
They are also informed that the study will not directly benefit them . If they decide to participate 
in the study, an orientation visit is scheduled  (see below) .  
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
The study will be conducted at the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory at the 
Psychiatric Institute at UIC. Study sessions will  be conducted using two testing rooms, which 
are similar in size and furnished as comfortable living areas; each has a window, a couch, an 
easy chair, a side table, a coffee table and bookcase with reading material, a television and 
video player, a desk wi th a computer, and pictures on the walls. The rooms are distinct in terms 
of the color of the couches, cushions, accent furnishings, pictures on the walls and scents. 
Cameras mounted in the upper corner of each room record subjects’ movements during the 
room choice tests. When subjects are not completing study procedures they may relax, read or 
watch television.  
 
The study involves seven separate visits to the laboratory. The first visit is an orientation 
session at which subjects are enrolled into the stud y. Visits 2 -5 are drug administration 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 9 of 21 12/19/2017  sessions. Visit 6 is a testing session that will also involve drug administration. Visit 7 is a 
debriefing session.  
 
Visit 1 - Orientation Session:  Subjects will read and sign the study consent form which states 
that t he study aims to investigate interactions between drug effects and the environment. The 
consent form lists classes of drugs i.e., stimulant, sedative, alcohol, or placebo, they might 
receive and possible side effects. Subjects are not informed about the dr ug that they will receive 
ahead of the study to avoid effects of expectancy upon the study measures (see Appendix J). 
Subjects are fully debriefed about the drugs received at the end of the study at the debriefing 
session. Other drugs are listed to prevent  expectancy effects. Subjects are informed that they 
should not schedule any activities for periods immediately following the experimental sessions 
because they may receive an active study drug that may influence their ability to perform these 
activities. On the consent form, subjects are informed that they must  not drive following study 
sessions (compensation for public travel will be provided if necessary), or use any recreational 
drugs except for their normal amounts of caffeine for 24h before and 6h fol lowing each session, 
and not to operate any machinery requiring concentration for 6h following the sessions  because 
this may be hazardous to their safety . By signing the consent form, subjects indicate that they 
will comply with these conditions.  Subjects may consume their usual amounts of caffeine before 
sessions to prevent the possibility of caffeine withdrawal. We do not expect that small doses of 
caffeine will interact with meth amphetamine or affect the outcome measures.  Subjects also 
complete a behavio ral Room Preference test (see ‘Dependent Measures’ section) to assess 
baseline room preference.  They will also practice the tasks and questionnaires to be 
administered during later sessions so that they are familiar with the study procedures. Some 
tasks ma y have additional small monetary rewards for good performance  (up to $10) that  is paid 
in cash at the end of the orientation session  (see Behavioral Tasks, page) . Subjects  will provide 
a saliva sample for genotyping (Oragene, DNA Genotek)  and a blood sample (50mL) for 
analysis of biological correlates (see details on page 12 regarding saliva and blood specimens).  
Blood draws will be performed at the Human Addiction Psychopharmacology Laboratory by a 
trained professional.   
Visits 2 -5 – Drug  administration Se ssions:  These sessions begin at 9am and are conducted 
at least 2 but not more than 7 days apart. Women, who are not using hormonal birth control, will 
be randomly assigned to participate in the follicular (days 1 -10) or luteal (days 5 -25) phase of 
their menstrual cycle. Women  assigned to the follicular phase, will call the Research  Assistant 
on day 1 of their cycle to schedule their sessions. Women assigned to the luteal phase will be 
given ovulation test kits (urine dip sticks) to test their urine on days 10 -15 of their cycle. When 
they receive a positive test (which indicates that ovulation is about to occur), they will call the 
researchers to schedule their sessions. On arrival, subjects will provide breath and urine 
samples to detect re cent alcohol and drug use, and pregnancy in women. The session will be 
cancelled if any of the tests are positive.  Subjects will be escorted to the testing room for that 
session depending on the treatment (drug or placebo) that they are to receive. To main tain the 
double -blind conditions, the PI (Dr Childs) will determine the drug and placebo session order 
(counterbalanced between individuals) and assign the drug and placebo rooms for subjects in 
the Paired Group based on their pre -existing preferences. Pai red Group subjects will receive 
meth amphetamine and placebo on alternating sessions i.e., A, P, A, P etc. or P, A, P, A etc.

Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 10 of 21 12/19/2017  Subjects will relax in the room for 15 min before baseline measures are collected. At 9:30am, 
they will consume a capsule that cont ains 20mg meth amphetamine or placebo. They will 
complete standardized subjective effects questionnaires (to measure drug effects) and vital 
signs will be collected every 30 min after capsule administration until 11:30am  (to allow peak 
drug effects to be ex perienced , approx. 60 min after administration of capsules ). At the end, 
subjects rate their overall experiences.  See safety guidelines (page 16)  regarding release of 
subjects after drug administration.  
 
Visit 6 - Testing Session : This session will  begin at 9am and is conducted at least 2 but not 
more than 7 days after the last drug administration session . On arrival, subjects will provide 
breath and urine samples to detect recent alcohol and drug use, and pregnancy in women. The 
session will be can celled if any of the tests are positive. Subjects first complete a Room 
Preference Test (see ‘Dependent  Measures’ section) to measure time spent in the testing 
rooms . Subjects will then undergo a drug challenge test in one of the testing rooms; Paired 
Grou p 1 (PG1) will receive 20mg meth amphetamine in the drug -paired room, PG2 will receive 
20mg meth amphetamine in the placebo -paired room, and PG3 will receive placebo in the drug -
paired room (NB: although we have not formulated specific hypotheses regarding P G3, this 
group will allow us to dissociate the contribution of expectancy and pharmacological effects to 
the responses exhibited by PG1). Unpaired group subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 
meth amphetamine or placebo in one of the testing rooms. After relaxing in the designated room 
for 30 min, baseline measures will be collected. Subjects will then consume the capsule. 
Subjective measures and vital signs will be obtained every 30min (at 30, 60, 90, and 120min). 
At the end, subjects rate their over all experiences  (see safety guidelines on page 16 for 
information regarding release of subjects after drug administration) .  
 
Visit 7 - Debriefing and Payment : Subjects will attend a short interview with the senior 
investigator one week after their final testing session  at which they are fully debriefed about the 
study aims, the drug received and may as k questions. They are paid $250 in cash  for 
completing all study requirements. Subjects who drop out of the study early will be paid for the 
number of sessi ons compl eted based on the payment schedule below. This information is 
conveyed to subjects at the orientation session verbally and in the consent form.  
The table below details each of the visits, the length of each visit, and the procedures that will 
be performed at each session during the study. The payment structure is also shown. Please 
note that payments are not made at each session, but are made in check form at the debriefing 
session as stated above.

Behavioral Tasks:  The Delay Discounting Task  measures impulsive choice by assessing the 
relative value of immediate versus delayed rewards. This task has been used extensively in 
drug abuse research, and studies have consistently shown greater discounting of delayed 
rewards by substance abusers. Subj ects complete this task at the orientation  session. In the 
task, participants make a series of choices (90 total) between a smaller amount of money 
(ranging from $0.50 to $10) available  immediately, and a larger amount of money ($10) 
available  after a dela y (i.e., 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days). They are told that at the 
end of the task, one of the questions will be selected at random and that they would receive 
whatever they answered to that question. Thus, subjects perform the task knowing tha t they will  
receive one of their choices  (money now or later) . This condition has been shown to enhance 
attention to the task and the accuracy of responding. In actuality, the research assistant checks 
the database to find a question to which the participa nt answered ‘$8 -10 right now’ and they are 
given $10. The $10 for task performance is separate to the $10 that subjects receive as 
compensation for completion of the orientation session.  
 
Dependent Measures : 1. Room preference  will be assessed during a 10m in Room Preference 
Test during which subjects are instructed to explore the testing rooms and to spend as much 
time as they like in each room. They are asked to pay particular attention to details such as 
scents, temperature, lighting, décor, and furniture . Camcorders placed in each room record 
participants’ movements during the preference test and the amount of time spent in each room 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________

Page 12 of 21 12/19/2017  is calculate d (% of total time) . 2. Subjective mood and drug  responses  will be assessed using 
standardized questionnaires;  
 
 The Addiction Centre Research Inventory , ARCI . This is a true –false questionnaire that 
consists of empirically derived scales sensitive to the effects of a variety of classes of 
psychoactive drugs (Haertzen 1966). We use a 53 -item version, which yields s cores for 
six scales that include sedation [pentobarbital –chlorpromazine group (PCAG)], 
stimulant -like effects [amphetamine (A); and benzedrine group (BG)], somatic and 
dysphoric effects [lysergic acid (LSD)], and euphoria [morphine –Benzedrine group 
(MBG)] . 
 The Drug Effects Questionnaire, DEQ . This consists of five  100-mm horizontal lines 
each labeled with a  question; “Do you feel any drug effect?” (rated from “none at all” to 
“a lot”), “Do you like the effects you are feeling now?” (rated from “not at all” to “like very 
much”), “Do you dislike the effects you are feeling now?” (rated from “not at all” to 
“dislike very much”), “Are you high?” (rated from “not at all” to “very”), and “Would you 
like more of what you consumed, right now?” (rated from “not at all” to “very much”).  
 The Profile  of Mood States, POMS. This is a 72 -item adjective checklist on which 
subjects report their current mood on a 5 -point scale from “not at all” (0) to “extremely” 
(4). Eight clusters (scales) of items are separated empirically by factor analysis (anxiety, 
depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion, friendliness, elation). Two summary scales 
are derived from the other scales as follows: arousal = (anxiety + vigor) –(fatigue + 
confusion); positive mood = elation –depression.  
 
Subjects also complete an End of Session Questionnaire (ESQ) at the end of each session to 
rate their overall experience and to indicate what drug they think they received. Vital signs will 
be measured at repeated intervals.  
 
For Specimen Collection Studi es 
 
1) Saliva Samples:  DNA for genetic analysis will be extracted from saliva samples collected 
during the orientation session. Saliva samples will be stored in a locked cabinet in the 
PI’s laboratory until analysis is performed. Samples will be coded and the  file linking 
subjects’ names and IDs will be kept in a separate secure location in the PI’s office. 
Once extracted, coded DNA samples (from saliva) will be stored in a locked freezer in 
the PI’s laboratory and kept for a period of 6 years following the st udy. Genetic analyses 
will identify potential genetic factors that influence responses to stimulant drugs and the 
development of environmental conditioning . These analyses will focus upon associations 
between genetic variants in, for example, drug receptor  genes and the outcome 
measures i.e., time spent in the drug -paired room, subjectively rewarding effects of 
methamphetamine . For example, these analyses may include analysis of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the dopamine transporter gene . Geneti c samples 
will be collected over the course of the study and stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s 
lab for batch analysis at the end of the study.

Page 13 of 21 12/19/2017  2) Blood samples:  RNA DNA, genes levels and plasma proteins will be extracted from the 
blood samples (50mL) co llected at orientation. Samples will be processed immediately 
for analysis of biological correlates. 20mL will be dedicated to the isolation of 
lymphocytes, 20 mL to gene expression studies and 10 mL for evaluating plasma 
protein.  
**The rationale for coll ection of blood samples for analysis of biological correlates is that 
drug use can induce changes in gene function that occur without a change in the body’s 
genetic code. We will collect lymphocytes and proteins present in blood samples in order 
to look at  gene function  in these recreational drug users . These analyses will include 
genes and markers for BDNF, CRF, NPY among others. This pilot data will be used to 
form a later grant application  to the NIH . 
 
Behavioral Intervention Studies  
 
Video tapes of subjects’ movements during the room preference tes t will be stored on a 
password -protected computer in the PI’s laboratory. Videos will be destroyed after the data is 
published.  
 
  Survey studies  
 
All questionnaires are standardized and are widely used in human laboratory studies to 
measure drug effects.  
 
Studies involving use of product  
 
Meth amphetamine tablets (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, MI) will be obtained from the 
Hospital Pharmacy and will be administered in opaque gelatin capsules with dextrose filler. Four 
5mg methamphetamine tablets will be placed into one single capsule. Placebo ca psules will 
contain only dextrose filler. Individuals are given a glass of water with which to consume the 
capsules.  
 
 
7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  
 
The risks to subjects involve risks of 1) confidentiality , 2) administration of meth amphetamine ,  
3) completion of questionnaires , and 4) blood draws . The possible adverse effects of 
meth amphetamine include:  
 
 constipation   coordination problems   drowsiness  
 memory loss   changes in sex drive   depression  
 dizziness  or faintness   rapid heart rate   confusion  
 restlessness   dryness of the mouth   tiredness  
 double or blurred vision   raised blood pressure   slurred speech  
 shakiness or tremor   nausea or muscle weakness   headache

These reactions are unlikely at the dose administered in this study, and in these healthy 
volunteers. In addition, subjects must report prior recreational use of illicit drugs including 
amphetamines , without adverse effects. We have previously administered  20mg 
meth amphetamine in our laboratory with few, if any, adverse effects. In order to minimize risks 
to subjects , we will only enroll individuals who report previous recreational drug use including 
alcohol, tobacco or marijuana use. The large majority of occasional psychoactive drug users do 
not go on to use them excessively and there is no evidence that participating in controlled 
laboratory studies such as these increases the risk for developing substance use problems [18-
21].  
 
Some risks are associated with the blood draw. These include bruising and pain at the site of 
needle insertion, and a small ri sk for infection. Samples  will be drawn by a certified phlebotomist 
who is trained  in methods of reducing risks. In addition, standard sterilization techniques will be 
utilized in order to minimize the risk of needle -site infections.  
 
Potential benefits of the proposed research to subjects and others : subjects will benefit from the 
information obtained during the screening procedure (e.g., physical examination and 
electrocardiogram, as well as psychiatric screening). This is particularly beneficial to individuals 
who are excluded during the screening bec ause of some previously undiagnosed condition. 
These individuals are referred for treatment. Subjects are paid for their participation. They may 
also request information about their performance and responses during the studies.  
 
Importance of the knowledg e to be gained : the risks to subjects are justified by the knowledge to 
be gained. The findings will further our understanding of an important yet understudied clinic al 
issue in a controlled manner,  that is, how psychoactive substances come to powerfully c ontrol 
mood and behavior which is central to the development of drug addiction. The project will 
important to the wider addiction research community, both basic science and clinical. The 
findings will be important from a basic science and also a clinical perspective. This human 
model has a clear parallel in preclinical research and provides a critical translational link to 
preclinical data. An understanding of how contextual conditioning is established with the 
prototypical stimulant drug meth amphetamine ca n be applied to the processes of contextual 
conditioning of other drugs. The findings and model can be used to design future investigations  
into methods to disrupt contextual conditioning and its consequences, particularly conditioned 
drug craving. Ultimat ely the data will inform existing treatment practices e.g. exposure therapy, 
and aid development of new approache s to curb drug use. Thus, new methods that break 
contextual associations or which counteract their influence on mood and behavior will improve 
current strategies to help achieve and maintain drug abstinence.  
 
8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures  
 
Subjective data will be collected using standardized paper forms and computerized 
questionnaires. Each subject will be given a unique code. The  data will only be identified with 
the subject’s ID for that study. The PI will keep the codes that link the name of the participant 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 15 of 21 12/19/2017  and the study ID in a secured cabinet. Data from paper forms will be entered in the computer by 
trained staff, and discrepa ncies corrected by a supervisor based on source documents.  
Computerized tasks will be administered using ACCESS and stored in a database on password 
protected computers in the PI’s laboratory.  
 
9.0 Data Analysis  
 
The primary measures are (i) change in % time spent in the drug -paired room, (ii) ratings of 
subjective stimulation (ARCI) during conditioning, and (iii) ratings of subjective stimulation 
during the re -exposure test session. Sample size calculations are pr esented in table 1 (below).  
 
Aim 1a:  To determine the influence of meth amphetamine place conditioning upon time 
spent in the drug -paired context.  We hypothesize that the paired group will spend 
significantly more time in a context paired with meth ampheta mine at test than the unpaired 
group.  We will compare the change in time spent in the initially less -preferred room between the 
paired and unpaired groups using t-tests.  
 
Aim 1b:  To determine the relationship between individual differences in 
meth amphetam ine place conditioning and (i) acute responses to the drug, (ii) 
demographic characteristics.  We hypothesize that individuals who exhibit greater sensitivity 
to the acute positive subjective effects of meth amphetamine will exhibit the largest increases in 
time spent in the drug -paired context at test.  We will examine the association between 
meth amphetamine subjective responses (stimulation and drug liking) after the first 
administration and the change in time spent in the drug-paired room at test  using correlation 
analysis. Power cal culations based on an N of 90 , with 80% power and a significance level of 
p<0.05 (2-sided) indicate that we will be able to detect a significant association if the true 
correlation coefficient is 0.3 ( a medium effect s ize). In exploratory analyses we will investigate 
differences in demographic, personality and drug use characteristics between paired group 
subjects  who acquire conditioning ( ≥10% increase in time spent in drug -paired room)  in 
comparison to those who do no t (no change or a decrease in time spent in drug -paired room ) 
using independent sample t -tests. Pilot data from our studies indicates that approximately 30% 
of subjects do not acquire conditioning.  
 
Aim 2:  To determine context -dependent responses to meth amphetamine and placebo 
challenge following place conditioning with meth amphetamine.  We hypothesize that 
meth amphetamine will produce greater subjective stimulation among subjects tested in the 
drug-paired room than those tested in the placebo -paired room.  We will compare subjective 
stimulation after  20mg meth amphetamine between paired group subjects tested in the drug -
paired and placebo -paired rooms  using independent samples t-test.

10.0 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
 
The PI is responsible for adherence with the protocol and accuracy in data entry. All data will be 
double entered and checked for accuracy. The PI will meet with research staff on a weekly 
basis to review procedures and data collection, and to troubleshoot  any unanticipated problems. 
Data will be analysed after every 10 subjects enrolled to check on the effect size.  
 
11.0 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The study involves a non -vulnerable population. Therefore, the PI and study physician will 
monitor the study for safety and adherence to the protocol.  The PI and Dr. Nathan will approve 
each subject before he or she begins any study procedures to ensure that only subjects who 
meet the eligibility criteria are enrolled. The PI will also rev iew the informed consent of every 
subject, supervise data collection and analysis, and ensure that privacy and confidentiality are 
maintained as described in this document.  
 
During the study sessions, vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) are monitor ed at 30 -
minute intervals and there are guidelines to follow regarding overt changes in these vital signs  
(see below).  
 
Determination of AEs: Adverse events are defined as any incidence when the PI or Dr. Nathan 
is consulted regarding participant vital signs or side effects. Any side effects reported in the 
medium to severe range will be classified as an adverse event. Data and safety monitoring  will 
be performed by the PI. Each month a report will be compiled that lists the number and details 
of adverse events (see Appendix) which will be discussed with the study physician.  
 
Possible adverse events (AEs) include:  
 Excessive increases in heart rat e and blood pressure.  
 Side effects of methamphetamine that cause significant impairment.  
During each session, heart rate and blood pressure are monitored before drug administration 
and at 30 min intervals following drug administration. Subjects also report  any side effects that 
they may be feeling using a paper and pen questionnaire. The following is a set of guidelines 
developed with the study physician regarding monitoring of vital signs and side effects during 
sessions.  
Safety and Monitoring Guide  
Baseli ne measurements i.e., before drug administration : 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 17 of 21 12/19/2017  Heart rate and blood pressure must within the “normal” range in order for the session to go 
ahead. Remember that subjects have often travelled on public transportation and may have 
rushed to the session to be here on time, so it is best to have them rest for at least 20 min before 
baseline measurements are obtained. In addition, heart rate and blood pressure tend to decline 
across the testing session while subjects are sedentary.    
  
Systolic  Diastolic  Heart rate   
What To Do:  
< 140  < 90 < 99 These values are within the “normal” 
range; proceed with other measures and 
drug administration  
>=140  >=90  >=99 -119 This is higher than “normal”; h ave the 
subject rest quietly and take another 
reading 10 minutes  later.  If reading is still 
above the “normal” range, rest and repeat 
once more 10 min later.  
If participant’s readings do not come down 
to the normal range, see instructions below.  
 
 
Within -session measurements i.e., after d rug administration :  
These measurements are taken post-capsule administration and are expected to cha nge 
throughout the session.  Do not use these measurements to play guessing games about what the 
capsule contained. If a participant’s blood pressure goes up , this is a normal drug response so do 
not get n ervous and definitely do not  make the participant nervous. Just follow the instructions in 
the guide in an appropriate and timely manner.  
  What to do if the subject has a reading in the “higher than we want”  range, and it won’t 
come dow n after a few readings:  
 Look in their subject folder for the vitals taken at their screening.  Contrast this 
reading with your current one; how different are they?  If they’re very different, the 
questions below may explain it .  Have this info ready for Dr. Childs/Dr Nathan . 
 Say to the subject in a casual tone,  “Your (blood pressure/heart rate) is looking a bit on 
the high side today.  There are a lot of factors that can affect (blood pressure/heart rate), so 
I’d like to ask yo u a few questions:  
 How much sleep did you get last night?  
 How much caffeine have you had in the last 12 hours?   (You should have asked 
this before anyway, but you can delve a bit deeper and double -check their 12 -
hour/current use versus their “typical” use)  
 Are you feeling stressed out?  
 Did you hurry coming in here?”  
 Record their answers on your session flowsheet .  Be thorough in your documentation.  
 Call Dr Childs to discuss  (5-2726) .  If you can’t reach Dr. Childs , call the study physician , 
Dr. Nathan (6 -9518) .

Page 18 of 21 12/19/2017  End-of-session measurements  
Vital signs must be within 20% of the baseline measurements in order to discharge the subject. If 
vitals are above these values, continue to monitor every 15min. Subjects who report any side 
effects in the medium range may require assistance to travel home  (i.e., taxi cab or have a friend 
come to get them). If any of these conditions are present at the end of the session, do not 
discharge the subject until you have consulted with Dr. Nathan. If all measurements are within 
the “normal” range (i.e., within 20 % of baseline, no significant side effects), discharge the 
subject with a Post -session Side Effects form for them to report any unusual signs or symptoms 
over the next 24h.  
 
Reporting of SAEs:  Although they are unlikely, all adverse events (AEs) occurring  during the 
course of the study will be reported to the Principal Investigator  and study physician . All AEs will 
be followed until resolved satisfactorily. Subject s who experience AEs will be withdrawn from 
the study. AEs will be evaluated for SAE criteria  (defined by the FDA). If an SAE should occur, it 
will be reported to the IRB of The University of Illinois at Chicago,  NIDA, and any other 
appropriate agencies  within 5 days of occurrence . The initial report will be followed by a 
complete SAE report, sent  to all institutions. If a subject or the investigator discontinues the If the Systolic  
Reading Is…  If the Diastolic  
Reading Is…  If the Heart 
Rate  Is…  
What To Do:  
 
< 140  
 < 90 < 99 It’s in the “normal” range.  
140-179 
 90-99 
 <99 
  
Check the side effects form for any 
symptoms. If nothing reported, continue to 
monitor regularly. If any side effects are 
reported, casually enquire about how they 
are feeling. If the subject also reports 
headache, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, 
pounding heart or subjective distress 
(anxiety, tension)  notify Dr. Childs and 
call Dr. Nathan to discuss . 
 
 
180 or higher  
 100 or higher  100 or higher   
Casually ask the participant how they are 
feeling. If they report no other 
symptoms,  have them sit quietly for 
10min. Take another reading and if it is  
still in this range, contact Dr. Nathan  for 
assistance (even if they say they fee l fine).  
If they report  headache, chest pain, 
nausea, pounding heart or subjective  
distress (anxiety, tension), contact Dr. 
Nathan for assistance right away (don’t 
wait for a second reading).

necessary. Follow -up care will continue until the subject no longer requires hospitalization, the 
condition is stabilized with no future change expected, or the problem is determined to be 
unrelated to the drug used in the study. The annual progress report submitted to NIDA will 
contain a summary of any SAEs occurring in the previous year.  
 
Reporti ng of IRB actions to NIDA:  Any IRB actions on the protocol, including continuing reviews 
and protocol amendments, will be communicated in the annual progress report to NIDA.  
 
Reporting protocol changes and amendments:  Any protocol changes or amendments to the 
procedures will be communicated in the annual progress report to NIDA.  
 
Trial stopping rules:  The study will be stopped if there is an inappropriate increase in the risks to 
participants (assessed by the rate of AEs  and SAEs) or if the effect size is deemed too small in 
preliminary analyses of study data.  
 
12.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
See earlier  section 9.0 Data Analysis.  
 
13.0 Regulatory Requirements  
13.1 Informed Consent   
 
Subjects read and sign the study consent form at the orientation session conducted at the 
Human Psychopharmacology Laboratory with the senior study investigator. They are told that 
the purpose of the study is to investigate interactions between drug effect s and the environment. 
The study will be fully explained to the subject at several instances (e.g. first contact, at the 
orientation session) before subjects read and sign the consent form. All subjects will be fluent in 
English in order to understand the standardized study measures.  There is also a waiting period 
of at least 2 days between signing the consent form and beginning the study such that the 
subject has time to fully re -review the study information and their decision to  participate.  All 
members of the research team will complete the required CITI training procedures for studies 
involving human subjects. The consent form will be stored in the subject’s research reco rd that 
is stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s laboratory.  
13.2 Subject Confiden tiality  
 
Subjects are assigned a study ID that is used to identify them on all study data. The file linking 
IDs to subject names is kept in a separate location to the data in a locked filing cabinet in the 
PI’s office. Only research staff who work on the study will have access to the data. Personally 
identifiable data is required in order to ensure eligibility for the study and to be able to contact 
subjects to schedule study visits.  
13.3 Unanticipated Problems  
 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________   
Interactions between drug effects and environments II  Version 0 11 
Page 20 of 21 12/19/2017  The PI and study physician will monitor the  study for safety and adherence to the protocol. Any 
adverse events that may occur are anticipated to be mild and limited to those listed in the 
consent form. The PI and the study physician will be notified immediately if an adverse event 
occurs, and the P I will report the event to the IRB. The PI and study physician will approve each 
subject before he or she begins any study procedures to ensure that only subjects who meet the 
eligibility criteria are enrolled. The PI will also review the informed consent of every subject, 
supervise data collection and analysis, and ensure that privacy and confidentiality are 
maintained as described in this document.

Why am I being asked?      
You are being asked to be a subject in a research study. The purpose of this research is to 
examine the interactions between drug effects and the environment.  The drugs used in this 
experim ent may be taken from one or more of the following classes of drugs:  
1. a stimulant e.g. caffeine, nicotine, amphetamine s 
2. a sedative e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepine, antihistamine  
3. a placebo (an inactive substance)  
You have been asked to participate in the research because you are 18 -40 years old, and have 
indicated during the screening process that you voluntarily consume psychoactive substances 
e.g., caffeine, nicotine, alcohol etc., on a recreational basis.  
Your participation in this research is voluntary .  Your decision whether or not to participate will 
not affect your current or future dealings with the University of Illinois at Chicago.   If you 
decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting that 
relationship.   
Approximate ly 150 subjects may be involved in this research at UIC.  
What is the purpose of this research?     
We are interested in studying the interactions between drug effects and the environment.  Subtle 
variations in environmental settings, such as smells, temperature, lighting, may interact with drug 
effects and alter the experiences that people feel. At seve ral points in the study we will ask you 
questions about whether you like the drug effects that you may be feeling, or the room that you 
are in.  Leave box empty -  For office use only  
 
 
Drug environments II, Version 014, 12/19/17, Page 2 of 9 
 What procedures are involved?     
This research will be performed at the Human Addiction Psychopharmacology Labo ratory 
(HAPPY Lab) located in Suite 318 of the Psychiatric Institute at the University of Illinois at 
Chicago.  You will need to come to the study site 7 times in order to complete the study. These 
visits will be scheduled at the availability of yourself an d the research coordinator, and will be 
conducted at least 2 days but no more than 1 week apart. Thus, the duration of your participation 
in the experiment will vary between 14 days and 7 weeks.  The first visit is an orientation session 
lasting 1 hour, the  next 4 visits (visits 2 -5) are drug administration  sessions that will last about 4 
hours each (usually conducted between 9am and 1pm). The sixth visit is a testing session that 
will also involve drug administration and will last 4h. The seventh visit will  be a debriefing 
session that will last approximately 30 -60min.  
At the orientation session, you will read and sign the consent form, receive instructions about 
recreational drug use before the sessions, and complete behavioral tasks, computer -based tasks 
and questionnaires so that you are familiar with the procedures . The research assistant will also 
collect a saliva sample for DNA analysis and a blood sample for epigenetic analysis (see below).  
The 4 drug administration sessions and the testing session  will be conducted beginning in the 
morning  at the HAPPY lab  at least 2 but not more than 7 days apart. If you are a women not 
using hormonal birth control, you will begin your first session either during days 1 -10 (follicular 
phase) or during days 15 -25 (luteal phase) of your menstrual cycle. The researcher will randomly 
determine (like the flip of a coin) w hether you are assigned to the follicular or luteal phase. If 
you are assigned to the follicular phase, you will call the researcher s on day 1 of your cycle to 
schedule your sessions. If you are assigned to the luteal phase, you will be given ovulation test 
kits (urine dip sticks) to test your urine on days 10 -15 of your cycle. When you get a positive test 
(which indicates that ovulati on is about to occur), you will call the researchers to schedule your 
sessions. Each session will involve administration of capsules  that may or may not contain an 
active drug and will last for 4 hours. You must not use any drugs  (including alcohol) , exce pt 
for prescribed medication s (that have been approved by the study doctor)  and your normal 
amounts of caffeine, for twenty -four ( 24) hours before any of the sessions.  In addition, you 
should not use other drugs for 6 hours following the experimental sessi ons as this may be 
hazardous to your health and safety. If you are taking prescribed medication, you should inform 
the experimenter before the experimental session. You should not drive to the study visits and 
should plan on a different method of transport ation.  You should not drive or operate complex 
machinery for 6 hours after the experimental sessions. You should not schedule any activities for 
immediately following sessions because of the possibility of drug administration during sessions.  
While you are  participating in the experimental phase (not the follow -up) of this study you must 
obtain the permission of the experimenter before participating in any other research study.  
Upon arrival at the laboratory, you will provide breath and urine samples to det ect recent alcohol 
and drug use, and in women, pregnancy.  If you test positive for alcohol or drug use, or 
pregnancy in women, your session will be cancelled and you may be withdrawn from the study.  
Fifteen minutes after arrival, you will complete mood qu estionnaires and your blood pressure 
will be measured. During study sessions 1 -5, you will be given a capsule  that could contain an 
active drug listed on the front of this form. Dr. Childs will randomly, like the flip of a coin, 
determine whether you recei ve an active drug or not. At various times after taking the capsule 
(30, 60, 90 and 120 min) you will complete mood questionnaires and your blood pressure will be 
 
 
Drug environments II, Version 014, 12/19/17, Page 3 of 9 
 measured. During the sessions when you are not completing study measures, you may relax in 
the testing room by yourself and watch television, movies or read.  
In this study, we are interested in studying the interactions between drug effects and the 
environment. Therefore, we ask you to pay attention to the environment you’re in during the 
study se ssions, and also any drug effects you are experiencing. At several points in the study we 
will ask you questions about whether you like the drug effects, or the room that you are in. At the 
end of the experimental session, you will rate your overall experi ence a nd you will be allowed to 
leave. As part of our laboratory procedure, some of the sessions that you participate in will be 
videotaped. The recordings will only be viewed by the experimenters and will be destroyed after 
the study.  
Once all of the stud y procedures are completed, you will attend the laboratory one week after 
your final testing session for a debriefing visit at which, you will be fully informed about the 
drugs you received and the aims of the study (i.e., the analysis that will be perform ed with the 
data collected). You may ask questions about the study and provide feedback about your 
experiences. At this visit you wi ll also be paid (up to $250) in c ash. If you drop out of the study 
before completing all of the requirements, you will recei ve a c ash payment  for the number of 
sessions completed according to the payment structure shown in the table below.  
The table on the next page  details each of the visits, the length of each visit, and the procedures 
that will be performed at each session d uring the study. The payment structure is also shown. 
Please note that payments for each study visit are not made at each session, but are made in c ash 
at the debriefing session as stated above.  
During this study, Dr. Childs and her research team will coll ect information about you for the 
purposes of this research. The information we collect regarding your current and recent drug use 
history will be used for research purposes only, and will remain locked in our laboratory at all 
times. Physiological (heart rate, blood pressure), subjective (mood questions ) and behavioral 
(computer task)  data will not be labeled with your name or other identifying information.  These 
data may be published, but will not identify you personally.  
Genetic Testing  
We will extract y our DNA from the saliva and blood sample s. DNA is the biochemical code that 
contains your genes, which you inherit from your parents. Genes help determine some of our 
individual characteristics, such as eye color, height and skin tone. Genes may also determine 
why people are affected by drugs and  how these drugs affect them. For example, people may 
differ in their sensitivity to the effects of drugs because of their genetic make -up and in turn this 
could influence their susceptibility to use drugs. We will assess the genes that  may influence 
your responses to the drugs administered during this study.  We will also study biological 
mechanisms that switch genes on and off  (epigenetics) . A special code will be used to label your 
DNA, so that it can be analyzed in this study but no one else will be able  to identify that it 
belongs to you. The Investigator will keep the name associated with each code in a locked file. 
This information will not be shared with you, nor will it be shared with others who are not 
directly related to this research study.

Optional Research:  
Sometimes new genetic information becomes available after a study has been completed, that 
would make it interesting to re -examine a different part of your DNA. Therefore if you agree, we 
request to store your DNA for future research and re -analysis of the data collected in this study. 
If you do not wish for your DNA to be used for future resear ch, it will be discarded after the 
testing has been completed for this study. You may also contact Dr. Childs at any point in the 
future to request that your genetic sample be re moved from storage and destroyed, at which point 
it will be destroyed.  We may study some or all of your genes and the results of this genetic 
research will not be returned to you.  
 
 I agree to allow my genetic data to be kept by Dr. Childs at the Human Addic tion 
Psychopharmacology Laboratory for future genetic research by this research study team to 
learn more about how to prevent, detect, or treat drug abuse and addiction.

 What are the potential risks and discomforts?  
Physical risks: The following is a list of the most common side effects of drugs that may be used 
in this study:   
 Constipation   Drowsiness   Dizziness or faintness  
 Rapid heart rate   Raised blood pressure   Restlessness  
 Dryness of the mouth   Changes in sex drive   Double or blurred vision  
 Confusion   Slurred speech   Shakiness or tremor  
 Headache   Nausea or muscle weakness   Coordination problems  
 Memory loss   Tiredness   Depression  
 Finger/toe numbness   Trouble  sleeping   Shortness of breath  
 Chest discomfort   Anxiety   Diarrhea  
Certain of the drugs you may receive also have the potential to be abused, but the risk of this is 
very low for individuals who qualify for these studies  based on our careful screening procedures .  
The experimenter should be informed of any symptom or feeling that you associate with the drug 
taken for the experiment.  If you experience any adverse reactions to the drugs, the experimenter 
may remove you from the study before completion. You should also be aware that small amounts 
of the drugs you receive may remain in your body for up to a  week after you take them and that 
this could result in a positive drug test.  If you intend to undergo a drug screening within one 
week of participatin g in this study, please advise the experimenter.   
There is also a potential risk of p ain, bruising or inflammation (the body’s response to injury or 
irritation) at the needle site  for the blood draw.  
Non-physical Risks:   There is a very small risk of a los s of privacy (revealing to others that you 
are taking part in this study) or confidentiality (revealing information about you to others to 
whom you have not given permission to see this information). You may experience mild anxiety 
or embarrassment in answ ering questions of a personal nature  regarding your health and well -
being.  
There is a Federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). In 
general, this law makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and mos t 
employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, it does not 
protect you against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or 
long-term care insurance. GINA also does not protect you agai nst discrimination if you have 
already been diagnosed with the genetic disease being tested.  
There is a risk that someone could get access to the genetic information we have stored about 
you. Genetic testing can create information about a subjects’ and the ir families’ personal health 
risks and can cause or increase anxiety, and/or interfere with your ability to get insurance or a 
job, and can even lead to discrimination.   Patterns of genetic variation also can be used by law 
enforcement agencies to identify  a person or his/her blood relatives.   There are laws against this 
kind of misuse, but they may not give full protection. There may be other unforeseen privacy 
risks. We believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make 
guarante es. Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we 
will make every effort to protect them. These efforts are described in the section below called 
“What about privacy and confidentiality?”.  
 
 
Drug environments II, Version 014, 12/19/17, Page 6 of 9 
 What are the reproductive risks ? 
If you are a woman,  the drugs that may be administered in this study can cause harm to an 
unborn child. To protect against possible side effects of the study drug, if you are pregnant or 
nursing a child you may not take part in this study. At the start o f each study session involving 
drug administration, you will provide a urine sample to be tested for pregnancy. The test must be 
negative for the session to continue.  
Will I be told about new information that may affect my decision to participate?   
During  the course of the study, you will be informed of any significant new research information 
(either good or bad), such as changes in the risks or benefits resulting from participation in the 
research or new alternatives to participation, that might cause yo u to change your mind about 
continuing in the research.  If new information is provided to you, your consent to continue 
participating in this research may be re -obtained.  
Are there benefits to taking part in the research?   
You will not directly benefit f rom participation in the research.  This study is designed to learn 
more about the factors that influence whether a person who takes psychoactive drugs may go on 
to abuse them and develop addiction or dependence.  The study results may be used to help othe r 
people in the future.  
What other options are there?  
This is not a treatment study.  Your alternative is to not participate in this study .  
What about privacy and confidentiality?  
The people who will know that you are a research subject are members of th e research team.  
Otherwise information about you will only be disclosed to others with your written permission, 
or if necessary to protect your rights or welfare (for example, if you are injured and need 
emergency care or when the UIC Office for the Prote ction of Research Subjects monitors the 
research or consent process) or if required by law.  
Study information which identifies you and the consent form signed by you will be looked at and/or 
copied for checking up on the research by the funding agency (Nat ional Institutes of Health) and /or 
others including UIC Office for the Protection of Research Subjects; State of Illinois Auditors , or 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) .   
A possible risk of the research is that your participation in the research or information about you 
might become known to individuals outside the research. Your personal information will not be 
stored with the data collected in this study. Your data collected in this study will be identified by 
a unique study code assigned only to y ou and the file linking this ID to your name will be kept 
separately to the data in a secure location (locked filing cabinet) in Dr. Childs’ office. All data 
collected from participants in this study will be given to the study sponsor (National Institute o f 
Health) to ensure that it is applicable to the general population. You will not be identified in this 
information provided to the study sponsor. Personal information collected from you during the 
study will be destroyed after the data is published.  
A de scription of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as required 
by U.S. law.  This web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the Web 
site will inclu de a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time.  
 
 
Drug environments II, Version 014, 12/19/17, Page 7 of 9 
 To help us protect you and the information we will be collecting from you, this study has been 
given a Certificate of Confidentiality by  the National Institutes of Health . This Certificate means 
that the researchers cannot be forced, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local 
civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, to disclose any information that 
may identify you.  The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands of information 
that would identify you, except as explained below.  
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a request for information from United States government 
employees if the request is for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects  or for 
information that must be disclosed to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).  
The Certificate does not stop you or a member of our family from voluntarily disclosing to any 
person information about yourself or your involvement in the study.  If you give your written 
consent to release study information to an insurer, employer or other person, the Certificate 
cannot be used to withhold this information.  
If the researchers become aware that you may cause serious harm to yourself or others, the 
researchers may report this to the appropriate auth orities without your consent.  
If you disclose actual or suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child, or disabled or 
elderly adult, the researcher or any member of the study staff must, and will, report this to Child 
Protective Services (i.e. Department of Family and Human Services), Adult Protective Services, 
and/or the nearest law enforcement agency.  
When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will 
be included that would reveal your identity. Videotapes that are collected during the study will 
be viewed only by the researcher staff working on the study and will be destroyed after the stud y.  
What if I am injured as a result of my participation?   
If you get ill or injured from being in the study, UIC will help you get medical treatment. You 
should let the study doctor know right away that you are ill or injured. If you believe you have 
become ill or injured from this study, you should contact Dr.  Childs at telephone number  
312-355-2726  
You should let any health care provider who treats you know that you are in a research study. If 
you do seek medical treatment, please take a copy of this  document with you because it may help 
the doctors where you seek treatment to treat you. It will also provide the doctors where you seek 
treatment with information they may need if they want to contact the research doctors.  
You or your health insurance pl an will be billed. No money has been set aside to pay the costs of 
this treatment. Health insurance plans may or may not cover costs of research -related injury or 
illness. You should check with your insurance company before deciding to participate in this 
research study. Costs not covered by insurance could be substantial.  
UIC has not set aside any money to pay you or to pay for your treatment if you get ill or injured 
from being in the study. There are no plans for the University to provide other forms of  
compensation (such as lost wages or pain and suffering) to you for research related illnesses or 
injuries. The only exception to this policy is if it is proven that your injury or illness is directly 
caused by the negligence of an UIC employee.

iii PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Assessment of mandibular bone invasion with M agnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) using SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation 
(SWIFT ) 
Précis: MRI scanning in 3T and 4T MR magnet will be performed on up 
to 20  patients with possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone 
invasion by applying newly developed sequences and clinically established MR sequences. We will then compare the conventional imaging results of the patients with 3T and 4T MRI results and post operative pathology results.   
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to improve the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of MRI in detecting the degree of bone involvement and invasion in oral cancer. The presence and degree of bone invasion determines the extent of surgery and has great effect on the morbidity of patients with oral cancer and bone/soft tissue tumors. 
 Primary:  To  demonstrate the efficacy  of the MRI scanning in 3T 
and 4T MR magnet for  patients  with squamous  cell carcinoma
 
adjacent  to, or involving,  the mandible.  Comparison will be made  
to histolopathological  sections  as the “gold  standard.”  
Population:  We plan to enroll  20 subjects  with a diagnosis  of advanced 
squamous  cell carcinoma  of the oral cavity or 
osteoradionecrosis . All of those  subjects  enrolled will have 
findings  concerning  for mandibular  invasion on physical  
examination or computed tomography  imaging.  Prior to 
surgery,  patients  will be consented  for SWIFT  imaging.  
Imaging  will be conducted during  a seven -day period prior to 
surgery.

1 1 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIE NTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
1.1 Background Information and Study Rational  
The primary objective of this study is to improve the diagnostic accuracy and 
specificity of MRI in detecting the degree of bone involvement. The presence and degree of bone invasion determines the extent of surgery and has great effect on the morbidity of patients with oral cancer and bone/soft tissue tumors. 
The most important factor in the management is to accurately identify the 
presence of neoplastic invasion.  
Unfortunately , detecting bone invasion and extension of bone involvement prior 
to surgery is often difficult with the currently available imaging techniques. MRI with high contrast resolution and the ability to perform multiplanar imaging plays an integral role in the delineation of tumoral involvement of the bone. Although MRI is an excellent tool in the assessment of bone invasion in carcinoma, its 
overestimation of cortical invasion and tumor extent to the bone marrow have 
been a diagnostic challenge, leading to false positive results. Like many of the musculoskeletal system tissues, cortical bone produces no signal with 
conventional MRI techniques, limiting the characterization of image contrast 
and differentiation of adjacent soft tissues.  
A novel MRI technique called Sweep Imaging with Fourier Transformation (SWIFT) appears to be a suitable tool to overcome this challenge.  The main 
advantage of SWIFT is to obtain signal from the cortical bone. We believe that 
the SWIFT technique will overcome the false positive res ults.   
1.2 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 This study has the following risks :

IRB: 1210M22261  7/ 27/2 015 
 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
2 1.2.1  Potential Risks  
Screening Questionnaire  
The questionnaire asks questions that are private in nature.  Also, some people can 
be embarrassed by the questions.  There is a risk that the information from the 
questionnaire could inadvertently be disclosed.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
MRI is rou tinely used in healthcare to look at tissues in the body. MRI scanners, the 
machines that take these images, have a strong magnetic field and have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine use for patients.  While there are no known health risks associated with these strong magnetic fields, 
some people report dizziness, mild nausea, headache, a metallic taste in the mouth, 
or sensations of flashing lights. These effects have been associated with movement of the head in a strong magnetic field. These symptoms, if present, disappear shortly after leaving the magnet. There are some risks linked with the MRI scanning 
procedure itself, which include:  
1.  Projectile Objects. Objects with magnetic properties, such as metallic objects, 
can be pulled into the magnet. These objects can be dangerous if they are brought 
into the magnet room. By keeping magnetic objects away from the magnet and by 
controlling access to the magnetic field area, we have minimized the chance of this occurring.  
2.  C laustrophobia. Some people may experience claustrophobia (fear of confined 
spaces), while inside the scanner .  Once inside it is possible to  stop the scanning 
and be removed at any time.  Patients  will be given a squeezable device, a bulb, 
which serves as an “emergency” button.  The squeeze bulb will let MRI staff know 
immediately if the patient is  experiencing claustrophobia, and they will terminate the 
scan. The MRI operators will be able to talk during the entire scanning process by two-way earphones and microphone communication system. Patients can also 
press a button inside the scanner to get their attention.  
3. Energy waves. Another risk is presented by the energy waves used in the scanner. The power of the energy waves is well below the strength neede d to heat 
the tissue in your body and cause harm,  but any metal in contact with patient  skin 
could heat up. This is why patients  will be asked to remove all jewelry.  
It is also possible that the scanner will cause peripheral nerve stimulation  
(stimulatio n of the nerves or muscles). If patients  feel any tingling or unusual

 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
3 sensations during the scan, or muscle contractions, they can use the squeeze bulb 
to alert the researcher immediately.  
4.  Loud Sounds. The MRI scanner makes loud banging noises during operation. 
Patients  will be given earplugs to reduce the noise level. The noise generated by 
the operation of the scanner during a study is loud enough to cause hearing 
damage if patients  do not wear hearing protection, which we will provide. If, even 
with the hearing protection we give patients , patients may  find the noise from the 
scanner to be uncomfortable or painful, and can ask the scanner operator to stop the experiment immediately.  
5. In addition, there is a risk of unknown effects related to partici pation in T4 tesla 
level MRI research. Long -term effects of exposure to high magnetic fields are 
unknown. Short term most people experience no ill effects from the strong magnetic field, but some people report dizziness, mild nausea, headache, a metallic t aste in 
their mouth, or sensations of flashing lights.  
6.   The risks of exposure to high magnetic fields are unknown for fetuses.  
Therefore, if the participant is  a female who is capable of becoming pregnant, and 
has any reason to believe that they might be pregnant, they should not participate in 
this study. The effects of taking MRIs on an unborn baby have not yet been proven to be safe or unsafe. If they think they  may be pregnant, they must inform the 
investigator. The investigators strongly recommend that participants do not 
participate in this study if the participant  think s that they may be pregnant. 
Participants  are ultimately responsible for their own decision to participate or not to 
participate in this study.  
 Potential Benefits  
There are no direct benefits to participation. However, if anything abnormal is found 
and is considered to be a significant finding it will be reported to the patient’s surgeon prior to surgery.

2.1 Study Objectives 
To demonstrate the efficacy  of the MRI scanning in 3T and 4T MR magnet for  patients  
with mandibular bone invasion. Comparison will be made to histolopathological  sections 
as the “gold  standard.”  
 
2.2 Study Outcome Measures  
To determine how well the MR images will predict the presence of mandibular invasion, 
we will compare our results with clinical, operative, radiological and pathological findings 
(gold standard). Thus, patients will be asked to give permission to the investigators to access the re levant medical records.

5 3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a cross- sectional study to be conducted at the University of Minnesota. For this 
study we will enroll patients with possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone invasion . 
Patients 18 and older with oral cancer or osteoradionecrosis will be recruited for the 
study prior to their surgery. Subjects will be identified by their physician while seek ing 
care for oral cancer or osteoradionecrosis in the Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery clinic. Eligible patients will be recruited and consented in the 
Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery clinic during their scheduled appointment. This 
appointment will occur before the patient undergoes surgery for their oral cancer  or 
osteoradionecrosis . Patients that are deemed eligible, after reviewing their medical 
records, will complete the CMRR subject safety screening questionnaire.  
All eligible and consented participants will have MRI scans obtained at the CMRR using the 3T and 4T magnet. Patients will also be asked to sign a HIPPA waiver allowing researchers to access their medical records including their clinical, operative, radiological and pathological findings.

11 6 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVA LUATIONS  
6.1 Study Procedures /Evaluations  
The subject will be taken to the room where the magnet is located. As MRI scanning is 
noisy, subjects will be given ear plugs and will be shown how to place them. Subjects will be asked to lie on his/her back on the scanner table. He/she will be moved into the 
magnet while lying on his/her back. Brief scans will be obtained (less than 1 minute) to localize the area of interest. We will then obtain longer MRI scans (around 5- 15 minutes 
each). The total time required for scanning will be about 1 hour.    
6.2 Questionnaire Administration 
Prior to obtaining the MRI images all participants will complete, with the research staff, the CMRR subject safety screening questionnaire.

12 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants , including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of a serious 
adverse event.    
7.1.1  Serious Adverse Event s  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the foll owing criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred)  
• Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
7.2 Reporting Procedures  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported 
using the following timeline :  
• Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the 
IRB within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB within 2 weeks of the invest igator becoming aware of the problem.

Protocol Synopsis  
Title A MULTICENTER, OPEN -LABEL STUDY OF SEBELIPASE ALFA IN 
PATIENTS WITH LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE DEFICIENCY  
Protocol Number  LAL-CL06  
Methodology  This is an open- label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
SBC-102 (United States adopted name: sebelipase alfa) in a broad population 
of subjects with Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL Deficiency).  Such 
subjects may have been excluded from enrollment in other studies of 
LAL Deficiency because of age, disease progression, previous treatment by 
hematopoietic  stem cell or liver transplantation, less common disease 
manifestations, or disease characteristics that would preclude participation in a 
placebo- controlled study.   
The study  will consist of a screening period of up to 45 days, a treatment period 
of up to 96 weeks, an expanded treatment  period of a maximum of up to 48 
weeks, and a follow -up phone call at least 4 weeks after the last dose of 
sebelipase alfa.  All subjects will initiate treatment with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 mg·kg -
1 through intravenous administration every other week (qow).  
Dose escalations up to 3  mg·kg -1 once weekly (qw) will be allowed if the 
subject meets dose escalation criteria (e.g., significant clinical progression) after a minimum time on the previous dose.  
All infusions will initially be administered at a study center. After Week 48 of the treatment period, home infusions may be permitted for subjects who have had no moderate- to-severe hypersens
itivity reactions requiring medical 
intervention/management and no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to 
study drug within the prior 24 weeks, contingent on Sponsor approval, local 
regulations, and the availability of established regional infrastructure and 
resources for home infusions.  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at regular intervals 
throughout the study.  Exploratory safety and efficacy assessments may be 
performed for subjects who exhibit specific atypical manifestations of 
LAL Deficiency at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the 
Sponsor (e.g., pulmonary function tests for an individual presenting with 
significant pulmonary involvement, etc). In addition, the PK of sebelipase alfa will be assessed for the pediatric population (where local regulations permit), those with severe hepatic dysfunction, and those who have had a previous liver or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
Effects on health- related quality of life (HRQOL) will be characterized for all 
subject s at selected time points.  Blood samples will also be collected for an 
additional analysis of potential disease- related biomarkers in this population.  
An independent program -level safety committee appointed by the Sponsor will 
provide additional oversight  of subject safety in this study through periodic and 
ad hoc reviews of safety data.  
Study Duration  Screening will occur within 45 days.  Each subject will receive sebelipase alfa for at least 52 weeks and up to 96 weeks  in the treatment period. Subjects who 
complete the 96- week treatment period may continue to receive sebelipase alfa 
in the expanded treatment period for an additional duration of up to 48  weeks , 
unless discontinued sooner after  sebelipase alfa is  registered and available as 
a long- term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with LAL 
Deficiency in the region where the subject resides and/or is receiving treatment (in accordance with country -specific requirements) .

Protocol Number  LAL-CL06  
The follow -up period will be at  least  4 weeks  from the last  infusion  of sebelipase 
alfa. 
Study Center(s)  Approximately 20 study centers will participate in this study.  
Study Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of sebelipase alfa in 
a more broad population of subjects with LAL Deficiency than have been 
previously studied.  
The secondary objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate effects of sebelipase 
alfa relative to Baseline assessment of lipid metabolism and liver function (including histopathology); (2) to evaluate the effects of sebelipase alfa on additional clinical parameters of LAL Deficiency including those not previously well characterized in the literature, and (3) to evaluate the effects of sebelipase 
alfa on growth parameters in pediatric subjects presenting with evidence of 
growth delay, (4) to evaluate the immunogenicity of sebelipase alfa.  
The exploratory objectives of this study are (1) to further characterize the PK of sebelipase alfa in pediatric subjects, subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction, and those who have had a previous liver or hematopoietic stem cell transplants; 
and (2) to evaluate the effect of sebelipase alfa on HRQOL assessments.  
Number of Subjects  Approximately 30 subjects; including at least 4 children from 2- 4 years of age at 
study initiation.

7. Exposure to any investigational product within 30 days of Screening for 
a small molecule and 60 days of Screening for a biologic.  
8. Known hypersensitivity to eggs.  
Investigational 
Medicinal Product, Dose, Route, 
Regimen  Sebelipase alfa is  a highly purified recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase 
(rhLAL) manufactured using transgenic hens, which produce rhLAL in egg 
white.  
Eligible subjects will receive intravenous infusions of sebelipase alfa for up to 144 weeks.  All subjects will receive  a starting dose of 1 mg·kg
-1 qow in the 
treatment period. Subjects who complete the 96- week treatment period may 
enter the expanded treatment period at the same dose of sebelipase alfa that 
they were receiving at the end of the treatment period. In both s tudy periods, 
dose increases (up to 3 mg·kg-1 qw) will be permitted during the treatment 
period and will be at the discretion of the Investigator and with approval of the Sponsor, based on protocol -defined criteria of significant clinical progression.  
At any time during the study, subjects who cannot tolerate the dose may 
receive a dose reduction. Subjects who are unable to tolerate the lowest dose (0.35 mg·kg
-1 qow) will be discontinued from the study.  
Reference therapy  There is no placebo or comparator in this study.  
Criteria for 
Evaluation Safety 
Safety endpoints will include the incidence of adverse events (AEs), SAEs, and 
infusion- associated reactions (IARs); changes from Baseline in 12- lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry [including lipid panel], and urinalysis); changes in vital signs during and after infusion, relative to pre- infusion values; physical examination findings; 
use of concomitant medications/therapies; characterization of anti- drug 
antibodies (ADAs) including ADA titer by time point, peak ADA titer, and time to peak ADA titer.  The effect of ADAs on the safety of sebelipase alfa will also be 
explored, in particular, the relationship between ADA -positive subjects and the 
incidence of IA Rs.  Functional and overall development in subjects ≤ 6 years of 
age will be assessed, as determined by Denver II scores.  
Efficacy  
Secondary outcome measures include the following changes or percent change 
from Baseline to the end of the treatment period: (1) decrease in Alanine 
Aminotransferase (ALT); (2) decrease in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); (3) 
decrease in LDL- C; (4)  decrease in non- HDL-C; (5) increase in HDL- C; (6) 
decrease in TG , (7) decrease in Child- Pugh status, (8)  decrease in United 
Kingdom  Model for End- Stage Liver Disease (UK -ELD) score. In the subset of 
subjects for whom these assessments are performed: (9) improvement in 
hepatic histology; (10) decrease in liver and spleen volume by magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI); and (11) decrease in liver fat fraction by MRI. The 
effect of sebelipase alfa on growth parameters in pediatric subjects with manifestations of impaired growth will be measured.

Protocol Number  LAL-CL06  
Additional clinical, biochemical and hematological abnormalities will also be 
evaluated, including (1) total and conjugated bilirubin, (2) gamma 
glutamyltransferase (GGT), (3) markers of macrophage activation, 
(4) high-sensitivity C -reactive protein, (4) hemoglobin level, and (5) platelet 
count.  
Exploratory measures of additional clinical manifestations of LAL Deficiency not 
previously well characterized in the literature will include changes in functional assessments outcomes.  
Pharmacokinetics  
PK parameters (in subjects for whom these assessments are performed) will be reported, as the data permit, and may include serum clearance and apparent 
volume of distribution estimates along with secondary parameters of area under the concentration-
time curve, maximum observed concentration, time to 
maximum observed concentration, and terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2).  The 
effect of ADAs on sebelipase alfa PK will also be explored. PK  analysis will be 
discussed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Health -Related Quality of Life  
Exploratory HRQOL measures will include changes from Baseline in scores for 
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue scale, Chronic 
Liver Disease Questionnaire, or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ( PedsQL™) 
Generic Core Scales, as appropriate to the age of the subject.  
Pharmacodynamics  
Exploratory disease- relate d biomarkers, which may be identified based on 
emerging information from the sebelipase alfa development program and scientific literature,  will be analyzed by changes or percent changes over time.  
 Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study; projected 
enrollment is based on feasibility.  It is expected that approximately 30 subjects 
will be treated.  
Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set: The Full Analysis Set will include all subjects who received 
at least 1 infusion of sebelipase alfa.  Other analysis sets may be defined in the SAP. 
 
General Analysis Conventions 
The following standard conventions will be used for creating descriptive 
summaries.  
• Continuous numeric endpoints will be summarized by providing the number 
of subjects  with non- missing data, the mean and standard deviation of the 
data, and the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum value;  
• For categorical endpoints, the number and percentage of subjects with each possible outcome will be displayed.   
The denominator for 
percentages will include subjects with missing data.  Statistical

Changes and percentage changes from baseline, if applicable, will be 
summarized at each planned assessment time point using these general 
techniques.  
The general techniques will be used to describe:  
• Demographics and baseline characteristics;  
• Subject accountability  
• Clinical laboratory tests (shift tables indicating changes relative to reference ranges may be constructed for some parameters; spaghetti plots of values over time may also be constructed)
 
• Results of MRI assessments (spaghetti plots of values over time may also be constructed)
 
• Physical exam and ECG data  
• Denver -II Assessment  
• Concomitant medication use  
• HRQOL  
Safety Analyses  
Safety will be examined for the Full Analysis Set ove rall and, as subject 
numbers permit, stratified by dose, by ADA status, and for other subgroups of interest.  
Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. All AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be listed; separate listings will also be provided for subjects who die while on study and who discontinue sebelipase alfa due to an AE.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing any AE, any related AE, any SAE, any related SAE, and any IAR and deaths and any other discontinuations due to an AE will be 
tabulated.  
Frequency of treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be tabulated by 
preferred term within the system organ class.  Frequencies will also be presented by the classifications of severity and causality within dose.  In addition, frequency of AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be presented for time periods spanning the entire course of sebelipase alfa treatment: up to 24 weeks after 
the first dose, > 24 to 48 weeks, > 48 to 72 weeks, and > 72 to 96 weeks.  As 
appropriate, additional listings, summary tables, and graphics will be generated 
to evaluate IAR frequency and severity over time. The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation will be summarized.
 
Anthropometric Parameters  
Anthropometric indicators of growth status (WFA, plus additional parameters if 
sufficient data are available) will be evaluated for subjects < 18 years of age. Weight -for-length/weight -for-stature and body mass index, if computed, will be 
derived from data on weight and length/stature.  Anthropometric parameters will be plotted on standard growth curves.  Z -scores and percentiles based on the 
age-gender standardized norms will be calculated in accordance with the 
methodology described by the WHO (subjects ≤  24 months) or CDC (subjects 
> 24 months to 18 years) and using the growth charts relevant to the respective 
methodology.  The primary means for describing the impact of sebelipase alfa

on anthropometric parameters will be graphical displays; tabular summaries 
may be created to support the graphs. In addition, the percentages of subjects 
who meet criteria for under nutrition (underweight, stunting, and wasting) will be 
tabulated at each time point.  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Evaluation of the relationship between non- invasive measurements of liver fat 
content and liver histopathology may al so be conducted.  Exploratory analyses 
of the effect of ADAs on the efficacy of sebelipase alfa may be performed as 
suggested by the type and amount of data available.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The Pharmacokinetic Set (PK Set) will be comprised of subjects who received at least 1 dose of sebelipase alfa, and have sufficient data for analyses of the PK profile following at least 1 infusion.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses will be performed for the PK Set. Sebelipase alfa serum concentration data will be incorpora ted into a population PK model, which is to be reported separately, 
and will not part of the reporting of this study.  
Subgroup Analyses  
Effect of ADAs will be examined for efficacy and safety endpoints.  As subject numbers permit, analyses may be conducted in other subgroups of interest (e.g., subjects who undergo major changes in diet and/or use of lipid- lowering 
medications).  
Missing or Invalid Data  
All data will be analyzed as they were collected in the database.  Missing data in general will not be imputed; any imputation techniques if deemed necessary will be discussed in the clinical study report.  
Extension Analyses  
At the completion of the study, analyses will also be performed on cumulative data from the treatment period and expanded treatment perio d. Efficacy 
endpoints will be analyzed using techniques similar to those described for the analyses of data in the treatment period. Safety endpoints, as well as PK and 
HRQOL endpoints, will also continue to be analyzed in the extension analyses.

1. Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study is to be conducted 
according to United States (US) and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines), applicable government regulations and institutional research 
policies and procedures. 
1.1. Background  
1.1.1.  Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency  
Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency (LAL Deficiency) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database number 278000) is a serious and life -threatening multisystem storage disorder caused 
by a marked decrease in LAL enzyme activity.  LAL plays a key role in the metabolism and degradation of lipids, predominantly cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides, and its marked reduction or absence in patients with LAL Deficiency leads to accumulation of these lipids in various tissues and cell types throughout the body.  There are no safe or effective therapies for LAL Deficiency.  
LAL Deficiency is caused by mutations affecting the LIPA gene located on chromosome 
10q23.2- q23.3.  The most rapidly progressive form of LAL Deficiency presents in infants and is 
associated with a variety of private mutations that likely result in a complete loss of enzyme function ( Grabowski et al., 2012); LAL Deficiency presenting in children and adults is frequently 
associated with a common exon- 8 splice -junction mutation that is may result in some residual 
enzyme activity.  
1.1.2.  Clinical Presentation of LAL Deficiency  
LAL Deficiency is associated with significant ill health and a shortened life expectancy.  As is the case for many other lysosomal storage disorders, subjects with LAL Deficiency present and progress as a continuum,  with prominent liver pathology, and dyslipidemia.  
LAL Deficiency presenting in children and adults, sometimes called cholesteryl ester storage disease, is the most common presentation, and is an underappreciated cause of cirrhosis, 
dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis.  In the majority of reported cases, subjects are 
diagnosed before the age of 20.  Although disease presentation can be variable, hepatic manifestations typically dominate the clinical picture ( Bernstei n et al., 2013) .  Diagnosis of 
LAL Deficiency requires a high index of clinical suspicion, since elevated transaminases, fatty 
liver, and hyperlipidemia (either alone or in combination) are also seen in subjects with other liver and metabolic diseases.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December  2015  
In LAL Deficiency, the presence of increased lysosomal cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in 
the liver is associated with liver fibrosis and progression to cirrhosis.  Published cases clearly 
demonstrate that progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis or clinical complications of chronic liver 
disease, including bleeding ascites and esophageal varices, occur across the age spectrum 
(Bernstein, et al., 2013). 
Dyslipidemia with elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low -densit y lipoprotein- cholesterol 
(LDL -C) and decreased high- density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL- C) levels is common and has 
been shown to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis ( Beaudet et al., 1977 ; 
Anderson et al., 1999 ; Elleder et al., 2000).  Although textbook descriptions describe elevated 
LDL and triglycerides (TG) in affected cases (Type II hyperlipidemia), recent insights suggest 
that isolated elevation of LDL may be present in a number of cases ( Tripuraneni et al, 2013 ). 
In addition to the more common manifestations of LAL Deficiency, other clinical presentations 
and complications have been described, including pulmonary hypertension ( Cagle  et al.,1986), 
severe hypersplenism and splenic infarcts (Guzzetta et al., 1990), and mesenteric lipodystrophy 
(vom Dahl et al., 1999). Growth failure, defined as > 2 standard deviations below normal weight 
and height measurements for age, has been noted in some children and adults with 
LAL Deficiency . Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in most LAL Deficiency subjects.  However, 
infants with LAL Deficiency typically present with chronic diarrhea, emesis, malabsorption and failure to thrive.  
LAL Deficiency presenting in infants, historically called Wolman disease, is a more rare presentation of the disease and is usually fatal within the first 6 months of life.  Named after the 
physician who first described it ( Abramov et al., 1956),  this is the most aggressive presentation 
of LAL Deficiency, with growth failure as the predominant clinical feature and a key contributor 
to the early mortality. Rapidly progressive hepatic disease, as evidenced by liver enlargement, elevation of transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia, also occurs in these infants and contributes to mortality ( Anderson et al., 1999 ; 
Mayatepek  et al., 1999 ). 
At present, there are no therapies approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of 
LAL Deficiency. In infants, a variety of supportive therapies are used in an attempt to mitigate 
some of the effects of this rapidly fatal disease.  Although some temporary stabilization of the 
clinical condition has been described, these interventions are not believed to substantially 
modify the outcome in affected subjects ( Hoeg et al., 1984; Meyers et al., 1985).  With few 
exceptions, success has not been achieved using bone marrow/hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  These methods are frequently limited in use and/or associated with high mortality due to the condition of the subjects at the time of  diagnosis.  Additionally, 
bone marrow/hematopoietic stem cell transplantation carries the  inherent risks associated 
with these procedures, including graft -versus -host disease ( Krivit et al., 2000;  Stein et al., 2007 ; 
Tolar  et al., 2009 ; Yanir et al., 2013 ).

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December  2015  
Treatment for children or adults presenting with LAL Deficiency is limited to management of 
dyslipidemia through diet and the use of lipid- lowering therapies.  The impact of lipid- lowering 
agents such as hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is limited, since 
they do not address the root cause of LAL Deficiency, and disease progression to end stage 
liver failure still occurs ( Ginsberg et al., 1987;  Di Bisceglie et al., 1990 ; Tarantino et al., 1991;  
Yokoy ama & McCoy, 1992;  Glueck et al., 1992; Gasche et al., 1997;  Assmann & Seedorf, 2001 ; 
Tadiboyina et al., 2005). As liver function deteriorates, liver transplantation may be required.  At 
present, there is limited information on the long- term outcomes of l iver transplantation in 
subjects with LAL Deficiency ( Ferry et al., 1991 ; Hansen & Horslen, 2008 ). 
1.1.3.  Medical Plausibility of Enzyme Replacement Therapy for LAL Deficiency 
LAL Deficiency resembles other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) with the accumulation of 
substrate in a number of tissues.  Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in subjects with LAL Deficiency is a rational approach given the demonstrated medical value and long -term 
safety of ERTs for other LSDs, including Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Fabry disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis I and II ( Barton et al., 1990; Barton et al., 1991 ; Kishnani et al., 2007;  
van der Ploeg et al., 2010;  Wilcox et al., 2004 ; Wraith et al., 2004 ; Muenzer et al., 2007 ). 
In LAL Deficiency, substrate accumulation is most marked in hepatocytes and cells of the reticuloendothelial system, including Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in the spleen and macrophages in the lamina propria of the small intestine. Reticuloendothelial cells express the 
macrophage mannose/N -acetylglucosamine receptor (also known as macrophage mannose 
receptor or CD206), which mediates binding, cell uptake and lysosomal internalization of 
proteins with N- acetylglucosamine or mannose terminated N -glycans, and provides a pathway 
for the potential correction of the enzyme deficiency in these key cell types ( Stahl et al., 1978 ).  
This knowledge and the precedent established for other LSDs provides plausibility that ERT 
with sebelipase alfa, a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) with the appropriate 
glycan characteristics for targeting macrophages and other key cells will benefit subjects with 
LAL Deficiency.  
Biological activity of sebelipase alfa in subjects with LAL Deficiency has been demonstrated in clinical study LAL -CL01 and LAL- CL04, including decreases in transaminases and evidence of 
early lipid mobilization and correction of dyslipidemia with longer term dosing,  This information and the encouraging initial response to sebelipase alfa in LAL- CL03, including improvements in 
weight gain, decrease in hepatic and splenic size, resolution of vomiting and diarrhea, and improvement in biochemical markers , provides the first human evidence in support o f the 
potential for ERT for this disease (see Section 1.4).

1.2. Investigational Agent  
Sebelipase alfa (SBC- 102) is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) with the 
same amino acid sequence as the native enzyme.  Sebelipase alfa is a highly purified 
recombinant form of the naturally occurring human lysosomal acid lipase enzyme responsible 
for the metabolism and degradation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides that are delivered to lysosomes by a variety of routes including LDL receptor -mediated endocytosis.  Sebelipase alfa 
is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 55- kD with 6 N- linked glycosylation 
sites.  
Sebelipase alfa is produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) technology in egg 
white using a transgenic Gallus  expression system and contains predominantly 
N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose- terminated N -linked glycan structures, some of 
which contain mannose -6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc and mannose -terminated glycans are 
specifically recognized and internalized via the macrophage mannose receptor  (MMR ) present 
on the surface of macrophages.  These cells are one of the most important cell types that 
accumulate cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in patients with LAL Deficiency.  In addition, the presence of M6P allows delivery to cells that display the widely expressed M6P receptor.  
1.3. Nonclinical Data with Sebelipase Alfa  
In in vitro  studies, sebelipase alfa demonstrated uptake and localization to lysosomes in 
macrophages, and produced a dose- dependent correction of LAL activity in human fibroblasts 
deficient in this enzyme.  
Homozygous LAL- deficient rats demonstrate liver and spleen abnormalities, which resemble the 
abnormalities seen in patients with LAL Deficiency including accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, hepatosplenomegaly, transaminase elevation, Kupffer cell expansion with disruption of normal liver architecture and liver fibrosis ( Leavitt, et al., 2011).  In addition, the 
LAL-deficient rats show other abnormalities that are prominent in infants with LAL Deficiency, 
including gastrointestinal involvement with abnormal lipid accumulation in macrophages in the lamina propria of the small intestine, markedly impaired weight gain, and early mortality (Leavitt,  et al., 2011).  In homozygous LAL -deficient rats, intravenous (IV) administration of 
sebelipase alfa restored LAL enzymatic activity, as evidenced by reduction in abnormal lysosomal lipid co ntent in the liver and other key target tissues. LAL substrate reduction in 
affected tissues was accompanied by a dose- dependent reversal of the pathology with 
restoration of more normal body weight gain, reduction in organ size, improvements in histopathological abnormalities, decreases in serum transaminases and markedly improved survival.  
Refer to the Investigator Brochure (IB) f or further information on nonclinical studies with 
sebelipase alfa.

1.4. Clinical Data with Sebelipase Alfa  
Clinical investigations  to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sebelipase alfa in 
subjects with LAL Deficiency are currently ongoing. One clinical study of sebelipase alfa in 
adults with LAL Deficiency has been completed (LAL- CL01), and 5 clinical studies of sebelipase 
alfa are ongoing in infants, children, or adults with LAL Deficiency (LAL- CL02, LAL- CL03, 
LAL-CL04, LAL-CL06, and LAL- CL08). Brief summaries can be found below for the completed 
study (LAL- CL01) and the 3 ongoing studies for which data have been report ed through the 
primary completion date (LAL- CL02 and LAL- CL03) or Week 104 of treatment (LAL- CL04). 
Refer to the IB for further information on the clinical experience with sebelipase alfa.  
1.4.1.  Completed Study LAL- CL01 
LAL-CL01, the first clinical study with sebelipase alfa, evaluated the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) of sebelipase alfa following a 4 -week regimen of once -weekly (qw) 
IV infusions of sebelipase alfa at doses of 0.35 mg·kg-1, 1 mg·kg-1, and 3 mg·kg-1 in adult 
subjects with liver dysfunction due to LAL Deficiency.  A total of 9 subjects were enrolled into 
3 sequential cohorts of 3  subjects each.  
All 3 doses of sebelipase alfa were well tolerated by the subjects in this study.  There were no 
deaths or treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), and no subject experienced an 
infusion- associated reaction (IAR) or discontinued treatment due to a treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). Most (86.4%) of the 44 reported TEAEs were considered unrelated to 
sebelipase alfa, and all but one were assessed by the Investigator as Grade 1 (86.4%) or Grade 
2 (11.4%) in severity.  One subject in the 3 mg·kg-1 dose cohort had a Grade 4 TEAE of 
hypercholesterolemia. Although the subject was asymptomatic, this laboratory abnormality met the definition of a Grade 4 event according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE) , which was used to assess severity in this study.  
All 3 doses of sebelipase alfa were biologically active, as evidenced by decreases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increases in serum lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL- C), which were observed within 2 and 4 weeks, 
respectively, and were reversible following discontinuation of sebelipase alfa therapy. Effects on  
serum lipids appeared more pronounced in the 3 mg·kg
-1 dose cohort, whereas effects on 
ALT and AST appeared to be independent of dose.  
PK data in adult subjects with LAL Deficiency indicate that sebelipase alfa has a short plasma half-life, ranging from 0.07 to 2.04 hours at the lowest dose of 0.35  mg·kg
-1 and from 0.09 to 
0.21 hours at higher doses of 1 or 3 mg·kg-1.  Sebelipase alfa area under the concentration- time 
curve (AUC) and maximum observed concentration (C max) increased proportional to dose fro m 
0.35 to 1mg·kg-1 and more than proportional to dose from 1 to 3 mg·kg-1.

1.4.2.  Ongoing Study LAL- CL04  
Study LAL- CL04 is an ongoing open- label multicenter extension study in adults with liver 
dysfunction due to LAL Deficiency who completed Study LAL- CL01 ( Balwani et al, 2013; 
Valayannopoulos et al, 2014).  This  study is designed to evaluate the long -term safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of sebelipase alfa at 2 dose levels (1 and 3 mg∙kg-1).  After completing 
all follow -up assessments for Study -LAL-CL01, subjects were eligible to initiate treatment in the 
extension study at a qw dose of sebelipase alfa equivalent to the dose administered during their 
fourth infusion in Study -LAL-CL01. After the fourth infusion under this protocol, all subjects 
receive an every -other -week (qow) dosing regimen of 1 or 3 mg∙kg-1.  Safety and efficacy 
assessments are conducted at regular intervals throughout the extension study.  In addition, 
blood samples are obtained at selected time points for analysis of sebelipase alfa PK and biomarkers of sebelipase alfa pharmacodynamic (PD) activity.  Refer to the IB for discussion of the preliminary safety and efficacy data from this study.  
1.4.3.  Ongoing Study LAL- CL02  
Study LAL- CL02 is an ongoing multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebelipase alfa in subjects ≥ 4 years of age with LAL Deficiency.  Eligible subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sebelipase alfa 
1 mg∙kg
-1 or placebo qow for 20 weeks.  Efficacy, PK and safety assessments are performed at 
regular intervals throughout the study.  After completing a 20- week double- blind treatment 
period, each subject can begin open- label treat ment with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 mg∙kg-1 
qow during an extension period.  Refer to the IB for discussion of the preliminary safety and efficacy data from this study.  
1.4.4.  Ongoing Study LAL- CL03  
Study LAL- CL03 is an ongoing multinational study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, 
PK and PD of sebelipase alfa in children who developed growth failure or other clinical evidence of a rapidly progressive course of LAL Deficiency before 6 months of age.   This is an open-
label, repeat -dose, dose-esca lation study in which subjects receive qw doses of sebelipase alfa.  
All subjects initiate treatment at a dose of 0.35 mg∙kg
-1 qw.  Dose escalation to 1 mg∙kg-1 qw 
occurs in all subjects, contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability, and a further dose escalation to 3 mg∙kg
-1 qw may be permitted for subjects who meet dose escalation criteria.  All 
subjects are evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy.  Refer to the IB for discussion of the preliminary safety and efficacy data from this study.

1.5. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
1.5.1.  Dose Rationale  
An initial dose of 1 mg·kg-1 qow will be administered to all subjects.  Dose increases to 3 mg·kg-
1 qow and then to 3 mg·kg-1 qw will be allowed based on disease progression, after a minimum 
time on the previous dose, and with approval from the Sponsor (see Section 6.1).  Doses were 
selected based on the following information:  
• Results from the first clinical study in adult subjects with LAL Deficiency (LAL- CL01) as w ell 
as ongoing study LAL- CL04 support selection of a 1 mg·kg-1 qow dose based on the 
following: 
o All 3 doses of sebelipase alfa (0.35, 1, and 3 mg·kg-1 qw) were well tolerated in adult 
subjects with LAL Deficiency treated in study LAL- CL01.  
o Sebelipase alfa AUC and C max increased proportionally to dose from 0.35 to 1 mg·kg-1 
and more than proportionally to dose from 1 to 3 mg·kg-1. 
o All 3 doses of sebelipase alfa were biologically active, as evidenced by decreases in 
ALT and AST and increases in serum lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL- C), 
which were observed within 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, and were reversible following 
discontinuation of sebelipase alfa therapy.  
• Given the requirement for chronic administration in subjects with LAL Deficiency, a qow 
dosing regimen is preferable to a qw dosing regimen. In a nonclinical model of 
LAL Deficiency, the PD  effects of 0.35  mg·kg-1 qw and 1 mg·kg-1 qw were comparable to 
those of 1  mg·kg-1 qow and 3 mg·kg-1 qow, respectively, based on a number of param eters.  
A dose of 0.2 mg·kg-1 qow was only marginally active in this nonclinical model.  
• Long- term dosing of 1  mg·kg-1 qow in adult subjects treated in LAL- CL04 study 
demonstrated sustained reduction in ALT and AST and, following an initial increase in serum lipids, sustained reduction in serum lipid.  
• Infants treated in study LAL- CL03 initially received 0.35 mg·kg
-1 qw for 2 infusions and then 
1 mg·kg-1 qw. Dose escalation to 3 mg·kg-1 qw was allowed.  All subjects treated for 
> 3 months are currently receiving ≥  3 mg·kg-1 qw and have demonstrated improved growth.  
Dosing has been generally well tolerated. 
• There is an adequate safety margin for sebelipase alfa based on nonclinical toxicology 
studies.  Refer to the IB for further discussion.

1.5.2.  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
LAL Deficiency is a rare disease, with no approved therapies, that leads to s ignificant morbidity 
and mortal ity.  Non clinical studies conducted in a relevant disease model at pharmacological 
doses and in other nonclinical species at doses substantially in excess of those proposed in this 
study, revealed no signific ant risks (see Section 1.3 and IB).  
Clinical investigations with sebelipase alfa in subjects with LAL Deficiency, including 
1 completed, and 3 ongoing clinical studies, support that sebelipase alfa is well tolerated at 
doses ranging from 0.35 mg·kg-1 to 3 mg·kg-1 qow and qw, with rapid improvements in serum 
transaminases, LDL, triglycerides, and/or HDL- C dyslipidemia and evidence of other biologic al 
effects including improved weight gain in infants (see  Section 1.4 and IB).  Thus, there is a 
reasonable basis to conclude that sebelipase alfa therapy in this study may be well tolerated 
and associated with beneficial effects on disease activity.  
In a completed study and ongoing clinical study in adult subjects with LAL Deficiency (LAL- CL01 
and LAL- CL04 respectively), sebelipase alfa therapy was associated with initial increases in 
serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL- C, likely as a result of lipid mobilization from 
intracellular lysosomal storage, followed by sustained reduction, including > 60% reduction in LDL-C at Week  52. 
In LAL- CL06, initial serum lipid levels will continue to be closely monitored by the Investigator, 
Medical Monitor, and through periodic reviews of all subject data by an independent 
Safety  Committee (SC) (see Section 7.5).  A subject with treatment -emergent persistent 
elevations in serum lipid levels of clinical concern may remain on treatment at the Investigator's 
discretion and, as medically necessary, may be managed by temporarily interrupting the infusions of study drug and/or initiating or adjusting lipid- lowering therapy.  
In addition to clinical experience with sebelipase alfa, extensive human experience exists for 
ERTs in the treatment of other LSDs  including Gaucher, Pompe, and Fabry disease.  While 
these diseases have distinct clinical manifestations and demonstrate differences in the targeting 
and biological effects of the ERT, data from these studies can inform the use of investigational products of this class, and is also relevant to the risk evaluation of sebelipase alfa.  
The most common adverse events (AEs) associated with administration of approved ERTs, 
including but not restricted to imiglucerase  (Cerezyme
®), velaglucerase alfa ( VPRIV®), 
alglucosidase alfa ( Myozyme®/Lumizyme®) and agalsidase beta ( Fabrazyme®) are IARs, which 
typically occur during or within several hours following completion of the infusion and are usually 
mild and manageable by changes in infusion rate and/or administration of antipyretics and 
antihistamines.  While severe infusion reactions (including anaphylaxis) and SAEs related to 
ERT administratio n rarely occur, these can require intensive medical intervention.  Given the 
propensity for infusion reactions with ERT administration, measures have been incorporated in this protocol to minimize risk and monitor subject safety.

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) have also been reported with approved ERTs and may be 
associated with altered response to treatment and/or increased risk of IARs.  Subjects will be 
monitored throughout the study to evaluate the development of ADAs (see Section 5.9). 
Overall, the risk -benefit assessment for sebelipase alfa is considered favorable, given the 
relatively low risk of adverse reactions with sebelipase alfa relative to the progressive and potentially life -threatening nature of untreated LAL Deficiency.

3. Study Design  
3.1. Overview of Study Design  
This open -label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebelipase alfa in a 
broad population of subjects with LAL Deficiency.  Such subjects may have been excluded from 
enrollment in other studies of LAL Deficiency because of age, disease progression, previous treatment by hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplantation, less common disease manifestations, or disease characteristics that would preclude participation in a 
placebo- controlled study.  Factors which may have rendered a subject ineligible include but are 
not limited to the following: 
• Age at symptom onset,  
• Severity of symptoms due to disease progression,  
• Previous  hematopoietic or liver transplantation, 
• Atypical or underappreciated clinical manifestation of LAL Deficiency in the absence of 
elevated ALT or early onset growth failure, including, for example, mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or impaired growth.  
The study will consist of a screening period of up to 45 days, a treatment period of up to 96 weeks, an expanded treatment period of a maximum of up to 48 weeks, and a follow -up 
phone call at least 4  weeks after the last dose of sebelipase alfa.  
All subjects will initiate treatment with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 1 mg·kg
-1 qow.  A dose 
escalation to 3 mg·kg-1 qow may be considered for a subject who exhibits significant clinical 
progres sion and meets protocol -defined criteria for dose- escalation.  A further dose increase to 
3 mg·kg-1 qw may be considered for subjects exhibiting significant clinical progression.  All dose 
escalations are contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions (see Section 6.1) and Sponsor approval.  
At any time during the study, subjects who are receiving a dose of sebelipase alfa that is not well tolerated may receive a dose reduction at the Investigator’s discretion.  If a subject cannot 
tolerate the lowest possible dose of 0.35 mg·kg
-1 qow, despite measures taken to manage any 
IARs, he/she will be discontinued from the study.  The per -protocol schedule of assessments 
will be modified for subjects who have a dose change to allow for closer monitoring of laboratory 
values around the period of change.  
Sebelipase alfa dosing is thoroughly discussed in Section 6.1. 
Each subject will receive treatment with sebelipase alfa for at least 52 weeks and up to 96 weeks in the treatment period. S ubjects who complete the 96 -week treatment period may 
continue to receive sebelipase alfa in the expanded treatment  period for an additional duration 
of up to 48 weeks  unless discontinued sooner after  sebelipase alfa is registered and available 
as a long- term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with LAL Deficiency 
in the region where the subject resides and/or is receiving treatment (in accordance with

country -specific requirements). The follow -up period will be at least 4 weeks from the last 
infusion of sebelipase alfa.  All infusions will initially be administered at the study center.  After 
Week  48 of the treatment period, home infusions may be permitted for subjects who have met 
criteria discussed in Section 6.5.2 . 
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at regular intervals throughout the study, as 
defined in the Schedule of Assessments.  Exploratory safety and efficacy assessments will be considered for subjects who exhibit specific atypical manifestations of LAL Deficiency 
(e.g.,  pulmonary function test for an individual presenting with significant pulmonary 
involvement, etc.) and will be at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the 
Sponsor.  
In addition, the pharmacokinetics of sebelipase alfa will be assessed for the pediatric population, for those with severe hepatic dysfunction (e.g., Child- Pugh Class C, 
see Appendix  A), and those who have had a previous liver or hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant.  
Effects on HRQOL will be characterized for all subjects at selected time points. Blood samples will also be collected for an additional analysis of potential disease- related biomarkers in this 
population.  
The established independent program -level safety committee appointed by the Sponsor will 
provide additional oversight of subject safety in this study through periodic and ad- hoc reviews 
of safety data.  
A follow -up phone call to assess AEs and concomitant medications will be conducted for all 
subjects at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administered under this protocol.

3.2. Rationale for Study Design  
Clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sebelipase alfa in subjects 
with LAL Deficiency.  As noted in Section 1.1.2,  LAL Deficiency presents as a clinical continuum 
and the current clinical studies are designed to accommodate differences in the presentation and rapidity of progression. 
Given the potential for variable presentation and progression of LAL Deficiency, it is important to 
expand the clinical experience by evaluating additional subjects not previously studied who are 
not eligible for ongoing clinical studies, such as subjects between 8 months and 4 years of age, 
subjects presenting with growth failure or other evidence of rapidly progressive disease that 
develops later than 6 months of age, previously transplanted subjects, subjects presenting with complications other than hepatic dysfunction, subjects with advanced liver disease or other complications that may put them at undue risk during the placebo controlled phase of a trial.  
The data from this study may provide supportive information on the activity of sebelipase alfa on 
additional less common clinical manifestations of LAL Deficiency.  
Studies in a highly relevant animal disease model of LAL Deficiency have demonstrated favorable effects on growth and survival.  A strong concordance was demonstrated between 
liver fat content (cholesterol esters and triglyceride), liver weight, and serum transaminases 
during both disease progression and in response to different doses of sebelipase alfa.  In this model, treatment with sebelipase alfa was associated with substantial improvements in liver pathology, with complete resolution of abnormalities and restoration of normal liver architecture at maximally eff ective doses ( Leavitt et al., 2011 ).  To provide supportive data of this 
concordance in humans, the current study will evaluate liver histopathology at Baseline and at Week 48 (or at the end of treatment, if earlier than Week  48) in all adult subjects, and in 
pediatric subjects where local regulations allow. In order to minimize the need for this invasive procedure, a baseline biopsy will be performed only if acceptable historical liver histopathology 
data are not available (s ee Section 5.12).  
An expanded treatment  period was included in this study to ensure continued access to 
treatment for each subject until sebelipase alfa is  registered and available in the region where 
the subject resides or  is receiving treatment.  
3.2.1.  Outcome Variable Selection  
3.2.1.1.  Safety  
The study is designed to primarily evaluate the safety of intravenous ( IV) infusions of sebelipase 
alfa. Outcome variables selected to characterize the safety profile of sebelipase alfa in subject s 
with LAL Deficiency include:  
• The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and IARs;  
• Changes from Baseline in 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology, serum chemistry [including lipid panel], urinalysis);  
• Changes in vital signs during and after infusion, relative to pre -infusion values; 
Page 31 of 98 
ALEXION PHARMACEUT ICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
• Physical examination findings;  
• Use of concomitant medications/therapies;  
• Characterization of ADAs, including ADA titer by time point, peak ADA titer, and time to peak 
ADA titer;  
• Functional and overall development in subjects ≤ 6 years of age, as determined by Denver -II 
scores.  
• Given the potential for ADAs to impact the safety profile of a biological product, the effect of ADAs on the safety of sebelipase alfa will also be explored, in particular, the relationship 
between ADA-p ositive subjects and the incidence of IARs. 
3.2.1.2.  Efficacy 
Literature review and insights from completed and ongoing clinical studies and the nonclinical disease model (see Section 1.3) suggest that a successful therapy for LAL Deficiency should 
mitigate the liver abnormalities and correct the dyslipidemia associated with the disease. 
Therefore, the study will investigate changes or percent changes over time from Baseline including the following:  
• Decrease in ALT ; 
• Decrease in AST ; 
• Decrease in LDL -C; 
• Decrease in non -HDL-C; 
• Decrease in TG; 
• Increase in HDL- C; 
• Decrease in Child- Pugh status for subjects with Child- Pugh class C or B at Baseline;  
• Decreased United Kingdom Model for End- Stage Liver Disease (UK -ELD) score;  
• Improvement in liver histopathology ; 
• Decrease in liver and spleen volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);  
• Decrease in liver fat fraction by MRI.  
Growth failure and other manifestations of impaired growth occur in subjects with LAL Deficiency.  Early growth  failure is  the predominant clinical feature of LAL Deficiency in 
infants, and a key contributor to the early mortality.  Positive effects on growth in subjects with LAL Deficiency would be supportive of a favorable effect of sebelipase alfa.  Therefore, for 
pediatri c subjects with evidence of impaired growth at Baseline, efficacy endpoints will also 
include changes over time in the following growth parameters:  
• For subjects ≤ 24 months of age, z -scores and percentile scores based on World Health 
Organization (WHO) growth charts ( WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006  
and 2007) will be determined for the following parameters:  
o Weight -for-age (WFA);  
o Weight -for-length; 
o Length- for-age; 
o Body -mass -index ( BMI)-for-age; 
o Head circumference- for-age.

ALEXION PHARMACEUT ICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:  
DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
• For subjects > 24 months of age to 18 years, z- scores and percentile scores based on 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts ( Kuczmarski et al., 2002) 
will be determined for the following parameters:  
o WFA;  
o Weight -for-stature (weight -for-height);  
o Stature -for-age (SFA);  
o BMI-for-age. 
• For all subjects < 18 years, the proportion of subjects who meet criteria for under nutrition 
(underweight, wasting, and stunting) based on WFA, weight -for-length/weight -for-stature, 
and length -for-age/SFA, respectively ( UNICEF, 2009 ), and combinations of these indicators, 
will be determined.  
Additional clinical, biochemical and hematological abnormalities will also be evaluated.  T hese 
will include the following:  
• Total and conjugated bilirubin;  
• Gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT);  
• Markers of macrophage activation, including absolute reductions in serum ferritin, seru m 
chitotriosidase and high -sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs -CRP); 
• Hemoglobin level;  
• Platelet count.  
Changes over time in additional clinically significant manifestations of LAL Deficiency in subjects 
with complications and/or an atypical clinical presentation affecting other organs, will also be 
evaluated to better understand disease progression and the potential therapeutic benefit of sebelipase alfa.  As described in Section 5.16,  additional assessments will be performed at the 
discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor to support these analyses.  
Given the potential for ADAs to alter the PD effect of sebelipase alfa, the impact of ADAs on efficacy endpoints will be explored, if sample size permits.  
Based on the effects of ERT in other diseases, significant health benefits are anticipated with sebelipase alfa treatment.  As there are currently no validated tool(s) to assess HRQOL in LAL Deficiency, and a very limited LAL Deficiency subject population to perform typical scientific 
validation per FDA guidance, HRQOL will be assessed using tools developed for other diseases. Changes from Baseline in scores for the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT- Fatigue) scale, Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), and 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) Generic Core Scales will be determined, as appropriate to the age of the subject.  Assessment of HRQOL will be restricted to subjects 
≥ 5 years of age, where validated self -reporting tools are available.  
See Section 5.18 and the Study Operation Manual (SOM) for further discussion of the HRQOL 
Assessments.

3.2.1.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Descriptive PK parameters will be reported for subjects < 18 years of age, for those defined as 
having severe hepatic  impairment, and in subjects with historical liver or bone marrow 
transplantation, as the data permit. PK parameters include clearance and volume estimates along with secondary parameters of AUC, C
max, time to maximum observed concentration 
(Tmax), and terminal elimination half -life (t1/2).  The effect of ADAs on sebelipase alfa PK will also 
be explored.

4. Study Population 
4.1. Target Population  
The target population for this study is male and female subjects with LAL Deficiency with clinical 
presentations of the disease that have not been previously studied, including subjects < 4 years of age who were not eligible for study LAL- CL03, those with severe liver disease, or a previous 
liver or hematopoietic stem cell transplant and those with an atypical or underappreciated presentation of LAL Deficiency.  
4.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 30 subjects will be treated.  At least 4 subjects between the ages of 2- 4 years will 
be treated .  
4.3. Inclusion Criteria  
A subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this study:

is iden tified, subjects may be included based on a fibroblast enzyme activity 
assay) ; OR 
b. Appropriately documented (based on consultation with the Sponsor) historical 
result of an enzyme test prior to hematopoietic or liver transplantation (performed 
in DBS , leuko cytes or fibroblasts).

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
2. Subject has known causes of active liver disease other than LAL Deficiency which have 
not been adequately treated (e.g., chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease).  
3. Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with study procedures.  
4. Subject received a hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant < 2 years from the time of dosing.  
5. Females who are nursing or pregnant.  
6. Subject with co- morbidities other than complications due to LAL Deficiency which, in the 
opinion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor, are irreversible or associated with a high mortality risk within 6 months, or would interfere with study compliance or data interpretation (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption).  
7. Exposure to any investigational product within 30 days of Screening for a small molecule 
and 60 days of Screening for a biologic.  
8. Known hypersensitivity to eggs.  
4.5. Concomitant Medications and Treatments  
Concomitant medications include prescription and over -the-counter medications, herbal 
medications, prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, vitamins, and dietary supplements. 
Concom itant treatments include diagnostic, palliative, or interventional procedures 
(e.g.,  lipid-lowering diet, surgery, physical therapy).  Information on all concomitant medications 
and treatments will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and will include the name of the medication (brand or generic) or therapy, reason for use, start date, stop date, 
dose, route of administration (if applicable), and frequency of administration.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to ascertain all concomitant medications and treatments 
received by the subject from 4 weeks prior to Screening until the subject completes the follow -up phone call at a minimum of 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administered 
under this protocol.  As applicable, information about  a subject's dose and dosing regimen of 
lipid-lowering medications will be collected for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and 
information about a subject's dose and dosing regimen of medications prescribed for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (e.g., glitazones, high- dose vitamin E, metformin, 
and UDCA) and corticosteroids will be collected for at least 16 weeks prior to Screening.  
Any changes in medications or treatments during the study will be captured in the eCRF. Subjects treated with lipid -lowering medication, UDCA, metformin, glitazones, or vitamin E at 
the time of Screening, must remain on the same dosing regimen for at least 12 weeks of treatment in the study.  If a subject’s dose of sebelipase alfa is increased during the first 12 weeks of treatment, the subject should continue to remain on the same lipid- lowering 
medication for an additional 12 weeks.  Dose adjustments or discontinuation of these medications should occur only when there is a clear medical reason and must be pre -approved 
by the Sponsor.  For example, adjustment of a subject's lipid- lowering medication will be 
permitted if deemed medically necessary to manage high serum lipid levels or in instances

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
where lipids are being adequately controlled with sebelipase alfa.  The reason for all such dose 
adjustments will be collected.  
For female subjects of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 4.3, the use of a highly 
reliable method of birth control will be confirmed at S creening.  
4.6. Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
4.6.1.  Premature Withdrawal from Study Participation  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, subjects have the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time for any reason, without prejudi ce to further treatment.  The Investigator and 
Sponsor also have the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time. Specific reasons for discontinuation may include, but are not restricted to, the following:  
• Intercurrent illness;  
• Medically signific ant AEs;  
• Pregnancy;  
• Protocol deviation or noncompliance; 
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor.  
A 48-week  expanded treatment period has been included in the LAL- CL06 protocol 
(Amendment  2.0) to ensure that each subject has continued access to treatment  until 
sebelipase alfa is registered and available in the region where the subject resides and/or is receiving treatment. Subjects receiving treatment in this expanded treatment  period will be 
discontinued from study treatment once sebelipase alfa is  regis tered and available in their 
region.  
4.6.2.  Procedures for Discontinuation  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, the subject or their parent or legal guardian will be 
asked about the presence of AEs.  The date and reason(s) for discontinuation will be recorded 
in the eCRF. The date of discontinuation will be the date that the Investigator discontinues the 
subject from the study or that the subject notifies the Investigator of the decision to discontinue.  The reason for discontinuation will be that identified by the Investigator or voluntarily reported by 
the subject.  If a subject withdraws consent and does not voluntarily provide a reason for 
discontinuation, "withdrawal of consent" will be recorded in the eCRF.  
A subject will be considered discontinued due to an AE if the subject received any infusion or partial infusion of study drug, but did not complete the study because of an AE, whether or not the AE is considered drug related.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment in the study will have an end-of-study visit prior 
to withdrawal, and a follow -up call at least 4 weeks after the last infusion, whenever feasible 
(see Appendix B for a list of the assessments to be performed at this visit).  Post -study SAE s

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
and IARs will be reported according to Section 7.4 for all subjects prematurely discontinuing 
treatment in the study.  
When a subject fails to return for scheduled assessments, efforts must be made to contact the 
subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian) to determine a reason for the failure to return.  
If 2 or more consecutive visits are missed, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor to determine whether the subject will be allowed to continue on study.  After all reasonable efforts to reach a subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian) have been exhausted, the subject 
will be identified as lost to follow up in the eCRF.  
4.7. Subject Replacement Policy  
Subjects who discontinue prior to completing the treatment period of the study (Day 0 to 
Week  96) may be replaced. Data from the discontinued subject will be included in analysis; 
however, additional subjects may be added. 
4.8. Subject Re -Screening  
Subjects will be allowed to return for re- screening.  
A subject will be re- consented if re- screening occurs outside of the 45 -day screening window. In 
this case, all screening procedures must be repeated with the exception of LAL enzyme activity 
and DNA blood sampling, MRIs, biopsies, hepatic venous pressure gradient, transient 
elastography, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). MRIs and biopsies must only be repeated if the previously obtained MRI or biopsy (either from an earlier screening visit or an acceptable historical biopsy procedure as per Section 5.12) was obtained more than 26 weeks 
prior to Screening.

5. Schedule of Assessments and Study Procedures 
The type and frequency of study assessments is outlined in the schedule of assessments in 
Appendix B.  Al l study visits wil l be schedul ed relative to W eek 0. The Investigator may also 
conduct an unscheduled visit at any time during the study at his/her discretion.  Assessments performed at an unscheduled visit will be symptom directed and will be recorded in the eCRF.  Assessments performed only for subjects of a certain age are based on the subject's age on the date that informed consent is obtained, unless otherwise indicated below.  
5.1. Informed Consent/Assent  
The subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian, if applicable) will be given a verbal 
explanation of the study, including information about the study drug and the study procedures, and will have all questions adequately addressed.  The subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian, if applicable) must sign and date a consent form that has been approved by the 
appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the 
screening procedures are initiated. All subjects (or their parents or legal guardians) will be given a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form. In addition, age- appropriate assent will 
be obtained as required from subjects who are of minor age according to local regulations.  
5.2. Subject Eligibility  
All subjects will be assessed for eligibility against the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 4.3  and Section 4.4 , and supportive clinical information collected.  
5.3. Medical H istory  
5.3.1.  Subject Medical History 
A complete medical history will be obtained for each subject at Screening, including the following:  
• Complications of liver disease (e.g., jaundice, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices including history of prior variceal bleeding, ascites, encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome) or gallstones.  
• Any prior major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or requirement 
for arterial revascularization (e.g., coronary angioplasty, stent insertion, bypass surgery or 
other vascular procedure);  
• History of allergies (e.g., food allergies, atopic dermatitis)  
• History of angina, transient ischemic episodes, intermittent claudication;  
• Other significant health complications that may represent an atypical, or underappreciated manifestation of LAL Deficiency, including, but not limited to significant history of pulmonary 
complications or lymphadenopathy.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
5.3.2.  Family Medical History  
In addition, a family medical history will be obtained, documenting the number of siblings and 
the medical status of each sibling, including the presence of abnormalities suggestive of LAL Deficiency (e.g.,  liver disease, liver cancer, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, or 
cerebrovascular accidents).  Where LAL enzyme activity or genetic testing has confirmed the presence of LAL Deficiency in additional family members, information will be collected on 
relationship, age of diagnosis, medical complications, age, and, if applicable, cause of death.  
For subjects who are ≥ 18 years of age, a history of alcohol use will also be obtained at 
Screening via the subject’s completion of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) . 
5.4. Demographic Information 
The following demographic information will be collected at Screening: date of birth, gender, 
race, and ethnicity.  
5.5. Physical Examination  
A complete, age- appropriate physical examination will be performed by the Investigator or 
qualified designee,  at the time points specified in Appendix B .  The examination will include an 
assessment of the subject’s general appearance, skin, head (including head circumference for children up to 3 years of age), eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities/joints, and neurological status. Whenever possible, the same person should perform the physical examination at each study visit. Abnormal findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Every physical examination will also include the following:  
• Child -Pugh Score (see Appendix A);  
• Abdominal photograph for subjects < 4 years of age at Screening;  
• Liver size: A clinical assessment of liver size (palpable/non palpable and centimeters below 
costal margin), regularity (smooth/nodular), and sensitivity (tender/nontender);  
• Spleen size: A clinical assessment of spleen size (palpable/nonpalpable and centimeters 
below costal margin), regularity (smooth/nodular), and sensitivity (tender/nontender);  
• Lymphadenopathy: An assessment of the size, location, and character of any palpable 
lymph nodes.  Areas to be examined include cephalic (occipital, preauricular, postauricular, submental, submandibular), cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal.  Any enlarged nodes 
will be characterized as tender or nontender; 
• Arterial disease: A clinical assessment of the right and left posterior tibialis and dorsalis 
pedis pulses and carotid bruits; 
• Skin manifestations:  A clinical assessment of signs of liver disease and portosystemic 
anastomoses such as periumbilical venous engorgement (caput medusae), spider nevia, or gynecomastia, dylipidemia such as xanthomas (tendinous, tuberous) and xanthelasma, and allergies including assessment of allergic skin rashes.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
5.6. Height and Weight  
Height and weight will be measured at the time points specified in Appendix B.  For subjects 
who are ≤18 years of age, height and weight data will be used to derive WFA and SFA.  
Z-scores and percentiles for WFA and SFA will be determined based on CDC growth charts 
(Kuczmarski et al., 2002 ).  For subjects who are > 18 years of age, age -normalized percentiles 
for height will be derived at Baseline, to provide insights into the potential impact of 
LAL Deficiency on growth. 
Refer to  the SOM for further detail on the measurement of height and weight.  
5.7. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature (obtained by a consistent method for all measurements at a giv en infusion visit) will 
be obtained at the time points specified in Appendix B .  On dosing days, vital signs will be 
recorded pre -infusion, every 30 minutes (±10 min) during the infusion and every 30 minutes 
(±10 mi n) from 0 to 2 hours after the end of the infusion. Note: The end of the infusion occurs 
before administration of the sodium chloride flush .  
Beginning at Week 24, the post- infusion period for vital sign monitoring may be shortened to 
1 hour for subjects who have completed at least 22 weeks of treatment with no occurrence of 
moderate or severe IARs and with approval from the Sponsor.  In such cases, the post -infusion 
monitoring period may need to be extended back to 2 hours if subjects begin experiencing moderate or severe IARs during or shortly after the infusions.  
Throughout the study, additional readings may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator.  
5.8. Electrocardiogram  
Age-appropriate 12- lead ECGs will be obtained at the time points specified in Appendix B .  
ECGs will be reviewed by a qualified clinician, and any abnormalities will be specified as clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  
5.9. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the time points indicated in Appendix B.  Table 1  lists the clinical laboratory tests to be performed in this study.  
Note that not all tests are performed at the same time points.  Due to the limitations on the volume of blood collection that is considered to be acceptable in young children with very small 
total circulating blood volumes, the laboratory tests will be ranked in the order corresponding to 
the study objectives, as follows:  
Page 43 of 98 
ALEXION PHARMACEUT ICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:  
DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
5.9.1.  Tier 1 Laboratory Assessments  
Tier 1 assessments include safety laboratory tests, including serum chemistry (including 
glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), liver function tests, serum lipids, hematology, coagulation panel (local), serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), ADA, DBS LAL enzyme activity, viral hepatitis screen, carbohydrate- deficient transferrin (CDT), and PK.  These tests include all 
efficacy laboratory tests. If a subject’s blood volume threshold for weight or clinical status limit 
collection of any Tier 1 laboratory assessments, the medical monitor should be consulted for 
guidance with regard to a modified schedule for that visit.  
5.9.2.  Tier 2 Laboratory Assessments  
Tier 2  assessme nts include all other laboratory tests, including exploratory biomarkers, 
macrophage activation markers, and hsCRP.  Tier 2 assessments are considered mandatory and all efforts will be made to collect these samples in all subjects as indicated in Appendix B . 
If a subject’s blood volume threshold for weight or clinical status limit collection of samples on the scheduled visit date, the Tier 2 laboratory assessments may be collected at the next scheduled visit, or when clinical status permits.  
Blood volume threshold based on subject weight is discussed further in the SOM.  
The blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction is not included in either tier of laboratory assessments, unless it is necessary to establish subject eligibility (e.g., for subjects with previous hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant without evidence of LAL enzyme 
deficiency by DBS).  For all other subjects, this sample may be collected whenever blood 
volume permits, preferably at Screening, or as soon as practically possible thereafter (see Section 5.9.7 ).  
5.9.3.  Clinical Laboratory Collection and Analysis  
Laboratory samples will be collected under the following conditions:  
• Blood samples will be drawn prior to the study drug infusion on infusion visits, and in the 
morning (whenever feasible) on noninfusion visits; 
• Subjects ≥ 18 will fast for at least 9 hours prior to collection of blood samples;  
• Subjects will refrain from ingestion of alcohol for 24 hours prior to collection of blood samples for lipid and liver panels.  
Refer to the SOM and Laboratory Manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, and storage of clinical laboratory samples.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
A central laboratory will be responsible for analysis of all laboratory tests, with the exception of 
prothrombin time (international normalized ratio), activated partial thromboplastin time, urinalysis, and urine pregnancy.  
Any identified laboratory abnormalities will be specified as CS or NCS by the Investigator or designee. In the event of unexplained clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results, the tests will be repeated as soon as possible (preferably within 24 hours of receiving the result) 
and followed up until they have returned to within the normal range and/or an adequate 
explanation has been identified. Clinically significant changes from a subject’s baseline value or 
previous values will be recorded as AEs.  
5.9.4.  Clinical Laboratory Collection for Dose Changes 
Subjects who undergo a dose modification, as described in Section 6.1, or changes in lipid-
lowering  therapies, as described in Section 4.5, will have the following additional laboratory 
monitoring schedule of selected analytes: 
• Prior to the first infusion of new dose/schedule or change in lipid- lowering me dication: serum 
lipid panel, liver panel, hematology, serum chemistry, ferritin, hs -CRP; 
o For dose  modifications only:  at the first infusion of new dose/schedule, a predose 
blood sample will be collected for ADA and serial blood samples will be collected for 
a determination of sebelipase alfa serum concentrations according to the sampling 
schedule shown in  Table 2 (pediatric subjects) or  Table 3  (adult subjects).   
• 4 weeks after starting new dose/schedule or change in lipid- lowering medication: serum lipid 
panel, liver panel;  
• 8 weeks after starting new dose/schedule or change in lipid- lowering medication: serum lipid 
panel, liver panel;  
• 12 weeks after starting new dose/schedule or change in lipid- lowering medication: serum 
lipid panel, liver panel, hematology, serum chemistry.  
In the event that any of the above additional laboratory monitoring time points coincides with the standard laboratory assessment, the standard laboratory  assessment will supersede the 
additional laboratory monitoring (see Appendix B). 
If a subject’s blood volume threshold for weight or clinical status limit collection of samples on the scheduled visit date, the Sponsor or medical monitor should be consulted for guidance with 
regard to a modified schedule for that visit.

5.9.5.  Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples (for serum isolation) will be obtained at the time points specified in Appendix B , 
where local regulations and blood volume limitations permit, for exploratory analyses to identify 
and evaluate disease- related biomarkers.  
Biomarker assays will be performed by a central laboratory or, as appropriate, by academic research laboratories with expertise in the analysis of specific biomarkers.   The intent is to 
investigate baseline disease and dynamic markers that will enable the Sponsor to better understand the pathogenesis of LAL Deficiency and related comorbidities and response to sebelipase alfa therapy.  Given the rarity of LAL Deficiency and the paucity of information on disease characteristics, the definitive list of analytes remains to be determined.  
Collection of samples for exploratory biomarker analysis will be subject to discretionary approval from each center’s IRB/IEC and the specific written consent of the subject and/or the subject’s parent or legal guardian.  This section of the protocol only applies if approval for collection of these additional samples has been granted by the IRB/IEC and consent is provided by the subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian).  
Samples will be stored by the Sponsor or designee in a secure and controlled environment until analysis, and will be destroyed by the Sponsor or designee after all worldwide obligations have been met, or sooner if required by local regulations.  
Refer to the SOM or Laboratory Manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, 
and storage of these samples.  
5.9.6.  LAL Enzyme Activity in Dried Blood Spots  
A blood sample will be spotted on filter paper at the site  for each subject and then shipped to 
the central laboratory for measurement of DBS LAL enzyme activity.  A sample will be collected 
from all subjects, irrespective of whether historical LAL activity data are available.  For subjects who have undergone liver transplantation the DBS will be performed, but it will not be used to determine study eligibility.  Samples will be collected at the time points specified in Appendix B.  
All samples will be assayed by a central laboratory to ensure consistency of LAL activity 
measurements across all subjects in the study.  Refer to the SOM and Laboratory Manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, and storage of this sample.  
5.9.7.  DNA Sample  
The Sponsor intends to analyze pharmacogenetics in the sebelipase alfa program in order to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters associated with sebelipase alfa use and LAL biology.  DNA sequences, including both the protein coding sequence and 
sequences that regulate gene transcription, messenger ribonucleic acid stability and the 
efficiency of protein translation that may be investigated include:

1. LAL (LIPA);  
Genes coding for other proteins involved in lipid biology that may contribute to and/or modify the 
disease phenotype of LAL Deficiency (e.g. ABCA1); 
2. Genes that may modify susceptibility to AEs related to sebelipase alfa . 
Where local regulations permit and subject to discretionary approval from each center's 
IRB/IEC, a  blood sample for DNA extraction will be collected from each subject at Screening, or 
as soon as practically possible thereafter, for subjects who do not require sample collection to 
establish study eligibility.  The DNA will be used as part of a later pooled analysis, which will 
include a determination of the spectrum of LAL mutations in subjects with LAL Deficiency and 
the relationship between gene mutation, safety, efficacy, and susceptibility to development of ADAs.  The Sponsor will only analyze DNA sequences within genes relevant to t he mode of 
action and response to sebelipase alfa, including variants important in understanding AEs, and 
candidate genes with a potential role in the etiology, pathogenesis, and progression of 
LAL Deficiency.  No additional testing will be performed on the samples collected in the study.  
DNA s amples will be stored by the Sponsor, or designee, in a secure, monitored, and controlled 
environment until analysis, and will be destroyed by the Sponsor after all worldwide obligations 
have been met, or sooner if required by local regulations.  
Refer to the SOM and Laboratory Manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, 
and storage of these samples.  
5.9.8.  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of sebelipase alfa serum concentrations will be collected from subjects < 18 years of age, from subjects with severely impaired liver functioning (e.g. based on imaging, biopsy or Child- Pugh Class C status at Screening), and for subjects who have 
previously undergone liver or hematopoietic stem -cell transplantation.  Sampling will be 
completed as blood volume permits (see Section  5.9) at Baseline, Week 24 and Week 48, and 
on the day of a dose modification, as applicable.  If a subject’s blood volume threshold for 
weight or clinical status limit collection of samples on the scheduled visit date, the Sponsor or medical monitor should be consulted for guidance with regard to a modified schedule.  
A sparse sampling scheme will be employed for pediatric subjects (< 18 years of age at 
informed consent) to reduce the risk of iatrogenic anemia.  As shown in Table 2, up to 4 blood 
samples will be collected at each study visit requiring a PK assessment.  These samples will be 
collected within broad time windows, rather than at discrete time points, to allow more flexibility in the management of PK sampling for these subjects and to provide opportunities for 
measurement of drug concentrations across a broader time period with limited sampling.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
A more extensive sampling scheme will be employed for adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age at 
informed consent) with severe liver disease, and those who have received a hematopoietic stem 
cell or liver transplant, in order to assess the PK profile in this population of adult subjects 
previously not evaluated in other clinical studies of sebelipase alfa.  As shown in Table 3, up to 12 blood samples will be collected from these adult subjects at each study visit requiring a PK assessment .  A majority of these samples will be collected at discrete time points.  
PK samples will not be taken from the extremity used for the study drug infusion.  PK sampling 
at time points that coincide with a vital sign measurement will be obtained before cuff  inflation 
for the blood pressure measurement, and PK samples at other time points will be obtained at 
least 5 minutes after cuff deflation.  The exact start time and stop time of each infusion and the 
exact time of collection of each sample will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Refer to the SOM and Laboratory Manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, 
and storage of these samples.

5.10.  Abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Abdominal MRI will be performed at the time points specified in Appendix B to quantify organ 
volume, and to evaluate the aorta and other intra- abdominal vessels for atherosclerosis.  All 
imaging scans will be acquired by an MRI technician or other qualified individual using 
standardized imaging protocols and will be read by a central reader, who will be blinded to time 
point of image acquisition.  
Imaging scans are required for all subjects, except those who have internal metal medical devices or other non- removable metal items that may pose a risk to subject safety (e.g., cardiac 
pacemakers, aortic or cerebral aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ferromagnetic implants, shrapnel, wire sutures, joint replacements, bone or joint pins/rods/screws/clips), and children in 
whom sedation would be required but is medically contraindicated.  In such populations, 
abdominal ultrasound will be substituted for an MRI.   
Detailed instructions on image acquisition and analysis will be provided in the Imaging Manual.

5.11.  Carotid MRI  
Carotid MRI will be performed at the time points specified in Appendix B  to quantify degree of 
stenosis in the carotid arteries.  All imaging scans will be acquired by an MRI technician or other 
qualified individual using standardized imaging protocols and will be read by a central reader, 
who will be blinded to time point of image acquisition. 
Imaging scans are required for all subjects, except those who have internal metal medical 
devices or other non- removable metal items that may pose a risk to subject safety (e.g., cardiac 
pacemakers, aortic or cerebral aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ferromagnetic implants, shrapnel, wire sutures, joint replacements, bone or joint pins/rods/screws/clips), and children in whom sedation would be required but is medically contraindicated.  
Detailed instructions on image acquisition and analysis will be provided in the Imaging Manual.  
5.12.  Liver Biopsy  
Liver biopsies will be obtained for subjects who are ≥ 18 years of age at Screening and at 
Week  48, or at the end of study treatment in the case of early withdrawal after at least 20 weeks 
of treatment.  A liver biopsy will also be obtained on an optional basis at Week 96 after subjec t 
and/or legal guardian consent (as appropriate).  
Biopsies for subjects < 18 years of age will be performed where local regulations permit.  Liver 
biopsies will be obtained at Screening and at Week 48, or at the end of study treatment in the case of early withdrawal after at least 20 weeks of treatment.  A liver biopsy will also be obtained on an optional basis at Week 96 after subject assent (as appropriate) and legal guardian consent.  
If a subject had a liver biopsy within 26 weeks prior to Screening as part of clinical standard of 
care, and this historical biopsy is deemed adequate for histological assessment of liver pathology in this study (see SOM for minimum criteria), then a biopsy procedure will not be required at Screening.  
Liver biopsy procedures  will be performed according to the local institutional practices by a 
qualified professional.  In those subjects with advanced liver disease, the biopsy must be obtained using the transjugular method, where local regulations and facilities permit, so the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) can be measured and collected during the procedure.  
All biopsies collected during this study will be evaluated centrally by pathologists who will be 
blinded to assessment time point.  Any biopsy done for other medical reasons during the course 
of the study will also be evaluated by central pathologists (stained and unstained samples). Blinded histological evaluation will  include a comparison of overall disease activity at Baseline 
and Week 48.  If applicable, comparisons will also be made with biopsies obtained at additional 
time points.  Additional histological analysis of exploratory measures of disease activity may be 
performed, if tissue volume permits.

Refer to the Histopathology Manual for further details on the collection, processing, and 
evaluation of liver biopsies.  
5.13.  Endoscopic Biopsy of Small Bowel  
For subjects with evidence of growth abnormalities or malabsorption, an endoscopic biopsy will 
be performed, unless medically contraindicated, at the time points noted in Appendix B .  
Historical biopsy results will be accepted in lieu of a Screening assessment, if the biopsy was performed within 1 year of Screening.  
If no evidence of lipid substrate accumulation confirmatory of malabsorption is present at Screening, a follow -up biopsy will not be required. However, results of any additional biopsies 
conducted during the study period should be recorded in the CRF.  
Biopsy procedures will be performed according to the local institutional practices by a qualified professional. Biopsies for subjects < 18  years of age will be performed with consent from a 
parent or legal guardian (and assent from the subject, if applicable), and where local regulations allow.  
5.14.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy  
Subjects with evidence of advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis on imaging or biopsy) will 
undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) a t the time points noted in Appendix B , to 
document the presence, size and quality of esophageal varices.  Exception to requirement is 
made for subjects for whom the procedure is medically contraindicated due to high risk of 
endoscopy -related bleeding based on presence of esophageal varices on endoscopy carried 
out within 3 months of assessment.  
EGD will be performed according to the local institutional practices by a qualified professional. EGD for subjects < 18 years of age will be performed with consent from a parent or legal 
guardian (and assent from the subject, if applicable), and where local regulations allow.  
5.15.  Transient Elastography  
Transient elastography will be performed for all subjects at the time points noted in Appendix B, 
to assess liver stiffness (measured in kPa), unless medically contraindicated.  The assessment will be performed according to the local institutional practices by a qualified professional , in 
locations where the technology is available.  
5.16.  Additional Imaging and Functional Assessments  
In the event of clinically  significant manifestations due to disease complications or an atypical 
clinical presentation of LAL Deficiency affecting other organs, additional imaging and functional assessments may be performed based on standard of care, and at the discretion of the Investigator and with Sponsor approval.  All additional imaging and functional assessments will 
be recorded in the CRF.

5.17.  Denver II Developmental Screening Test  
The Denver II will be administered to subject s ≤ 6 years of age, at the time points specified in 
Appendix B.  The Denver II is a standardized measure to assess development in children from 1 
month to 6 years of age ( Frankenberg et al., 1992).  The Denver II includes performance- based 
and parent -reported items in 4 functional areas: fine motor -adaptive, gross motor, 
personal -social, and language skills.  The test was normed on a diverse sample of children who 
were full term and had no obvious developmental disabilities; the norms indicate when 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of children passed each item.  The Denver II has good inter -rater and 
test-retest reliability (correlations ≥ 0.90 for most tests). 
The Denver II must be administered by a trained clinician and takes an average of 10 to 20 minutes to complete, and up to an hour depending on the age of the child and number of 
assessments completed.  Administration and scoring of the Denver II  is based upon the child's 
age.  Refer to the SOM for further information on administration and scoring of the Denver II.  
5.18.  Health -Related Quality of Life  
HRQOL questionnaires will be completed at the time points specified in Appendix B for subjects 
who are ≥ 5 years of age.  The specific HRQOL questionnaires completed by each subject will be based on the subject’s age on the date that informed consent is obtained as indicated in Table 4 .  Questi onnaires will be administered prior to any other study procedures being 
conducted at that visit.  
The 13 -item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue scale was 
developed to measure levels of fatigue in people living with a chronic disease. In this study, the 
FACIT -Fatigue scale version 4 will be self -administered by all subjects who are ≥ 17 years of 
age at informed consent.  
The Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) is a disease- specific instrument designed to 
assess health- related quality of life in subjects with chronic liver disease (Younossi et al., 1999).  
The CLDQ will be self -administered by all subjects who are ≥ 17 years of age at informed 
consent.  
The PedsQL™ is composed of generic core scales and disease- specific modules.  The 23- item 
PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales was designed to measure the core dimensions of health, as 
delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning in healthy 
children and those with acute or chronic health conditions.  The PedsQL ™ Generic Core Scales 
includes 4 multidimensional scales of physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning 
(5 items), social functioning (5 items) and school functioning (5 items).  In addition to the total 
scale score (all 23 items), two summary scores, the Physical Health Summary (8 items) and 
Psychosocial Health Summary (15 items), are also reported. In this study, the PedsQL™ 
4.0 Generic Core Scales will be self -administered by subjects who are 5 to < 18 years of age on 
the date of informed consent, using one of the three self -report forms (ages 5 -7, 8-12, or 13- 18), 
as appropriate to the subject’s age ( Varni et al., 2009).  Parent proxy reports will not be used in 
this study.

6. Treatments  
6.1. Treatment Administered  
All eligible subjects will receive repeat IV infusions of sebelipase alfa at an initial dose of 
1 mg·kg-1 qow. Consecutive infusions must be at least 7 days apart.  All study infusions will be 
administered by qualified medical personnel. Up to and including Week 24, study infusions are recommended to be administered over approximately 2 hours .  After Week 24, infusions may be 
administered over approximately 1 hour, as tolerated by the subject (see Section 6.5.2).  Prior to 
any infusion of sebelipase alfa, the subject will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an acute illness, including but not limited to: vomiting, fever, upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.  If an acute illness is suspected, it is recommended that the Investigator determine whether to hold the study drug dose for that visit.  In case of any questions, the Medical Monitor must be consulted.  
6.1.1.  Dose Escalation Criteria 
Dose escalation up to 3 mg·kg
-1 qw will be considered for each individual subject based on 
observed safety and tolerability and disease progression.  Dose escalation will occur at the discretion of the Investigator and with approval of the Sponsor.  An initial dose increase to 3 mg·kg
-1 qow may be considered if the subject meets dose escalation criteria (as defined 
below), after receiving at least 8 consecutive infusions at the initial dose.  A further increase in 
dose to 3  mg·kg-1 qw may be considered if a subject continues to demonstrate persistence of 
disease manifestations after receiving at least 8 consecutive infusions at a dose of 
3 mg·kg-1 qow.  
Prior to considering a dose increase, the subject will be evaluated for other potential causes of any observed clinical manifestations (e.g., initiation of a potentially hepatotoxic concomitant medication in a subject with abnormal ALT or AST, missed study infusions,  or development of 
viral or autoimmune hepatitis or other alternative etiology of liver disease or inadequate weight 
gain).  Protocol defined clinical laboratory assessments will be modified around any dose 
modification, as described in Section 5.9 . 
A subject meets dose escalation criteria  when any of the following are present:  
• ALT or AST remaining abnormal, and either not improved or worsened from Baseline after 8 consecutive infusions from Baseline or worsened from the previously achieved 
lowest value over the preceding 8  consecutive qow infusions;  
• LDL-C or triglyceride remaining abnormal, and either not improved or worsened over the 
preceding 8 consecutive qow infusions; 
• The subject is < 18 years of age at the time of assessment for dose escalation, has a WFA z -score that is 2 standard deviations below the mean that either did not improve or 
worsened during the preceding 6 months, and the subject did not miss more than 20% of 
study infusions during the preceding 6 months.  All possible etiologies for inadequate weight gain, not related to LAL Deficiency, will be ruled out by the Investigator before 
considering a dose increase.

DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
6.1.2.  Accelerated Dose Escalation Criteria  
Dose escalation may be accelerated in exceptional cases with a particularly severe clinical 
presentation or evidence of rapid or substantial clinical deterioration, including but not limited to inadequate weight gain, ongoing weight loss deemed to be related to LAL Deficiency or a symptomatic progression of liver disease.  Dose escalation will occur at the discretion of the Investigator and with approval of the Sponsor. A 3 mg·kg
-1 qow dose may be considered after at 
least 4 consecutive infusions at the initial 1 mg·kg-1 qow dose.  A further increase in dose to 
3 mg·kg-1 qw may be considered if a subject continues to demonstrate significant clinical 
progression after receiving at least 4 consecutive infusions at the 3  mg·kg-1 qow dose.  
In special cases, and only with approval from the Sponsor, it may be allowable to increase the 
dose to 3 mg·kg-1 qw, without mandating 4 infusions of qow dosing.  
Significant clinical progression of liver disease is met if the subject presents with the following 
criteria: 
• Confirmed elevation of ALT or AST to > 5 x upper limit of  normal and at least twice the 
highest pre -treatment value and presence of one of the following:  
o Increase of total bilirubin to > 3x upper limit of normal and at least twice the highest 
pre-treatment value;  
o Prolongation of prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) ≥ 4 seconds above Baseline;  
o Development or worsening of ascites;  
o Development of encephalopathy.  
6.1.3.  Dose Decreases  
Decreases in dose will be permitted and will be at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor, based upon evidence of intolerance to sebelipase alfa treatment.  Subjects who are receiving a dose of 3 mg·kg
-1 qw, 3 mg·kg-1 qow or 1 mg·kg-1 qow but cannot 
tolerate this dose may receive a dose reduction to 1 mg kg-1 qw, 1  mg kg-1 qow, or 0.35 mg·kg-1 
qow, respectively.  If a subject cannot tolerate a dose of 0.35  mg·kg-1 qow despite measures 
taken to manage any IARs, the subject will be discontinued from the study after completion of early discontinuation procedures (see Section 4.6.2).  Dose decreases may also be considered 
by the Investigator for subjects who are exhibiting evidence of clinical improvement and stability (ALT, AST and LDL), based on clinical judgment on the 3 mg·kg
-1 qw dose, for a period of at 
least 24 weeks.  In such an instance, a qow dosing schedule can be considered and must be 
discussed with the Sponsor.  
Protocol defined clinical laboratory assessments will be modified around any decrease in dose, as described in Section 5.9.

6.2. Description of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Sebelipase alfa is an rhLAL produced by recombinant DNA technology in egg white using a 
transgenic Gallus  expression system.  Study kits containing study drug will be supplied by the 
Sponsor or designee. The study drug will be delivered in a 10- mL glass vial containing 
approximately 10.5 mL (including 5% overfill) of a buffered solution of sebelipase alfa at an 
approximate concentration of 2  mg∙mL-1.  The study drug contains no preservatives and is 
designed for single use only.  Details of the nonclinical and clinical experience to date with 
sebelipase alfa, as well as stability information, can be found in the current version of the IB.  
Sodium Chloride (0.9%) for injection USP, for use in preparation of diluted solutions for infusion, will be sourced locally by the study center.  
6.3. Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Each subject will be assigned a subject number at Screening upon providing informed consent. The subject will maintain the same screening number throughout the study.  
6.4. Receipt, Storage, and Disposition of Study Drug 
6.4.1.  Receipt of Study Drug  
Upon receipt of study kits, a drug inventory will be performed and verified by the person accepting the shipment.  Designated study staff will verify and document that each shipment 
contains all items noted in the shipment inventory, and that no temperature excursions occurred 
Page 57 of 98 
ALEXION PHARMACEUT ICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:

during study drug transport.  Confirmatory documentation of shipment contents will be provided 
to the Sponsor or designee.  Any damaged or unusable vials in a shipment will also be documented. The Sponsor or designee must be notified of any damaged or unusable study 
treatments that were supplied to the Invest igational site. 
6.4.2.  Storage of Study Drug  
Vials of sebelipase alfa must be stored under controlled refrigerated conditions at 2
oC to 8oC 
(36oF to 46oF).  Vials should not be frozen and will be protected from light during storage. 
Temperature monitoring must be performed by the investigational site to ensure proper storage 
of sebelipase alfa throughout the study.  Refer to the Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) 
manual for instructions on how to handle temperature excursions.  
The infusion bag (or syringe) containing sebelipase alfa will be prepared just prior to infusion 
administration.  The prepared infusion, diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, may be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) for no more than 12 hours, although it is preferable that prepared solution be used within 4 hours of dilution. Shaking or other forms of agitation must be avoided.  
6.4.3.  Disposition of Study Drug 
The Investigator, designee (e.g., licensed pharmacist), or other appropriate person according to local regulations, will b e responsible for maintaining accurate records for all supplies used. 
Opened vials containing any residual volume may be stored at room temperature for study drug accountability .  Following study drug accountability, the Sponsor or designee will give writt en 
authorization to return or destroy the study drug as instructed.  
6.4.4.  Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
If any unused study drug material is remaining upon completion of the study, the material will be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed only after the Sponsor or designee has performed final 
drug accountability and provided written authorization for the return or destruction of study drug.  Refer to the IMP Manual for further instructions.  
6.5. Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Dose preparation and administration will be performed using sterile, nonpyrogenic disposable materials including, but not restricted to syringes, needles, transfer tubing, and stopcocks. Under no circumstances will the study drug be used other than as directed in the protocol.  
6.5.1.  Preparation of Study Drug 
The infusion bag (or syringe) containing sebelipase alfa will be prepared just prior to the start of infusion administration. Prior to preparation of the infusion, the vials of study drug will be visually 
inspected.  The solution should not be used if it contains foreign particulate matter or is discolored.  The solution may be used if a small number of visible translucent to opalescent or 
Page 58 of 98 
ALEXION PHARMACEUT ICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
white amorphous or threadlike particles are present in the vial.  The contents should NOT be 
warmed using a microwave or other heat source.  Sebelipase alfa is a protein and will be handled and mixed gently to prevent foaming. 
The subject’s most recent protocol -scheduled weight measurement, rounded to the nearest 
0.1 kg, will be used for calculating the volume of study drug to be withdrawn from the vial(s) to 
prepare the infusion.  If subject weight cannot reliably be obtained on the morning of the infusion 
because of the subject’s condition, then the last available accurate weight will be used.  
Sebelipase alfa should be diluted to a concentration of 0.1 to 1.5 mg/mL for infusion.  Refer to 
the IMP Manual for detailed instructions regarding preparation.  
6.5.2.  Administration of Study Drug  
All infusions must be administered under close supervision of the Investigator or designee. 
Study drug should not be infused with other products in the same infusion tubing, as the compatibility of sebelipase alfa in solution with other products has not been evaluated.  
It is required that all infusions of study drug be administered using in- line filtration with a low -
protein binding 0.2- or 0.22- μ filter.  Occlusion of the in -line filter may occur, which is not 
uncommon with IV infused proteins.  Studies of sebelipase alfa with several commercially available 0.2- or 0.2- μ filters have shown that the IV line occlusion is primarily attributed to the 
surface area of the filter. Since several 0.2- or 0.22- μ filters are available at both 4.5 cm
2 and 
10 cm2, it is recommended to contact the filter manufacturer to determine the surface area of the 
0.2- or 0.22 -μ filter that is being used if occlusion of the in- line filter occurs. In this situation, a 
larger surface area 0.2 - or 0.22- μ filter may be used.  
The sebelipase alfa dose and infusion rate will be as directed in the investigational protocol and IMP Manual.  
The IMP infusion will be administered at an infusion rate depending on the subject’s weight. 
Sebelipase alfa should not be administered at an infusion rate exceeding 4 mL·kg
-1·hr-1.  Refer 
to the IMP manual for detailed instructions pertaining to duration and rate of infusion.  
From Week 0 to Week 48, all infusions will be administered at the study center. After Week 48, 
home infusions may be permitted for subjects who have received the same dose and regimen for the prior 24 weeks and had no moderate -to-severe hypersensitivity reactions requiring 
medical intervention/management and no SAEs related to study drug within the prior 24 weeks, 
contingent upon Sponsor approval, local regulations, and the availability of established regional 
infrastructure and resources for home infusions.  
6.6. Blinding of Study Drug 
This is an open -label study with no requirement for blinding.

7. Assessment of Safety  
The methods for collecting safety data are described below.  All study personnel must ens ure 
they are familiar with the content of this section.  
7.1. Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities  
7.1.1.  Clinical Adverse Events 
An Adverse Event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with the administration of a study drug.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Pre -existing 
conditions that worsen in severity during the course of the study are to be reported as AEs.  All 
AEs occurring during the clinical study and related to study conduct, will be reported on the AE 
page of the eCRF, as described in Section 7.3.  The Investigator will assess the severity, 
causality (relationship to study drug), and seriousness of each AE. 
Severity : The Investigator will assess the severity of all AEs/SAEs as mild, moderate, or severe, 
based on the following definitions (developed from Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model standard terminology v3.1.1).  
• Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant. 
• Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
Causality:  AEs will b e assessed as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or related to 
study drug.  Table 5 provides general guidance on the assessment of causality.  For data 
reporting purposes, AEs assessed as not related or unlikely related will be reported as unrelated to study drug, and AEs assessed as possibly related or related will be reported as related to study drug.  Assessment of causality will be based on the Investigator’s medical judgment and the observed symptoms associated with the event.

Table 5 Assessment of Causality  
Relationship  to Study Drug  Criteria for Judgment  
Related  Reasonable temporal relationship of the clinical event 
to study drug administration AND cannot be 
reasonably  explained by other factors (such as the 
subject’s clinical state, concomitant therapy, and/or 
other interventions).  
Possibly Related  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study 
drug administration makes causal relationship 
possible but not unlikely AND other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Unlikely Related  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study 
drug administration makes causal relat ionship unlikely 
but not impossible AND other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
plausible explanation for the observed event.  
Not Related  Data are available to clearly identify an alternative 
cause for the reaction  
Seriousness:  AEs will be classified as serious or nonserious according to the definitions 
provided below.  
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is or leads to any of the following:  
• Death;  
• Immediately life threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or  prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for an SAE will be regarded as nonserious AEs.  Given the severity and life threatening nature of LAL Deficiency in infants, it is plausible that 
some pediatric subjects will be hospitalized during the first several weeks on study.  
Continuation of this initial hospitalization for participation in the trial is not considered an SAE.  Also, a hospitalization to accommodate a study procedure is not considered an SAE. However, during the hospitalization, AEs will be collected and assessed for seriousness and reported 
appropriately.  All SAEs and IARs must be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 7.4.

7.1.2.  Laboratory Test Abnormality  
Laboratory test results will be recorded in the eCRF, or electronically produced laboratory 
reports will be submitted directly from the central laboratory.  Out- of-range laboratory test values 
should not be reported on the AE page of the eCRF unless the Investigator considers the test result to be a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline value or  previous values.  
7.1.3.  Medical Events of Interest: Infusion -Associated Reactions  
Infusion- associated reactions will be considered AEs of special interest.  Any AE that occurs 
during the infusion or within 4 hours after the infusion is completed and is assessed by the 
Investigator as at least possibly related to study drug will be designated as an IAR. In addition, if 
at any time during the study, the Investigator observes symptoms that he/she considers to be 
consistent with an IAR or hypersensitivity reaction related to the administration of study drug, the symptoms should be recorded as an AE(s) and designated as an IAR(s).  Individual AE terms should be recorded rather than ‘IAR’ or ‘infusion- associated reaction’.  
As with any ERT, medications and equipment for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions must be available for immediate use in case of unexpected severe hypersensitivity reactions.  These supplies include, but are not limited to, oxygen, antipyretics, antihistamines (e.g.,  diphenhydramine, parenteral and oral), corticosteroids, epinephrine, beta- adrenergic 
inhaler, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices.  
For similar biological products, most acute IARs occur within 2 hours of the infusion.  Signs of a possible acute IAR may include: hyperemia, flushing, fever and/or chills, nausea, pruritus, urticaria, gastro -intestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping), cardiopulmonary 
reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypotension, or hypertension . 
Table 6 includes dose modifications required for all IARs and general guidance for the diagnosis 
and management of IARs in accordance with the institution’s standard of care.  The Investigator should use clinical judgement in the management of IARs in individual subjects participating in this study.  In the case of a severe life -threatening reaction, current medical standards for 
emergency treatment are to be followed.

Table 6 Management of Infusion- Associated Reactions 
Mild Reaction  
Common  
• Hyperemia 
• Flushing  
• Lightheadedness  
• Nausea 
• Mild chest discomfort (tightness)  
Less  Common  
• Fever and/or shivering 
• Palpitations  
• Headache 
• Irritability (especially in young children) • Slow infusion rate by 50%  
• Give anti -pyretic and/or anti -histamine  
• Decrease infusion rate by a further 25% if 
symptoms persist  
• If the event resolves, the infusion should continue at a reduced rate for a minimum of 30 minutes before the infusion is 
increased to 75% of original r ate. If the 
subject tolerates the infusion at 75% of the original rate for at least 30 minutes the 
original rate may be restored for the remainder of the infusion.  
• If reaction persists despite rate reduction stop infusion 
• Pre-treat with antihistamine and 
antipyretic prior (approximately 1.5h) to 
the next infusion 
o e.g., diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg po) 
and acetaminophen (15 mg/kg po)  
Moderate Reaction  
• Hyperemia (flushing)  
• Chest discomfort  
• Itching and/or raised urticarial rash  
• Severe headache 
• Gastro-intestinal symptoms, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, abdominal cramping. • Stop infusion  
• Give antihistamine IV and consider IV or 
oral steroids  
• Consider giving a beta- adrenergic inhaler 
treatment, if appropriate  
• If the event resolves, the infusion may continue at a reduced rate of 50% of the original for a minimum of 30 minutes 
before the infusion is increased to 75% of 
the original rate. If the subject tolerates 
the infusion at 75% of the original rate for 
at least 30 minutes the original rate may be rest ored for the remainder of the 
infusion.  
• If reaction persists despite rate reduction 
stop infusion 
• Pre-treat with antihistamine and 
antipyretic prior to next infusion 
• Collect serum sample for tryptase 1- 3 
hours after the IAR onset and another serum s ample for tryptase and anti -drug 
antibody (ADA) during the next study visit 
(> 4 days after the IAR) prior to the 
infusion.  
• Consider skin testing

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
Severe Reaction  
• Clinically significant cardiovascular effects: 
e.g., hypertension or hypotension defined 
as a decline approaching 20- 30% of their 
preinfusion value without alternative 
etiology, agitation, pain, fluid overload, 
dehydration 
• Respiratory symptoms: Significant shortness of breath, stridor, wheezing, 
laryngeal oedema, swelling of tongue.

• Give epinephrine (adrenaline)  
• Give antihistamines IV and steroids IV  
• Consider giving a beta -adrenergic inhaler  
treatment, if appropriate  
• Collect serum sample for tryptase 1 -3 
hours after the IAR onset and another 
serum sample for tryptase and ADA 
during the next study visit (> 4 days after 
the IAR) prior to the infusion.  
• Consider skin testing  
• Dosing of the subject will be suspended 
until the Safety Committee has completed 
the review of the IAR and any other 
relevant safety data (Section 7.5)  
• In the event subject is approved by Safety Committee for resumption of dosing:  
o Pre-treat with antihistamine and 
antipyretic prior to next infusion 
o Slowly up -titrate the infusion rate 
during the subsequent infusion: e.g. if previous rate was 50 mL/hr, begin at 
0.25 x previous rate (12.5 mL/hr) x 
15min, then increase to 0.5 x rate (25 
mL/hr) x 15 min, then increase t o 0.75 
x rate (37.5 mL/hr) x 15 min, then 
increase to full rate (50 mL/hr) for the 
remainder of the infusion.  
7.2. Handling of Safety Parameters  
7.2.1.  Serious Adverse Events and Moderate or Severe Infusion -Associated Reactions 
(Immediately Reportable to Sponsor)  
All SAEs and IARs (serious and nonserious), must be reported to the Sponsor or designee 
immediately and no later than 24 hours after the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event.  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is defined as the period from signature of 
the informed consent to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  Adverse events occurring 
after signing the informed consent but prior to the first dose of study medication will only be 
recorded if assessed as related to protocol procedures or requirements.  For this study, the 
study treatment follow -up is defined as a minimum of 4 weeks following the last administration 
of study treatment.  If a subject experiences an SAE that is considered to be related to study 
treatment at any time after the study, it must be reported to the Sponsor.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
7.2.2.  Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
During the study, all AEs and SAEs will be followed up until they have returned to baseline 
status or stabilized or until the Investigator and Sponsor or designee agree that follow up is no longer necessary.  If a clear explanation is established, it should be documented.  
Treatment of AEs is at the discretion of the Investigator and should follow the standards of medical care at the Investigator's institution.  
Follow -up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values  
In the event of unexplained clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, the tests will be repeated until they have returned to baseline values and/or an adequate explanation of t he 
abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is established, it should be documented.  
7.2.3.  Pregnancy 
Although sebelipase alfa is a recombinant form of a normal human enzyme and may therefore have a lower reproductive risk potential than other medications, formal testing has not been 
completed.  Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must therefore agree to use a 
highly effective and approved contraceptive method for the duration of the study and until 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administered under this protocol.  Regular pregnancy 
tests will be performed for female subjects of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 5.9 . 
The Investigator must immediately be informed if a subject or partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant during the study.  A subject who has become pregnant during the study must 
not receive further study drug infusions.  Pregnancies occurring up to 4 weeks after the completion of the last infusion must also be reported to the Investigator.  The Investigator must 
report all pregnancies to the Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than 24 hours after 
the first knowledge of the pregnancy.  The Investigator should counsel the subject discussing 
the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  
7.3. Recording of Adverse Events  
At each scheduled contact with the subject (or the subject’s parent or legal guardian) the 
Investigator must seek information on AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by 
examination.  Information on all AEs must be recorded in the source document, and in the eCRF. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures  results should 
be recorded under one diagnosis. 
AEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent until completion of the last 
scheduled visit, i.e., the follow -up visit.  Adverse events occurring after signing the informed 
consent but  prior to the first dose of study medication will only be recorded if assessed as 
related to protocol procedures or requirements.

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
Any AEs remaining unresolved after completion of the last scheduled visit should be recorded 
as ongoing.  Ongoing AEs/SAEs should continue to be followed up for the period specified in Section 7.2.2 but without further recording in the eCRF.  However, follow -up information on 
SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee as described in Section 7.4.  Any SAE that 
occurs after the study period and is considered to be related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
Any AE that occurs within 24 hours of the infusion will be recorded by time and date. Adverse 
events occurring 24 hours after the infusion will be recorded by date only.  The date and time, or 
the date when the AE started and stopped, as well as the intensity, seriousness, action t aken 
with regard to the study treatment, causality assessment and outcome of the event will be recorded for each AE.  
7.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Infusion- Associated Reactions and 
Unanticipated Problems   
Investigators and the Sponsor must conform t o the AE reporting timelines, formats and 
requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible (§13 GCP -V; Detailed 
guidance on the collection, verification and presentation of adverse event/reaction reports 
arising from clinical trials on medicinal products for human use [‘ CT-3’]; US Code of Federal 
Regulations Title 21, §312.32, Investigational New Drug [IND] safety reporting) . 
The Sponsor or designee will report all reportable events to all regulatory authorities , IECs or 
IRBs, and Investig ators as required by local regulations.  
Periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be done by the Sponsor according to national and local regulations.  
7.4.1.  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Sponsor  
Any SAE and I AR or unanticipated problem must  be reported to the Sponsor or designee, and 
other appropriate person according to local regulations, immediately and no later than 24 hours 
after the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event.  To report such events, an SAE or IAR form must be completed  by the Investigator and sent within 24 hours.  The Investigator will keep a 
copy of this SAE or IAR form on file at the study site.  
The Investigator must promptly provide further information on the SAE, IAR, or the unanticipated problem.  This will include a copy of the completed SAE or IAR form, and any other information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant new information on ongoing SAEs or IARs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than 24 hours o f the Investigator’s knowledge.

7.4.2.  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the IRB/IEC  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the 
IRB/IEC per their institutional policy by the Investigator, Sponsor, or designee according to 
country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file.  
7.4.3.  Sponsor Reporting: Notifying Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or designee is required to report certain study events in an expedited manner to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency’s  EudraVigilance Clinical Trial Module and to all 
country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted.  The following describes the safety reporting requirements by timeline for reporting and associated type of event:  
Immediately and within 7 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow -up information must be reported in the 
following 8 days.  
Immediately and within 15 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life  threatening, and there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study drug  and the reaction;  
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity;  
• Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the IMP that 
may affect the safety of the trial subjects.  
• Follow -up information must be reported within 15 calendar days.

The Sponsor will comply with all additional safety requirements as applicable. Periodic safety 
reporting to regulatory authorities will be done by the Sponsor or designee according to national and local regulations.  
7.4.4.  Sponsor Reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee to immediately notify all participating Investigators of any suspected AE associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and 
unexpected, as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk 
for human subjects.  
7.5. Independent Safety Committee  
Primary oversight for subject s afety will be the responsibility of the Investigators and Sponsor. 
Additional oversight of subject safety will be provided by an independent SC comprised of individuals with pertinent medical expertise who will serve in advisory capacity to the Sponsor to ensure that clinical trial participants are not exposed to unreasonable or unnecessary risks.  
Collectively, the SC members will have methodological and clinical expertise relevant to the study design and population.  SC membership is expected to last for t he duration of the study. 
Core members of the SC will not participate in the trial as Investigators or subinvestigators, as members of any team otherwise participating in the trial, or in any other capacity that may compromise their privileged activities on the SC.  Neither members of the SC nor their immediate families will have a direct financial interest in the Sponsor or an interest that is 
dependent on the outcome of the trial.  To be considered for SC membership, all candidates 
must disclose all actual or potential conflicts of interest, including any financial interests in or research activity on a competing product.  SC members will be compensated at an appropriate market rate for time spent reviewing, discussing, and attending the meetings.  The Sponsor will also reimburse SC members for any out -of-pocket travel expenses required for attendance at 
the meetings.  Aside from the above, SC members will receive no additional compensation for their membership on the committee.  
The SC will perform periodic  reviews of aggregated safety data for study LAL- CL06 on an at 
least biannual basis (i.e., approximately every 6 months) from the date of enrollment of the first 
subject until completion of dosing for all subjects in the study.  
The SC will also perform ad hoc reviews of safety data on an as needed basis in the event of emerging safety signals of clinical concern in 1 or more subjects, including potential safety risks such as a severe IAR with clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory or other effec ts. 
Following each periodic and ad- hoc review of safety data, the SC will indicate whether dosing of 
sebelipase alfa may continue for all subjects or a subset of subjects in the study.  The composition and activities of the SC will be outlined in the SC Charter.

8. Statistical Plan  
8.1. General Considerations  
No formal inferential statistical testing will be performed.  P- values and 95% confidence 
intervals, where presented, will be considered descriptive and will be provided to facilitate 
clinical review and inter pretation.  
All data collected in this study will be provided in subject data listings sorted by subject number; the dose of sebelipase alfa temporally associated with the data will be included on the listing.  
Summary tables and/or graphs will be presented  for each endpoint, as appropriate to the data, 
by evaluation time point.  Unless otherwise noted, the following standard conventions will be 
used for  creating descriptive summaries . 
• Continuous numeric endpoints will be summarized by providing the number o f subjects with 
nonmissing data, the mean and standard deviation of the data, and the minimum, first quartile , median, third quartile , and maximum value;  
• For categorical endpoints, the number and percentage of subjects with each possible 
outcome will be  displayed.  The denominator for percentages will include subjects with 
missing data.  
8.2. Determination of Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study; the projected enrollment is 
based on feasibility. It is expected that approximately 30 subjects will be treated.  
8.3. Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 infusion of sebelipase alfa. Other analysis sets may be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
8.4. Demographics and Baseline Ch aracteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics, including results of DNA and LAL enzyme activity testing, will be listed for each subject and tabulated overall, according to the methods in Section 8.1.  Chronological age will be reported in years to one decimal (i.e., xx.x  years).  
8.5. Subject Accountability  
Subject accountability will be presented in a listing, and will include age, gender, date of 
consent, date and dose of first infusion of study drug, date and dose of last infusion of study 
drug, date of completion or premature discontinuation from the study, and reason for discontinuation if the subject discontinues prematurely.  Data from all subjects who are treated in the study will be included in the summary of subject accountability.  The frequency and

percentage of subjects who are treated in the study, completed the study, and discontinued 
from the study, along with reasons for discontinuation, will be summarized.  
8.6. Study Treatment Usage and Compliance  
Number of weeks in the study and number of study infusions received will be summarized 
overall and; any changes in dose will be described in listings, and may also be provided in tabular summaries.  Other data summaries describing sebelipase alfa usage and compliance may be created, as applicable, and will be outlined in the SAP. 
8.7. Safety Analyses  
Safety will be examined for the Full Analysis Set overall and, as subject numbers permit, stratified by dose, by ADA status, and for other subgroups of interest.  
8.7.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. All AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be listed; separate listings will also be provided for subjects who die while on study and who discontinue the study due to an AE.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing any AE, any related AE, any SAE, 
any related SAE, and any IAR and, deaths and any other discontinuations due to an AE will be 
tabulated.  
Frequency of treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be tabulated by preferred term 
within the system organ class.  Frequencies will also be presented by the classifications of 
severity and causality.  In addition, frequency of AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be presented for time 
periods spanning the entire course of treatment with sebelipase alfa: up to 24 weeks after the 
first dose, > 24 to 48 weeks, > 48  to 72 weeks, > 72 to 96 weeks.  As appropriate, additional 
listings, summary tables, and graphics will be generated to evaluate IAR frequency and severity 
over time. The incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation will be summarized.  
8.7.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Observed measurements and changes from Baseline to each study time point in clinical laboratory data will be summarized.  Clinically significant abnormal values will be indicated in 
the listings of laboratory data, and frequencies of abnormal values relative to the laboratory 
normal range and clinically significant abnormal values will be summarized, if sufficient data are available for analysis.  
Immunogenicity data will be summarized, including the number and percentage of subjects who 
become ADA- positive, time to peak titer, ADA titer by time point, and median and peak ADA 
titer.  Other exploratory analyses of the effect of ADAs on the safety of sebelipase alfa may also 
be performed as suggested by the type and amount of data available.

8.7.3.  Other Safety Data  
Observed measurements and changes from Baseline to each study time point in vital signs, 
physical examination finding s, ECG parameters, and Denver II assessment will be summarized. 
Abnormal findings/values will also be listed and summarized.  
Concomitant medication/treatment data will be coded using the WHO -Drug Dictionary.  All data 
will be listed, and the number and percentages of subjects receiving each concomitant 
medication/treatment will be tabulated. 
8.8. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy will be examined for the Full Analysis Set and, as subject numbers permit, stratified by 
dose, by ADA status, and for other subgroups of interest.  
Efficacy of sebelipase alfa is expected to be reflected through changes in liver and spleen fat content and organ volume, clinical laboratory data and, where applicable, growth parameters.  Evaluation of change in parameters will be made from key assessment time points to the pre-dosing baseline and, as appropriate, to dose -specific baseline assessments (i.e., the 
assessments taken just prior to escalation to a higher dose level).  Additional comparisons of 
change between sequential assessment time points may also be made.  
8.8.1.  Abdominal Magnetic Resonance 
Change and percent change in liver and spleen volume and fat content will be calculated from Baseline and tabulated for each evaluation time point by multiples of normal (and including 
percent change from  Baseline).  Data will be summarized for the endpoints as continuous 
variables.  Spaghetti plots of change in measurements over time (1 line per subject) may also be created for selected endpoints of interest.  
8.8.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Change and percent change in serum live biochemical parameters, serum lipids, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count will be calculated from Baseline and tabulated for each evaluation time 
point.  Data will be summarized for the endpoints as continuous variables and, for selected 
endpoints (e.g.,  transaminases), relative to the laboratory normal range or recognized clinically 
significant abnormal values indicative of disease (e.g., presence of hepato- or splenomegaly). 
Spaghetti plots of change in measurements over time (1 line per subject) may also be created for selected endpoints of interest.  The UK -ELD assessment, which is computed from clinical 
laboratory values, will be summarized similarly to laboratory data, although these scores will not be compared against standard laboratory reference ranges for individual laboratory assessments.

are available) will be evaluated for subjects < 18 years of age. Weig ht-for-length/weight -for-
stature and BMI, if computed, will be derived from data on weight and length/stature. Anthropometric parameters will be plotted on standard growth curves.  Z- scores and percentiles 
based on the age -gender standardized norms will be calculated in accordance with the 
methodology described by the WHO (subjects ≤ 24 months) or CDC (subjects > 24 months to 18 years) and using the growth charts relevant to the respective methodology.  When possible, 
historical data on growth parameters will also be incorporated into the analyses.  The primary means for describing effects of sebelipase alfa on anthropometric parameters will be graphical 
displays; tables may be generated in support of the graphs.  In addition, the percentages of 
subjects who meet criteria for under nutrition (underweight, stunting, and wasting) will be 
tabulated at each time point.  
8.8.4.  Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Evaluation of the relationship between non- invasive measurements of liver fat content and liver 
histopathology may also be conducted.  Exploratory analyses of the effect of ADAs on the efficacy of sebelipase alfa may be performed as suggested by the type and amount of data available.  In addition to the pre- specified exploratory summary tabulations, other tabulations 
demonstrating the effects of sebelipase alfa on clinical manifestations of LAL Deficiency, 
including those not previously well characterized in the literature, may be prepared as appropriate to the type and amount of data. Details of these data presentations will be described in the SAP.  
8.9. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
8.9.1.  Pharmacokinetic Set  
The Pharmacokinetic Set (PK Set) will be comprised of subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
sebelipase alfa, and have sufficient data for analyses of the PK profile following at least 
1 infusion.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses will be performed for the PK Set.  Sebelipase alfa serum 
concentration data will be incorporated into a population PK model, which is to be reported separately, and will not part of the reporting of this study .  
8.9.2.  PK Analysis in Select Adult Subjects (Age ≥18 Years at Informed Consent)  
PK parameters will be derived using standard noncompartmental methods.  The actual sampling times will be used in the calculations.  The following PK parameters will be derived where possible:  
• C
max; 
• T max;  
• Area under the serum concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the last measurable 
time point;

LAL-CL06 Protocol Amendment 2.0   07 December 2015  
• Area under the serum concentration vs. time curve from time zero to infinity;  
• t 1/2; 
• Serum clearance;  
• Apparent volume of distribution.  
Pre-dose values falling below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to zero as 
appropriate. Any value below the LLOQ of the assay before the time to maximum concentration 
will be assumed to be zero.  Serum levels below LLOQ appearing in terminal samples will be 
omitted from the analysis.  PK parameters will be summarized by dose and dosing regimen. 
8.9.3.  PK Analysis in Pediatric Subjects (Age <18 Years at Informed Consent)  
Serum concentrations of sebelipase alfa will be summarized in a descriptive manner.  Scatter 
plots may be used and where appropriate concentrations may be summarised by collection interval, in addition to dose and dosing regimen.  
8.10.  
Health -Related Quality of Life  
For the subset of subjects ≥ 5 years of age, change in HRQOL measures will be calculated from Baseline and tabulated for each evaluation time point as an exploratory analysis. In addition to the evaluation of changes in the overall scores for each HRQOL measure, changes in 
subscales and summary scores, as applicable to the HRQOL instrument, will be summarized.  
For the PedsQL
™, in addition to the Generic Core Scale, the 4 subscales (physical functioning, 
emotional functioning, social functioning, and school  functioning) may also be summarized.   
8.11.  Subgroup Analyses  
Effect of ADAs will be examined for efficacy and safety endpoints.  As subject numbers permit, 
analyses may be conducted in other subgroups of interest (e.g., subjects who undergo major 
changes in diet and/or use of lipid- lowering medications).  
8.12.  Missing or Invalid Data  
All data will be analyzed as they were collected in the database.  Missing data in general will not 
be imputed; any imputation techniques if deemed necessary will be discussed in the cl inical 
study report.  
8.13.  Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis  is planned. Analyses are descriptive and no adjustments will be 
made for multiple comparisons.

8.14.  Extension Analyses  
At the completion of the study, analyses will also be performed on cumulative data from the 
treatment period and expanded treatment period . Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using 
techniques similar to those described for the analyses of data in the treatment period. Safety 
endpoints, as well as PK and HRQOL endpoints, will also continue to be analyzed in the 
extension analyses.  
Further details of the extension analyses will be provided in the SAP.

P Pre-infusion  
1 Historical DNA will be assessed only f or subjects with previous liver transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, when no enzyme deficiency was documented prior to 
transplant.  In a highly suggestive case of LAL Deficiency, where only 1 mutation is identified, subjects may be included bas ed on a fibroblast enzyme test.  
2 All physical examinations will include assessment of liver and spleen size, lymphadenopathy, arterial disease, and skin manif estations of liver disease or dyslipidemia. Physical 
examination findings should drive additional  functional assessments.  
3 Abdominal ultra -sound can be substituted if an abdominal MRI is medically contraindicated.  
4 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy will be performed at Screening and Week 48 for subjects with evidence of advanced liver disease, unless medic ally contraindicated 
(Section  5.14).  
5 A historical endoscopic biopsy result will be accepted in lieu of a Screening biopsy if performed within 1 year of Screening.  A follow -up biopsy will be performed only at 
Week 24, if evidence of substrate accumulation was present at Screening. Repeat biopsy during the study are not required, however any biopsy performed will be recorded 
in the CRF.  
6 A historical liver biopsy obtained within 26  weeks prior to Screening and a dequate for histological examination may be used in lieu of a Screening biopsy. The liver biopsy 
should be obtained via the transjugular method in those subjects with advanced liver disease, where local regulations and fac ilities permit, so the hepatic ven ous pressure 
gradient can be measured and collected during the procedure. Any biopsy done for other medical reasons during the course of the study will also be evaluated by central 
pathologists (stained and unstained samples). Subjects who have any prior liver biopsy unstained sections will be analyzed in the same method, if available. Liver biopsy at 
Week 48 can be ± 2 weeks, for scheduling considerations.  
7 Transient elastography will be performed in locales where technology is available.  
8 Refer to  Section 5.9  for a list of analytes in each laboratory panel. Subjects ≥  18 years of age must fast for at least 9 hours prior to collection of samples for the lipid panel and 
fasting serum glucose, and must abstain from alcohol for at least 24 hours prior to collectio n of blood for the liver and lipid panels. Prior to any dose change, serum lipid, 
serum liver, hematology, chemistry, ferritin and hs -CRP shall be obtained; ADA and PK assessments will be obtained on the day of any study drug dose chang, as described in 
Section 5.9.4.  Serum lipid and serum liver assessments should be taken 4, 8, and 12 weeks following any study drug or lipid drug dose chan ge.  
9 A sample will be obtained at Screening, or as soon as practically po ssible thereafter ( Section 5.9.3)  
10 For female subjects of childbearing potential only. Serum pregnancy test is required at screening. Urine pregnancy tests at all designated visits thereafter.  
11 PK Samples will be taken at Baseline, Week 24, Week 48, and on the first day of any dose modification  as per  Table 2  and Table 3 . 
12 Vital signs will be measured at one time point during Screening. On the day of study drug dosing, vitals will be collected before dosing, every 30 minutes (±10 min) during the 
infusion, and every 30 minutes ( ±10 min) from 0 to 2 hours after infusion. Beginning at Week 24, the post- infusion period for vital sign monitoring may be shortened from

Sponsor.  
13 Please refer to  Secti on 6.1 for details on treatment administration. Please refer to the IMP manual for detailed instructions on duration and rate of inf usions. After Week 24, 
infusion time may be decreased to 1 hour. If the infusio n is not well tolerated; the infusion rate may be decreased ( Section 6.5.2) . If dose is increased to weekly infusion, the 
allowable window for treatment is ±2 days, and infusions must be at least 5 days apart.  
14 Subjects should also be queried about any changes in lipid-lowering medications or lipid -lowering diets, UDCA, metformin, glitazones, or vitamin E.

Physical exam findings should drive any additional functional assessments.  
3 For subjects <2 years of age, weight, recumbent length or height, and abdominal circumference will be measured at all visits; mid- upper arm circumference will be 
measured. Head circumference will be measured in children up to 3 years of age.  
4  Abdominal MRI should be considered in subjects receiving general anesthesia and/or sedation for other procedures at the indicated time points. There should be at least 
3 months between each MRI. Ultrasound may be substituted at a given time point if an MRI is contraindicated.  
5 Liver biopsies will be obtained in subjects <18 years of age. An historical liver biopsy obtained within 26  weeks prior to Screening and adequate for histological examination

1 All physical examinations will include  assessment of liver and spleen size, lymphadenopathy, arterial disease, and skin manifestations of hepatic disease or dyslipi demia. 
Physical exam findings should drive any additional functional assessments.  
2 For subjects <2 years of age, weight, recumben t length or height, and abdominal circumference will be measured at all visits; mid- upper arm circumference will be 
measured. Head circumference will be measured in children up to 3 years of age. 
3  Abdominal MRI should be considered in subjects receiving general anesthesia and/or sedation for other procedures at the indicated time points. There should be at least 
3 months between each MRI. Ultrasound may be substituted at a given time point if an MRI is contraindicated.  
4 Liver biopsies will be obtained in  subjects <18 years of age. The liver biopsy should be obtained via the transjugular method in those subjects with advanced li ver disease, 
where local regulations and facilities permit, so the hepatic venous pressure gradient can be measured and collected during the procedure. Any biopsy done for other 
medical reasons during the course of the study will also be evaluated by central pathologists (stained and unstained samples) . Subjects who have any prior liver biopsy 
unstained sections will be analyzed in t he same method, if available. A liver biopsy at Week 96 is optional.  
5 Any endoscopic biopsy performed during the study will be recorded in the CRF.  
6 Transient elastography will be performed in locales where technology is available.  
7 Denver II assessments will com pleted for subjects who are ≤6 years old during the screening period.at the time of Informed Consent.  
8 Age- appropriate health- related quality of life questionnaires will be completed prior to any other study procedures.  
9 Refer to  Table 1  for a list of analytes in each laboratory panel. Subjects will refrain from ingestion of alcohol for 24 hours prior to collection of blood samples for lipid and 
liver panels. Labs will be drawn as blood volume and clinical status allow. See laboratory manual or SOM for details. Prior to any dose change, serum lipid, serum liver, 
hematology, chemistry, ferritin and hs -CRP shall be obtained ; ADA and PK assessments will be obtained on the day of any study drug dose change, as described in 
Section  5.9.4.  Serum lipid and serum liver assessments should be taken 4, 8, and 12 Weeks following any study -drug or lipid drug dose change.  
10 For female subjects of childbearing potential only. Serum pregnancy test is required at Screening. Urine pregnancy tests at all designated visits thereafter.  
11 On the day of study drug dosing, vitals will be collected pre- dose, every 30 minutes (±10 min) during the infusion, and every 30 minutes (±10 min) from 0 to  2 hours after 
infusion. Beginning at Week 24, the post infusion period for vital sign monitoring may be shortened from 2 hours to 1 hour fo r subjects who have completed at least 
22 weeks of treatment with no occurrence of moderate or severe IARs, continge nt upon approval from the Sponsor.  
12 Please refer to IMP manual for detailed instructions on duration and rate of infusions. After Week 24, infusion time may be decreased to 1 hour. If the infusion is not well tolerated; the infusion rate may be decreased  (Section 6.5.2) . If dose is increased to weekly infusion, the allowable window for treatment is ±2 days, and infusions must be at 
least 5 days apart.  
13 Subjects/parents should also be queried about any changes in lipid -lowering medications or lipid -lowering diets, UDCA, metformin, glitazones, or vitamin E.

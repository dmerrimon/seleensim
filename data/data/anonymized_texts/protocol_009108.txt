 2 Abstract  
 
Background:  
 
Post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathy and bleeding represents one of the largest areas of 
blood product transfusion in surgical practices today. Abnormal bleeding after cardiopulmonary 
bypass has been shown to be present in about 11% patients.1 Current literature shows lower 
transfusion rate and blood loss  in patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) 
when compared to fresh frozen plasma ( FFP) after cardiac surgery .2  
 
Specific Aim:  
 
Determine best practice in management of postcardiopulmonary by pass coagulopathy and 
bleeding. Our aim is to compare administration of PCC ( Kcentra ) to FFP for patients with post 
bypass factor mediated coagulopathy and clinically significant  microvascular bleeding . Primary 
endpoints for the study will be allogenic blood product transfusion rate and 24 hour 
postoperative blood loss.  
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
 Patients receiving PCC (Kcentra) will have same or decreased allogenic blood product 
transfusion rate and blood loss after cardiac surgery compared to patients receiving fresh frozen 
plasma.  
 
Significance:  
 
This will be the first prospective randomized controlled clinical trial  directly comparing  PCC to 
FFP for post cardiopulmonary bypass microvascular bleeding and factor -mediated coagulopathy.  
 
 
 3 1. Background and Significance:  
 
Post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathy and bleeding represents one of the largest areas of 
blood product transfusion in surgical practices today. Abnormal bleeding necessitating blood 
product transfusion occurs in about 11% of cardiac surgical patients.1 Bleeding after 
cardiopulmonary bypass is multifactorial and related  largely  to blood exposure to bypass circuit 
components . Consequential coagulation aberrations include  thrombocytopenia, platelet 
dysfunction , clotting factor consumption  and dilution , hyper -fibrinolysis, and 
hypofibrinogenemia .3 Surgical field and byp ass circuit b lood which is processed through cell 
salvage processing  and then transfused to the patient  is devoid of remaining coagulation 
factors.4,5  Standardiz ed transfusion algorithms  for patients with post -cardiopulmonary  bypass  
bleeding  are not utilized across all healthcare institutions; however, algorithm based transfusion 
is standard practice at our institution .1 Currently, patients with factor mediated coagulopathy and 
bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass at our institution receive transfusion of fresh frozen 
plasma.1 Factor concentrations within FFP are variable, and  large volumes of transfused product 
are often necessary to correct factor deficiencies . In addition FFP transfusion carries the risk of 
transfusion related lung injury , transfusion related circulatory overload , infectious and allergic 
complications  among others.6  
 
Prothr ombin complex concentrate  use in hemophiliac patients dates back several decades, and 
has recently  become  the treatment of choice for  management of bleeding in patien ts taking 
vitamin K antagonists  (warfarin) .7-9 Current formulations of inactivated PCC available in the 
United States include Bebulin (Baxter) which contains factors 2, 9, 10, and Kcentra (CSL 
Behring) which contains factors 2, 7, 9, 10. PCC administration in the perioperative setting 
including post-cardiopulmonary bypass coagulopathy and bleeding is common  in Europe an 
countries . Studies evaluating the efficacy of PCC’s in this patient population have demonstrated 
faster normalization of INR, lower blood los s, and lower transfusion requirements .2,10,11 
Historically, PCC use in the perioperative setting has been  limited due to fear of thrombotic 
complications. Newer formulations of PCC’s include a variety of anti -coagulants such as 
heparin, protein C & S, and anti -thrombin 3. Such additives are felt to re duce thrombotic risk 
when compared to PCC formulations void of these additives.12 Thromboembolic events remain a 
concern when using any procoagulant including PCC’s , especially formulations with activated 
factors such as FEIBA (Baxter), which contains activated factor 7 . Inactivated PCC  use has not 
been directly linked to  significant ly higher rates of  adverse outcomes or thrombotic 
complications  when compared to conventional therapies  in surgical patients .2,10,13 Large 
prospective randomized trials comparing PCC and FFP in cardiac surgical patients to assess 
clinical outcomes  and safety  have not been performed. Distinct a dvantages to PCC 
administration  compared with FFP  include higher factor concentration despite significantly less 
infusate volume, ambient storage with rapid reconstitution, unnecessary blood group 
compatibilit y, lower risk of transfusion  related complications such as  acute lung injury  and 
infection , along with  potential cost savings .14 Current transfusion practices in European countries 
involve use of inactivated PCC in lieu of FFP.  
 
The significance of this study is related to the potential for reduction in allogenic transfusion 
requirements  and hence associated transfusion  related complications. Transfusion reduction 
would also lead to institutional cost savings which in busy cardiac  surgical practices could be 
 4 substantial. In addition, massive bleeding after cardiac surgery is associated with higher rates of 
reoperation, morbidity, and mortality.3 Current practice per our institution al transfusion 
algorithm is to use fresh frozen plasma as first line therapy for factor mediated coagulopathy and 
bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass.  
 
Large prospective randomized studies directly comparing PCC to FFP in the setting of factor -
mediated bleeding after cardiac surgery have not been conducted.  
We hypothesize that PCC  use will show a reduction in allogenic transfusion requirements  in 
cardiac surgical patients with factor mediated postcardiopulmonary bypass bleeding.  
 
2. Specific Aims:   
 
Our aim is to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing elective 
cardiac surgery. We plan to preoperatively consent and enroll sufficient patients to reach a goal 
of 200 randomized patients ( 100 patients per arm) that demonst rate clinically significant 
microvascular bleeding and factor mediated coagulopathy after cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Randomized patients with clinically significant factor mediated bleeding will receive transfusion 
of PCC  (Kcentra)  (100 patients) or fresh fro zen plasma ( 100 patients). Factor mediated 
coagulopathy will be defined per our current transfusion algorithm as PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 
sec. Primary o utcome measures for efficacy will be total units of allogenic blood product 
transfused, and 24 hour postop erative blood loss. Outcome measure for safety will be rate of 
serious adverse outcomes.  Analysis of coagulation factor levels will also be conducted prior to 
cardiopulmonary bypass, post cardiopulmonary bypass, and after product administration (PCC or 
FFP). 
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
 PCC  arm will have same or decreased allogenic blood product transfusion rate  and blood loss 
after cardiac surgery compared to patients receiving fresh frozen plasma.  
 
3. Research Design and Methods:  
 
A. Study Overview  
 
All patients enrolled in the study  will have a  perioperative anesthetic care plan standardized as 
much as possible conforming to the current institutional  protocol utilized for  intraoperative  
medication a dministration. Patients will be anticoagulated according  to institutional practice with 
heparin 400 units/kg with goal ACT > 400 prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. After 
cardiopulmonary bypass, patients will receive protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given 
with target ACT within 10% of baselin e value. If ACT >10% baseline additional protamine will 
be given at the anesthesiologists discretion. Evaluation and determination of excessive 
microvascular bleeding in the surgical field will occur 10 minutes after return of ACT to within 
10% of baseline . Determination for treatment with PCC or FFP will be based off of the current 
algorithm used at our institution.1  Specifically this study will focus on patients with a PT >16.6 
sec/ INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > 57 sec with clinical evidence of excessive microvascular bleeding 
 5 in the surgical field as determined by the surgical team. All other coagulopathies will be treated 
as per the current institutional transfusion protocol.  
 
 
B. Study Population  
 
Consecutive adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at  St. Marys Hospital will be potentially 
eligible for the study.   All of the cardiac surgeons at Mayo Clinic Rochester will be asked to 
participate in the study.  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
All subjects eligible for enrollment must:  
 
1. Be ≥ 18 years of age

1. Are unable to grant informed consent or comply with study procedure  
2. History of hypercoagulable condition (e.g. Factor V Leiden, AT -3 deficiency, 
Prothrombin gene mutation, Anti -phospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.) or previous 
unprovoked thromboembolic complications  
3. Coagulopathic cond itions such as factor deficiencies, factor inhibitors, heparin induced

adherence to the study protocol  
 6 Enrolled subjects must meet additional criteria in order to receive study treatment:  
Inclusion Criteria  
 
1. Have evidence of excessive microvascular bleeding in the surgical field as determined by 
the surgical team  
2. PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > 57 sec. on initial post cardiopulmonary bypass 
labs  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Fibrinogen < 144 mg/dL on initial post cardiopulmonary bypass labs  
 
 C. Enrollment  
 
Subjects wi ll be enrolled at the time of pre -operative visit with cardiothoracic surgery if they 
meet the eligibility criteria. Informed written consent will be obtained and randomization 
performed to one of the two study arms.  
 
We estimate approximately 1000 subject s will be need to consented with intent of having 100 
patients receive treatment (50 patients in each treatment arm). This study will terminate once 50 
patients in each study arm have received treatment. Our data and safety monitoring board 
(DSMB) will pro vide oversight and monitoring to the study to ensure the safety of participants 
and validity and intensity of data. The DSMB will consist of 2 physicians and a statistician not 
affiliated with study. They will review data from the study and  meet at the 50% and 75% 
enrollment milestones or every 6 months from previous meeting date  whichever comes first . The 
DSMB will provide aggregated data summaries to the Mayo IRB with explanations of 
seriousness and relatedness of adverse events to the study.  In addition  to the above, the authors 
will inform the National Institute of Health (NIH) of any actions taken by the IRB as a result of 
its continuing review.  
 
The primary adverse event of concern in this study would be thromboembolic events.  DSMB 
(anesthesiologist, hematologist, and statistician) will meet quarterly, and review all data from 
each study arm. Thromboembolic complications will be reviewed and clinical judgment will 
used to determine necessity of study termination. No formal stopping rules are feasible g iven the 
study size and low incidence of TEE.  
   
 
Early termination of the study will ensue if adverse events in either study arm exceed acceptable 
level.  
 
D. Randomization  and Blinding  
 
Upon consent for study participation enrolled patients will be randomized  via computer -
generated blocks and with stratification according to the surgical procedure to either receive PCC 
or FFP during cardiac surgery should they develop excessive microvascular bleeding in the 
 7 surgical field as determined by the surgica l team in addition to a PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec 
after cardiopulmonary bypass.  The randomization assignments will be concealed in opaque 
envelopes  and disclosed to the anesthesiologist caring for the patient . The surgical and intensive 
care personnel wil l not be blinded to the treatment arm, as transparency of transfusion product is 
necessary to prevent overdosage of PCC and potential thrombotic complications.  
 
E. Interventions  
 
Patients will be consented and enrolled in the study until 50 patients have received treatment in 
each arm of the study.  Patients will be anticoagulated according to institutional practice with 
heparin 400 units/kg with goal ACT > 400 prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. After 
cardiopulmonary bypass, patient s will receive protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given 
with target ACT within 10% of baseline value.  After protamine administration the ACT, CBC, 
PT/ INR, and f ibrinogen , will be collected via preexisting arterial access.  If ACT >10% baseline 
addit ional protamine will be given at the anesthesiologists discretion. Evaluation and 
determination of excessive microvascular bleeding in the surgical field will occur 10 minutes 
after return of ACT to within 10% of baseline.  Patients with clinical evidence o f excessive 
microvascular bleeding in the surgical field as determined by the surgical team, along with a PT 
>16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec will receive randomized treatment with either PCC or FFP.   
 
 
PCC (Kcentra) Dosage:  Patients randomized to the PCC arm with evidence of microvascular 
bleeding and PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec will have Kcentra 15 units/kg prepared from pharmacy.  
 
Patients who have received PCC  and continue to demonstrate microvascular bleeding 10 
minutes after  the full PCC  dose has been administered  will undergo repeat laboratory evaluation 
of PT/INR +/ - CBC, and fibrinogen depending on previous lab results and p roduct 
administration other than  PCC. Therapy will ensue following our institutions current transfusion 
algorithm . Patients who receive d full dose PCC and continue to have microvascular bleeding in 
addition to a PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec will receive FFP  at a dose of 10 -15 mL/kg rounded up 
to the nearest unit.   
 
FFP dosage : Patients randomized to the FFP arm will co ntinue with standard therapy per our 
institutional algorithm at a dose of 10 -15 mL/kg  rounded up to the nearest unit . Patients who 
have received  FFP by randomization per the above dosage protocol and continue to demonstrate 
microvascular bleeding 10 minutes after product administration will undergo repeat laboratory 
evaluation of PT/INR +/ - CBC, APTT, and fibrinogen depending on previous lab results a nd 
product administration other than  FFP.   Therapy will ensue following our institutions current 
transfusion algorithm. Patients who receive FFP per randomization and continue to have 
microvascular bleeding  10 minutes after product administration in additi on to a PT >16.6 sec/ 
INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > 57 sec will receive additional FFP.  
 
 8 Transfusion of coagulation products other than PCC or FFP  (e.g. platelets and cryoprecipitate)  
will be determined by laboratory abnormalities requiring treatment within our institutions current 
algorithm in the presence of excessive microvascular bleeding.  
 
Resolution of microvascular bleeding  within the surgical field as determined by the surgical team  
is the endpoint for necessitation of transfusion , not normal ization of coagulation testing. 
Examples of this are as follows:  
1. A patient with an INR of 1.9 and  evidence of microvascular bleeding who receives either 
PCC or FFP, for which the microvascular bl eeding resolves but the INR remains elevated 
at 1.7 would not receive additional transfusion.  
2. In the absence of laboratory deviations, continued bleeding is most commonly secondary 
to surgically related issues. The extremely rare instance that bleeding pe rsists despite 
normalization of laboratory indices and there is no identifiable surgical cause for bleeding 
(thus presumed to be continued microvascular bleeding), the decision to transfuse blood 
component products, PCC, or potentially salvage therapy with  activated PCC will be left 
to the discretion of the anesthesiologist and surgeon caring for the particular patient.  
 
 
Red blood cell transfusion (PRBC) threshold will be a hemoglobin concentration of 8g/dL  (Hct 
24%) for patients enrolled in this study, as this threshold was not inferior to a threshold of 10 
g/dL (Hct 30%) in the TRACS trial.15  PRBC transfusion threshold deviations from this  
recommendation  may occur at the discretion of the anesthesiologist  caring for the patient  in rare 
instances  (e.g. severe surgical bleeding ). Transfusion of PRBC in intensive care setting will also 
target a hemoglobin transfusion thresh old of > 8 g/dL.  Resolution of micr ovascular bleeding is 
the endpoint for necessitation of transfusion , not normal ization of coagulation testing.  
 
Thrombin generation testing  
A blood sample will be collected to analyze thrombin generation  prior to cardiopulmonary 
bypass, post -cardiopulmona ry bypass after protamine administration, after transfusion of product 
(either FFP or PCC), 24 hours postoperative, 3 days postoperative, and 5 days postoperative or 
day of discharge  . This sample will be collected in conjunction with other standard labora tory 
tests. Thrombin generation testing is not performed at Mayo Clinic. These samples will be stored 
at -20 degrees Celsius and sent batched to a specialized laboratory for testing. All samples will 
be deidentified and contain no PHI. Study participants w ill not be charged for this testing. No 
genetic analysis or testing other than AT -3 and Thrombin generation testing will occur with these 
samples.  
 
Antithrombin III Level  
AT-3 levels will be drawn at time periods that mirror thrombin generation testing below:  prior to 
cardiopulmonary bypass , post-cardiopulmonary bypass after protamine administration, after 
 9 transfusion of product (either FFP or PCC), 24 hours postoperative, 3 days postoperative, and  5 
days postoperative or day of discharge  . Pati ents will not be charged for this testing. AT -3 levels 
will be collected in the same sample tube as Thrombin generation testing and shipped to a 
facility capable of performing such testing. All samples will be deidentified and contain no PHI. 
No genetic an alysis or testing other than AT -3 and Thrombin generation testing will occur with 
these samples.  
 
Coagulation Factor Levels  
A blood sample will be collected to analyze coagulation factors 1 -12 and protein C & S levels 
prior  to cardiopulmonary bypass, post -cardiopulmonary bypass after protamine administration, 
and after transfusion of product (either FFP  or PCC). This blood sample will be collected 
through an arterial catheter which is routinely placed as standard practice fo r cardiovascular 
operations. The collected coagulation factor level results will not be available to alter treatment 
in either study arm. Analysis of coagulation factor levels will focus on  changes in factor levels 
resultant  of cardiopulmonary bypass , and changes in factor levels resultant of product 
administration (either FFP or PCC).  Study participants will not be charged for coagulation factor 
laboratory analysis.   These samples will be batch shipped to CSL Behring’s central laboratory in 
Germany for tes ting.  All samples will de-identified and contain no PHI ( Protected Health 
Information) .  No genetic analysis or testing other than the factor levels will occur on these 
samples.  
 
 
Current intraoperative transfusion algorithm  
 

 11 patients will be at a nasopharyngeal temperature of >36°C prior to discontinuation of CPB.  
Anticoagulation will be reversed with protamine  as previously described . The patient will be 
transported intubated on a mo nitored cart to the cardiac surgical ICU.   
 
 
   
Postoperative ICU transfusion  
Current postoperative  ICU transfusion  requirements will follow the institutional  algorithm  (see 
ICU transfusion algorithm  below ). Deviation from the protocol in rare circumstances is left to 
the discretion of the ICU consultant and Surgeon. Transfusion of PRBC in intensive care setting 
will aim for a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of > 8 g/dL.   
 
 

 13    Respiratory rate ≤ 25/min  
 
Discharge from the intensive care unit and hospital criteria  
Current conventional discharge from the intensive care unit criteria and hospital will be used.  
 
ICU di scharge time will be recorded and  traditionally assumes following criteria:  
Alert and cooperative  
No inotropic support  
No hemodynamically unstable  dysrhythmia  
Adequate respiratory status  
Minimal chest tube drainage  
Urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/hr  
 
Discharge fr om the hospital will be recorded and traditionally assumes following criteria:  
Hemodynamically stable  
Stable cardiac rhythm  
Noninfected incisions  
Afebrile  
Ability to void and bowel movements  
Independent ambulation and feeding.

1. The concern for thromboembolic complications is certainly 
present, and will be monitored closely as an adverse event in both 
treatment arms. The presence of clinically significant 
thromboembolic complications will be diagnosed as per current 
clinical practice in this patient population. It is assumed that 
clinical symptomatology or suspicion to such diagnoses will 
trigger diagnostic testing when deemed appropriate, and any 
confirmed diagnoses of thromboembolic complications will be 
noted. No s pecific screening tests will occur in patients enrolled 
for this study.

H. Outcomes  
 
All suspected outcome events will be evaluated in a standardized way by an adjudication panel 
that will be unaware of the patients’ assignments.  
 15  
In the study, outcome measures for efficacy will be total allogenic blood products transfused and 
24 hour pos toperative blood loss .  Outcome measure for safety w ill be rate of serious adverse 
events.  
 
Length of stay in the ICU and hospital will also be recorded in both groups.  
 
  
 
I.  Follow -Up 
 
A telephonic assessment will be made by a study nurse at 30 days  + 7 days .  A standardized 
phone survey will be used to obtain information for assessing events of interest (Attached 
below).    
 
J. Statistics/Power  Analysis  
 
Power Analysis was determined from a study by Arnekian et al  that retrospectively presented a 
reduction in blood loss in patients receiving PCC over those receiving FFP .2 In that study, the 
distribution of 24 -hr chest tube drainage was highly skewed, but the observed difference between 
the two groups was at least 0.65 standard deviation units.  Using a non -parametric test, a sample -
size of N=50 per group should provide statistical power of >85% to detect a difference of 
this magnitude. Therefore we suggest a sample -size of at least 50 per group . In the paper, 
they also found a dramatic difference in ICU red cell transfusions. If the true difference is as 
large as they observed a sample -size of N=50 per group would also provide adequate statistical 
power for this endpoint.2 
 
Primary endpoints in this study will be units of allogenic blood product administration, and 24 
hour postoperative b lood loss.  Exploratory endpoints will include rate of serious adverse 
outcomes.  
 
Baseline patient characteristics, including demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory 
values, and cardiovascular variables will be reported and com pared across treatment groups. 
Categorical variables will be reported as counts and percentages, and compared across groups 
using chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests.  Continuous variables will be reported a s median and 
interquartile ranges, and compared across groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.   
 
 
K. Feasibility and Time Frame  
 
This study with the combined collaboration of divisions of anesthesiology and cardiovascular 
surgery is quite feasible. Approxim ately 2200 -2500  cardiopulmonary  bypass procedures are 
done annually  at St. Mary’s Hospital.  Making the conservative estimate that 50% will consent 
1000 patients should be consented within 1 year. Given that approximately 11% of patients 
 16 receive transfusio n; this would result in approximately 100-110 patients to be treated within 12 
months . We expect to get IRB approval within the next one month.  The study and data 
collection will take about 1 year with approximately two months for data analysis.  
 
L. Strengths and Limitations  
 
Strengths: This will be the first prospective randomized controlled trial in the United States 
directly assessing the effect of PCC compared to FFP in the setting of  postcardiac surgery 
coagulopathy and bleeding in patients under going elective cardiac surgery.  
 
Limitations: If the study demonstrates lower transfusion requirements and blood loss in the PCC 
arm, further studies will need to address optimal dosing requirements. Current PCC dosing is 
based on INR and weight fo r patien ts on warfarin therapy. Should no difference be  found 
between groups, or lower transfusion rate and/or postsurgical blood loss is found in the FFP arm, 
the question as to whether this represents a superior result of FFP or underdosing of the PCC arm 
will r emain.  
 
 
M. Anticipated Results  
 
a. PCC administration will reduce the amount of allogenic blood product transfused and 
amount of postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  
 
b. Adverse event rate will be similar between the 2 treatment  arms , representing the 
known risk associated with cardiovascular surgery . 
 
c. Perioperative transfusion related costs will be similar or lower in patients receiving 
PCC compared with FFP  
 
N. Estimated Co sts 
 
Kcentra will be supplied and funded by CSL Behring (Melbourne, Australia). FFP if 
administered will be covered by the patient/payer as this treatment is the current practice  
standard. All laboratory testing not routine to this patient population will be funded by CSL 
Behring and is outline within the budget.  
 
O.  Research Materials  
  
All data forms will be stored in individual patients study fo lders and handled securely for patient 
confidentiality. This data will be entered into an access database that is password protected.  
 
P.  Human Subjects  
 
We will obtain informed consent from all participants prior to initiation of the study.  Informed 
consent will meet the requirements of  the code of federal regulations 21CFR 50.25 (elements of 
informed consent) and the IRB of this center.  During informed consent for the study cardiac 
 17 surgical patients will be told that the chance of needing a transfusion in the perioperative period 
is around 11%. Should they meet criteria by our current transfusion algorithm to receive FFP, 
they would have been randomized to receive either FFP or the study PCC infusion.  A copy of the 
consent form will be placed in the patient’s medical records. The study will be stopped when 50 
patients have received treatment in each study arm. Efficacy will be defined as either a 
statistically significant reduction in transfusion of allogenic blood products or 24 hour 
postoperative blood loss .  Safety will be defined as similar rate of serious adverse outcomes in 
the PCC study drug arm to the standard therapy FFP arm .   
 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.   
 
 
Q.  Institutional IRB training Narrative  
 
The institution has established a formal program entitled the Mayo Investigator Training 
Program or MITP.  The MITP is  a web based educational course designed to provide all 
personnel involved in human subject research with training about human subject protection.  All 
Mayo p ersonnel engaged in human subject research are required to complete the course.  The 
primary objectives of the course are to provide the historical framework for current human 
subject protection regulations and to explore the evolving issues related to hum an subject 
research.   The course is divided into four sections:  
 
• Course introduction and general overview  
• History section which explores examples of unethical behavior in human subject research  
• Review of major human subject protection issues  
• Discussion of the various roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in human subject 
research  
• At the conclusion of the instruction, individuals are required to complete a thirty -question 
assessment.  
 
 
R.  Confidentiality  
 
Every effort will be made  to ensure strict patient confidentiality.  Research records are stored 
securely and are separate from hospital records.  No patient identifier will be used in any 
publication resulting from this study.  
 
S.  Recruitment  
 
Volunteers will be recruited by stu dy personnel during their pr eoperative medical evaluation. 
The investigators will review the purpose, the procedures risks and discomforts, benefits 
alternatives, costs, participation and termination, treatment for research related injury and 
confidentiali ty issues of the study in person with all potential volunteers.  Before participation, 
all volunteers are given adequate time to read the consent form before written informed consent 
is obtained.  The original consent form is placed in the subject’s study file.  A copy is provided 
to the participant and sent to HIM scanning to include in the electronic medical record . 
 
T.  Gender/Minority Mix  
 
 18 We expect an equal distribution of male and female study participants. The study population will 
comprise patients mainly from Olmsted County, MN and a few referred patients from throughout 
the country. We expect the racial/ethnic characteristics of the group to reflect the communities in 
Olmsted County, MN and are anticipated to be 95% white, 3% Asian and 2% other min orities. 
No efforts will be made to alter these characteristics, as there are no data that suggest differences 
in outcomes that we are studying in different genders or ethnic groups.

2 STUDY DESCRIPTION
2.1 Study Design
CA209923 is a Phase 1b, randomized, doubl e-blind, multi-center study to evaluate the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, pharmacokinet ics, and pharmacodynamics of a  s ingle dose of nivolumab in 
participants wi th severe sepsis or septic shock.
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 2.1 -1.

7Single dose
nivolumab    
960 mg (n=15)
The total duration of study for each participant is approximately 100 days, comprised of a 
screening period of up to 10 days, plus a single dose on Day 1, followed by clinical study 
assessments up to Day  90.  AEs and SAEs will be collected up to Day  90.
Physical examinat ions, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardi ograms (ECG), and clinical 
safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed at selected times throughout the study . 
Parti cipants will be closely monitored for adverse events throughout the study. Serial blood 
samples for PK, RO, PD, bi omarker, and immunogenicit y analyses will be collected predose and 
at selected time points postdose. Up to approximately 452mL of blood will  be drawn from each 
participant during the study  (within any7 day interval, no more than 180 mL may be drawn) .
Clinical parameters of organ dysfunct ion will be assessed predose and at selected time points 
postdose during participants’ index hospitalizat ion. 
2.2 Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be randomized to receive either single dose nivolumab 480mg orsingle dose 
nivolumab 960m gaccording to a randomizat ion scheme generated by an Interactive Response 
Techno logy (IRT). Before the study  is initiated, each user will receive log in informat ion and 
directions on how to access the IRT.
During the screening visit, the invest igative site will contact the Interactive Response Techno logy 
(IRT) system to assign the participant ident ification number. Once it is determined that the 
participan t meets the eligibilit y criteria fo llowing the screening visit, the invest igative site will call 
the IRT to randomize the participant into the open dose panel. 
2.3 Blinding and Unblinding
Blinding of treatm ent assi gnment is critical to the integri ty of this c linical study . However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge o f the 
investigat ional product is critical to the participant's management, the blind for that participant 
may be broken by the invest igator. The participant’s safet y takes priority over any other 
considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatm ent, the invest igator should 
determine that the unblin ded informat ion is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the participant's 
immediate m anagement. In many  cases, parti cularly  when the emergency  is clearly not rel ated to 
the investigational product, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant 
is receiving act ive product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Moni tor, but the investigator always has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblind. The Principal Invest igato r should only call in for emergency unblinding 
AFTER the decisio n to di scont inue the participant has been made.
For thi s study , the method of unblindin g for em ergency purposes i s IRT.

8In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact the Medical Moni tor and ens ure every  attem pt is made 
to preserve the blind.
Any request to unblind a participant for non-emergency  purposes shoul d be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.
In case of an em ergency, the investi gator(s) has unrestri cted access to randomizat ion informat ion
via the Interactive Response Technol ogy (IRT) and is capable of breaking the blind through the 
IRT sy stem  without pri or approval  from sponsor. Foll owing the unblinding the Investi gator shall 
notify the medical monitor and/or study  director. For informat ion on how to unblind in an 
emergency, consult the IRT manual.
Study  parti cipants and all clinical  research si te personnel , except the pharm acist, will  be blinded.
The pharm acist at the site and/or designee will be unblinded to the randomized treatm ent 
assig nments in order to dispense treatment fro m bulk supplies, as needed. 
Members of BMS Research and Devel opment and their designees will be unblinded to study 
treatm ents to f acilitate real -time analyses of PK, RO, and safety  data in support of dose sel ection
for future studies. No unblinded data will be communicated to Invest igators or to other blinded 
clinical research site personnel. This unblinding is not expected to affect the integri ty of the trial. 
PK and RO endpo ints are objective assessments that shou ld not be affected by unblinding, and 
BMS personnel will not communicate any trial results to the site to avoid any introductio n of bias 
in safet y assessments .
2.4 Protocol Amendments
This Statist ical Analysis Pl an (SAP) incorporates the Protocol Amendments be low.
Document Date of Issue Summary of Change
Revised Protocol 01 03-Mar -2017 Incorpo rates Amendment 01
Amendment 01 03-Mar -2017 The number of participants in the study was clarified as 
being “up to approximately 30” to reflect the fact that 30 
participants is the maximum number planned. A key 
objective of this study is to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab in participants with 
sepsis, with the goal to obtain a PK profile from at least 6 
subjects per dose level.
The body weight e ligibility criteria was revised to (1) 
remove the word “ideal,” which was inadvertently included 
in the original protocol, and (2) align the upper limit of 
body weight with that studied in the nivolumab oncology 
development program. 
In the original protoc ol, members of BMS Research and 
Development are blinded; in the amended protocol, they 
will be unblinded to study treatment in order to facilitate 
real-time analyses of PK, RO, and safety data in support of 
dose selection for future studies. The unblinded data and 
the corresponding analysis/report will be included in 
documents for communication with regulatory authorities.

7.7.5 Immune -Mediated Adverse Events
In order to further characterize AEs of special clinical interest , ananalysis of immune -mediated 
AEs (IMAE s) will be conducted. Immune -mediated AEs are specific events (or groups of PTs 
describing specific events) that include pneumo nitis, diarrhea/colit is, hepati tis, nephrit is/renal 
dysfunct ion, rash, endocrine (adrenal insufficiency, hy pothy roidism/thyroi ditis, hyperthy roidism, 
diabetes mellitus, and hypophysit is), and other specific events, considered potenti al immune -
mediated events by invest igator , that meet the definit ion summarized below: 
those occurring within 90 days of the dose, 
regardl ess of causalit y,
treated with immune -modulat ing medicat ion (of note, endocrine Adverse events such as 
adrenal insufficiency, hypothy roidism/thyroi ditis, hyperthy roidism , diabetes mellitus, and 
hypophysit is are considered IMAEs regardl ess of immune -modulating medicat ion use, since 
endocrine drug reactions are often managed without immune -modulat ing medication).
For the m ost recent immune -onco logy studi es, the data collection for IMAE was m odified to al so 
collect data on invest igator assessment of potential IMAE including evidence of immune mediated 
etiology. For these studies, an additional criteria accounting for immune mediated etiology or 
immune mediated compone nt is also to be considered:
with no clear alternate etio logy based on invest igator assessment, or with an immune -mediated 
component 
The list of MedDRA preferred terms used to ident ify Immune -Mediated adverse events is revisited 
quarterly  and updated accordingly. The preferred terms used for the selection at the time of the 
database lock by categories will be provided.
IMAEs will be summarized by treatment group for each immune mediated category / PT using the 
90-day safet y window:
Overall summary  of AEs (subjects withgrade 1-
5 AEs) presented by immune mediate 
Category / PT. This summary includes all AEs that are qualified for IMAE preferred terms list, 
without requirement of either usage of immune modulat ing medicat ions or accounting for 
immune media ted eti ology or immune mediated component.

7.7.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
7.7.6.1 Laboratory Abnormalities
Laboratory  abnormalit ies are determined fro m laboratory  measurements analyzed at the central or 
local laboratory .
Three ty pes of  laboratory  summaries are produced by  treatm entand total for on-treatm ent period : 
Worst grade of laboratory  value on treatment (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3 -4), 
Treatment emergent abnormalit ies(not em ergent, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3 -4),
Change fro m baseline to worst grade on treatm ent(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and not reported, for baseline 
and on -study ). 
Worst grade of  emergent laboratory  abnorm alities are summarized by treatm ent and total for on-
treatm ent period .Treatment emergent abnormalit ies are abnormalit ies that worsened relative to 
baseline (including missing baseline). The “not emergent ”category in this tabl e is for subjects 
whose l aboratory  grades di d not increase from baseline. 
Laboratory  abnormalities are further summarized by baseline toxicity grade:  “0,” “1-2, “3-4” or 
“Not reported” versus worst on -study  grade “0,” “1 -2,”“3 -4” or “Not Reported .”  These analyses 
are done by  treatment.
Commo nly co llected laboratory tests with CTCAE grades m ay include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
Hem atology: hemoglo bin, Hematocri t, WBC count with different ial to calculate absolute 
lymphocy te count , platelets;CD4+, CD8+ T -Cell Count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio

Duration of organ support
1)Rules to calculate vasopressor use
Following vasopressors are recorded
a)Dopamine
b)Epinephrine
c)Norepinephrine (Levophed)
d)Vasopressin
e)Phenylephrine (NeoSynephrine)
Dobutamine is not a vasopressor for this determinat ion. If a patient receives any of the 5 
vasopressors listed above on a calendar day, then it is counted as a vasopressor day . 
2) Rules for duration of Mechanical Ventilation (M V) 
a)We define MV as invasive ventilat ion only; it does not include non-invasive techniques 
such as continuous positive airway  pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure 
(BiPAP) m ask vent ilation.
b)Durati on of MV is the number of consecut ive* days o f invasive mechanical ventilat ion that 
a subject requires. 
i)*If a subject is free of MV for < 48hrs (or 2 days when hours are not recorded) these 
days are counted as part of the overall durati on of MV shoul d the participant be assisted 
with MV.
(1).If free of MV for < 48 hrs, this will count as part of  one episode, however if free 
for > 48 hrs, thi s will  count as an independent episode

ii)Use calendar day for all calculat ions. If a subject receives MV for a few hours 
(intubated late at night or extubated early in the mor ning), each calendar day is included 
in the calculat ion.  
3)Rules for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) 
a)Types of renal replacement therapy  (RRT) in this measurement include peritoneal dialysis, 
continuous renal replacement therapy  (CRRT), and hem odialysis (HD).
b)Durati on of RRT is defined as the amount of consecut ive* days that a subject requires 
RRT.

Kidney stone passage down the ureter into the bladder often results in severe abdominal pain 
called ureteral colic. Ureteral colic is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments  
(ED).  
 
Approximately 550,000 episodes of ureteric colic are seen in ED in the United States per year  
costing nearly $3 billion.1 The current standard of care for ureteral stone passage involves 
hydration and pain control as approximately 47- 80% of stones will pass within approximately 4 
weeks, depending on size  and location.2 Patients who cannot achieve spontaneous stone passage 
or have a  subsequent  complication (including recurr ent pain, compromised renal function, or 
infection) often require  surgical  therapy, typically either with extracorporeal shock wave 
lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. Two decades  ago, the first randomized trial demonstrating the 
potential efficacy of a calcium channel blocker  (nifedipine) for medical expulsive therapy of 
ureteral stones was performed.3 Subsequently, tamsulosin, a  selective  alpha -1a antagonist, has 
also been demonstrated as a potentially useful agent for medical expulsive therapy (MET) in  
randomiz ed trials.4 Over the past decade, off -label MET has become more  commonplace. 
However, the strength of findings from randomized trials  is weak due to variability  in quality and 
power of study  design.  
 
In 2015, a large multi -center randomized placebo- control led trial (SUSPEND Trial) included  
1167 patients and compared the efficacy of nifedipine and tamsulosin for the reduction in 
surgical therapy  in patients passing ureteral stones within 4 weeks after randomization.5 This trial 
demonstrated that  both nifedip ine and tamsulosin were ineffective for MET and were associated 
with an increase in  adverse  effects  (AE) compared to placebo. These findings suggest that 
current off -label therapy with  calcium -channel  blockers and alpha -blockers may be ineffective 
and inappropriate. Because ureteral stones remain  an important and expensive medical problem, 
identification of other potential agents for MET may  reduce  the frequency of serious 
complications and necessity of surgical intervention as well as improve  patient - centered  
outcomes. 
 
Mirabegron is a selective beta- 3 adrenergic agonist that was approved for overactive bladder in 
the United States in 2012. Several human and animal studies have also shown the presence of  
beta- 3 adrenergic receptors in the ureter and efficacy of agonists for the relaxation of the ureter.6, 
7 Stimulation of the beta -3 adrenergic receptors in the human ureter have been shown to promote 
urothelial  relaxation in a pre- clinical model.6 We hypothesize that mirabegron may be useful as 
MET thr ough beta-3 adrenergic -mediated ureteral relaxation which may enhance ureteral stone 
passage in patients who are  expectantly managed. Because ureteral colic results from sustained 
ureteric smooth muscle  contraction, we hypothesize that relaxation of the ur eter may reduce pain 
associated with ureteral stones and  ureteral  stents that are placed after surgical intervention.8 As 
secondary endpoints, we will assess the efficacy  of mirabegron for the reduction of pain during 
the expectant management period and during the  post - surgical stent period. 
 
2. SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Ureteral obstruction due to kidney stones is a common and costly condition that requires  surgical  
intervention in 20- 50% of patients . It is associated with severe pain and discomfort along with  
WAM  Page 6 of 31 2/20/19  other serious adverse health outcomes such as renal failure and sepsis. If mirabegron can reduce 
either  the need for surgical intervention or the pain associated with ureteral colic, this may alter 
standard of  care  for expectant stone management. Furthermore, st ent pain is a major common 
adverse sequela of surgical intervention for kidney stones.9 If mirabegron can reduce stent pain, 
it would greatly  improve  quality of life for patients undergoing invasive surgical therapy for  
urolithiasis . 
 
3. OBJECTIVES  
 
A. Primary O bjective  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of mirabegron 
can improve the spontaneous passage rate of patients with ureteral single ureteral 
calculi within  30 days of  presentation.  
 
B. Secondary Objectives  
 
The secondary obje ctives of the study are to evaluate the effects of mirabegron on  the 
reduction of pain level during the expectant management as well as stent -associated 
pain of those patients who had surgery.  
 
4. DRUG INFORMATION 
 
Mirabegron is a FDA -approved medication used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB)  
with symptoms of urgency, frequency, and leakage in adults. Both Mirabegron and placebo will  
be formulated and provided by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. The FDA -approved Mirabegron (50mg)  
product  will be used without manipulation or reformulation (Mirabegron package insert; Rev. 
Jun 2012).10 
 
The efficacy and safety of mirabegron have been evaluated in three 12 -week studies and one  
long-term (12-month) safety  study.  
 
In clinical trials, mirabegron was shown to be eff ective in treating symptoms of OAB within the  
first several weeks. Those taking mirabegron made fewer trips to the bathroom and had fewer 
leaks  than those not taking mirabegron. Results may  vary.

7. DESIGN   
 
The study will be a prospective randomized double -blind placebo -controlled trial of mirabegron  
for MET in patients with a CT  scan or Ultrasound/KUB -proven ureteral stone between 4 to 10 
mm undergoing  expectant  management. Subjects will be distributed at a 1:1 ratio between the 
control and treatment groups. The treatment group will receive  mirabegron and the control 
groups will receive a placebo. Both groups  will receive analgesics and hydration will be 
recommended. All subjects will then be followed for 30 days  to determine the proportion of 
subjects with spontaneous passage. Patients will  record narcotic usage  and pain scores during 
WAM  Page 8 of 31 2/20/19  this time. If there is stone persistence in the ureter based on imaging (CT scan or 
Ultrasound/KUB  of the abdomen and pelvic, then the patient will undergo ureteroscopy  with 
stent placement. In these patients, treatment will continue while the stent is in place and patients 
will fill out a validated questionnaire regarding stent  pain. 
 
8. RANDOMIZATION  
 
Study participants will be randomized to the treated arm (mirabegron 50 mg orally once every 24  
hours starting immediately) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio using a randomized block design, stratified 
by stone  size (≤5 mm versus >5 mm) and location (upper versus lower ureter). The 
randomization will be  implemented through a database with software designed by the Director of 
Research Informatics at  the Baylor College of Medicine’s (BCM) Dan Duncan Institute of 
Clinical and Translational Research. It will be  a HIPPA -compliant secure database accessible via 
internet.  
 
Each randomly assigned participant will be given 60 capsules of trial medication  (over -
encapsulated mirabegron or placebo) supplied by Astellas Pharm US, Inc. and dispensed by the 
Harris  Health System Pharmacy. Both Astellas Pharm US, Inc. and Harris Health Pharmacy will 
have no further  involvement  in the t rial, ensuring that participants, clinicians, and trial personnel 
remained unaware of the  allocated group.  
 
 Justification : 
Two decades  ago, the first randomized trial demonstrating the potential efficacy of a calcium 
channel blocker  (nifedipine) for medical expulsive therapy of ureteral stones was performed.3 
Subsequently, tamsulosin, a  selective alpha -1a antagonist, has also been demonstrated as a 
potentially useful agent for MET in randomized trials.4 Over the past decade, off -label MET has 
become more commonplace. However, the strength of findings from randomized trials is  weak 
due to variability  in quality and power of study  design.  
 
In 2015, a large multi -center randomized placebo- controlled trial (SUSPEND Trial) included  
1167 patients and compare d the efficacy of nifedipine and tamsulosin for the reduction in 
surgical therapy  in patients passing ureteral stones within 4 weeks after randomization.5 This trial 
demonstrated that  both nifedipine and tamsulosin were ineffective for MET and were associa ted 
with an increase in  adverse effects compared to placebo. These findings suggest that current off -
label therapy with  calcium -channel blockers and alpha -blockers may be ineffective and 
inappropriate. Because ureteral stones remain  an important and expens ive medical problem, 
identification of other potential agents for MET may  reduce the frequency of serious 
complications and necessity of surgical intervention as well as improve  patient - centered  
outcomes. 
 
9. PROCEDURES  
 
Visit 1 – Emergency  Department  
In the  ED, the subjects will receive a full history and physical, blood tests (including CBC and 
BMP), urinalysis and culture , urine pregnancy test , CT scan or Ultrasound/KUB  of the abdomen 
WAM  Page 9 of 31 2/20/19  and pelvis, and KUB as part of standard of  care f or ureteral colic. The radiology department will 
note on all imaging the largest diameter of the stone  and the Hounsfield units. Research study 
staff will screen potential subjects in the ED by reviewing  their charts and will obtain written and 
verbal consent (in Spanish when ne cessary) from subjects who  meet  all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Baseline data, including demographics, medical and surgical  history, and current 
medications, will be collected before  randomization. 
 
Each subject will be assigned a unique, consecutive  three -digit identification number (i.e., 001, 
002…). The study number will be utilized for identification of the subject throughout the study. 
The clinical  study coordinator of the trial will maintain the code that links the name of the 
participant to their  study identification number. The study coordinator will maintain the code in a 
secured cabinet and the code  will be kept confidential. Only the clinical study coordinator and 
Principal Investigator (PI)  can access  and view the  codes.  
 
Subjects will b e asked to complete the Wong -Baker FACES pain scale (available with validated  
Spanish translation as well). Subjects will be discharged from the ED with a (1 ) 60 day  
prescription for the  study drug (mirabegron or placebo) (2) urine strainer (3) 60 day log for 
recording medication  adherence, narcotic/analgesic usage, and ureteral pain. Subjects will be 
instructed to take one pill per day  beginning immediately and continuing until they have 
completed all pills or until they have been instructed  to discontinue  by the study staff.  
 
Subjects will be provided instructions for use of the urine strainer and collection of any stone or 
stones that may be passed.  They  will be instructed to bring any stones that have been passed to 
the next clinic visit.  
 
Subjects will be informed that they may also discontinue the study drug  at any time if they would 
like to drop out of the trial and they may do so by contacting Dr. Mayer  or designee. Subjects 
will be informed to contact Dr. Mayer or designee if they believe that they  have  passed their 
ureteral stone before discontinuing therapy. Subjects will be told to bring their  medication bottles 
when they return to the  clinic.   
 
In the event that a subject has additional pain, discomfort, or other symptoms that may be related 
to their ureteral stone they may follow -up for an unscheduled visit to either the emergency 
department or the Urology clinic. The subject will be treated according to standard of care and 
information regarding their visit will be collected. If the subject must undergo an emergent 
procedure for their stone  they will be determined to have failed therapy but will remain in the 
study to evaluate the study drug to reduce stent pain. Subjects that fail therapy early will undergo 
Visit 3 and will be evaluated at V isit 4 for the removal of their stent. Subjects will remain in the 
study  for all outcome measurements  if they do not require surgical intervention. 
 
Interim Phone Follow -up #1 – (7 Days ± 3 days post -Visit  1) 
The research study staff will contact the subje ct by phone approximately 7 days after Visit 1. 
Research staff will assess ureteral pain, medication/strainer compliance, and adverse events. 
Research staff  will also identify whether or not the subject subjectively or objectively has passed 
their ureteral  stone. The research staff will also answer any questions that the subject may have 
during this follow -up event. 
WAM  Page 10 of 31 2/20/19   
Interim Phone Follow -up #2 – (21 Days ± 3 days post -Visit  1) 
The research study staff will contact the subject by phone approximately 21 days after Visit 1.  
Research staff will assess ureteral pain, medication/strainer compliance, and adverse events. 
Research staff  will also identify whether or not the subject subjectively or objectively has passed 
their ureteral stone.  The research staff will also answer any questions that the subject may have 
during this follow -up event. The research staff will also remind the subjects to bring in their 
medication bottles to Visit 2 (see  below).  
 
Visit 2 – Urology Clinic (30 days ± 5 days post -Visit  1) 
Subjects  will follow -up in the Harris Health Urology Clinic approximately 30 days after Visit 1. 
Subjects will provide a blood sample for a CBC, BMP, coagulation studies (PT/INR/PTT), a  
urine  sample for a urinalysis and culture , urine pregnancy test , and have thei r blood pressure 
taken, as per standard of care.  Subjects will also undergo a CT or KUB plus renal ultrasound at 
the Harris Health Radiology Department  to radiologically identify the status of their ureteral 
stone, as per standard of  care.  
 
In the Urology Clinic, staff will perform a brief history and physical, review clinical imaging,  
observe any stones that the subject has collected, and determine whether or not the subject has 
passed their ureteral stone. Clinical and research staff  will assess blood pre ssure, ureteral pain, 
pain medication and pain score log compliance, medication/strainer compliance, and adverse 
events using the adverse event checklist. Subjects will be asked to bring in their medication 
bottles at this visit to assess medication compliance. Subjects with persistent ureteral stones will 
be scheduled for ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. These  subjects 
will continue the study drug  and strain their urine. Subjects will be provided additional study 
drug if necessary and  instructed to continue until Visit 4, regardless of if they believe they passed 
their stone or not.  They will be  asked to bring the study drug bottle and any collected stones 
upon their return to Visit  3. 
 
Subjects who have passed their  stone will discontinue the study drug and exit the  study.  
 
Visit 3 – Ureteroscopy (14 days ± 5 days post -Visit  2) 
Subjects who have failed the expectant management period as determined on Visit 2 will  
undergo ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy approximat ely 14 days after Visit 2.  
Blood pressure will be  checked prior to the procedure. Stone fragments will be collected for 
composition analysis. All subjects will be stented using the preferred  6-French Boston Scientific 
Contour Injection Ureteral Stent Set that has  been appropriately sized for each patient. If this 
particular catheter cannot be used, any 6 -French catheter is preferred, but any ureteral catheter 
may be utilized during this visit. The string will not be removed from the ureteral stent to  
facilitate easier removal later. In subjects for whom the ureteroscope cannot successfully be 
passed into the  ureter after reasonable attempts, the surgeon will place a ureteral stent and the 
subject will remain on the  trial until their ureteral stent has been in 1 week or until Visit 4. 
Subjects will receive 10 days of  ciprofloxacin, Tylenol #3, phenazopyridine, per standard of 
care. Subjects will not be prescribed alpha -adrenergic blockers  or anticholinergics.  
 
Clinical and research staff will assess blood pressure, ureteral pain, pain medication and pain 
WAM  Page 11 of 31 2/20/19  score log compliance, medication/strainer compliance, and adverse events using the adverse 
event  checklist.  
 
They will be asked to bring the study drug bottle upon their return to the clinic at Visit 4. It is  
possible  that some patients will pass their stone between visit 2 and visit 3. If the patient has 
physically seen  the stone pass or has collected the stone, they will exit the study; otherwise, they 
will pro ceed with  a diagnostic versus therapeutic ureteroscopy with stent  placement.  
 
Visit 4 – Removal of Ureteral Stent (7 days ± 3 days post - Visit  3) 
Subjects will return the Harris Health Urology Clinic approximately 7 days after ureteroscopy to  
remove  their ureteral stent. In the Urology Clinic, staff will perform a brief history and physical, 
including  blood pressure, per standard of care.  Subjects will complete the USSQ . Stent pain, 
medication compliance, and medication -related  adverse  events , if any, will be assessed.  Subjects 
will be asked to return any unused study drug and the study drug bottle at this visit. For subjects 
in whom the ureteroscope could not be passed and a stent was left in place, this visit will be  a 
return to the operating room for com pletion ureteroscopy or stent removal, as clinically  
indicated.  
 
Early Completion of the Trial  Period  
Subjects will be asked to call the study staff if they believe that they have passed their ureteral 
stone  during the expectant management period or before  ureteroscopy. Subjects that have 
objectively  passed their stone will be asked to bring stone fragments for composition analysis. 
Subjects that  have  subjectively passed their stones will be asked to continue on their study 
medication until they  can undergo  a CT or KUB plus renal ultrasound and be interviewed in 
person by the clinical staff  to determine stone passage. If a subject completes the trial before 
Visit 4, they will be asked to return  any unused study  drug.  
 
Protocol Exceptions  
Under the circumstan ce that any clinic visit cannot be made within the given timeframe due to 
system or subject issues unrelated to the study staff, the PI can review each case on an individual 
basis. If the PI determines that standard of care is ongoing, the subject may rema in on the study. 
Under the circumstance that this may delay time to completion, the PI may extend study drug 
until completion of the trial.  Extension of the study drug may continue in continuation with the 
initial 60 day dose or may be restarted after a period of drug cessation. This extension is not to 
exceed 60 additional days. 
 
Monitoring of Adverse Events  
Safety outcomes will be reported when they happened (via the case report form, patient  
questionnaires, and patient and clinician report). Suspected se rious adverse events will be graded 
at site by the  principal  investigator. Safety events will be monitored by Astellas  research ethics 
committee, and  MHRA. Reporting of unanticipated problems will be in accordance to the current 
IRB guidelines and FDA regu lations. An adverse event log will be maintained at the clinical site.  
The logs will be tabulated  into a master log and submitted with each annual IRB renewal  report.  
 
WAM  Page 12 of 31 2/20/19  10. LABORATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Blood and urine samples will be obtained at the first visit in the ED and during the 30 day  
follow -up visit in the Urology clinic. Up to 10 ml of blood will be drawn for laboratory 
assessment of CBC,  BMP, and the coagulation panel. 
 
The samples for standard of care testing will be sent to the laboratory at Ben Taub  General  
Hospital. After tests are completed, any remaining samples will destroyed per laboratory's 
Standard  Operating Procedures.  
 
No cell lines will be developed. If a subject withdraws, the samples will have already been  
destroyed;  therefore, the subjec t will not be able to have the samples returned to  them.  
 
Subjects may see and get a copy of their research related health information. The research doctor 
may be able to provide subjects with part of their information while the study is in progress and 
the rest of  their information at the end of the  study.  
 
11. SAMPLE SIZE  
 
The primary outcome measure is spontaneous stone passage. The proportion of patients  who 
spontaneously pass the stone within 30 days will be compared between the mirabegron and 
placebo groups using Fisher’s exact test. Previous research suggests that about 50% of subjects 
in the  placebo group will have a spontaneous stone passage. A sample size of 45 subjects per 
group will provide  80% power to detect a 0.30 unit difference in proportions us ing Fisher’s exact 
test assuming alpha=0.05  and half of the patients in the placebo group have spontaneous stone 
passage. Therefore, a total of  104 subjects will be enrolled into this study to allow for 15%  
attrition.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The primary analysis will evaluate the difference in the proportion of subjects who successfully  
pass their ureteral stone between subjects who received mirabegron and placebo. This analysis 
will provide information regarding the efficacy of mirabegron to improve stone passage rates for 
patients  undergoing expectant stone  management.  
 
The secondary analyses will involve a multivariable analysis to compare the difference in pain  
during passage and pain with a ureteral stent in place. This may include co -variates such as age,  
gender, location of ureteral stone, prior history of ureteral stones, pain medication used during  
expectant  management, and stone  size.  
 
13. DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics will be summarized by means with sta ndard 
deviations, medians with minimum and maximum values, or frequencies with percentages. 
Summary statistics  will be stratified by treatment group. No univariable analysis will be 
completed in this randomized clinical  trial. 
WAM  Page 13 of 31 2/20/19   
The primary analysis will co mpare the proportion of subjects with spontaneous stone passage 
within  30 days between study groups using Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance with be 
assessed at the 0.05 level (two- sided). A logistic regression model will also be used to estimate 
the odds ratio for spontaneous stone passage in the mirabegron group versus the placebo with a 
95% confidence  interval.  
 
A multiple logistic regression model, adjusting for treatment group, will also be used to test for 
significant associations between s pontaneous stone passage and patient demographics or  clinical  
characteristics. Parameter estimates significant at the 0.05 level will be included in the final 
multiple  regression model. No adjustments will be made for multiple hypothesis  testing.  
A seconda ry objective of this study is to compare pain measures between treatment groups. The  
Wong Baker FACES pain scale will be measured daily for each patient. A general linear mixed 
model will be used to compare pain scores between treated and placebo groups. The model will 
include fixed  effects for treatment group, time (discrete) and a group- time interaction term. The 
matrix of correlated  residual  terms will assume an unstructured format. This model will account 
for the correlation between  repeated measures w ithin the same subject and will allow for all 
available data to be included in the model.  
 
Missing data will not be imputed. Model fit will be assessed using influence diagnostics and  
residual  analysis. Data transformations (e.g., natural logarithm) will b e used if departure from  
model  assumptions is evident. The model will also be used to explore associations between pain 
scores  and demographic and clinical characteristics, adjusting for treatment group and time.  
 
The USSQ will be observed in patients who require surgical intervention, and will be observed 
during study visit 4. A general linear model will be used to compare USSQ pain scores between 
the treated  and placebo groups. The model will also be used to explore associations between pain 
scores  and de mographic or clinical characteristics adjusting for treatment group. Secondary 
analyses will  be assessed at the 0.05 level (two -sided) without adjusting for multiple  
comparisons.  
 
14. END- POINTS  
 
Endpoints will include spontaneous passage rate during the 30 -day expectant management period  
or completion of the expectant management period without a requirement for surgery. Secondary  
endpoints  will include ureteral pain during the expectant management period (Visit 1, Interim 
Follow -up #1 and #2, Visit 2) and pain with a ureteral stent in place (Visit 4).  
 
15. RISKS  
 
There are risks to any medication. However, mirabegron is a FDA -approved medication and has  
passed rigorous trials for  safety.  
 
A. Mirabegron: Mirabegron is contraindicated in patients who have known 
hypersensitivity reactions to mirabegron or any component of the tablet. Mirabegron 
can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are 
WAM  Page 14 of 31 2/20/19  recommended, especially in  hypertensive  patients. Mirabegron is not recommended 
for use in severe un controlled hypertensive  patients (defined as systolic blood 
pressure ≥180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm  Hg). 
 
Urinary retention in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients  
taking antimuscarinic medications for the trea tment of OAB has been reported in 
post-marketing experience in patients taking mirabegron. A controlled clinical safety 
study in patients  with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in 
Mirabegron patients;  however, Mirabegron should be adminis tered with caution to 
patients with clinically significant BOO. Mirabegron should also be administered 
with caution to patients taking  antimuscarinic  medications for the treatment of  OAB.  
 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reporte d with 
Mirabegron. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of 
angioedema have been  reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple 
doses. Angioedema associated with  upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If 
involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or  larynx occurs, promptly discontinue 
Mirabegron and initiate appropriate therapy and/or  measures necessary to ensure a 
patent  airway.  
 
Since Mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to 
CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol and desipramine is increased when co-
administered  with Mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose 
adjustment may be  necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs 
metabolized by CYP2D6, such as  thiorid azine, flecainide, and  propafenone. 
 
Most commonly reported adverse reactions over 2% and greater than with placebo) 
were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection and headache.  
 
Subjects will be monitored carefully for such side effects and s hould the subject  feel 
uncomfortable continuing treatment, he will be allowed to discontinue participation 
in the study.  
 
PREGNANCY: It is possible that the medicines used in this study could injure a fetus 
if the subject or  partner becomes pregnant while taking them. Because of the 
potential risks involved, the subject or  partner  should not become pregnant while you 
are participating in this study.  
 
If subject is  sexually active or become sexually active and can get pregnant or can get 
the partner pregnan t, the subject  must agree to use one of the following forms of birth 
control every time the subject has  sex from now until 3 months after stopping the 
study drug : 
 
* oral contraceptives ("the pill"),  
* intrauterine devices (IUDs),  
* contraceptive implants under the skin, or contraceptive injections,  
WAM  Page 15 of 31 2/20/19  * condoms with foam.  
 
Should pregnancy occur  while on this study, the subject  must immediately notify the 
study personnel.  
 
The investigator will assist in finding appropriate medical care. The investigator also 
may ask to be allowed to continue getting information about the  pregnancy. The 
subject  can choose not to provide this information. 
 
B. Blood Draw: Inserting needles into veins for collecting blood may be uncomfortable. 
Risks include slight bruising at the puncture site, fainting, the formation of a small 
blood clot  or swelling of the vein and surrounding tissue, bleeding from the site, and 
the remote  possibility of infection at the site of the needle puncture. Fainting is 
usually harmless, of short  duration, and typically produces feelings of weakness, 
sweating, slowing of the heart rate and  an abnormal decrease in blood pressure. Care 
will be taken to avoid these  complications.  
 
C. Blood Pressure: Subjects may feel a slight disco mfort while the band on the arm is  
tightened in order to take the reading.  
 
D. Scans: CT scans, ultrasounds, and plain x -rays do not cause any physical discomfort. 
Anxiety in anticipating these procedures might be experienced. CT scans and plain x -
rays subject  patients to small amounts of radiation. I n the field of radiation 
protection, it is  commonly assumed that the risk for adverse health effects from 
cancer is proportional to the amount  of radiation dose absorbed and the amount of 
dose depends on the  type of x -ray examination.  A CT examination with an effective 
dose of 10 millisieverts (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x rays) may 
be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer  of approximately 1 
chance in 2000. This inc rease in the possibility of a fatal cancer  from  radiation can be 
compared to the natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S.  population, about 1 
chance in 5. In other words, for any one person the risk of radiation- induced cancer  is 
much smaller than the  natural risk of cancer. Nevertheless, this small increase in  
radiation - associated cancer risk for an individual can become a public health concern 
if large  numbers of the population undergo increased numbers of CT screening 
procedures of uncertain benefi t. It must be noted that there is uncertainty regarding 
the risk estimates for low levels  of radiation exposure as commonly experienced in 
diagnostic radiology  procedures.  
 
E. Loss of Confidentiality: The loss of confidentiality regarding research information is  
a possibility, although, the risk is extremely small. The investigator and his/her 
research  staff will make every effort to maintain the  confidentiality.  
 
F. Ureteroscopy with stent placement: Patients will have a small camera placed in their  
bladder. A smaller camera will be placed in the kidney which will be used to find the 
stone. If  unable  to introduce this smaller camera in the kidney a stent will be left to 
open up the ureter, the tube that drains the kidney and another attempt will be made 
WAM  Page 16 of 31 2/20/19  in a few  weeks. The stone  will be broken apart by a laser. The small fragments may 
be individually removed. An x -ray will be used for the procedure. A stent will be left 
in the kidney after the procedure and will  be removed in clinic.  
 
G. Questionnaires : Completing the questionnaires may cause some  level of emotional 
discomfort due to the personal nature of the questions. The study  doctor and staff will 
maintain a professional and caring attitude while administering  the questionnaires . 
 
16. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
A. Adverse E vents Reporting 
 
All adverse event (Severe Adverse Event (SAE), Unanticipated Event (UAE), or  
Adverse  Event (AE) will be assessed by the Principal Investigator using the BCM PI  
Determination form.  The IRB will be notified according to current rules, regulations, 
and procedures.  
 
B. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Within 24 hours of awareness of a serious adverse event, whether or not related to the 
study drug, the Investigator will complete and submit a Medwatch 3500A Form to 
FDA, containing all required information (reference 21 CFR 312.32).  The 
Investigator will submit a copy of this MedWatch 3500A form to Astellas by either e -
mail or fax, within the same timeframe.   If submission of this SAE to FDA or Astella s 
or is not possible within 24 hours, the Investigator’s local drug safety contact (IRB, 
etc.) should be informed by phone.  
 
The SAE documentation, including the Medwatch 3500A Form and available source 
records should be emailed or faxed to:  
 
 Astellas Pha rma Global Pharmacovigilance – United States  
 Email: Safety -us@us.astellas.com  
 Fax number: (847) 317- 1241 
 
The following minimum information is required:  
 
•        Study number/IIT regulatory identifier  
 
•        Subject number, sex and age  
 
•        The date of report  
 
•        A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event)  
 
•        Causal relationship to the study drug 
 
WAM  Page 17 of 31 2/20/19  Follow -up information for the event should be sent promptly (within 7 days) as 
necessary.  
 
C. Additional safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population, defined as all  
subjects who receive at least one treatment with study  drug. 
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating physical, clinical laboratory 
tests,  and reported  AEs.  
 
17. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
 
Subjects  for the study  will be selected  during  screening  based  on the inclusion and  exclusion  
criteria  and clinical  assessment listed below .  Subjects will be  discontinued from the study 
prematurely  if: 
 
A. Unacceptable AEs considered  by the  investigator  to be associated with  use of the 
study  drug occur  
B. The subject requests to be withdrawn from the  study  
C. A need for concomitant medication prohibited by the protocol  arises  
D. The Principal  Investigator  decides  that it is in the subject’s  best interest  
E. The subject is significantly non- compliant with the  protocol  
 
18. BENEFITS  
 
Subjects assigned to the mirabegron group may experience a reduction in their risk for  surgical  
intervention or may experience reduced pain associated with ureteral colic or ureteral  stenting.  
 
Should mirabegron prove beneficial in reducing the need for surgical stone extraction or reduce 
the pain associated with ureteral colic or ureteral stenting this medication may be used during the  
expect ant management period for ureteral stones. This may decrease the adverse effects and 
morbidity  associated with ureteral stones. Preventing the need for surgical intervention may 
reduce healthcare costs  and reduce complications and morbidity associated with surgery.  
 
The anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks. The study medication used in this study has  
been approved as safe by the FDA.  
 
19. ALTERNATIVES  
 
Patients may choose not to participate in this study. Other treatment for small ureteral stones  
inclu des nifedepine or tamsulosin (off -label) in addition to hydration and NSAIDs.  
 
20. COSTS TO SUBJECTS  
 
The subject s and/or their insurance will cover the emergency department visit as well as follow -
up office  visits, blood tests, diagnostic imaging, and surgical intervention that are standard of 
diagnosing  and managing ureteral  stones. 
WAM  Page 18 of 31 2/20/19   
The study medication, mirabegron, and the placebo are not considered standard of care. Astellas  
will provide these study drugs.  
 
21. PAYMENT TO SUBJECTS

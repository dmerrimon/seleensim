71.OBJECTIVES
1.1Study Design
Within the gastroenterology practice of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we will conduct 
a prospective, single-arm clinical trial to measure the effects of daily 4-gram eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA), through treatment with AMR101 (VASCEPA, icosapent ethyl) on urine, stool and 
tissue biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer. 
1.2Primary Objectives
To measure the effect of daily 4-gram AMR101 treatment on fatty acid composition in colorectal 
tissue among individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.
1.3Secondary Objectives
To measure the effect of EPA treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolome, urinary 
prostaglandin metabolites (PGE-M) and gene expression profile of colorectal tissue among 
individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.
2.BACKGROUND
2.1Study Disease(s)
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
in the U.S. In 2016, an estimated 95,270 new cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed and 
49,190 people will die from the disease.1 Age is strongly associated with colorectal cancer 
incidence, with more than a third of all colorectal cancer deaths occurring in the population aged 
80 years or older. The death rates are higher in black populations and lowest in Asian individuals. 
Men have a slightly higher lifetime probability of receiving a colorectal cancer diagnosis (5.0%) 
compared to women (4.7%).2
Nationally, incidence rates have been declining over the past two decades; and at a slightly higher 
rate over the last 10 years compared to the 1990s. This is largely believed to be due to increasing 
use of screening methods and improved risk factor profile. Still the public health concern remains 
as colorectal cancer ranks third among all cancer deaths with only an approximate 65% five-year 
survival rate, necessitating further advances in cancer prevention.2
2.2IND Agent(s)

(DOP2) of the FDA (see the attached formal letter, IND 141418. Please note that the name of the 
study has been changed since receipt of the IND approval). 
2.3Other Agent(s)
AMR101
AMR101 (icosapent ethyl) is a prescription medicine for adults to lower blood levels of 
triglycerides. It is supplied as a liquid-filled gel capsule for oral administration. The standard 
dose is 4 g per day (administered as 8 half-gram capsules). Each 0.5-gram capsule of AMR101 
contains 0.5 gram of icosapent ethyl, which is an ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). 
EPA possesses triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory activities, and has been suggested to 
be beneficial for a variety of health outcomes in adults, including coronary heart disease,3 stroke,4 
type 2 diabetes,5 depression,6 and inflammatory bowel disease,7 although the data are not 
univocal.8 Increasing evidence supports the anticancer effect of EPA.9 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
9Besides EPA, AMR101 capsules also contain the following inactive ingredients: tocopherol, 
gelatin, glycerin, maltitol, sorbitol, and purified water.
2.4Rationale
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US.1 Substantial data 
support the benefit of EPA for colorectal cancer prevention and treatment,10 which may be mainly 
due to the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity of EPA.11 Increasing data support 
that gut microbes are pivotal in integrating dietary cues with host immunity, and that disturbances 
in the gut microbiota may promote colorectal cancer by breakdown of intestinal immune 
homeostasis. Dietary fat composition is a major driver of the gut microbial community structure 
and EPA has been shown to enrich the gut bacteria that possess immunoprotective activities. These 
data together our hypothesis that EPA modulates the gut microbiota to preserve colorectalic 
immune homeostasis and suppress colorectal cancer. In the current study, we propose to 
experimentally test this hypothesis by assessing the effect of EPA supplement on the gut 
microbiota - host immune interaction. 
2.5Correlative Studies Background
2.5.1 EPA and colorectal cancer
Several lines of evidence support the benefit of EPA for colorectal cancer prevention and 
treatment.10 In a meta-analysis of 3 prospective cohort studies and 8 case-control studies, high 
levels of EPA are associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer in a dose-dependent manner.12 
In an RCT of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, EPA supplement of 2 g daily for 6 
months reduces the number and size of polyps by 20-30%, an effect comparable to that by the 
FDA-approved prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, also known as COX-2) 
inhibitors.13 
2.5.2 Immune mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of EPA
The anticancer effect of EPA may be related to its multifaceted immunomodulatory activity 
mediated by alterations in lipid raft structure and changes in fatty acid composition of cell 
membranes.14 These changes alter gene expression and the activities of several key immune 
signaling pathways, such as PTGS2 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B 
cells (NF-κB), and modify downstream metabolite production, including a decrease in 
proinflammatory eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandin E 2; PGE 2) and an increase in pro-resolving 
lipid mediators (e.g., resolvin and protectin).14-19 Of note, PGE 2 has been suggested as one of the 
critical pathways that govern tumor-mediated immune dysfunction and contributes to a shift in 
the tumor microenvironment from anti-tumor responses to immunosuppressive responses.20 On 
the other hand, increasing data suggest that EPA may revert the immune suppression mediated 
by Treg cells.21,22 Treatment of Tregs with EPA decreases the immune suppressive activity by 
downregulating inhibitory precursors.21 In experimental colorectal cancer models, fish oil exerts 
its antitumor effect by altering Tregs and their cytokine repertoire (e.g., reduction of IL-10 
expression).22 In an RCT of 60 patients with solid tumors, supplementation of EPA increased the 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
10ratio of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells in the peripheral blood of the malnourished patients, 
and prolonged the survival of all the patients.23 
Our recent observational study indicated that high EPA intake was associated with lower risk of 
colorectal cancer that is infiltrated with a high density of FOXP3+ T cells, but not tumors with 
low densities of FOXP3+ T cells.24 Similar benefit was observed when EPA and DHA were 
examined separately. Because FOXP3 is a prerequisite transcription factor for the 
immunosuppressive function of Treg cells, we further examined the in vitro effect of EPA on the 
suppressive activity of colorectal Treg cells against proliferation of T effector (Teff) cells.24 
Consistent with our human findings, we found that EPA treatment decreased the suppressive 
activity of FOXP3+ Treg cells in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, the suppressive effect of 
EPA leveled off at around 50 uM, which is within the normal range of EPA in human plasma 
samples, highlighting the human relevance of these experimental findings.
2.5.3 Gut microbiome in relation to EPA and colorectal cancer 
Increasing data suggest that the gut microbiota play an important role in colorectal cancer 
development and progression, possibly by influencing both local and systemic immune 
response.25 Among all potential shaping factors, diet is particularly important for the gut 
microbial composition and function. Compared to other types of fat, EPA has been associated 
with enhanced intestinal microbiota diversity and EPA-rich diet ameliorates omega-6 fatty acids- 
or antibiotics-induced dysbiosis.26-29 Animal studies indicate that EPA supplements increase the 
abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as lactic acid-producing bacteria (mainly 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium), and decrease the abundance of immunosuppressive and pro-
inflammatory bacteria, such as F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and Akkermansia. Administration 
of Bifidobacterium has been shown to improve patients’ response to cancer immunotherapy,30 
whereas increased abundance of F. nucleatum has been linked to dampened antitumor immune 
response and poor prognosis of colorectal cancer.31-33 Therefore, it is possible that the beneficial 
effect of EPA for colorectal cancer may be mediated by modulation of the gut microbial 
composition and function that in turn shape the host immune response.  
 
3.PARTICIPANT SELECTION
Patients that meet the eligibility criteria will be identified through investigators during their routine 
clinical practice, supplemented by a periodic query of the MGH endoscopy (Provation) and 
pathology database. Patients also may be identified using Natural Language Processing clinical 
software that queries medical records. The MGH gastroenterologist that performed the procedure 
or saw the patient for outpatient care as follow-up to the patient’s colonoscopy procedure will be 
notified and asked for permission to contact their patient. We plan to recruit patients who have 
undergone a colonoscopy by an MGH gastroenterologist either in the ambulatory clinic or for an 
endoscopic procedure. In some cases, these physicians may not be members of the study team. 
However, non-study physicians will not perform study-related procedures. 
For appropriate patients, we will identify their preference for contact about research studies 
(Research Opportunities Direct to You [RODY] status) through queries of the Research Patient 
Data Registry (RPDR). Participants with a RODY YES response will be contacted by a letter 
(attached recruitment letter for RODY YES patients) from the study PI. Patients with a RODY 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
11NO response or without RODY designation will be contacted by a different letter (attached 
recruitment letter for RODY NO patients). If the colonoscopy was performed at MGH, after an 
adenoma is resected from a patient at MGH, all gastroenterologists routinely contact their 
patients by mail with the results of their pathology. The recruitment letter will be included with 
the pathology results when possible, or it will be sent separately after the pathology report. If the 
colonoscopy and polypectomy were performed at another hospital, the MGH gastroenterologist 
will confirm the prior diagnosis of an adenoma through review of pathology reports. Their 
treating MGH gastroenterologist, regardless of whether the physician is study personnel, will 
sign the letter. If no response is received to this recruitment letter within two weeks (10 business 
days) a follow-up phone call or email will be placed by a research assistant/study coordinator 
(phone script/sample email attached). In some cases, the treating gastroenterologist may 
approach the patient following the colonoscopy that identified a polyp if he/she feels the patient 
would be a good candidate for the study. In these cases, the patients may not receive a 
recruitment letter as the primary method of contact. Instead, they will be directly contacted by 
phone or email (see call script/sample email) from a member of the research team prior to 
mailing the letter (if requested). Potential participants will have additional opportunities to ask 
any questions by contacting an investigator or a trained research coordinator. If the participant is 
interested in participating, eligibility will be assessed by the study coordinator (see script) and 
confirmed by the investigator through an additional check of the patients’ medical record (see 
“Investigator Representation for Review of Protected Health Information Preparatory to 
Research” form). If eligibility is confirmed, the patient will be scheduled for their initial study 
visit and registered with OnCore by the study staff. The informed consent form will be mailed to 
the patient prior to the initial visit so that he or she can read it in detail, if requested by the 
participant. Eligible participants will provide written informed consent at the baseline visit prior 
to participation in the study. The consenting process will be performed by one of the trial’s 
clinical investigators. 
3.1Eligibility Criteria 
Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to 
participate in the study:
3.1.1 Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy with removal of at least one adenoma; 
3.1.2 Age 18-80 years. 
This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in children 
is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct biological 
mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults. Patients over age 80 will 
not be enrolled since the benefits and risks of AMR101 over the age of 80 have not yet 
been well-characterized.
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
123.1.3 The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason, 
women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of 
study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
3.1.4 Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.
3.1.5 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
3.2Exclusion Criteria
Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for 
admission into the study.
3.2.1 Currently using or have used any fish oil supplement at any dose more than once per week 
within the last month.
3.2.2 Regularly consuming more than three servings of fish per week.
3.2.3 History of allergic reactions attributed to fish or compounds of similar chemical or biologic 
composition to omega-3 fatty acid. 
3.2.4 Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney disease, bleeding diathesis
3.2.5 Any prior diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (including esophageal, small intestine, 
colon, pancreatic), or any diagnosis of other cancers (with the exception of non-
melanoma skin) in which there has been any active treatment within the last three years.
3.2.6 Known diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Non-Polyposis 
Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome).
3.2.7 Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.
3.2.8 Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease) or history of peptic ulcer 
or gastrointestinal bleed requiring hospitalization, endoscopic complications, or 
contraindication to colonoscopy.
3.2.9 Current use of anticoagulant therapies, including Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin sodium, 
Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an 
unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.
3.2.10 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
133.2.11 Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of fish oil supplements or to 
provide blood, urine or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.
3.2.12 Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.
3.2.13 Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.
3.2.14 Pregnant or breastfeeding.
The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, 
women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of 
study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she 
is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 
Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but 
potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother 
with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is 
enrolled on the study.
3.2.15 Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or 
acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.
Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased risk of 
significant complications in the perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from 
patients with these infections cannot be harvested for research purposes, per 
institutional policy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving 
combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
3.3Inclusion of Women and Minorities
Women and minorities will be eligible for this study without alteration in eligibility criteria. 
Enrollment of these underrepresented populations to this trial will be encouraged.
4.REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
4.1General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions

5.TREATMENT PLAN
5.1Treatment Regimen
After study registration, eligible participants will be assigned unique study identification numbers. 
The investigator will contact the MGH Research Pharmacy for drug dispensation. The MGH 
Research Pharmacy will dispense study capsules, obtained from Amarin Pharma (Bedminster, NJ), 
containing 0.5-gram of AMR101. The assigned dosage will not change over the course of the study 
unless dose reduction is indicated (See Section 6). The first dose of the study medication will be 
given to patients after the initial flexible sigmoidoscopy. Participants will be expected to take 4 
capsules orally, twice a day, until the return for their final visit (minimum 8 weeks, maximum 12 
weeks). The final visit, 8-12 weeks from the baseline visit, will be scheduled during or before the 
baseline visit. The MGH Research Pharmacy will assign the participant three bottles of AMR101 
each containing 240 capsules (12 weeks, 8 capsules/day) and participants will return any unused 
capsules and the bottle to the study staff at their final visit. The bottle will be labeled with their 
participant ID. The participant number must be recorded on the drug dispensation form  and in the 
participants case report form (CRF). These numbers are unique to each participant and must not 
be re-assigned. Remaining capsules will be counted as a measure of compliance, the number

used to monitor adherence and adverse events. Patients who initiate fish oil supplements during 
the study will be withdrawn and an exit visit performed.
Compliance will be assessed based on drug diary and pills counts, as well as blood measurement 
of EPA levels. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7. No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies may be administered with the intent to treat the 
participants. The principal investigator will review subjects’ data periodically throughout the 
duration of the study for quality, validity and integrity assurance and for adherence to the IRB

7.ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in 
addition to routine reporting.
7.1Expected Toxicities
AMR101 may produce a hypersensitivity reaction in individuals with known hypersensitivity to 
shellfish/fish. Because AMR101 contains ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acid, patients taking other 
anticoagulants may be at risk to develop a prolonged bleeding time; the risk of active bleeding is 
unknown.
7.1.1Adverse Events List(s)
7.1.1.1Adverse Event List(s) for AMR101
AMR101 is usually well tolerated. According to Micromedex, arthralgia was one of the most 
commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of AMR101 occurring in 2.3% (14/622) 
of patients compared with 1% (3/109) in placebo in pooled data from 2 double-blind clinical trials, 
which included patients with triglyceride values of 200 to 2000 mg/dL. An additional adverse 
effect from clinical studies was oropharyngeal pain. Mild to moderate GI-related adverse events

8.PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.
8.1AMR101
8.1.1Description
The active ingredient of AMR101 is EPA ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl). The molecular formula is 
C22H34O2, and its molecular weight is 330.51. Its structural formula is:
Icosapent ethyl is de-esterified during absorption into the active metabolite EPA. EPA is 
absorbed in the small interesting through the thoracic duct lymphatic system into the circulation. 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
21The Tmax of EPA was about 5 hours following oral administration of icosapent ethyl. EPA is 
metabolized in the liver by beta-oxidation into acetyl Coenzyme A, which is converted into 
energy via the Krebs cycle. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism is a minor pathway of 
elimination. The total plasma clearance of EPA at steady state is 684 mL/hr. The elimination 
half-life of EPA is about 89 hours.
8.1.2Form
The trial AMR101 (icosapent ethyl) capsules are manufactured and supplied by Amarin Pharma 
(Bedminster, NJ) as 0.5-gram amber-colored soft-gelatin capsules. The capsules will be ordered 
by and shipped to the MGH Research Pharmacy where they will be packaged in three pill bottles 
each containing 240 capsules, which are sufficient for 12-week supply where 8 capsules are 
taken daily.
8.1.3Storage and Stability
AMR101 capsules should be stored at room temperature. When stored under this condition, it 
has been indicated that the product is stable and non-reactive.

acid among 448 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. AMR101 will be supplied by 
Amarin Pharma and stored in the MGH research pharmacy per institutional guidelines. The 
research pharmacist will be responsible for dispensing the study medication to participants. 
8.1.10Accountability
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator (i.e., research 
pharmacist), must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the agent using 
the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF) or another comparable drug accountability 
form.  (See the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and 
Storage.)
8.1.11Destruction and Return
At the end of the study, unused supplies of AMR101 should be destroyed according to 
institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug Accountability Record Form. 
9.BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES
9.1Biomarker Studies
9.1.1Background
We hypothesize that EPA modulates the gut microbiota to preserve gut immune homeostasis and 
suppress colorectal cancer. The proposed study will assess the influence of EPA treatment on the 
tissue fatty acid composition, the gut microbiome and metabolome, gene expression in colorectal 
cancer tissue, and urinary PGE-M. In doing so, we aim to provide causality for the anticancer 
mechanisms of EPA established by other studies. We and others have put forth considerable 
efforts to determine measurable biomarkers implicated in the microbial and immune mechanisms 
linking EPA and colorectal cancer. A discussion of these biomarkers and their significance is 
provided below:
9.1.1.1EPA in colorectal tissue
Increasing data suggest that the anticancer effect of EPA relates to its incorporation into the cell 
membrane phospholipids and alteration of the structure and function of the lipid rafts.34,35 High 
intake of EPA results in increased incorporation of EPA and replacement of arachidonic acid 
(AA) in membrane phospholipids. This alteration has two consequences: 1) suppressed 
biosynthesis of AA-derived inflammatory eicosanoids in favor of EPA-derived prostanoids; 2) 
enhanced competition with omega-6 fatty acids for cyclooxygenases that leads to higher 
production of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. Given the critical role of inflammation in 
colorectal cancer development and progression, EPA-induced shift from pro-inflammatory to 
anti-inflammatory metabolite profiles may protect against tumorigenesis.36 Moreover, EPA can 
modify membrane lipid rafts, which are lipidic microdomains consisting mainly of 
sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and glycerophospholipids that hold many signaling proteins.37 These 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
23microdomains are involved in a myriad of cellular functions, such as signal transduction, 
membrane trafficking, neuronal differentiation, and entry of pathogens and toxins into the cells. 
EPA has been shown to target a number of lipid raft proteins, thereby modulating the signaling 
pathways critical for tumor growth and metastasis. In particular, given the role of lipid rafts as 
platforms for cell activation in the immune system,38 animal and in vitro studies indicate that 
EPA can influence intracellular signaling in T lymphocytes by modification of the architecture of 
lipid rafts.39-41 However, the relevance of these findings to the immunomodulatory effect of EPA 
in human cancer remains to be determined. Therefore, to establish the mechanistic foundation for 
testing downstream immune modulation, we will assess the effect of AMR101 treatment on the 
fatty acid composition in colorectal tissues as the primary endpoint. 
9.1.1.2EPA and the gut microbiome
Increasing data indicate that the gut microbiota mediates the health effects of dietary components 
by shaping the intestinal and systemic immune response.42-45 As summarized in Table 2, both 
animal and human studies support the role of EPA in influencing the gut microbial composition 
and function. Compared to other types of fat, EPA have been associated with enhanced intestinal 
microbiota diversity and EPA-rich diet ameliorates ω-6 PUFAs- or antibiotics-induced 
dysbiosis.26-29 Animal studies indicate that EPA supplements increase the abundance of anti-
inflammatory bacteria, such as lactic acid-producing bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacteria), and decrease the abundance of immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory 
bacteria, such as F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and Akkermansia. Likewise, changes in the gut 
microbiota have been linked to CRC, with an enrichment of F. nucleatum, Escherichia coli, and 
Enterobacteriaceae; and a depletion of Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus in CRC patients.46-54 
Microbes may affect carcinogenesis by influencing DNA damage repair,55-57 cell 
proliferation,58,59 host metabolism,60-62 and immune responses.31,63-65 Moreover, recent data show 
that commensal bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria, may modulate tumor immune 
microenvironment and improve the efficiency of CTLA-4 or PD-L1 blockade.30,66,67

9.1.1.3EPA, microbiota, and stool metabolomics
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
24Anaerobic gut bacteria, including some species of Lactobacillus, have been implicated in 
polyunsaturated fatty acid saturation, a detoxifying mechanism that transforms bacterial growth-
inhibiting polyunsaturated fatty acids into less toxic fatty acids, such as hydroxyl fatty acids.86-92 
These microbial metabolites may help preserve intestinal barrier integrity, reduce oxidative 
stress, and lower inflammation.93,94 Interestingly, Lactobacillus is selectively enriched by EPA 
(Table 2), suggesting a reciprocal mechanism by which gut microbes adapt to host dietary 
change with functional consequences for host health. Moreover, a cross-feeding effect has been 
noted between human Bifidobacterium, which produces lactate and acetate, and the butyrate-
producing species, such as Eubacterium rectale, which convert lactate to butyrate.95-97 Butyrate, 
a short-chain fatty acid, has potent anti-inflammatory98 and potential anti-CRC properties.61,99 
In addition to microbial products, host cell metabolites can be shed into the gut lumen, including 
a series of EPA-derived eicosanoids (e.g., PGE 3, lipoxin, leukotriene [LT], thromboxane [TX], 
and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [HETE]) and lipid mediators (including resolvin, protectin, and 
maresin) that possess anti-inflammatory activities and may mediate the anticancer effect of 
EPA.100-105 Of note, some lipid mediators, such as resolvin, may alter the gut microbial 
composition by stimulating epithelial expression of microbial regulators, such as intestinal 
alkaline phosphatase (IAP),106 a transmissible factor with lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-detoxifying 
activities.78  Thus, stool metabolomics provides a critical tool to examine the products and 
functionality of the diet – gut microbiota – host interaction. 
9.1.1.4Gene expression profile – immune and inflammatory pathways
Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 are central players in colon cancer through 
activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3.107,108 EPA have 
multifaceted roles in immune regulation.15 High EPA intake has been associated with lower 
circulating inflammatory markers (e.g., TNFα and IL6).109,110 In a pilot study of women at high 
risk for breast cancer, EPA supplements decreased breast tissue expression of chemokine C-C 
motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2),111 a cancer-promoting cytokine.112 As described above, our 
prior study indicated that EPA might protect against colon cancer through downregulation of the 
immunosuppressive Treg cells.24 However, despite these data, human data linking EPA to 
colorectal cancer-related immune and inflammatory pathways are lacking. Therefore, to fill this 
knowledge gap and extend our prior findings, we will examine the effect of EPA treatment on 
the gene expression profile of colorectal tissue. We hypothesize that EPA treatment reduces the 
gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF, IL6 and CCL2).
9.1.1.5. Urinary PGE-M
A mechanism underlying EPA’s immunomodulatory effect may be related to reduced synthesis 
of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) by tumor epithelial cells and/or tumoral stromal cells.35 PGE 2 
promotes tumor cell survival and is higher in cancer cells than in normal cells.113  PGE 2 
contributes to a shift in the tumor microenvironment from anti-tumor to tumor-permissive.20 
PGE 2 may promote immunosuppression by inducing FOXP3 expression in naïve T cells114-116 
and inducing differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Both 
animal17,18,117,118 and human RCTs14,119 indicate that EPA treatment reduces circulating and 
colonic tissue PGE 2 levels. A clinical trial showed that EPA treatment reduced urinary 
prostaglandin metabolites (PGE-M), a marker of systemic PGE 2 production, by 27.6% compared 
with a 27.9% increase in the placebo group.120

259.1.2Study design
Using our gastroenterology practice population, we will implement a prospective clinical trial to 
measure the effect of EPA on tissue fatty acid composition, the gut microbiome and metabolome, 
gene expression profile, and urinary PGE-M. At MGH, we will target 80 individuals over a two 
year period. Eligible patients will have had a previous colonoscopy at MGH and had at least one 
adenoma removed during the previous procedure. Eligible patients must meet all eligibility 
requirements and none of the exclusion criteria as outlined in Section 3: Eligibility criteria. 
9.1.2.1Prior to the initial visit
No bowel preparation will be necessary for the procedure since the sigmoidoscope will only be 
advanced to the distal sigmoid colon.
9.1.2.2Initial (baseline) Visit
At the initial visit,  the study physician will obtain written, informed consent for the study as well 
as a standard clinical consent for a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Following OnCore registration, 
participants will be asked to complete with a study coordinator a brief lifestyle questionnaire as 
well as a nutritional survey on a research iPad via VioScreenTM, a validated web-based dietary 
assessment tool developed by Viocare, Inc (See appendix for VioScreen security overview, the 
assessed food list, and sample screens).121 Patients will undergo measurements of height, weight, 
waist and hip circumference and provide a blood and urine specimen. A study gastroenterologist 
will then perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy, advancing to the level of the distal sigmoid colon. No 
more than a total of 24 mucosal biopsies will be taken from the rectum and sigmoid and 
immediately placed in collection tubes. In the MGH GI Unit, we routinely perform endoscopic 
biopsies regardless of concurrent AMR101 use, a practice consistent with recommended 
guidelines.122 A study of the safety of multiple endoscopic biopsies in research subjects from a 
National Institutes of Health series found that performing large numbers of endoscopic biopsies 
(mean number = 38.2 ± 15.6 biopsies per procedure) are “well tolerated and appears to have no 
more than minimal risk without appreciably increasing the risk of otherwise routine endoscopy.”123 
Furthermore, there is no statistically significant association between risk of complications and the 
number of biopsies, type of procedure (flexible sigmoidoscopy vs. colonoscopy), colonic location 
of biopsy, operator, or polypectomy.123 The number of biopsies is also consistent with our existing 
study protocols and has never been associated with any adverse events (See: “Endoscopy Protocol: 
Tissue Specific Immunity Against HIV-1”; PI: Kwon, Ragon Institute). We have estimated that 
24 biopsies will be necessary to complete the proposed analyses. The RNAseq experiments 
proposed require a minimum of 4 pinch biopsies for each sample. The additional biopsies will be 
required for validation experiments based on the results of genomic and metagenomic analyses 
using targeted sequencing approaches. Due to the small number of cells obtained from pinch 
biopsies and the input requirements for these assays, we may use tissue culture techniques to 
expand cell populations. This will allow us to perform these comprehensive analyses without 
additional burden to the participants (i.e. increasing tissue yields by using larger or more biopsies). 
During flexible sigmoidoscopy, stool will be aspirated through the endoscope or using a Roth net 
and snap-frozen. . Following the visit, questionnaire data will be transferred to the Partners secure 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
26REDCap electronic database system. Also, REDCap will be used to store data from the study 
including endoscopy data, medical history information, sample collection, and more.
Participants will be provided with $100 (US) compensation and free parking for up to 4 hours for 
this initial visit.  The final visit will be scheduled with the patient at his or her convenience.
9.1.2.3Final Visit
Participants will return for a second and final visit between 8 and 12 weeks from their initial visit. 
An abbreviated lifestyle questionnaire and a full nutritional survey via VioScreen will be 
administered to update information from the baseline visit. Participants will also provide blood 
and urine samples and undergo a second flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure with mucosal biopsies. 
A bowel preparation will not be necessary for the follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 24 
mucosal biopsies will be taken, as described for the baseline visit. A stool specimen will also be 
collected, as previously described. 
Participants will be provided with an additional $100 (US) compensation and free parking for up 
to 4 hours for this final visit. Total compensation will equal $200 (US) for successful completion 
with the study. 
9.1.3Collection and Processing of Biospecimens
Immediately following each flexible sigmoidoscopy, urine specimens will be aliquoted and 
blood specimens will be centrifuged into plasma and buffy coat. Stool specimens will be stored 
in a cryovial and immediately frozen. Colon biopsies will be immediately frozen for future 
RNA-seq analysis. Yield from these procedures typically exceeds requirements for RNA-seq. 
Thus, any excess colon tissue will be banked for future studies. All aliquots of stool, urine, 
plasma, buffy coat, and tissue will be frozen at -80°C until analysis. We may access FFPE blocks 
of polyps/adenomas removed during the participant’s qualifying colonoscopy with 
accompanying pathology reports to correlate our findings with tissue-specific markers in the 
original adenoma.
Blood samples will be collected in two-6 mL EDTA/purple top tubes at each visit, stored on ice 
until processing and freezing (within 3 hours of collection). Immediately upon receipt, urine 
specimens will be aliquoted into 1.2 mL aliquots and stool samples will be homogenized, 
aliquoted into 100 mg aliquots, and frozen for long-term storage. Fresh tissue will be collected in 
the pathology laboratory immediately following resection, transported on wet ice and 
immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. We may access archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) blocks of any biopsies or tissue specimens collected during the participant’s 
procedures that led to their diagnosis of colon cancer if the diagnostic procedures occurred at 
MGH. If the diagnostic procedures occurred at an external site, formal requests in writing will be 
made to the corresponding pathology department to release and ship tissue to study staff. We will 
request whole tissue blocks or 10-15 unstained slides. All samples will be transported to the 
laboratory of Dr. Andrew Chan and labeled with a study identification number, the date, and the 
type of specimen. Dr. Chan’s laboratory will supervise all storage of coded specimens. All 
endpoint analysis will occur at the end of the trial as described for each endpoint below:

13.STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This study is a single-arm clinical trial that will measure the effects of EPA treatment on specific 
biomarkers related to EPA incorporation, gut microbiota, gut metabolome, and immune response. 
In doing so, we aim to provide causality for the microbial and immune mechanisms that potentially 
mediate the beneficial effect of EPA for colorectal cancer prevention. We and others have put forth 
considerable effort to determine measurable biomarkers implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. 
A comprehensive discussion of these biomarkers and their significance is provided in Section 9. 
We will recruit 80 participants who recently underwent removal of their adenomatous polyps at 
MGH to conduct a single-arm trial of EPA (AMR101, 4 g/day) treatment for 2 months. The 
rationale for selection of this EPA preparation is because it 1) is FDA approved; 2) has good 
comparability across production lots; 3) has been previously used in several trials of EPA.111,132 
The rationale for selection of this dose is because it is 1) the prescription dose approved by FDA; 
2) consistent with other RCTs of EPA in colorectal neoplasia;13,120,133 and 3) can provide the best 
balance of efficacy and safety. 
13.1Study Design/Endpoints
This study is a single-arm trial of EPA treatment in patients with a history of colorectal adenoma. 
NCI Protocol #: N/A
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-402
Protocol Version Date: 12/10/2021
34The single-arm design is chosen for the following reasons: 1) Based on our prior experience, 
short-term dietary supplementation is unlikely to lead to substantial changes in lifestyle. 2) Any 
major lifestyle changes will be documented by the detailed lifestyle questionnaires and 
nutritional surveys administered at both the baseline (pre-intervention) and final (post-
intervention) visits to allow for statistical adjustment in the analysis. Moreover, as described in 
the protocol, we will measure EPA content in red blood cells to further assess compliance and 
changes in omega-3 fatty acid intake. 3) Given the high dose (4 g/day) of highly purified and 
specially formulated omega-3 fatty acid used in the study (AMR101), even modest changes in 
lifestyle is unlikely to introduce significant confounding on the intervention effect of interest. For 
example, one serving (3 oz.) of Atlantic salmon only contains 1-2g of marine omega-3 fatty 
acids, and individuals have to consume at least 3 servings of salmon per day to achieve the 
intervention dose used in the study. 4) Given the fishy odor and oily appearance of the study 
drug, our MGH Research Pharmacy is unable to provide a visually identical, blinded placebo 
capsule for the study drug. Therefore, given all of these considerations as well as the biomarker-
based nature of the study, we believe that the single-arm design is the best use of the limited 
resources for the study.
The primary aim is to assess the effect of AMR101 treatment on our primary efficacy endpoint, 
mucosal tissue EPA. A detailed discussion of the background of this biomarker is provided in 
Section 9.1.1.1. Briefly, we will determine the effect of AMR101 at standard dose on mucosal 
tissue EPA content through pre- and post-treatment comparison. The rationale for selection of 
this primary endpoint is to specifically test the effect of EPA on colonic tissue, which will build 
the mechanistic foundation for testing downstream endpoints within the local environment. 
Additional endpoints will include the gut microbiome, metabolome, urinary PGE-M and gene 
expression profile of mucosal tissue. Our study design for each of these endpoints is 
comprehensively discussed in Section 9. Statistical considerations relating to these endpoints are 
provided in the following sections. 
13.2Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration
Patients will be accrued in one stage with no early stopping rules. The total sample size is 80 
patients and we expect accrual to be 6-7 participants per month and complete the enrollment 
process within one year. This accrual rate is based upon accruals under our recently completed 
IRB-approved protocol (Protocol # 14-496; Dr. Chan, PI) for a similar trial of aspirin in patients 
with history of colorectal adenoma. Each patient will be followed for at minimum 8 weeks and at 
maximum 12 weeks. This total sample size accounts for participant drop out, as endoscopy studies 
typical experience a drop-out rate of approximately 10%.
The sample size is based upon the primary efficacy endpoint of M3PUFA supplement at 4 g/d 
increasing mucosal MO3PUFA composition from pre- to post-treatment period by a mean of 3.0%, 
according to previous studies.13,134 The null hypothesis is H 0: Δpost – Δ pre = 0 versus H A: Δpost – Δ pre 
≠ 0, where Δ pre and Δ post are the measurement of mucosal MO3PUFA composition before and after 
the intervention, respectively. Based on prior studies, we assume the standard deviation (SD) of 
9.0% for the paired difference in MO3PUFA measurement. With 80% power and the significance 
level of 0.05 in a two-sided paired t-test, we will require 73 participants to detect the mean change 
of 3.0% in MO3PUFA level from pre- to post-treatment period. To account for possible drop out 
NCI Protocol #: N/A

35at 10%, we plan to enroll 80 patients.
Our accrual target rates for ethnic and racial minorities will likely be consistent with the rate at 
which we see these minorities in the gastroenterology practice at MGH. (See table on next page)

13.5Analysis of Primary Endpoints
Analysis of mucosal tissue EPA (primary endpoint): Our primary biostatistician, Dr. Rosner, will 
supervise statistical analyses assessing the change in EPA levels in mucosal tissue after AMR101 
treatment, using a paired t-test. In secondary analyses, we will use mixed linear regression 
models to adjust for duration of treatment and other major factors that may influence the gut 
microbiome, including aspirin use, antibiotic use, and major dietary and lifestyle patterns (e.g., 
fiber intake, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol intake). A robust variance 
estimate will be used to eliminate any normality assumptions for the residuals.
13.6Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Microbiome analysis: Dr. Huttenhower will supervise the gut microbiome analysis. Stool 
specimens collected before and after treatment will undergo metagenomics and 
metatranscriptomics sequencing to assess the influence of EPA intervention on the gut microbial 
NCI Protocol #: N/A

36composition and function. We will use the computational tools developed by Dr. Huttenhower, a 
leading authority in microbiome data analysis ( http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/biobakery).  
We will associate treatment status with the microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
determined by MetaPhlAn135 using biomarker discovery tests: LEfSe (Linear Discriminant 
Analysis Effect Size),136 a univariate class comparison method; and MaAsLin (Multivariate 
Analysis by Linear models),137 a multivariate test that finds associations between clinical metadata 
and microbial abundance or function after adjusting for other covariates. Metatranscriptomic data 
will be analyzed using HUM138AnN,139 a software package designed to efficiently and accurately 
define the abundance of microbial pathways within the community, and then linked to treatment 
status by linear mixed effects model. We expect to find that, after EPA treatment, study participants 
will have increased gut bacterial diversity, experience beneficial changes in microbiota composition, 
and demonstrate decreased transcriptional activity of inflammatory pathways that have been 
previously correlated with an increased risk of colon cancer. 
Analysis of gene expression profiles: Dr. Huttenhower will supervise gene expression analysis. 
Tissues collected after treatment will undergo RNA-sequencing analysis to assess the influence 
of EPA intervention on gene expression profile of colon cancer. Samples are quantified and 
RNA quality is evaluated using Agilent's Bioanalyzer 2100. The percentage of fragments with a 
size greater than 200 nucleotides (DV 200) are calculated; samples with a DV 200 score < 30% are 
included, as the likelihood of success is dramatically reduced. 100ng of RNA is used as the input 
for first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) 
and Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit. Synthesis of the second strand of 
cDNA is followed by indexed adapter ligation. Subsequent PCR amplification enriches for 
adapted fragments. The amplified libraries are quantified using a Qubit assay (Life 
Technologies) and assessed for quality on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (DNA 
1000 chip). 200ng of each cDNA library is combined into two 4-plex pools. Illumina’s Coding 
Exome Oligos that target the exome are added and hybridized on a thermacycler. Following 
hybridization, streptavidin beads are used to capture probes that are hybridized. Two wash steps 
effectively remove any non-specifically bound products. These hybridization, capture, and wash 
steps are repeated to assure high specificity. A second round of amplification enriches the 
captured libraries. qPCR is performed on the pooled libraries and normalized to 2nM. The 
normalized, pooled libraries are loaded onto a HiSeq2500 for a target of 50 million 2x76bp 
paired reads per sample. RNA-Seq libraries will be analyzed using Tophat, Cufflinks140 and 
other new statistical packages to identify consistent differences in the end-of-treatment changes 
in transcript levels between tissues before and after EPA treatment at pre-determined FDRs on 
the order of 0.01. Stringent tests for statistically significant differences in RNA levels between 
samples are built into the algorithms for RNA-seq analysis.
Analysis of stool metabolomics: We will use both the non-targeted Global Metabolomics and the 
TrueMass™ Complex Lipid Panel (Metabolon, Inc.) to examine the effect of intervention on the 
stool metabolite profile.  The Global Metabolomics platform quickly and accurately identifies 
and quantitates more than 1,000 metabolites with less than 4.5% median process variability and 
is compatible with almost any sample type. The TrueMass™ Complex Lipid Panel provides 
absolute quantitation of 14 lipid classes, including principle phospholipid, sphingolipid and 
neutral lipid classes. It also provides molecular species concentrations and complete fatty acid
composition of each lipid class, thereby offering unparalleled insight into the lipidome. The

37resultant data will be imported into Surveyor Web Tools (Metabolon, Inc.) for intuitive data 
visualization and easier interpretation. We will also use the MetaboLync® Client Portal provided 
by Metabolon, Inc. to perform comprehensive, in-depth analysis, such as the heat map tool, the 
pathway enrichment tool, and the Pathway Visualizations Tool. The treatment effect on 
metabolites (log-transformed whenever needed) will be first assessed by paired t-test and then by 
linear mixed effects model that includes treatment status (pre/post-treatment), duration of 
treatment, and other major factors that may influence the metabolomics, including major dietary 
and lifestyle patterns (e.g., fiber intake, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol 
intake).
Analysis of Urinary PGE-M: We will measure PGE-M (11a-hydroxy-9, 15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-
tetranor-prostane 1,20-dioic acid) levels in baseline/pre-treatment and post-treatment urine 
samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) as previously described.141 
0.5mL of each urine specimen will be stabilized by conversion to the O-methyloxime derivative 
and purified by C18 solid phase extraction with subsequent addition of the O-methyloxime 
derivatized deuterium-labeled internal standard (custom synthesis). Liquid chromatography (LC) 
will be performed on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.0 × 50 mm, 1.7μm particle, Waters 
Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) connected to a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system and 
delivered to a Waters Xevo TQ-S Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters 
Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).

Product Background
VioScreen is a scientifically validated, dietary assessment tool that generates an accurate analysis 
of a subject’s dietary behavior in about 20 minutes.
The assessment allows for the evaluation of subjects against a typical North American diet. This 
graphical online assessment consists of approximately 1,200 food images. Subjects are shown a 
set of foods within a food group from which they select only foods consumed at least once a 
month over the past three months. For each food identified, the system prompts the subject to 
select the frequency and portion size typically consumed. When needed, VioScreen branches to 
collect more relevant data. For example, if the subject lists “coffee,” VioScreen prompts to see if 
sugar or milk is added and, if so, what kind of milk.
Subject responses are digitally stored in real time, verified for completeness, and analyzed to 
create an accurate and detailed nutritional profile with over 160 nutrient and food components, 
top foods with key nutrients, current and recommended eating patterns, Body Mass Index and 
Estimated Energy Requirement. Responses and analysis are immediately accessible to the 
researcher via VioScreen’s administrative interface. This straight through process eliminates the 
need for lengthy and costly interviews or error prone paper-based questionnaire processing.
VioScreen’s administrative interface is not just for data access, it makes the management of the 
entire process easy. Researchers are able to define organizations and protocols, assign user roles, 
import subject data, view results and export results to a standard file format for import to 
analytical software.
Hosting Environment & Backup
All data is stored in the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server database. The web server and 
database server reside on their own secure environments separated from other servers through a 
secure router implementation. All server access requires individual user level access via VPN, 
each user is required to update their password after 45 days, and all access is logged and 
reported. The application and database is backed up through highly secure cloud based services. 
The servers are cloud based and each server’s operating system (Windows OS) is updated as new 
patches are released. HIPAA compliance is supported through the use of tools like Idera's SQL 
Server Compliance Manager for auditing sensitive data, monitoring alerts, and potential threat 
detection. Any unauthorized access to any environment or application is reported and tracked 
within the Windows OS.
System & Data Access
VioScreen is web-based application so there is nothing to install or manage. It has interactive 
data input and retrieval over the internet via transport layer security so the only requirement is an 
internet connection and access to www.vioscreen.com. All access to the application is secured 
through encrypted password access and each session is timed out after 15 minutes of inactivity

Upon account setup new customers will receive a study administrator account. This account 
allows the study administrator to do many things including manage their account, set privileges, 
define protocols, create local administrators and create subjects. As part of the protocol 
definition, the study administrator is able to create subjects by a unique SubjectID to ensure 
participant confidentiality. All data is available in real-time to researchers via the export 
functionality available via the administrative functionality. Data is exported to a .csv format for 
easy import to any analysis software.

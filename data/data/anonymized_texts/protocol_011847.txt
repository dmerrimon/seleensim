OBJECTIVES  
Primary:  
To evaluate the safety of transplantation of expanded autologous MSC -NTF cells administered on a single 
occasion via combined intrathecal (IT) administration and 24 intramuscular (IM) injections given into the right  
biceps and triceps muscles in patients w ith ALS .   
Secondary:  
To compare the change in slopes from the pre -transplantation period to the post -transplantation period  in ALSFRS -
R between the treatment and placebo groups through 24 weeks post -transplantation . 
To compare the change in slopes from t he pre -transplantation period to the post -transplantation period  in SVC 
between the treatment and placebo groups through 24 weeks post -transplantation . 
To compare the slope of the rate of decline in the ALSFRS -R at 24 weeks following transplantation relative to the 
12-16 week baseline period before transplantation in all patients (both treatment and placebo groups) . 
To compare the slope of the rate of decline in S VC at 24 weeks following transplantation relative to the 12 -16 
week baseline period befor e transplantation in all patients (both treatment and placebo groups).  
METHODOLOGY  
Study Design  This is a Phase II randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter study that will 
be conducted in 48 patients with early ALS (ALSFRS -R scores of ≥30) at up to 3 study 
sites.  After providing informed consent, each patient will undergo approximate ly 12-16 
week  baseline period during which monthly ALSFRS -R scores and SVCs will be obtained. 
During this period of time their bone -marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal 
cells will be isolated and expanded. Twelve to 1 6 weeks after screening, patients will 
undergo transplantation with their autologous MSC -NTF or matching placebo; product will 
be administered both intrathecally as well as intramuscularly as 24 IM injections given into the right  biceps and triceps muscles,  all at a single study visit.  Following treatment they will 
have up to  six monthly visits at which the AL SFRS-R and SVC will be obtained, along with 
vital signs, laboratory tests and recording of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs, see scheme below) .

Duration  Each participant will be followed -up for three months pre -and six months post 
transplantation; thus, each participant’s study participation will last for approximately 9 
months.  The expected study duration (taking into account the limitations of the 
manuf acturing site which is expected to be able to process approximately 2 -4 patients per 
month), the entire study duration is expected to be approximately 12- 16 months.  
Study Drug and Formulation  Study drug will be supplied in:  
• Twenty four 1ml syringes , each  containing 2 x10
6 MSC -NTF cells in 200 µl (10 x106 
cells/mL ) or the same number of syringes containing placebo for IM administration.  
• One 5 ml syringe containing 4 ml of MSC -NTF cell suspension at a dose of 100- 125 
x106 cells or a 5 ml syringe containing placebo for IT administration.  
Dose and Route of Administration  Study drug is to be delivered by IM and IT administration.  
The MSC -NTF cell dose is :  
• 100-125 x10
6 cells by IT administration  
• 48 x106 cells by IM administration.  
• Participants  randomized to placebo will receive both IT and the same number of IM 
injections . 
Concomitant and 
Excluded Therapy  Study participants will be on a stable dose of r iluzole for at least 30 days prior to screening 
or not taking riluzole at all, nor plan to b egin riluzole during the study period.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 8 STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS  
Efficacy  All efficacy analyses will use one -sided alpha = 0.10 tests and present one -sided 90% 
lower confidence limits and two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the difference 
between treatments as well as two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the point 
estimates within each treatment group. All summaries will be presented by treatment 
group.   
Secondary Objectives: The change in slope from pre -transplantation to post -transplantation 
in ALSFRS -R and in SVC (as a percent of normal for age and sex) will be est imated using 
the mixed linear statistical model. The fixed effect variables in the model will be:  
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre- treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values) ; 
• Treatment ; 
• Two-way interactions between visit & post- treatment indicator, (0 for pre -
treatment visits, 1 for post -treatment visits) and visit & treatment;   
• Three -way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment;  
• Site.   
The repeated measur es within a subject over visit will also be accounted for in the model, 
wherein the covariance structure will be evaluated using Bayesian information criterion 
(BIC). Covariance structures to be evaluated are: unstructured, toeplitz, spatial power with 
day, and compound symmetry .  
The three -way interaction between visit & post- treatment visit indicator & treatment will 
be used to compare the change in slope in the treatment group to the change in slope in the placebo group.  
The post -pre slope estimate for t he active treatment group will be used to test the change 
from pre-transplantation to post- transplantation within the active treatment group . 
Exploratory Objectives:  The analysis for EIM (optional) and HHD will employ the same modeling approach as describ ed above for the secondary objectives.  The analysis for 
HHD will be based on a combined score reflecting muscles in the right  arm.   
A further analysis of HHD will compare the score for the right  arm to the score for the left 
arm.  The linear mixed model will include, in addition to the terms described above, an 
indicator for " right  arm", interactions between that indicator and all other variables in the 
model, and a random effect term for the rig ht arm indicator.  
Safety  The proportion of subjects having each AE will be compared between treatment groups 
using Fisher’s exact tests.  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, baseline will be defined as the last 
measurement prior to transplantation (i.e., prior to treatment).  
Physical examination, neurological examination, hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs , 
ECG and concomitant medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, mini mum, and maximum) if the data is continuous and 
using counts and percentages if the data is discrete.  Shifts from baseline in categorization 
of results (e.g. normal/abnormal or low/normal/high)  will also be summarized.

6.1. INTRODUCTION 
6.1.1. Background  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurological disease. There is currently no 
available treatment to stop or reverse its progressive course. There remains an unmet 
medical need for safe and effective treatments for people with ALS.  
Based on putative pathophysiol ogic mechanisms, there are several therapies under 
investigation such as anti -glutamatergic agents, drugs targeting protein misfolding and 
accumulation, antioxidant therapy, immunomodulatory agents, and stem cell transplantation . 
Cyto -therapy may hold the key to circumventing multiple hurdles in the ALS 
pathophysiological cascade (Morren JA et al. 2012). Apart from the replacement of lost or damaged motor neurons, stem cell implantation therapy may benefit ALS patients by an independent effect of cytoprotec tion. Experimental data has shown that non- neuronal cell 
replacement can be a strategic therapy in promoting motor neuron survival and improved neuromuscular function (Corti S et al. 2010). 
Neurotrophic factors secreting m esenchymal stromal cells  (MSC -NTF ) cells are a novel 
cell-therapeutic approach which aims to effectively deliver NTF directly to the site of 
damage in ALS patients.   The MSC -NTF cell therapy (NurOwn) is based on transplantation of autologous bone 
marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) , which are enriched from the 
mononuclear fraction of the patients’ own bone marrow, propagated ex vivo  and induced 
to secrete NTF such as Glial Derived Growth Factor (GDNF) and Brain Derived Growth 
Factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VE GF) and Hepatocyte growth 
factor ( HGF). These cells are thus designated MSC -NTF  cells .  
The autologous MSC -NTF cells are back -transplanted into the ALS patient into the site s 
of damage, the spinal cord and/or the muscles, where axon terminals will take up the 
neurotrophic factors secreted by the transplanted cells. In the muscles, the transplanted cells are close to the motor -end plates at the axon terminals, and in the spinal  cord the cells 
are close to the cell bodies. Axon terminals take up the NTF and transport them 
retrogradely along the axons into the neuron cell bodies, thus aiming to prevent further degeneration of the neuronal cells.  
NTFs are potent survival factors f or embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are 
considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the 
immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.  
6.1.2. Summary of Previous Clinical Experience with MSC -NTF cell transplantation  
An open- label, two patient -group Phase 1/2 trial of MSC -NTF in 12 people with ALS, has

The interim safety report for the first 12 patients in the Phase  1/2 clinical trial, submitted 
to the Israel  Ministry of Health (MOH), indicated that MSC -NTF cells treatment, either by 
IM or IT administration was  generally well tolerated for 6 months. No treatment -related 
adverse events (AE) were reported in the 12 patients treated by either route of administration .  
In this study a trend towards a decreased rate of decline on ALSFRS and FVC efficacy measures in the IT treated patients ove r 6 months post -transplant as compared to the three 
months pre -transplant follow -up was observed.   
A Phase 2a dose -escalating study is currently ongoing at the Hadassah Medical Center in 
Jerusalem, Israel.   
The Phase 2a study is designed to determine the  safety and preliminary effects on outcome 
measures of MSC -NTF administered by combination treatment of intramuscular and 
intrathecal administration, in three cohorts of 4 early -stage ALS patients, receiving 
increasing doses of MSC -NTF cells. The first gro up of patients receive d a combination 
treatment of the current dose, the second group of patients received a 1.5 fold combination 
treatment of the current dose and the third group of patients received a 2 fold combination

Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
An interim safety summary  report for the first 12 patients in the study was submitted to the 
Hadassah Medical Center Ethical Committee about two month after  transplantation  of the 
12th patient . One SAE (death due to cardiopulmonary arrest) was reported as non-
treatment related. The majority of the other AE observed were  procedure related and not 
treatment related . 
Four  compassionate use ALS patients have been treated with MSC -NTF cells with no 
apparent safety related concerns.  
The first compassionate use ALS patient was treated by IT transplantation of 1 x 106 
cells/ kg body weight autologous MSC -NTF cells. During the 5 months follow up, no 
treatment -related adverse effects had been reported. 
The s econd compassionate  use ALS patient received a combination of IT and IM 
injection s of autologous MSC -NTF cells: 1 x 106 cells/ kg body weight IT and 1x106 
cells/site in 24 sites,  IM. No significant treatment -related adverse effects had been 
reported observe d during the  9 months post -transplantation follow -up. The follow -up 
report for this patie nt is attached hereto . 
The third compassionate use patient (diagnosed with both ALS and m yasthenia gravis) 
received a higher combination dose of I T and IM injection s of autologous MSC -NTF 
cells, namely 1.5 x 106 cells/kg  body weight IT and 1.5 x  106 cells/site in 24 sites IM for a 
total of 147 x 106 MSC -NTF cells. During the 2 months follow -up no significant side 
effects were observed. This compassionate use patient s howed a n improvement in the 
ALS FRS-R score, in muscle power (muscle chart) and in the respiratory parameters 
(FVC ). 
This patient was subsequently re -treated 5 months after the first injection with a second 
dose of MSC -NTF cells . Two months after repeated M SC-NTF transplantation all 
neurological functions were found to have improved.  A case report for this patient 
entitled 'Rare Combination of Myasthenia and ALS, Responsive to NTF -MSC Stem Cell 
Therapy' was recently accepted for publication in 'Muscle and N erve'.  
No formal assessment was performed for the repeated treatment of this compassionate 
treated patient, or for the fourt h compassionate treated patient . Brainstorm Cell 
Therapeutics has not received any reports from the treating physicians of any adverse effects suspected to be due to the product in these four patients . 
In th is proposed Phase 2  study , our goal is to evaluate the safety of MSC -NTF cells and 
their effect on several widely used, validated outcome measures  in ALS.  The MSC -NTF  
cells wi ll be  administered by combin ed IM and IT routes of administration ; the doses 
being proposed in this study represent the  highest dose s that were administered in the 
previous clinical studies; in those studies  and in the compassionate use patients , these 
doses appeared to be generally well -tolerated  by the 2 8 subjects to whom they were 
administered .

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 17 6.1.3. Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Experience with MSC -NTF  
6.1.3.1. The Role of Neurotrophic F actors  in ALS  
Neurotrophic factors (NTF) are small, naturally occurring polypeptides that support the 
development and survival of neurons. NTF are reported to be potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons  and s tudies in ALS animal models have shown a 
delay in disease onset and/or progression after administration of various neurotrophic factors . Therefore, NTF are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS as well as 
for other neurodegenerative diseases.  
Several studies in peripheral nerve injury have shown that NTFs play an important role in the development, maintenance and regeneration of the nervous system. BDNF was shown to prevent the loss of motor units and to contribute to the maintenance of muscle  mass 
when administered to the hind limb muscles of mice after neonatal peripheral nerve injury (Mousavi K et al., 2004). In addition BDNF enhances branching and arborization of Corticospinal motor neurons (Ozdinler PH et al., 2006).  GDNF and Insulin Grow th 
Factor  1 (IGF-1) are two of the most potent survival factors known for peripheral neurons. 
Several studies have shown that GDNF and IGF -1 can prevent neuronal degeneration in 
mice and rats after axotomy, as well as the programmed cell death of motor neu rons 
during development (Henderson, CE, et al. 1994, Mohajeri H et al. 1999, Wang, LJ et al. 2002, Acsadi G et al. 2002, Ozdinler PH et al.
 2006, Suzuki M et al. 2008).  
The ability of growth factors to protect dying motor neurons has also been extensively studied in ALS  models of disease.   
A variety of preclinical and clinical studies already suggest that local delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects for ALS. 
The VEGF family, which includes factors  that are primarily associated with angiogenesis 
are now increasingly recognized to have neurotrophic effects.  
Reduced expression of a member of this family, VEGF -A, in mice results in 
neurodegeneration similar to that of ALS, while treatment of animal mo dels of ALS with 
either VEGF -A gene therapy or VEGF -A protein has yielded positive therapeutic 
outcomes. These basic research ﬁndings raise the potential for a VEGF therapy to be translated to the clinic for the treatment of ALS ( Reviewed Keifer et al 2013 ).  
Increased expression of VEGF by intramuscular viral injections prolongs their survival  
and enhances motor performance
 (Azzouz, M et al. 2004, Zheng, C et al. 2004). 
Intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF in a rat model of ALS enhanced motor neuron survival, whereas an intraperitoneal injection of VEGF led to the preservation of 
neuromuscular connections
 (Storkebaum, E, et al., 2005) . Moreover, a recent study 
indicates that intramuscular administration of a VEGF zinc finger transcription factor activator, which can induce VEGF expression, improves motor functions in SOD1- G93A 
rats  (Kliem, MA, et al., 2011) .  
A recent study has shown that hMSC engineered to express GDNF and VEGF synergistically significantly prolonged survival and slowed the loss of motor function in a rat model of ALS (Krakora D. et al. 2013).  
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first identified and molecularly cloned as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes (Nakamura et al., 1984, 1989).  
BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 18 Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is also a potent in vitro and in vivo survival -promoting 
factor for neurons (Kadoyama K, et al. 2007). HGF was first identified and molecularly 
cloned as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes (Nakamura et al., 1984, 1989). 
Subsequent studies revealed that  HGF ex erts multiple biological effects (c -Met) 
(Funakoshi and Nakamura, 2003).  
Neurotrophic effects of HGF have been demonstrated in vivo on embryonic spinal motor 
neurons during development and on adult motor neurons after axotomy of the hypoglossal nerve (Nov ak KD et al. 2000). O verexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result 
in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial ALS transgenic mouse model  (Sun W et al. 2002). Introduction of the HGF gene into neurons 
of transgenic mice expressing human mutant Cu⁄ Zn superoxide dismutase (G93A mice) 
attenuates motor neuron degeneration and increases the life span of these mice. (Sun W et al. 2002). 
6.1.3.2. In vitro protection of motorneur ons by MSC -NTF cells  
In order to test whether MSC -NTF cells are capable of rescuing motoneurons, we 
examined the effects of conditioned media of the MSC -NTF cells on a motoneuron cell 
line (NSC -34, Cashman NR et al. 1992). We found that the conditioned medium protects 
from NO damage (induced by SIN -1), glutamate toxicity, H
2O2 (Sadan O et al.2009, 
Yust -Katz S et al. 2012) and hypoxia (Fig. 1 ) suggesting that soluble factors secreted from 
MSC -NTF cells may  protect motor neurons from the damage associated to the 
pathophysiology of ALS.  
 
Figure 1 : MSC -NTF cells’ conditioned medium protects moto rneuron cells from 
hypoxia.  
Moto rneuron cells (NSC 34) were exposed for 48h rs to hypoxia (1% H 2, 4% CO 2 and 95%N 2) in the 
presence of conditioned medium of MSC -NTF cells  or of MSC. Cell viability was measured by Alamar Blue 
(O.D., 544 -590 nm) and the ratio between hypoxia and control (with no Hypoxia) for each conditioned 
medium was calculated. MSC -NTF conditioned medium is shown to be significantly more protective as 
compared to MSC conditioned medium against hypoxic stress (p<0.001, n=20).  05101520253035%   Hypoxia/Control

SOD1 mice  
Aiming to evaluate the effect of autologous transplantation of mouse MSC -NTF cells in a 
mouse model of  ALS, we used mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells that 
were induced to differentiate and secrete NTF.  MSCs isolated from mice and induced to 
differentiate into NTF secreting cells, demonstrated similar phenotype and characteristics as the hum an MSC and MSC -NTF cells respectively. The MSC -NTF cells (5x10

transplanted into the cerebral ventricle and into the leg muscles (5x105) of Superoxide 
dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) transgenic mice. We found that, compared to control (saline) injected 
mice, the  cell-transplanted mice performed better on rotarod, had delayed onset of the 
disease and an extended life span.  Additionally the life span of the MSC -NTF treated 
SOD1 mice increased by 18.8 days as compared to saline injected SOD1 mice (151.8 vs . 
133 day s, p<0.007, Fig. 2 ).

6.1.3.4. Therapeutic Effects of Differentiated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a Rat Model of Sciatic Nerve Injury  
Motor neuron (MN) loss is the origin of several fatal, progressive neurodegenerative 
diseases including ALS (Boillée et al., 2006). It is characterized by a progressive loss of MNs from the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex.  
Sciatic nerves are the l ongest and largest single nerves in the body. They begin in the 
lower spinal cord and run through the pelvis and down the lower limb. The sciatic nerves 
innervate the back of the thigh, leg and foot muscles. 
Since the sciatic nerve supplies movement to mos t of the lower limb, damaging this motor 
system, models lower limb paralysis and the deficits that occur in diseases like ALS. 
While the etiologies of ALS and lower limb paralyses differ, the clinical presentations have similarities, and both lack effectiv e treatments.  
It has been shown that the retrograde death of motor neurons in the adult spinal cord after sciatic nerve avulsion is due to apoptosis (Martin LJ et al. 1999). Since retrograde

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 20 degeneration and neuronal apoptosis may participate in the mechanisms for motor neuron 
death in ALS it is suggested that this model can provide important information toward the understanding of motor neuron protection in ALS.   
The protective effect of autologous MSC -NTF cells was studied in the sciatic nerve injury 
model in rat as a model for motorneuron damage which is representative of the damage 
seen in ALS (Dadon -Nachum M et al 2011a).   
We examined whether MSC -NTF cells are capable of rescuing motor neurons in a 
unilateral Sprague -Dawley rat Sciatic Nerve Injury ( SNI) model. The right hind limb 
sciatic nerve was crushed for 30 seconds in two points above the first branching of the 
nerve using a clamp. One day later, rats were transplanted with rat MSC -NTF cells or 
control into the site of the lesion. Four days afte r transplantation, in rats injected with the 
MSC -NTF cells, motor function measured by rotarod was found to be markedly preserved 
(73% vs. control in the MSC -NTF cells treated rats as compared to 41% in the control -
injected  group, p<0.01).  
These finding i ndicate that intramuscular transplantation of autologous MSC -NTF cells 
rescued neuron  damage in the sciatic nerve injury in rats  and therefore support  the notion 
that MSC -NTF can protect and increase restoration of motor -neurons , the cell population 
that s uffers the most damage in ALS (Dadon -Nachum M et al 2011). 
 
6.1.4. MSC -NTF Benefit and Risk Assessment  
ALS is a fatal neurological disease. There is currently only one product approved for the treatment  of ALS, namely, riluzole, which was demonstrated to increase time to 
tracheostomy or death in patients randomized to riluzole compared to those randomized to placebo .  No other products have been approved for the treatment of ALS since riluzole’s 
approval in 1995.  Thus, there remains a great unmet medical need for  safe and more 
effective treatments for people with ALS.  
Most of the current investigational therapies in development for ALS, such as anti -
glutamatergic agents, drugs targeting protein misfolding and accumulation, antioxidant therapy  and immunomodulatory  agents, focus on one of multiple putative 
pathophysiologic mechanisms.  
Cyto -therapy may hold the key to circumventing multiple hurdles in the ALS 
pathophysiological cascade (Morren JA et al. 2012). Apart from the replacement of lost or damaged motor neurons, stem cell implantation therapy may benefit ALS patients by an independent effect of cytoprotection.  
Experimental data have  shown that non- neuronal cell replacement can promot e motor 
neuron survival and improved neuromuscular function (Corti S et al. 2010). Preclinical studies in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases have shown 
benefit s of MSC -NTF transplantation , which support  the evidence that these cells may be 
effective treatment of ALS patients.  
Autologous MSC -NTF transplantation appe ars to be generally safe in the 28 ALS patients 
in whom  the product has been administered in two open- label GCP compliant clinical 
trials as well as in five treatments in 4 patients  with ALS  in which the cells were 
administered on a “compassionate” basis  treatment.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 21 In the open- label studies we previously conducted, no serious treatment -related adverse 
events were reported in the 12 treated  ALS  patients  who were administered the product via 
either IM or the IT route of administration  or in the 12 patients  that received a combined 
IT and IM administration of increasing doses of MSC -NTF cells (See section 6.1.2) . 
The dose for the proposed Phase 2 study  is the highest IM and IT combined administration 
dose, found to be well tolerated in the Phase 2a clinical study and in the 'compassionate 
use' treated patients.  
In our previous study a trend towards a decreased rate of decline on the ALSFRS -R and on 
FVC was observed in the IT treated patients over 6 months post -transplant as compared to 
the three months pre -transplant follow -up, suggesting that the product should be further 
evaluated in this indication .  
MSC are plastic- adherent cells isolated from the mononuclear fraction of the bone 
marrow. The bone marrow compartment is a convenient source for MSC.  
In summary , autologous trans plantation of adult bone marrow -derived MSC offers 
practical advantages since:  
• Bone marrow cells can be easily and safely obtained by needle aspiration. 
Although the crude bone marrow contains only very low numbers of MSC (1:104-
105), they can be enriched and expanded ex -vivo from the bone marrow 
mononuclear cell fraction.  
• There is no need for immunosuppression since rejection is  not expected when 
autologous MSC are administered.  
Potential risks of participation in this study are  considered to be low, and include the 
following:  
• Risks associated with bone marrow harvesting and related conscious sedation 
• Risks of LP include post -LP headache  and CSF  leak that could potentially  requir e 
treatment.   
• Risks of IM administration may includ e local skin irritation at the injection site s.   
• As this is an autologous treatment and there is variability between patients' cells' 
growth capabilities , there is also a possibility that patients' cells will not grow 
sufficiently and may not allow the required cell dose to be transplanted  back .  
Therefore, the potential benefits of IT and IM injections  of MSC -NTFs justify the 
small risk s associated with th e harvesting of Bone Marrow  and administration of this 
autologous product.

6.3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is the third clinical study of autologous MSC -NTF cells conducted by BrainStorm  
Cell Therapeutics and the first study conducted under this IND in the U.S.  It is a Phase II 
randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter study that will be conducted in 48 patients with early ALS (ALSFRS -R scores of ≥30) at up to 3 US study s ites.  After 
providing informed consent, each patient will undergo a 12- 16 week  baseline period 
during which monthly ALSFRS -R scores and SVCs will be obtained. During this period 
of time their bone -marrow will be harvested and deriving mesenchymal stromal cells will 
be expanded. Twelve to 16 weeks after screening, patients will undergo transplantation 
with their autologous MSC -NTF or matching placebo; product will be administered both 
intrathecally as well as intramuscularly as 24 IM injections given into the right biceps and triceps muscles, all at a single study visit.  Following treatment they will have monthly visits at which the ASLFRS -R and SVC will be obtained, along with vital signs, 
laboratory tests and recording of concomitant medications and AEs.
 
All participants will undergo informed consent and sign a written informed consent document.  Participants will be informed that in case their autologous bone marrow fails to grow adequate numbers of MSC they will not receive the transplant.  All participa nts will 
be observed for a total of 12- 16 weeks prior to undergoing a bone marrow aspiration

to be compared to post -treatment measures . This pre -treatment period also include s about 
four weeks of the cell propagation (see Figure 3 ). 
The 48 participants will be randomized (3:1) into a treatment or  into a placebo group 
which will occur at Visit 3.  Cells from the treatment group participants will be propagated 
in a cell culture facility over a period that can range from 24 to 38 days.  Participants in 
both the treatment  and placebo  groups  will then undergo combined IT and intramuscular 
(IM) injections  (Figure 1). Both groups will be monitored for 24 weeks post -treatment .  
Participants in each group will be monitored by evaluators blinded to the treatment group, 
using identical procedures during the pre -transplantation period and for an additional 24 
weeks post-treatment .  Participants will be followed by in -perso n visits and telephone 
visits at least monthly throughout the trial (see schedule of activities (SOA) in Tables 1 and 2).  
The autologous production process is on a per -patient basis  and begins upon fresh bone 
marrow aspirate arrival to the cleanroom facili ty and is completed once the cells are ready 
for transplantation. Because t he production capacity of the cell manufacturing facility is 
limited , it will be the limiting factor for the rate of enrolment. Based on the  production 
capacity  limitations, patients are expected to be recruited at a rate of approximately 2 -4 
patients/months  throughout the trial .  
6.3.2. Study Schematic  
The study comprises a 12- 16 week  pre-treatment follow -up period and a 24 week post -
treatment follow -up period (Figure 1) .  
Patient bone marrow will be aspirated about 9- 11 weeks following the first screening visit. 
The MSC isolation and cell propagation process will last about 3- 5 weeks  and will be 
followed by MSC -NTF cells transplantation.   
At the transplantation visit (about 12- 16 weeks after the screening visit) , subjects will be 
admitted to an inpatient study unit for study procedures and will be followed for 44- 72 
hours post  transplantation.  
Following treatment patients will be followed at monthly visits for a total of 24 weeks.  
Each patient will thus be followed for a total of  about 38 weeks (9-10 months ) from the 
first screening visit (Figure 3).

6.3.3.1. Bone Marrow aspiration procedure:  
Human bone marrow will be aspirated by a credentialed health care provider as per 
Medical Centre procedures bilaterally  from multiple punctures of the iliac crest of the 
pelvic bone of patients into 20 mL  syringe s prefilled with approximately 1.5 mL  of a 
Heparin -containing solution (Heparin Solution, USP, 100 units/mL ) diluted 1:20 in HBSS .   
Vacutainer tubes ( Green cap 6 ml REF 367886 BD  or equivalent with Sponsor approval ) 
containing Lithium Hep arin Sodium for injection ( 95 IU units/tube ) will be pre -labelled 
and the cap pre -cleaned with Ethanol. After replacing the aspiration needle with a new 
sterile 19 gauge needle, the bone marrow aspirated from each single puncture (2 -3 ml ), 
will be injected into a sepa rate pre -labelled Vacutainer tube. Immediately after bone 
marrow is injected into the tube, the tube will be thoroughly mixed to avoid clotting of the bone marrow sample.  
A total of 50- 70 ml of Bone Marrow will be aspirated from each patient.  
6.3.3.2. IT Transplan t Procedure  
Participants will undergo a lumbar puncture (Spinal needle 20GA 3.50 IN (0.9 x 90 mm) 
followed by intrathecal injection of cells or placebo  (Dulbecco modified Eagle Medium, 
DMEM) . The detailed transplantation procedure is provided in Appendix  3. 
6.3.3.3. IM Transplant Procedure   
Participants will undergo a unilateral (right) IM transplantation of cells or of placebo

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 25 6.3.4. Blinding and Randomization  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of patients to treatment, to 
increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons.  
This is a double -blind st udy; the investigators, the subjects, and designated study monitors 
will be blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the subject’s participation in the trial. The exceptions to the blinding will be the Production team  (unblinded personnel)  at 
the cel l culture facility at the site who distribute  the MSC -NTF cells, and the unblinded 
statistician who will create the final randomization schedule  but will not otherwise be 
involved in the trial.   
Randomization will be stratified by site.  Site -specific rand omization  lists will be provided 
to the Production manager  prior to any subjects being randomized.  The Production 
manager will refer to the randomization list when assigning treatment to a subject, and 
will allocate the treatment corresponding to the subject’s randomization number.  Randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially as subjects are randomized at each site.  Randomization will occur at Visit 3 (one week before Bone Marrow aspiration) after 
eligibility has been confirmed.  The subject’s ran domization number will be recorded in 
the subject’s source documentation and CRFs, and the randomization number will be provided to the cell culture facility in preparation for the MSC isolation and cell propagation process.  
In the event that emergency unblinding  is necessary, the treatment codes for all subjects,  
where the treatment code  information for each subject  will be separated to ensure that all 
treatment codes will not be unblinded unnecessarily , will be available from the Medical 
Monitor .  The randomization code may be broken only in the event of an emergency when 
it is essential to know which treatment the subject received in order to provide appropriate care. Whenever the code is broken for safety reasons, the date, time, and reason for 
unblinding must by documented by the investigator or any other person breaking the code, the Sponsor must be notified immediately.  
6.3.5. Duration of study  
Participants will be screened and undergo bone marrow aspiration after 9- 10 weeks.  
Following aspiration, ce lls will be grown in culture for approximately 24- 30 days (3 -4 
weeks).  Participants in both the treatment and placebo groups will undergo combined IT and IM cell transplantation with either MSC -NTF cells or the placebo (DMEM).  
Following cell transplantation, participants will be monitored  as inpatients for a period of 
at least 44 hours. Participants will be discharged after at least 44 hours and up to 72 hours  
unless a clinical adverse event(s) occur that require continued inpatient monitoring and/or 
treatment.  Each subject’s participation in the study will last for approximately 9 months.  
6.3.6. Discussion of Dose  
The combined IM and IT transplantation dose is the highest dose of MSC -NTF 
administered  by combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration shown to have 
been safely administered in previous clinical trials in ALS patients (see section 6.1.2  
above).

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 26 6.3.7. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
The study is a randomized double blind placebo control led study . The control group will 
be given placebo.  It is expected that 36 subjects given MSC -NTF and 12 subjects DMEM 
in the placebo  arm will provide an adequate number of subjects to compare rates of 
adverse events  between the treatment and control groups and allow us to explore the 
effects on the  rates of decline on the ALSFRS -R and SVC between the  treatment and 
placebo control groups  as well as individual change s from baseline scores through Week 
24 following treatment.  
One of the study exploratory endpoints is aimed at determinin g feasibility of succeeding in  
performing successful IT administration of MSC -NTF cells and of blinding patients and 
caregivers to the treatment in anticipation of performing a larger Phase III efficacy study.  
ALS is a terminal disease , and life expectancy of patients is usually 3 to 5 years after 
diagnosis of ALS. Early stage ALS patients (≤24 months from ALS symptom onset and 
ALSFRS -R ≥30) were therefore chosen as the study population, to increase chances of 
participants of  complet ing the full 9 months study and to obtain a patient population with a 
relatively homogenous rate of disease progression thus  increas ing the power for detecting 
a difference in the  efficacy outcomes  (either between treated and controls or change from 
baseline among treated vs. untreated subjects) . Rates of decline on the ALSFRS -R in such 
patients are reported  in the  published scientific literature to range from - 0.92 ± 0.08 
points/month (Castillo -Viguera et al 2010 , NEALS data ) to 2.35 (Sorenson EJ et al. 2008) .   
Since ALS is a fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor -
neuron cell death in the brain and spinal cord, accompanied by rapid loss of muscle 
control and eventual complete paralysis  and there is currently no available treatmen t to 
prevent its progressive course, a reduction in the  slope of decline in the ALSFRS -R and/or 
in the SVC  reflected as a change in disease progression ( slope ) compared to concurrent 
placebo controls will be considered to constitu te a response  that will be  evaluated further 
in Phase III clinical studies .  
6.4. SUBJECT POPULATION  
This study will be conducted in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of ALS who meet the El Escorial criteria (Brooks, B.R., et al 2000) for possible, laboratory -supported probable, 
probable, or definite ALS. T o be enrolled in this study, patients must meet all inclusion 
criteria in Section 6.4.1 below and must not have any of the exclusion criteria listed in Section 6.4.2. 
The subject population is chosen f rom the group of early -stage ALS participants  with the 
aim of obtaining a  homogeneous study population that will facilitate  the interpretation of 
the study results and allow for identifying  trends in efficacy outcomes .  
Due to the length of the study i t is also aimed to include pa rticipan ts that will survive for 
the duration of the study.  
6.4.1. Inclusion Criteria

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 34 In addition to the circumstances listed above  for patients’ withdrawal from the study, 
Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd . and the Investigators reserve the right to terminate the 
study at any time. In any case of early termination (ET) of the study, Brainstorm Cell 
Therapeutics Ltd . and the Investigators will ensure that adequate consideration is given to 
the protection of each subject’s interest.  
An ET visit will be conducted only for subjects who discontinue the study after treatment, post visit 5. The ET visit will include all the procedures required at end of study visit 
(Visit 10).  
Any participant discontinuing the study prior to transplantation of cells (or placebo) injections will be replaced with another participant to meet the target of 48 transplanted participants.  
6.5.6. Temporary Treatment Discontinuation  
Since study treatment  is only administered once during this trial, study treatment cannot be 
temporarily held for any serious adverse event or significant intercurrent illness. 
6.5.7. Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  
Permanent treatment discontinuation is defined as cessation of study drug administration. 
This may only occur if the subject does not receive all the intended doses of study treatment at the single treatment period (e.g., not all of the intended IM and/or IT doses 
are administered).  Safety follow -up (Section 6.5. 8.) will still be performed.   
The primary reasons for permanent treatment discontinuation are listed in Section 6.8.4.   
Cross -references are provided to protocol sections  with additional information.   
 
Reason  Comment  
Adverse event or intercurrent illness  Any intolerable adverse event that cannot be ameliorated by the 
use of adequate medical intervention or that in the opinion of the 
Investigator or Medical Monitor would lead to undue risk if study 
treatment were continued.  
Sponsor discontinuation of study  The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study anytime as 
described in Section  6.12.7.  The sponsor will terminate this study 
following completion of the study objectives, or earlier if deemed 
necessary.  
Participant decision  Participants  may permanently discontinue study treatment 
anytime for any reason.  Following study drug discontinuation, 
patients should have protocol -required safety follow -up 
assessments unless the patient specifically declines further 
follow -up.   
6.5.8. Safety Follow -Up 
All patients who are treated or partially treated will have safety follow -up approximately 9 
months  from enrolment in the study . Adverse events and serious adverse events will be 
follow ed up as described in Section 6.8. For patients who refuse further clinic study visits, 
teleph one contact and/ or home visits by study staff should be attempted and documented 
to review for adverse events.

Every reasonable effort will be made to contact any patient apparently lost to follow -up 
during the course  of the study to complete study -related assessments and record 
outstanding data.   
Following unsuccessful telephone contact, an effort to contact the patient by mail using a 
method that provides proof of receipt will be attempted.  Alternate contacts will be used if 
the patient is not reachable (eg, primary care providers, referring physician, relatives).  Such efforts should be documented in the patient’s source documents.   If all efforts fail to establish contact, the patient will be considered lost to f ollow -up.

The cell therapy is based on the autologous transplantation of adult bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) which are induced ex- vivo to secrete 
neurotrophic fact ors (NTFs) such as Glial Cell Line Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
(GDNF), Brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial  Growth Factor 
and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and are thus designated MSC -NTF cells. The MSC -
NTF cells are derived from  hMSCs isolated from the patient’s own Bone Marrow, 
propagated in -vitro  and induced to secrete NTFs using a medium base d procedure.  
MSC -NTF cells are adult stem cells that  are used for a utologous “Self -transplantation”. 
There is no ethical or safety issues of involvement of embryonic cells. Since the cells are the patient's own cells there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long -term side effects.  
MSC -NTF cells delivery is easy and safe by standard procedures (IT and IM injections) 
and does not require surgical intervention.  
6.6.2. MSC -NTF  Product Characteristics  
Participants’ bone marrow is aspirated and MSC are isolated from the total bone marrow mononuclear cell population, propagated in culture and induced to secrete NTFs. The MSC -NTF cells are then transplanted back into the patient as following:  
• 125 x10
6 cells by IT administration (however, if less than 125 x 106 cells are 
available, then the total available dose of cells should be administered, provided at least 100 x 10
6 cells are administered)  
• 48 x106 cells by IM administration.  
Patients randomized to placebo will receive both IT and the same number of IM injections  
The MSC -NTF cells' production process is carried out in the absence of antibiotics in the 
absence of phenol red and in the absence of animal derived components. The production 
process is cGMP compliant and is performed under full environmental control, in a cl ass 
10,000 cleanroom (ISO 7). All cell manipulation procedures are performed in a class 100 (ISO 5) laminar flow hood.  
The MSC -NTF cells are provided in a ready -to-use participant -personalized unique 
treatment package with the appropriate primary and seco ndary labels. The treatment

23 Sept 2014  MSC -NTF cells (NurOwn™)  Section 6 Page  36 of 64  
 
Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 36 package consists of one 5 ml syringe for IT transplantation, and twenty four 1 ml syringes 
for IM transplantation. Each treatment package consists of ready -for-injection syringes 
containing freshly harvested autologous cultured MSC -NTF  cells at the dose defined for 
the appropriate route of administration in the clinical study protocol.  
Syringes will be capped with a stopper (not a needle). The 5 ml syringe for IT 
transplantation will be packed in a pouch. The 1 ml syringes for IM transplantation will be 
placed in a 7 -compartment tray that will be packed in a pouch.  
The treatment /placebo  package is delivered to the clinical site in a shipping system 
container designed for maintaining a te mperature of 2 -8°C during shipment. The shipping 
system containing the syringes is shipped via ground transportation to the clinical site. Product should be administered to the patient within 5 hours from packaging.  
Placebo will be provided in the same num ber of syringe s types and sizes as the cell -
containing syringes . 
All treatment as well as placebo syringes  will be masked to preclude  physician and 
patient's identification  of their content. In addition the sponsor will make every effort to 
ensure blinding  of the study by the attending physicians.  
The cell production process, including the in- process controls is described in full detail in 
the CMC section and in the Investigator's brochure (IB).  
6.6.3. Treatment Compliance  
It is expected that participants  will b e fully compliant during the pre -transplant follow -up 
period.  
Since patients are recruited at the early stage of the disease and ambulatory (Disease 
symptom s onset ≤ 24 months and ALSFRS -R ≥30 prior to Screening Visit) they are 
expected to be able to comp lete the full 6 months post treatment follow -up.  
To increase chances of post –treatment compliance, it will be attempted to recruit patients 
living in the vicinity of the medical centers and /or previously  known to the Investigators.  
6.6.4. Test product, Dose and  Admin istration  
Placebo or participants'  autologous MSC -NTF cells  will be used  for a combination 
treatment of 125x 10
6 cells intrathecally, (however, if less than 125 x 106 cells are 
available, then the total available dose of cells should be administered, provided at least 
100 x 106 cells are administered), and 2x106 cells/site intramuscularly  divided equally 
among  24 sites in the right biceps and triceps muscles  unilaterally.  
6.7. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
6.7.1. Prior Therapy  
Participants who  received prior cell therapy of any kind will be excluded from the study 
(See Section 6.4.2).  
Rilutek (riluzole) and Nuedexta (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate) 
are the only FDA -approved drugs for patients with ALS (Nuedexta is approved only to

be on a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days prior to screening, or not on riluzole at all with no plans to begin therapy with riluzole for the durat ion of the study.  
6.7.2. Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications given to the patient during the pre -transplant, in -patient post -
transplant and outpatient post -transplant periods will be recorded.   
Patients who were on a stable dose of riluzole  for at least  30 days prior to screening will 
continue taking riluzole  prior to study enrolment , unless requiring discontinuation for 
standard side -effects .  
6.8. SAFETY REPORTING  
For this study, AEs and SAEs will be collected from screening visit  through the end of the 
study period and as detailed in Section 6.8.1. 
6.8.1. Adverse Events definitions and reporting  
Standard definitions for AEs are provided in this section for informational purposes.  
6.8.1.1. Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  
6.8.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (An AE or suspe cted adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

23 Sept 2014  MSC -NTF cells (NurOwn™)  Section 6 Page  38 of 64  
 
Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 38 If it is not certain that an event meets the above definitions of an SAE, the site 
investigators will contact the Medical Monitor to discuss. 
6.8.1.3. Relatedness (Causality)  
Investigators will assess relatedness of adverse events to study drug using the following 
terms: 
• Definite : An AE that has a clear temporal association with investigational product 
administration (e.g., within 24 hours); provides a plausible pharmacologic explanation for the event;  
• Probable: There is a reasonable temporal association with administration of th e 
investigational product; unlikely caused by other drugs or underlying conditions;  
• Possible :  There is a plausible temporal association with the investigational 
product, but other etiologies are possible and relatedness to the investigational product cannot definitely be ruled out.  
• Unlikely:   The temporal association with the investigational product is 
implausible (but not impossible). The event is likely related to other drugs or conditions. 
• Not Related : An AE with no temporal association with the inves tigational product 
but rather related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or conditions or subject's known clinical state; subject has not received investigational product. 
 
6.8.1.4. Severity (Intensity)  
The severity of an adverse event will be grad ed on a scale: mild, moderate, severe, as 
defined below:  
• Mild :  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Moderate:  Minimal, local or non -invasive  intervention indicated; interferes with 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
• Severe:  Disabling; unable to carry out age -appropriate activities of daily living.  
• Potentially Life -Threatening :  Medical or operative intervention indicated to 
prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or de ath 
6.8.1.5. Follow -Up of AEs  
After the initial recording of an AE, the Investigator should proactively follow the patient.  Any non -serious AEs that are still on -going at the end of the study should be reviewed to 
determine if further follow -up is required.  The Investigator will document on the eCRF 
any/all on -going non- serious AEs that will not be followed further after the patient exits 
the study.  If in doubt, the Investigator should consult the study Medical Monitor.    
All SAEs should be followed until resol ution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the 
patient is lost to follow -up, or otherwise explained.  Once the SAE is resolved, the 
corresponding AE eCRF page should be updated.  Additionally, any relevant laboratory 
test reports, consultation reports  from other health care professionals, discharge 
summaries, or other information that has been gathered about the event should be transmitted to the Sponsor.

23 Sept 2014  MSC -NTF cells (NurOwn™)  Section 6 Page  39 of 64  
 
Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 39 The Sponsor may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of any AE.   
6.8.1.6. Outcome  
The following terms will be used during this study:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Unknown 
6.8.1.7. Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities  
Any laboratory abnormalities deemed clinically significant by the Investigator should be 
reported on the AE CRF. A clinically significant abnormality is a confirmed abnormality (by repeat test) that is changed sufficiently from Screening so that in the judgment of the Investigator a change in management is warranted. This alteration may include: monitoring the laboratory test further, initiating other diagnostic tests or procedures, chang ing ongoing treatment, or administering new treatment. Whenever possible, the 
etiology of the abnormal finding (e.g., anemia) will be recorded on the CRF. Repeated additional tests and/or other evaluations required to establish the significance and etiolog y 
of an abnormal result should be obtained when clinically indicated.  
6.8.2. Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for AEs and SAEs  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or Sub- Investigator(s) to perform periodic 
assessment of all AEs/SAEs.  
A subject, who experiences an AE, whether serious or not serious, should receive appropriate treatment and medical supervision as clinically indicated. AEs/SAEs will be followed throughout the subject’s participation in the study, until resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually agreed upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.  
The Investigator must report to the Sponsor all SAEs within 24 hours of learning about the event. The reporting mechanism for an SAE is by submitting all available in formation 
about the event via fax to the designated Safety Department contact. If the SAE has not resolved at the time the Investigator submits an initial SAE report, the Investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon r eceipt of significant 
information if the event is still ongoing).  
The following information and assessments will be recorded in the adverse event section of the SAE Reporting Form:  
• The date and time of onset of the event and when it ended using the 24 hour clock 
where midnight is 00:00 and noon is 12:00. 
• The signs, symptoms, or diagnosis of the event.  
• The adverse event severity using the criteria outlined above.  
• The relationship of the event to the investigational product as outlined above.

and welfare.  
6.8.3. Prospective assessment of the occurrence of suicidality  
There is no evidence from animal or previous human studies to suggest that MSC -NTF 
cell transplantation will increase suicidal ideation or attempts ; but, because these cells are 
delivered to the CSF and are active in the central nervous system, we plan to monitor suicidal ideation a nd behavior carefully throughout the trial.  
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS;  http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu), delivered at each in -perso n trial 
visit. All study staff delivering the C -SSRS will be fully trained in its appropriate use and 
only study staff prepared to appropriately respond to subjects exhibiting suicidal ideation or behavior will deliver the scale. The ‘Baseline’ questionnai re will be given at the 
Screening/Visit.  The ‘Since Last Visit’  questionnaire will be given at subsequent visits.  
6.8.4. STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
6.8.4.1. Study or Site Termination  
Conditions may arise during the study that could prompt the study to be halted or the study site to be terminated. Conditions that may prompt such considerations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1. The discovery of unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study . 
2. A decision on the part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) to suspend 
or discontinue the study . 
3. A decision on the part of Sponsor to suspend, discontinue, or shorten the study . 
4. Study conduct at the study site may warrant termination under condit ions that 
include the following:  
a) Failure of Investigator(s) to enrol  eligible subjects into the study ; 
b) Failure of Investigator(s) to comply with ICH -GCP guidelines, or FDA 
guidelines and regulations ; 
c) Submission of false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, the 
Clinical Monitor, the FDA, or IRB ; 
d) Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements ; 
e) A conflict of interest of the Investigator, his/her institution, or site personnel that would negatively impact the integrity of the clinical trial ; 
f) Institution or IRB under investigation for cause by a regulatory agency.  
6.8.4.2. Subject Withdrawal from Study  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the 
study.  
The Investigator will document on the appropriate CRF page the reason/circumstances for  
withdrawal.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 42 Efforts will be made to follow all subjects who discontinue study for any reason. Such 
follow up will include all relevant evaluations for safety including clinical assessments and collection of laboratory stud y results as set out in this protocol.  
6.8.4.3. Study stopping rules  
Previous clinical studies with MSC -NTF cells did not result in any treatment- related 
SAEs. However, if in the course of this study, 2 or more subjects experience SAEs evaluated as possible , probable or definitely related to product administration, patient 
enrolment and dosing will be temporarily suspended pending DSMB review of the subjects with SAEs.  
6.8.5. Clinical Laboratory Safety Tests  
Clinical laboratory safety tests will be monitored throughout the  trial at Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 
9 and 10 as listed in the Schedule of Activities (Tables 1 and 2).  
All samples to be tested will be shipped to a Central Laboratory.  
Tests include:  
Hematology: CBC (RBC with Indices, WBC with differential and platelet count , Hb, Ht)  
Coagulation : PT, PTT  
Blood Biochemistry : Na, K, Cl, HCO3, BUN, Cr, Gluc, Ca, Mg, Phos, total protein, 
triglycerides (TG), Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, 
AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), ALP , uric acid.   
Urinalysis  (dip-stick test) -  Specific Gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, blood 
6.8.6. Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiograms   
Participants will undergo p hysical examinations  at all in -person visits except at  the Bone 
Marrow Aspiration (BMA) visit (Visit 4 ), Vital Signs  measurements (including blood 
pressure, pulse and respiration rate after sitting for at least 3 minutes) as well as body weight will be monitored at all in -person visits , and a 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at 
visits 1 , 5 and 10.  
6.9. ASSESSMENT OF ENDPOINTS  
6.9.1. Primary Endpoint:  
6.9.1.1. Safety  
The primary endpoint of the trial is the safety of MSC -NTF transplantation by IT and IM 
routes in participants with ALS  
Safety will be assessed based on the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) (including serious adverse events [SAEs]) including clinically relevant changes 
in vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical and neurological examination s, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) tests.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 43 6.9.2. Secondary Endpoints:  
6.9.2.1. Revised ALS Functional Ra ting Scale (ALSFRS -R) 
The ALSFRS -R is a quickly administered (10 minutes) ordinal , validated rating scale 
(ratings 0 -4) used to determine patients' assessment of their capability and independence in 
12 functional activities.  All 12 activities are relevant in ALS.  Initial validity was 
established by documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS -R scores correlated 
with change in strength over time, as measured by quantitative neuromuscular strength 
testing, and with quality of life measures, and predi cted survival ( Cedarbaum, J.M., et al. 
1999, Greenberg, S.A., et al 2005). The test -retest reliability is greater than 0.88 for all test 
items .  The advantages of the ALSFRS -R are that  the categories are relevant to ALS, it is 
a sensitive and reliable tool for assessing activities of daily living function in patients with ALS, it is quickly administered , and is validated over the phone as well
1.  
6.9.2.2. Slow Vital Capacity (SVC)  
SVC measure th e maximum amount of air a patient can exhale in a single breath. SVC is 
used frequently in ALS clinic as part of a battery of tests used to assess diaphragmatic weakness and monitor disease progression. SVC will be measured with patient seated in 
upright position.  It can be measured quickly and effectively in the office setting . 
6.9.3. Exploratory 
6.9.3.1. Hand Held Dynamometry (HHD)  
HHD is a quantitative measure of muscle strength and has been validated against 
maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) ( Greenberg, S.A., et al. 2002).  
Proximal arm and distal arm muscles will be examined bilaterally.  To normalize for 
varying strength of individual muscles, all values will be expressed as percent change 
from baseline; this value can be averaged to provide upper extremity, lower extremity, and 
total megascores.  An additional analysis will use m ean and standard deviation for each 
muscle group established from the initial values for each subject in this trial, so that strength determinations can be converted to Z scores (the difference between the obtained 
score and the mean, divided by the standard d eviation).  These Z scores can be combined 
in similar fashion to what was discussed above to produce megascores as well. 
Muscle strength measurements (elbow flexion, wrist extension, knee extension, and ankle 
dorsiflexion) will be performed using the Hand Held Dynamometer (HHD), as described 
in appendix 2 at Visits  1,2,3,5,6,7,8, 9 and 10. The tests take approximately 20 minutes to 
complete.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 44 6.9.3.2. Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM, Optional)  
EIM measures the electrical impedance of individual muscles as a repr esentation for 
muscle composition, which changes with disease progression.  Using a single probe that 
contains both stimulating and recording electrodes, measurements are taken twice over each muscle.  The probe is placed against a clean area of skin for l ess than 10 seconds per 
recording.  Four muscles will be tested in upper and lower extremities; elbow flexors, wrist extensors, knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors, for a total of 8 muscles tested per subject. The minute electrical signals produced by t he stimulator are imperceptible; 
subjects only notice the pressure of the probe against their skin.  Sites will have the option of collecting the EIM outcome data.  
6.9.3.3. Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid 
Few studies have been performed that assess and quantify the presence of neurotrophic 
factors in the CSF.  Since MSC -NTF secrete several known neurotrophic factors, we 
intend to develop ELISA assays for neurotrophic factors and use these assays to assess the concentration of these factors after treatment.  We are also exploring the possible assessment of several putative ALS biomarkers in these CSF samples.  
6.9.4. Statistical Methods and Sample Size Determination 
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Minima and maxima will be reported with the same precision as the raw values; means, standard deviations, and medians will be presented  to one additional decimal place than reported in the raw values. Summaries for 
discrete variables will include frequencies and percentages. All percentages will be 
rounded to one decimal place (i.e., XX.X%). Differences between treatment groups will be calculated as MSC -NTF cells  – placebo and change from baseline will be calculated as 
post-treatment – pre-treatment (OR follow -up visit – baseline:  e.g. Week 2 – baseline, 
Week 4 – baseline) . The baseline visit will be defined as the last non -missing measure  
prior to initiation of investigational treatment.  Additionally, for the pre -transplantation 
period and transplantation visits, change from screening (V1) summaries will be 
calculated as pre -transplantation period/transplantation visit – screening.  
All eff icacy analyses will use one- sided alpha = 0.10 tests and present one -sided 90% 
lower confidence limits and two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the difference 
between treatments as well as two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the point 
estimates within each treatment group. All summaries will be presented by treatment 
group.   
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized  prior to database lock, 
unblinding and analysis of study  results .  
6.9.4.1. Analysis Population 
The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive study treatment (treatment or placebo) including those who do not complete the study. The safety population will be analyzed as treated and will be used for the safety analysis.  
The full a nalysis set (FAS) population includes all randomized subjects. The FAS will be 
analyzed as randomized.  Analyses on the FAS population will be considered secondary.

violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the  study as judged by a 
blinded evaluation performed by a group of study personnel including the medical 
monitor,  statistician, and clinical project manager prior to the unblinding of the study 
treatment. Analyses on the PP data set will group subjects acco rding to the treatment 
actually received.  Analyses on the PP population will be considered secondary .

6.9.4.2. Safety  analyses  
Prim ary Objective
: The safety of MSC -NTF transplantation via combined IT and IM 
injection in participants with ALS is the primary objective of this study. Safety endpoints include AEs, changes in physical and neurological examination findings, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and requirement of concomitant medications.  
All AEs will be coded to System Organ Class ( SOC ) and Preferred  Term ( PT) using the 
MedDRA®. The number of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  (TEAEs ) and the 
number of subjec ts with any TEAEs (along with percentages) will be tabulated by SOC 
and PT within each SOC by treatment group and over treatment groups. To count the 
number of subjects with any TEAEs, a subject who experiences multiple TEAEs within 
the same SOC will be counted only once for that SOC (whether or not the TEAEs are 
coded to the same PT). A subject who experiences multiple TEAEs coded to the same PT 
within the same SOC will be counted only once for t hat particular PT. In the summary, 
SOC will  be listed in a scending alphabetical order ; PTs will be listed in order of 
descending frequency for all subjects  within each SOC .  
Separate summaries will be provided for the following categories of AEs:  
• TEAEs  
• TEAEs by severity  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
The proportion of subjects having each AE will be compared between treatment using 
Fisher’s exact tests.  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, baseline will be defined as the last 
measurement prior to transplantation (i.e., prior to treatment).  
Physical examination, neurological examination, hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs and concomitant medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) if the data is continuous and using counts and percentages if the data is discrete. Shifts from baseline  in categorization of 
results ( e.g. normal/abnormal or low/normal/high ) will also be summarized.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 46 6.9.4.3. Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary Objectives : The change in slope between the treatment and placebo group and 
from pre -transplantation to post -transplantation in ALSFRS -R and in SVC (as a percent of 
normal for age and sex) will be estimated using the mixed linear statistical model.   
The f ixed effect variables in the model will be: 
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre -treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values).   
• Treatment  
• Two-way interactions between visit & post -treatment  indicator, (0 for pre -
treatment visits, 1 for post -treatment visits) and visit & treatment  
• Three- way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment 
• Site 
The repeated measures within a subject over visit will also be accounted for i n the model, 
wherein, the covariance structure will be evaluated using Bayesian information criterion 
(BIC). Covariance structures to be evaluated are: unstructured, toeplitz, spatial power with 
day, and compound symmetry.  
The three- way interaction between  visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment will 
be used to compare the change in slope in the treatment group to the change in slope in the placebo group.  
The post -pre slope estimate within each  treatment group will be used to test the change 
from  pre-transplantation to post -transplantation . 
Repeated measures covariance will be estimated by restricted maximum likelihood.  The Kenward and Roger method will be used to determine degrees of freedom and compute p -
values.  
Secondary objectives will be evaluated for the FAS, as well as the PP populations.  Exploratory Objectives
:  The analysis for EIM (optional) and HHD will employ the same 
modeling approach as described above for the secondary objectives.  The analysis for 
HHD will be based on a combined score reflecting muscles in the right arm.    
A further analysis of HHD will compare the score for the right arm to the score for the left arm.  The linear mixed model will include, in addition to the terms described above, a n 
indicator for "right arm", interactions between that indicator and all other variables in the model , and a random effect term for the right arm indicator. Therefore, the fixed effect 
variables in the model will be: 
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre -treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values) ;   
• Treatment ; 
• Right arm indicator ; 
• Two-way interactions between visit & post- treatment indicator (0 for pre -treatment 
visits, 1 for post -treatment visits), visit & treatment, visit & right arm indicator, 
and treatment & right arm indicator ; 
• Three- way interactions between visit & post- treatment visit indicator & treatment, 
visit & post -treatment indicator & right arm indicator, and visit & treatment &  
right arm indicator ; 
• Four -way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment & 
right arm indicator ;

6.9.4.4. Determination of sample size  
No formal sample size calculation has been performed. The sample size chosen was not 
based on s tatistical considerations. The total of 36 treatment and 12 placebo subjects are 
expected to be a sufficient number to obtain adequate characterization of common TEAEs  
and to observe trends for treatment effects on the efficacy  measures chosen for this study.   
6.10. STUDY COMMITTEES AND COMMUNICATIONS  
6.10.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Committee    
An independent, three member  Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
assembled for this Phase 2 clinical trial.  The DSMB will consist of two expert 
neurologists (with ALS experience and no other involvement in this trial), with experience 
in safety trials  and a statistician .  The DSMB  will review initial safety data after 
approximately 12 patients have been treated and at periodic intervals thereafter.  
6.11. LABORATORY REQUIR EMENTS  
A central laboratory will analyze the clinical laboratory safety samples (hematology, 
serum chemistry) as described in Section 6. 8.5 for this study.  Laboratory samples will be 
sent to an independent laboratory for processing and analysis as specifi ed by the Sponsor.   
6.12. INVESTIGATOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREM ENTS  
6.12.1. Ethics  
The Sponsor/Investigator will obtain, from the clinical sites Institutional Review Boards (IRB), prospective approval of the clinical  protocol and corresponding informed consent form (s); modifications to the clinical protocol and corresponding informed consent forms, 
and advertisements (i.e., directed at potential research su bjects) for study recruitment.  
The only circumstance in which a deviation from the current IRB -approved clinica l 
protocol/consent form(s) may be initiated in the absence of prospective IRB approval is to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to the research subject(s).  In such circumstances, the Sponsor/Investigator will promptly notify the clinical sites IRB of the deviation.  
The clinical sites IRB operate in compliance with FDA regulations at 21 CFR Parts 50 and 
21 CFR 56, and in conformance with applicable International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (CGP).  
In the event that the clinical sites IRB require, as a condition of approval, substantial changes to a clinical protocol submitted under an FDA -accepted IND application, or in the 
event of the Sponsor -Investigator’s decision to modify the previously accepted clinical 
protocol the Sponsor/Investigator will submi t (i.e., in advance of implementing the 
change) a Protocol Amendment to the IND describing any change to the Phase 2 protocol

6.15.2. Appendix 2: Muscle Strength using Hand Held Dynamometry  
Muscle str ength tests will be assessed at  visits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 
The evaluators will use the MIRCOFET 2 HHD for all subjects in this study.  The 
dynamometer will be zeroed prior to each muscle test by pressing the reset button. All subjects will be seated upright in a hardback chair  with armrests for testing. If the subject 
cannot transfer to a chair then the subject can be tested in their wheelchair.  
Each muscle will be tested twice and both of the values recorded. However, up to three trials can be performed if the variability between the first two trials is greater than 15 % or if the evaluator thinks that one of the first two trials was not valid.  The numbers will be recorded on the forms provided by the coordination center.    
The testing pad for the HHD should be changed to fit the contour of the subject’s body. The finger test pad must be used for testing the first dorsal interosseous. The HHD should always be flat against the body part being tested and the force directed opposite to the direction of movement.   Prior to testing the subject with the HHD, the evaluator must ensure that the subject is able to actively move into the test position.  
The subject should rest between trials and then return to the starting position. The subject 
should be encouraged to push against the HHD with all of his/ her strength.  Subject must hold maximal contraction for at least two seconds.  Evaluator should match subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before increasing their force to break the contraction.  Encouragement needs to be consistent with all subjects.    
Shoes and orthotics should be removed prior to testing the legs.  Stabilization of the 
subject  is very important and should follow the instructions provided for each muscle 
group.  The subjects cannot hold on to the armrest during testing.  Subjects can be 
supported with pillows or by another person if they have trunk instability. Subjects can use BIPAP if needed during the testing.  
6.15.2.1. Shoulder Flexion 
The subject is seated in a hard back chair with the shoulder flexed at 45 degrees to the angle of the trunk. The forearm is in a neutral position and the elbow extended.  The subject’s feet are on the f loor. The resistance with the hand held dynamometer is placed 1 
inch just proximal to the elbow crease. The evaluator stabilizes at the top of the shoulder, avoiding contact with the anterior deltoid muscle. Evaluator should match the subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before increasing their force to break the contraction.   
The number is recorded, the dynamometer is reset to zero, and the test repeated.  
6.15.2.2. Elbow Flexion 
The subject is seated in a hard back chair with their arm by their side, not resting on the armrest.  The elbow is flexed to 90 degrees. The subject’s feet are on the floor. The 
forearm is supinated. The hand held dynamometer is placed 1 inch proximal to the wrist.

forearm is pronated and rests on the armrest.  The wrist is neutral (not flexed or extended).  
The subject’s feet are on the floor.  The hand held dynamometer is placed just proximal to the metacarpal joints. The evaluator stabilizes at the lateral elbow.  Do not allow elbow flexion.  Evaluator should match the subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before 
increasing their force to break the contraction.  The number is recorded, the dynamometer is reset to zero, and the test repeated.  
6.15.2.5. First Dorsal Interosseous  
The subject is seated in a hard back chair with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees.  Th e 
subject’s feet are on the floor. The forearm is pronated and resting on the armrest, the index finger is abducted. The hand held dynamometer with the finger attachment  is placed 
at the proximal interphalangeal joint on the lateral (thumb) side. The evalu ator stabilizes at 
the wrist on the ulnar side proximal to the MCP.  Take care not to exert a counter force with stabilizing hand.  Evaluator should match the subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before increasing their force to break the contract ion.  The number is recorded, 
the dynamometer is reset to zero, and the test repeated.  
6.15.2.6. Hip Flexion  
The subject is seated in a hard back chair with the hip flexed to 90 degrees.  They should rest their hands in their lap or at their side, and not hold onto the chair.  The subject must 
have adequate strength to flex their hip to the point where the back of their thigh comes off of the chair.  The leg being tested is raised into hip flexion with the opposite foot on the floor.  The hand held dynamometer is plac ed 1 inch proximal to the knee. The evaluator 
stabilizes at the lateral hip. The evaluator should match the subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before increasing their force to break the contraction.   The number is recorded, the dynamometer is r eset to zero, and the test repeated.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 60 6.15.3. Appendix 3: Procedure for IT transplantation of MSC -NTF cells  
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure and define the basic 
requirements for Intrathecal (IT) Transplantation of BrainStorm's proprietary MSC -NTF 
cells in clinical trials.  
The procedure described here is based on common clinical practice (standard lumbar puncture procedure) as well as the experience of the medical staff currently conducting the company's clinical trial at the Neurology Department of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.  
6.15.3.1. Product Handling and injection procedures  
All syringes should be gently  rotated for 20- 30 seconds until all cells are in suspension. 
For IM  injections remove syringe cap and connec t a 25Gx5/8” (0.5 x  16 mm) needle.  
With the needle in the upright position gently flick the syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Push the plunger up until the first drop is visible at the tip of the needle. At this point the product is ready for inject ion. 
For IT injections gently remove syringe cap. With the syringe in the upright position 
gently flick syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Slowly and carefully push plunger up, until the liquid meniscus is visible at the top of the (needle -less) syringe. Connect syringe 
to the 3
rd outlet of the valve, and inject the cells over roughly 2 minutes  (see section  
6.15.3.2. below) .  
6.15.3.2. IT Injection Procedure:  
1. When performing IT transplantation of MSC -NTF cells, the patient is typically 
placed in a left (or  right) lateral position with his/her neck bent in full flexion and knees 
bent in full flexion up to his/her chest, approximating a fetal position as much as possible.  
2. The area around the lower back is pre pped using aseptic technique.  A 20 G, 3.5 
inch, 0.9x90 mm spinal needle (such as: BD Cat. No. 405253) is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4 or L4/L5 to a depth at which there is a "give" indicating that the needle is past the ligamentum flavum.  3. The needle is inserted further until there is a second 'give', indicating that the 
needle is now past the dura mater and in the subarachnoid space.  
4. The stylet from the spinal needle is then withdrawn and a 3- way stopcock (such as 
Elcam Medical Cat. No. 582682) is immediately attached to the spinal needle .  
5. A 3 to 5 ml syringe, with the plunger drawn back, is attached to the 2nd outlet of 
the stopcock, and approximately 3 ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed (CSF is not ’aspirated’ since any negative pressure can be harmful, so the syringe plunger is  drawn 
back before connecting the syringe, and the syringe with the drawn -back plunger is then 
connected to the 2nd outlet of the stopcock and the CSF thus flows into the syringe).  
6. The syringe containing the CSF is removed and closed, the air is removed f rom the 
syringe and the syringe is then again placed at the 2
nd outlet of the stopcock. The CSF is 
injected back only after the injection of the MSC -NTF as described below.  
7. A second syringe containing a 4 ml suspension of MSC -NTF cells is attached to 
the 3rd outlet of the valve, and the cells are injected over roughly 2 minutes.  8. The stopcock is then immediately turned back to the 2nd outlet and approximately 
1 ml of the previously collected CSF is injected, "washing" the spinal needle and ensuring that th e entire cell suspension is transplanted into the patient.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 61 9. The procedure is completed by withdrawing the needle and immediately placing 
pressure on the puncture site.  
10. The syringe containing the remaining 2 mL of CSF is removed and capped and 
should be transferred to storage at -80ºC within 30 minutes of the completion of the 
procedure.  
11. The patient is typically asked to lie on his/her back for at least 2 hours, on an anti - 
Trendelenburg position and is monitored for signs of neurological problems.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 62 6.15.4. Appendix 4:  Procedure for IM transplantation of MSC -NTF cells  
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure and define the basic 
requirements for Intramuscular (IM) transplantation of BrainStorm's proprietary MSC -NTF cells in clinical trials.  
The procedure described here is based on common clinical practice (IM injection) as well 
as the experience of the medical staff currently conducting the company's clinical trial at  
the Neurology Department of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.  
6.15.4.1. Product  Handling and injection procedures  
All syringes should be gently  rotated for 20- 30 seconds until all cells are in suspension. 
For IM  injections remove syring e cap and connect a 25Gx5/8” (0.5x16mm) needle.  
With the needle in the upright position gently flick the syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Push the plunger up until the first drop is visible at the tip of the needle. At this point the product is ready for injection.  
6.15.4.2. Procedure:  
1. For IM transplantati on of MSC -NTF cells, the patient may be in a reclining or 
upright position. The upper arm area is prepped using aseptic technique.  In case of a hairy arm the arm is shaved prior to IM injections. 2. The syringes for IM injection contain an 0.32 ml suspension of MSC -NTF cells, in 
a 1 ml Luer -Lock syringe (such as: Becton Dickinson Cat. No. 309628), attached to a 
25Gx5/8” (0.5 x 16 mm, such as Becton Dickinson Cat. No. 300600) needle.  
3. The MSC -NTF cell suspension (0.2 ml) is transplanted into the patient by multiple 
intramuscular injections (IM) to a 1.5 cm depth (ensuring that injection is into the muscle and not into adipose tissue) at 24 separate sites on the patient's right  upper arm  biceps and 
triceps muscles, according to a map based on the designed grid (see below).  4. The procedure is completed by withdrawing the needle.  
5. The patient's arm is bandaged with a pressure bandage  
6. The patient is typically asked to remain in the clinic area  for at least 2 hours, and is 
monitored for signs of neurological problems.

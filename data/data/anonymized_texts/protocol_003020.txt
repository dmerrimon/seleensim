Study Design Part 1 of this protocol is a Phase 1, open -label, 3+3, dose -escalation study in subjects 
with WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma (G4 MG) who are in first or second relapse 
and who have not previously received any BEV or other anti -angiogenic agent, 
including sorafenib, sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, everolimus, or cilengitide or MRZ 
or any other proteasome inhibito r, including BTZ ,CFZ, or IXZ .  Three to 6 
evaluable subjects per cohort will be enrolled: approximately 24subjects ,to 
deter mine the MTD or MAD (Part 1 Dose-escalation) and an addition of at least 12
more subjects to confirm the MTD /MAD and determine the RP2D (Part 2 Expansion
Cohort ) and assess preliminary activity to a total of up to 36 subjects.  Subjects may 
not be enrolled in more than 1 cohort and there will be no intra -subject dose 
escalation.
The Phase 1 portion will be followed by Part 2 a Phase 2 study of single agent MRZ

sequential design of up to 30 response -evaluable subjec ts.
The Part 2 Phase 2 will be followed by Part 3 ,a Phase 2 study of combination MRZ 
using intra -patient dose escalation ,and BEV at a fixed dose .  MRZ will be 
administered as a 10 -minute infusion every week for 3 weeks in 28 -day cycles at a 
starting dose of 0.8 mg/m2(the RP2D from Part 1 Phase 1).  After the first cycle
without a dose-limiting adverse event (DLAE) , the dose of MRZ will be inc reased to 
1.0 m g/m2and after 1 more cycle without a DLAE the dose of MRZ will be 
increased to1.2 mg/m2.  BEV will be administered every 2 weeks (Days 1 and 15 of 
each 28 -day cycle) at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg.
DLAEs are MRZ -related AEs which are: 1) related to disturbances in the cerebellum 
(ie, ataxia, dizziness, dysarthria, fall, gait disturbances) plus hallucinations of any 
grade or 2) Grade ≥ 2other AEs. This portion of the study will be conducted in 
approximately 40eligible subjects of which , based on the A Es seen in Part 1 of the 
study, about 24 subjects are expected to be eligible for intra -patient dose escalation.
Part 4 (Phase 1 )of this protocol is a nopen -label, dose -escalation study (during C ycle 
1)in subjects with WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma (G4 MG) who are in first or 
second relapse and who have not previously received any BEV or other anti -
angiogenic agent, or MRZ or any other proteasome inhibitor .  Subjects will be 
treated with MRZ enterallyadministered via NG tube for one 28 -day treatment 
cycle, with three doses administered on Days 1, 8 and 15.  Subjects must receive at 
least 3dosesof MRZ , with two of them administered enterally during Cycle 1 ,to be 
evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT)
.  One to 6evaluable subjects per cohort 
will be enrolled in the first 3 dose -escalation cohorts, and 3to 6evaluable subjects 
per cohort will be enrolled in the next 6dose cohorts, to deter mine the MTD (Part 4
dose
-escalation) . Approximately 6additional subjects will be enrolled to confirm the 
MTD (Part 4dose-expansion ) and assess preliminary activity to a total of up to 
approximately 24subjects.  Subjects may not be enrolled in more than 1 cohort and 
there will be no intra -subject dose esca lation.
Part 5 Phase 1of this protocol is an open -label MRZ PK study in approximately 12 
subjects with WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma (G4 MG) who are in first or second 
relapse and who have not previously received any BEV or other anti -angiogenic 
agent, or MRZ or any other proteasome inhibitor.  Subjects will be treated with MRZ 
IV (0.8 mg/m2) on Days 1, 8 ,and 15 of each 28 -day treatment cycle.  BEV will be 
administered IV (10 mg/kg) on Day 15 of Cycle 1, after completion of MRZ PK 
sample collection, and subsequently on Days 1 and 15 (10 mg/kg) of each 
subsequent 28 -day cycle.

during Cycle 1, then enrollment into the next dose cohort can be initiated.
If ≥2 of the first 3 evaluable subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during 
Cycle 1, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will not proceed.
If 1 of the first 3 evaluable subjects in a dose co hort experiences a DLT during

the next 3 subjects at the next higher dose level can be initiated.
If ≥2/6 evaluable subjects in the expanded 6 -subject cohort experience a DLT 
during Cycle 1, then the MTD has been exceeded and no furth er dose escalation 
will occur.
The MTD isdefined as the dose level below the cohort wher e DLT is observed in at 
least 2 subjects in the same cohort during Cycle 1 .  Intermediate dosing levels may 
be explored if indicated.   If the Sponsor and Investigators agree, then additional 
cohorts starting below the MTD for the 10 -minute infusion may be enrolled to 
explore extended infusion lengths.   The dose of 0.8 mg/m2will not be exceeded and 
will be the MAD.  The RP2D is the MTD/MAD unless further saf ety information 
suggests a lower dose for future trials.
Teleconferences between Triphase and the clinical study sites will occur at least 
every other week to discuss safety.  Additional teleconferences may be scheduled at 
the end of each cohort to decide on the dose and/or MRZ infusion length of the next 
cohort.  Once the MTD or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) has been identified, 
a cohort of at least 12 additional ,evaluable subjects will be treated at the MTD /MAD
to further confirm the safety and to ass ess preliminary activity for the combination 
treatment.  This cohort may be used to determine the RP2D.

10-minute IV infusion.  If the subject tolerates the MRZ dose during the first cycle 
without a DLAE, the dose of MRZ will be increased to 1.0 mg/m2.  After 1 more 
cycle without a DLAE ,the dose of MRZ will be increased to 1.2 mg/m2.All dose 
increases require approval by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.
DLAEs are MRZ -related AEs 1) related to disturbances in the cerebellum ( ie, ataxia, 
dizziness, dysarthria, fall, gait disturbanc es) plus hallucinations of any grade or 
2)Grade ≥ 2 other AEs . If the MRZ starting dose of 0.8 mg/m2is not tolerated after

RegimenPart 1 Phase 1
MRZ will be administered IV over 10 minutes.  Other infusion lengths may be 
explored.  Volume of administration will vary based on assigned dose (Table S-1) 
and subject body surface area (BSA).  To mitigate the possibility of renal 
dysfunction, subjects will receive normal saline administered at 35 0 mL/hour for 
1hour before and for 2 hours after the MRZ infusion. The MRZ infusion will be 
started after approximately 350 mL of saline have been given over 1 hour.  After the 
MRZ infusion has been completed, approximately 700 mL of saline will be given 
over 2 hours, for a total volume of saline infusion equal to approximately 1 L.  Post 
infusion hydration may be reduced at the discretion of the Investigator.  The 
lyophilized drug product contains 2 mg API and 60 mg sucrose bulk excipient.

BEV will be administered as an IV infusion (90 minutes 1stdose, 60 minutes 2nddose 
and 30 m inutes afterward assuming tolerability) as described in the current package 
insert.  BEV will be administered approximately 10 minutes after the end of the 
MRZ infusion when co -administered on the same day.
Part 2 Phase 2
MRZ will be administered IV over 10 minutes at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2.  To m itigate 
the possibility of renal dysfunction, subjects will receive normal saline administered 
at 250mL for 30minutes before the MRZ infusion.  The lyophilized drug product is 
the same as used in the Phase 1 portio n.
Part 3 Phase 2
MRZ will be administered IV over 10 minutes at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/m2.  
Based on the subject ’s tolerability, the dose of MRZ may be increased after the first 
cycle without a dose -limiting adverse event (DLAE) and again after 1 more cycle 
without a DLAE .The lyophilized drug product is the same as used in the other 
portions of the study.   In Amendment 3 , pre and post MRZ dose hydration is not

MRI scans at the end of every even numbered cycle (± 7 days) using RANO 2010 
criteria for assessm ent.  Responses (complete response [CR] and partial response 
[PR]) should be confirmed by repeat scans performed 4 weeks (± 2 days) later.   
Subjects in Parts 2 , 3, 4 , and 5 may continue treatment with MRZ for 1 or 2 cycles 
after an MRI indicates progression of disease, if according to the Investigator’s 
judgement, the MRI is interpreted as showing possible pseudo -progression, and there 
is no significant clinical deterioratio n of the subject.
Functional status using the KPS

Part 1 Phase 1
A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD/MAD for MRZ +BEV 
combination treatment in 28 -day cycles.  (Subjects who do not have a DLT will be 
replaced if they discontinue treatment with MRZ or BEV in Cycle 1 for any other 
reasons.)  After MTD/MAD has been determined in the dose -escalation part of the 
study, at least 12 additional subjects will be treated at the MTD/MAD to confirm the 
safety and assess the preliminary activity for the combination of MRZ +BEV.
For all analyses by dose cohorts, the MTD/MAD confirmation cohort subjects will 
be combined with the correspo nding dose cohort in the MTD/MAD determination 
phase as one single dose cohort.
Part 2 Phase 2
A 2-stage sequential design will be utilized in Phase 2.  Fifteen response -evaluable 
subjects will be in the first stage.  If at least 1 response is observed, th en the study
will be expanded, and an additional 15 response -evaluable subjects will be treated.  If

Confident ial and Propri etary 24 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18 Mar 2020Part 3 Phase 2
Forty eligibl esubjects will be treated.  Assuming there are 30 deaths observed 
(ie,25% of the subjects are censored), the resulting 95 % confidence interval ( CI)is 
7.2 – 14.8 mont hs, with a width equal to 7.6mont hs for  an estimated median survival 
of 10 mont hs.
Part 4 Phase 1
A modified 3 + 3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD for MRZ
administered enterally via NG tube inthe first 28-day treatment cycle.  (Subjects 
who do not have a DLT in Cycle 1 will be replaced if they discontinue treatment 
with enterally administered MRZ in Cycle 1 before receiving at least 2 doses for any 
other reasons.)  After MTD has been determined in the dose -escalation part of the 
study, approximately 6 additional response -evaluable subjects will be treated at the 
MTD to co nfirm the safety of MRZ administered enterally via NG tube .
For all analyses by dose cohorts, the MTD confirmation cohort subjects will be 
combined with the corresponding dose cohort in the MTD determination (dose -
escalation) phase as one single dose cohor t.
Part 5 Phase 1
Tumor response, including progr essive disease ( PD), progression -free survival 
(PFS), and overall survival (OS) will be assessed.  Tumor response will be assessed 
by the Investigators using RANO 2010 criteria.  The overall confirmed response rate 
will be presented.  Endpoints of response based on tumor assessments will be 
calculated for subjects who received at least 3 doses of MRZ and had at least 1 post -
dose tumor evaluation.   Disease Progression ( PD), PFS, and OS will be tabulated for 
Part 5.
Safety (All Parts)
All subjects will be evaluated for safety analysis if they receive at least one dose of 
MRZ (or BEV in Parts 1, 3, 4 and 5 ).  The safety data will be presented in individual 
listings and summary tables, including frequency tables for adverse events and 
frequency and shift tables for laboratory variables.  The safety population will be all 
subjects who received at least one dos e of either study drug in any part of the study.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) (Part 1 Phase 1, Part 4 Phase 1 , and Part 5 Phase 1)
Non-compartmental analyses will be performed.  The following PK parameters will 
be calculated using standard non -compartmental analy sis: m aximum observed blood 
drug concentration (C max), time of maximum blood concentration (T max), elimination 
half-life (T 1/2), area under the blood concentration -time curve (AUC 0-inf), clearance 
(CL), and volume of distribution.  Blood concentrations and computed PK 
parameters for MRZ will be listed and summarized by cohort (mean, geometric 
mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum and number 
of observations).  Subject population for PK will be all subjects who received at least
one dose of either study drug and had at least one post -MRZ administration sample 
analyzed. Compartmental PK modeling may be conducted, as appropriate.

7. Hemogl obin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, and platelets .  Hematology tests can be performed 
within 72 hou rs of scheduled dosing on Day 1 except prior to Cycle 1, which can be done within 7 (+2) days prior to dosing.  Should a subj ect experience a Grade 4 
hematologic toxicity, the appropriate test will be monitored in accordance with institutional guidelines ( at minimum: weekly) until Grade ≤ 2.  The following tests should 
meet minimum stipulations prior to entry into Cycle 2+: Hgb ≥ 8 g/dL; platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L.
8. Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, glucose, BUN, uric acid, c reatinine, ALT
,AST, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and total 
bilirubin.  Chemistry will be performed within 72 hours of scheduled dosing, on Day 1 except prior to Cycle 1, which can be d one within 7 (+2) days prior to dosing.  
Minimum re -treatment criterion prior to the beginning of each new cycle: creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN.
9. Coagulation tests will be performed within 72 hours of scheduled dosing on Day 1, except prior to Cycle 1, which can be done within 7 (+2) days prior to dosing. 
Prothrombin time (PT) or International Normalized Ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may be performed more often if clinic ally indicated.  
10. Urinalysis: protein, blood, glucose, pH; microscopic (RBC, WBC, casts) if abnormal urinalysis. Urinalysis perfor med within 7 (+2) days prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 
1.  Additional urinalysis should be obtained if clinically indicated .
11. BEV administered as an IV infusion.  Cycle 1 Day 15 dose should be infused over 90 minutes and if tolerated, the second infusion (Cycle 2 Day 1) may be given over 60 
minutes, and if tolerated, subsequent infusions may be given over 30 minutes.  Infusions may be interrupted or lengthened to treat or prevent infusion -related reactions.  
The first dose of BEV is administered on Cycle 1 Da y 15 immediately following the 60 -minute PK blood collection, and approximately 10 minutes after the end of the 
MRZ infusion at all subsequent visits .
12. On Cycle 1 Day 1 , Cycle 1 Day 8, and Cycle 1 Day 15, MRZ PK samples will be obtained before treatment, just prior to end of infusion, and 2, 5, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 
60minutes after the infusion.  Every effort should be made to collect samples at the prescribed times, but excursions up to 10% of the time point are allowed.  Additional 
samples may be collected if the subject experiences a potentially drug -related SAE.  Use Sponsor -provided PK kits.  Process, store ,and ship samples per instructions in 
Study  Reference Manual.
13. Pregnancy test (serum or urine) to be performed at Baseline, End -of-Treatment visit, and more frequently if clinically indicated.
14. Tumor assessment: Baseline tumor assessments are to be made within 14 days (+3 -day window) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Response should be assessed (RANO 2010) 
during the rest period of Cycle 2 and during the rest peri
od of every 2 cycles thereafter (± 7 days).  If a subject is determined to have an overall disease response of CR or 
PR, then disease assessments should be repeated approximately 4 (± 2 days) weeks later to confirm the response.  If tumor ass essments have not been performed in the 4 
weeks prior to the End -of-Treatment Visit, then tumor assessments are to be done at the End -of-Treatment Visit.  If a subject has a standard of care tumor assessment 
done prior to giving Informed Consent, but within the 14 -day (+3-day)window, that is available to the Investigator, then that tumor assessment can serve as a baseline 
and another screening MRI is not required.
15. Subjects with drug -related AEs of Grade ≥2 observed at the End -of-Treatment Visit assessment should be fo llowed -up at least monthly until the AE has resolved to 
Grade 1, the event is believed to be chronic or subject receives other anticancer therapy.

1.1. Glioblastoma: Current Clinical Outcome
There i s an unmet clinical need for the therapy  of progressive or recurrent malignant glio mas 
(MG) with a m edian survival of < 12 m onths despite available chemotherapy .  Recurrence 
following current “standard of care” surgery , radi ation therapy  and adj uvant chem otherapy  is 
nearly  universal . The tradi tional therapies rely  on DNA damage and disruption of mitotic 
machinery, wit h limited effect in prol onging subje ctsurvival (Stupp 2005 ).The reported data 
show a 6month progression -free-survival  of 15% and median progression -free survival o f only 
9weeks among 225 subject s with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) (Wong 1999 ).Upon 
progression, subject s typically  devel op progressive physical and mental debilitat ion culminat ing 
in death 40 to 50 weeks from diagnosis. Novel  therapi es are being devel oped in an attem pt to 
target specific mo lecular mechanisms invo lved in abnormal signaling and resistance to apoptosis. 
1.2. Anti-angiogenic Therapy
Malignant glio mas have lo ng been known to be one of the most densely vascularized tumors
(Brem  1972 ).Malignant glio mas express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF ), a key  regul ator of angiogenesis. Levels of VEGF expressio n correl ate wi th both tum or 
grade and microvessel densit y (Plate 1992 ; Schmidt 1999 ; Samoto 1995 ).These findings 
suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF may provide an effect ive approach to suppress 
MGgrowth. Several preclinical studies in MG have shown promising ant itumor activit y of 
targeting VEGF and its cognate receptors (Kunkel 2001 ; Rubenstein 2000). In addit ion, 
inhibit ion of VEGF receptor signaling was shown to reverse the resist ance of GBM to radi ation 
therapy  in a preclinical study (Geng 2001).
Avast in®(bevacizumab , BEV ) (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA), an ant i-VEGF ,
humanized, monoclonal ant ibody ,has been examined extensively in preclinical m odels
(Avast in® Prescribing Informat ion 2014 and 2015). These studies found that single -agent 
therapy  with BEV resul ted in tum or growth inhibit ion of 20 different human tumor cell lines 
(13tumor types) im planted into nude mice irrespective of the route of administration or tumor 
location (Gerber 2005). A murine equivalent of BEV , A4.6.1 was shown to decrease tumor 
vascularit y, enhance tum or apoptosi s and prol ong survival of rats intracranially  implanted wi th 
glioblastoma cells (Rubenstein 2000). Various studies have examined the feasibilit y of 
combining anti -VEGF therapy  with cytotoxi c or biol ogical agents. Combining BEV with 
doxorubi cin, topotecan, paclitaxel, do cetaxel, or radiotherapy  resul ted in addi tive or synergistic 
tumor growth inhibit ion. Changes in vascular functions were frequent ly reported, including 
decreased vessel diameter, densit y, and perm eability  in response to treatment. A reduction in 
interstitial fluid pressure was also observed. In some studies, these improvements resulted in an 
increase in intratumoral uptake of chemotherapy, implying that the most effect ive use of 
anti-VEGF therapy  is in co mbinat ion with chemotherapy (Chauhan 2005).
1.3. Bevacizumab Clinical Experience
BEV has been studied in at least 5000 subject s in a number of Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.  
BEV is indicated in the United States for a variet y of cancer indicat ions including GBM , as a

Prescribing Informat ion 2014 and 2015).
The efficacy and safet y of BEV was evaluated in an open -label, mul ticenter, randomized, 
non-compar ative study  of subject s with previ ously treated GBM (Friedman 2009 ).  Subject s 
received BEV (10 mg/kg IV) alone or BEV plus irinotecan every 2 weeks unt il disease 
progression or until unacceptable toxicit y.  All subject s receive d prior radi otherapy  (com pleted at 
least 8 weeks prior to receiving BEV) and temozolomide.  Subject s with act ive brain hemorrhage 
were excluded.  Of the 85 subject s randomized to the BEV arm, the median age was 54 y ears, 
32% were female, 81% were in first relapse, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 90 −100 
for 45% and 70 −80 for 55%.  The efficacy of BEV was demonstrated using response assessment 
based on both WHO radiographic criteria and by stable or decreasing corticosteroid use, which 
occurred in 25.9 % (95% CI 17.0%, 36.1%) of the subject s. Medi an durati on of  response was 
4.2months (95% CI 3.0, 5.7).   Radiologi c assessment was based on MRI imaging (using T1 and 
T2/flair). MRI does not necessarily dist inguish between tumor, edema, and radiat ion necro sis.
Another s tudy was a single -arm, single inst itution tri al with 56 subject s with GBM . All subject s
had docum ented disease progression after receiving temozo lomide and radiation therapy
(Avast in® Prescribing Informat ion 12/2016). Subject s received BEV 10 mg/kg IV every  
2weeks unt il disease progression or unacceptable toxicit y.  The median age was 54, 54% were 
male, 98% Caucasian, and 68% had a KPS of 90−100.   The efficacy o f BEV was supported by  
an objective response ra te of 19.6% (95% CI 10.9%, 31.3%) using response assessment based on 
both WHO radiographic criteria and by stable or decreasing corticosteroid use .Medi an durat ion 
of response was 3.9 months (95% CI 2.4, 17.4).
1.4. Marizomib
Mari zomib(MRZ , also known as NPI-0052, Salinospora mide A ,or CC -92763) is a highly potent 
20S proteasome inhibitor originally derived from a marine act inomycete ( Figure 1).  
Pharmaco logy data support the clinical development of this invest igational agent in the treatment 
of a variet y of solid tum ors (including MG) and hematol ogic malignancies (including mult iple 
myeloma).

Confident ial and Propri etary 44 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020Pharmaco logy and toxi cology studi es were performed to support init ial dosing in subject s with 
advanced malignancies.  The pharmaco logy program  consisted o f single- and m ultiple-dose 
testing in the mouse, rat, and monkey; cytochro me P450 inhibit ion studi es; and a vari ety of 
invitro mechanism -of-action and in vivo tumor-efficacy studies.  Toxico logy studi es included 
dose-range finding, Good Laboratory  Practi ce (GLP) repeat -dose safet y studi es, and pivotal  
long-term toxici ty studi es in rats and primates with toxicokinetics and assessment of 
pharmacodynamics by proteasome inhibit ion.  Cardi ovascular safet y parameters, such as blood 
pressure, heart rate, electro cardiogram (ECG), troponin I, and creatine kinase (CK) iso forms, 
have been measured as part of the GLP toxico logy studi es.  No -observed -adverse -effect l evels 
(NOAELs) and severely toxic doses have been ident ified in the rat and primate to establish a safe 
starting human dose in the init ial Phase 1 trials o f single agent MRZ.
1.4.1. Pharmacology
MRZ inhibit s proteasom e activit ies wi th a significant ly different profile and at different 
concentrations compared to bortezomib (BTZ) .  Initial in vitro studi es dem onstrated that MRZ is 
a potent inhibitor of the CT- L (IC50 3.5 nM) and T -L (IC50 29 nM) activit ies of human 
erythrocyte-derived derived 20S proteasomes but is less potent at inhibit ing the C- L activit y 
(IC50 430 nM).  Bortezomib exhibited a sim ilar inhibit ion of CT -L activit y compared to MRZ
(IC50 8 nM) but different profiles on the T -L (IC50 590 nM) and C -L (IC50 53 nM) activit ies. 
MRZ is also a more potent inhibitor of NF -κB act ivation and cy tokine synt hesis co mpared to 
bortezomib ( Chauhan 2005 ). 
Proteasome inhibit ion holds potential for therapeutic act ivity in incurable brain tumors such as 
GBM.  Due to high mutation rates, malignant cells generate excessive amounts of misfo lded 
proteins in co mpar ison to normal cell s, a si tuation that is exacerbated, particularly in brain 
tumors, by  reactive oxy gen species (ROS).  Upon reduction or elimination of proteasome 
activit y, these waste products accumulate, leading to cellular stress and apoptosis.  Thus, to 
prevent cell dea th, cancer cells rely on the residual proteasome act ivity, rendering them 
potenti ally more vulnerable to proteasom e inhibit ion in co mpar ison to normal cells.  Thus, 
apoptosis may be selectively induced in cancer cells by inhibit ing their proteasome act ivity.  
Bortezomib has been evaluated as a potential ant i-GBM drug.  Although showing good activit y 
against GBM cells in vitro (Bota 2013), bortezomib does not cross the blood brain barrier 
(Yu2006) and thus has proven ineffect ive in animal models and in the clinic (Labussiere 2008 ;
Phuphanich 2006 ).
Bota and coworkers (Bota 2013) investigated the in vitro activit y of MRZ in primary  cell 
cultures derived from human brain tumors (high -grade and l ow-grade glio ma and meningio ma), 
norm al neural stem /progeni tor cells (NSC) and the established MG lines, U251
-MG and 
D54-MG.  Malignant glio ma stem  cells (GSCs) and the two cells li nes were highly  sensi tive to 
MRZ (IC 5020-50 nM) ( Figure 2-AB), in contrast to the low -grade glio ma, m eningi oma, and 
NSC -derived cells (no effect at 60 nM) ( Figure 2-A).  Treatm ent wi th MRZ at 60 nM for 4hours 
inhibited proteasome activit y by 89-90% in U251- MG and D54 -MGcells ( Figure 2-C).  MRZ
cytotoxi city was dependent upon increased free radical production and apoptosis in glio ma cells 
since these effects were partially suppressed by the ROS quenching agent N -acetyl cysteine 
(Figure 2-D).

of 7 to 15 minutes for both humans and monkeys, although some individuals may exhibit a 
half-life of up to 30 minutes.
The short half -life is consistent with the very  rapid clearance fro m thevascular compart ment, in 
the range of several liters/min in man.  Clearance is independent of dose level and duration of 
administration.  A rapid clearance is also observed in mo nkeys. The vo lume of distribut ion (Vd) 
is large, approaching or exceeding tot al body  mass. 
In an animal model using [3H]-MRZ , MRZ is excreted via both the urinary and fecal routes.

lower l evels of radi oactivi ty include brain (approximately 10% of peak blood levels), spinal 
cord, testis and skin, whereas no radioactivi ty was detected in adipose tissue or bone.  
Radioactivi ty remains in the body  for at l east 10 days, consistent with the irreversible binding of 
MRZ to proteasom es and other tissue co mponents.
Protein binding could not be determined due to the s hort half -life or MRZ .  The di sappearance of 
MRZ in vitro in human liver microsomes does not appear to be P450- mediated.  Based on

drug interactions wit h substrates for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 is considered to be low.
1.4.3. Toxicology
1.4.3.1. IV MRZ
The toxi city profile of MRZ following IV inject ion to rats and mo nkeys was similar between the 
2species as the same general array o f treatm ent-related effects occurred in both species.  These 
included lack of adverse in -life signs, changes in RBCs (decrease) and leukocy tes (increase) and 
serum  chemistry  param eters (notably  increases in indices of hepat ic and renal funct ions), organ 
weight effects, and histopathological alterati ons.  The data from the rat study  suggested target 
organs of kidney, liver, spleen and adrenal gland whereas in the monkey study  the target organs 
were ki dney , nerve fibers in deep cerebellar white matter and spinocerebellar tracts pathway s and 
pancreas. The effects occurred mainly in the high dose groups (0.60 increased to 
0.75 mg/m2/dose in the rat and 0.45 increased to 0.60 mg/m2/dose in the m onkey ).  In addi tion, 
inhibit ion of proteasome activit y was noted, wi th CT-L activit y being the most sen sitive 
indicator of exposure to MRZ and exhibit ing inhibit ion at all doses.
The observations fro m the pivotal  toxicity studies suggest that 6 to 9 month prolonged exposure 
to MRZ is not associated with an increased incidence or severit y of toxicity, or the induct ion of 
any new toxicit y as co mpared to the findings fro m the previous 1-month studies. In fact fewer 
target organs were noted in the long -term studi es.
Based on the findings observed in the pivotal GLP studies, the fo llowing dose levels were 
determi ned: a NOAEL in rats of 0.30 mg/m2and in m onkeys of 0.225 m g/m2; a highest 
non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) or maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 
0.75 mg/m2in rats and 0.6 mg/m2in monkeys.

Confident ial and Propri etary 48 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020The genotoxic potential o f MRZ has been invest igated in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay and in the micronucleus test in human lymphocy tes.  In the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay, no signs of toxicit y and no evidence of mutagenic act ivity were observed fo llowing 
exposure to MRZ with or wi thout added S9 mix. In the micronucleus test, concentrations of up 
to 70 nM in the absence of S9 mix and 150 nM in the presence of S9 mix did not induce 
significant inducti on of  micronuclei; at higher concentrations MRZ showed evidence of causing 
an increase in the induct ion of micronuclei in cultured human lymphocy tes.  It should be noted 
that the concentrations inducing micronuclei in this study  are considerably  higher (by a factor of 
≥ 20- fold) than the IC 50values observed for inhibit ion of human proteasome inhibit ion (3.5 nM).  
Thus, one possible interpretation of the data is that the induct ion of micronuclei may be related 
to cellular cy totoxi city as it is not observed at non -cytotoxi c, yet pharmacol ogically  active, 
concentrations of MRZ .
In summary, the toxico logical effects profile for IV administered MRZ has been well established 
in rats and mo nkeys.  No unique species or gender effects were observed.  In addition, any 
potenti al safety  concerns for the clinical studies (as identified in the toxico logy studi es) h ave 
been addressed in the current clinical protocols via an extensive monitoring schedule.
1.4.3.2. Oral MRZ
The toxi cological effects profile o f orally  administ ered MRZ have also been established in the 
nonhuman primate .  In a GLP study in cyno molgus m onkeys (ITR 30948), the toxi city, 
toxokinet ic (TK), and PD profil es of  MRZ were determined following oral  capsule
administration to the cyno molgus monkey on Days 1, 8 and 15, as well as the reversibilit y ofany 
changes fo llowing a 14 -day recovery  period.  The test and Control /Excipient items were 
administered to groups of 7 monkeys per gender per dose (4 monkeys/gender/dose terminated 
one day  after the l ast dose, 3 m onkeys/gender/dose terminated after the 14 -day recovery period).   
Dosages administered were 0, 0.0083, 0 .025, and 0.0375 mg/kg/dose (corresponding to 0, 0.1, 
0.3 and 0.45 mg/m2, respectively).
Param eters evaluated in this study  included daily mortalit y and clinical signs and observations
along wi th weekly body  weight m easurem ents. Serial blood samples were obtained on Days 1
and 15 of treatment for quantificat ion of marizo mib and the bioanalyt ical data obtained were 
used for toxicokinet ic parameter evaluat ion. Bl ood sam ples were al so collected for
p
harmacodynamics on Day s 1 and 15 for evaluat ion of chymotry psin-like, caspase -like and 
trypsin-like proteolyt ic activit ies. Bl ood and urine samples were also obtained for clinical 
pathol ogy evaluat ion (hematology , clinical chemistry  and coagul ationparameters) prior to start 
of treatm ent, on Day  2 and pri or to necr opsy  for all main animals as well as at the end of 
recovery . Fecal occul t blood collect ions and analysis were performed on Days 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 14 
and 16 as well as prior to terminat ion on Day  30 for recovery  animals. At terminat ion, a gross 
external and i nternal evaluat ion was conducted, selected organs were weighed and 
histopathology  evaluat ion was performed.
Treatm ent of c ynomolgus monkeys wit h oral  capsul e administration of MRZ on Days 1, 8, and 
15 was well tolerated at a dose level of 0.0083 mg/kg/ dose. Treatment of cynomolgus monkeys

intestines correlated with an increase in circulat ing white blood cells populations, most notably 
neutrophil s and m onocy tes and changes in the spleen (sinus neutrophilia and/or hist iocytosis), 
mesenteric lymph node (sinus neutroph ilia), and/or bone marrow (myelo id hypercellularit y). All 
findings were completely reversed fo llowing a 14 -dayrecovery  period.
In this study , no gender differences in marizomib pharmacokinet ics were observed following 
once a week oral capsule administration of marizomib in cyno molgus monkeys. Although there 
was a dose related increase in C maxand AUC laston both treatment day s, the C maxand AUC last
estimates obtained on Day  15 were l ower than those obtained on Day  1 in the l ow (0.0083 
mg/kg) and mid dose (0.025 mg/kg) group, but were comparable on both treatment days in the 
high dose group (0.0375 mg/kg). Since the exposure on both treatment day s was similar in the 
high dose group (the likely  therapeut ic dose), the observed trend of change in accumulat ion 
index with dose is not likely to have any impact on the pharmacodynamics/efficacy in a clinical 
setting using higher therapeutically relevant doses.
Macroscopic and microscopic findings in the stomach and small intest ines were considered to be 
related to the administration of MRZ at dose levels of ≥ 0.0083 mg/kg/occasi on including 
inflammat ion, edema/hemorrhage, epithelial degeneration /necrosis, and/or erosion noted in the 
mucosa and/or submucosa of the cardia, fundus, and pylorus portions of the stomach and 
inflammat ion, edema/hemorrhage, and/or villous atrophy  noted i n the m ucosa of  the duodenum 
and jejunum. The incidence and severit yof microscopic changes were proportional to dose of 
MRZ and reversed completely fo llowing a 14 -day recovery  period. The microscopic changes in 
the stom ach and small intestines were considered adverse based on the incidence and severit y of 
change at dose l evels o f 0.025 and 0.0375 mg/kg/occasio n of MRZ.  
The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of MRZ administered orally was considered 
to be the 0.0083 mg/kg/dose, based on the adverse findings of the clinical signs, microscopic
changes (stomach, small intestines and spleen) and hematology  changes that resulted fro m the
administration of marizo mib at the two higher dose levels tested on this study. Changes that were 
noted i n the l ow dose animals were considered to be of low magnitude and reversible. The
Highest Non -Severely  Toxic Dose (HNSTD) was considered to be the high dose, 0.0375 
mg/kg/occasio n(0.45 m g/m2), based on the absence of mortalit y and reversibilit y of the adverse 
findings fo llowing the 14 -day recovery  period.

In Part 2 (Phase 2) of this MRZ -108 study , subjects received MRZ monotherapy at a dose of 
0.8mg/m2; MRZ was administered as a 10 -minute infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 -day 
cycle.  As of 04 January 2018, 30 of the 30 target subjects enro lled on study haddiscont inued for

subject (3%) was not response evaluable .
Study MRZ -108 Amendment 3 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Recurrent Glioblastoma)
MRZ -108 Amendment 3 was designed to determine the maximally tolerated dose for MRZ by  
intra-subject dose escalation.  Forty -one subjects wit h progressive or recurrent WHO G rade IV 
GBM, were enrolled in MRZ- 108 Phase 2, Amendment 3 and received the combinat ion of MRZ 
and BEV , with MRZ administered as a 10- minute IV infusio n every  week f or three weeks in 28 -
day cycles (on Day s 1, 8 and 15) at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/m2. As of 04 January 2018, 33 
subjects completed the study .  Afte r the first cycle without a dose -limit ing adverse event (DLAE) 
the dose of MRZ was increased to 1.0 mg/m2, and after one m ore cy cle wi thout a DLAE the dose 
of MRZ was to be increased to 1.2 mg/m2.  BEV was administered every  2 weeks on Days 1 and 
15 of eac h 28-day cycle, at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg.  
DLAEs are MRZ -related AEs which are: 1) related to disturbances in the cerebellum ( ie, ataxi a,

adverse event.   In this ongo ing study, the RP2D for MRZ was determined to be 0.8 mg/m2in 
recurrent GBM (in agreement with Part 1 of the study ).  
Study MRZ -108 Amendment 4 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Recurrent Glioblastoma)
Part 4 of the study  was added to assess the feasibility  of enterally -administered MRZ. The MRZ 
IV formulat ion was reconstituted and administered enterally via NG tube for the first 28 -day 
treatm ent cycle. In Cy cle 2 and all subsequent cycles, MRZ was administered IV at the 
recommended dose and schedule determined in Part 1. Fourteen subjects have been enrolled in 
Part 4 of this ongoing study .
Study MRZ -112 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ;Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (ndGBM)
The study  is examining the effect of the addit ion of MRZ to standard of care treatment utilizing 
two study  arms: Conco mitant Treatm ent in which MRZ is combined with temozolomide (TMZ)
+ radiation therapy  (RT) and Adjuv ant Treatm ent in which MRZ is co mbined with TMZ.  The 
study  is being conducted as fo llows: 
Stage 1 (Dose -Escalation): 3 to 6 evaluable subjects per MRZ dose cohort were 
enrolled in each study arm (MRZ 0.55 to 1.2 mg/m2). A total of 33 subjects were 
enrolled.
Stage 2 (Dose- Expansion):  Concomitant Treatment was followed by Adjuvant Treatment 
to confirm the MTD for each treatment regimen as determined in the Dose -Escalation 
(Stage 1), and to assess preliminary activit y of the RP2D.
Stage 2, Amendment 2:  The protocol was amended (Amendment 2) to add another 
treatment arm to include MRZ 0.8 mg/m2+ TMZ + Optune®.
As of 10 Jul 2019, 66 subjects have been enro lled in Study MRZ -112 (35 in the concomitant 
treatm ent arm , 18 in the adjuvant treatm ent arm , and 13 in the Optune arm). Twenty- five of the 
35 subjects enro lled in the conco mitant treatm ent arm  also continued to receive adjuvant 
treatm ent. Overall, 47 (71.2%) subjects experienced at least 1 Grade ≥ 3 TEAE. Fatigue, 
vomiting, ataxi a, and hypertensio n were the most frequent ly reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs. Grade 3 
or higher TEAEs occurred most frequent ly in the SOCs of nervous system disorders, general 
disorders and administration site condit ions, psychiatric disorders, and gastroi ntestinal disorders.
Six (6)DLTs occurred during dose -escalat ion, wi th 5 of the 6 DLTs occurring in the 1.0 mg/m2
cohort: 
In adj uvant Cohort 2 (0.7 mg/m2), one subject experienced Grade 3 fat igue for > 7 
days; 
In concomitant Cohort 4 (1.0 mg/m2), DLTs i ncluded Grade 3 ataxia/diarrhea 
(1subject), Grade 3 ataxia/confusion (1 subject), and Grade 3 myo cardial  infarcti on 
(1 subject) for which the relat ionship to MRZ could not be excluded;

Confident ial and Propri etary 53 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020In adj uvant Cohort 4 (1.0 mg/m2), DLTs included Grade 3 delirium/atax ia (1 subject) 
and Grade 3 ataxia/fat igue (1 subject). 
A total o f 7 subjec ts (21 %) had a TEAE that led to discont inuat ion of MRZ treatment of which 
five of these subjects received MRZ at 1.0 mg/m2.  Eleven of the 12 subjects (92%) dosed at 1.0 
mg/m2 exper ienced at least one Grade ≥ 3 TEAE.  In contrast, 5 of the 21 subjects in the lower 
dose cohorts experienced at least one Grade ≥ 3 TEAE, including 2 subjects (33%) at 0.55 
mg/m2, 2 subjects (22%) at 0.7 mg/m2, and 1 subject (17%) at the 0.8 mg/m2dose.  B ased on the 
totalit y of these data, the RP2D for MRZ was determined to be 0.8 mg/m2 added to the standard 
of care radi ation and TMZ in newly diagnosed GBM.
1.4.5. Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamic (PD) data demonstrate that MRZ is a potent inhibitor of all 3 prote asom e 
activit ies and that the inhibit ion pattern is dose -, cycl e-, and schedule -dependent.  The PD profile 
of MRZ -induced proteasome inhibit ion has been assessed in clinical studies at 10 dose levels 
(0.0125 to 0.9 mg/m2).  Im portantly , preliminary  clinica l PD activit y detected in early  trials of 
MRZ closely mi rrored the encouraging data from preclinical studies in rodents and primates.  In 
the first -in-human trial Study  NPI-0052- 100, where sample sizes were small and PD activit y was 
collected only  during Cycle 1, CT -L activit y was inhibited modest ly (up to 20%) even in the first 
cohort (0.025 mg/m2), more robustly  at intermediate doses ( eg, 50-80% at 0.25 mg/m2) and was 
completely inhibited at high doses of 0.7 mg/m2and above.  For T -L activit y, inhibit ion was 
observed at lower doses (up to 20% at 0.25 mg/m2) but a robust effect (over 50%) was noted at 
doses of 0.7 mg/m2and above, even by C1D15.  The C -L act ivity was the l east affected, with 
little to no inhibit ion seen wi thin the fi rst cy cle at doses up to 0.55 mg/m2, although several 
subject s receiving at least 0.7 mg/m2achieved a 30 -40% inhibit ion of C -L act ivity.
In tri als NPI -0052- 101 and -102, partial or complete inhibit ion of all three proteasome subunits 
was achieved with both once -and twice -week ly MRZ dosing, wi th the rank order of sensit ivity 
(CT- L > T -L > C -L; Levin, 2016 ) consi stent wi th the bi ochemical  potency  of MRZ 
(Teicher, 2015
). For CT -L activit y, both ini tial (C1D1) and peak proteasome inhibit ion was 
dose-dependent, with complete (100%) inhibit ion of CT -L activit y in PWB, and maximal 
(60-80%) inhibit ion of CT-L activit y in PBMC, within the first dosing cycle .Increasing MRZ 
dose exposure resulted in increasing inhibit ion of CT -L activit y in PWB, wi th estimated 50% 
inhibitory  dose l evels o f 0.3 and 0.8 mg/m2in the once -and twice- weekly infusio n arms, 
respectively  (95% Confidence Intervals: AM, 0.02 –4.3; MM, 0.14 –4.5), indicating equivalent 
proteasomal inhibitory  activity of MRZ in P WB between tumor ty pes or infusio n regimens. 
Importantly, proteasome inhibit ion in the nucleated cells (PBMCs) was comparable at all dose 
levels to that observed in PWB samples after both a single dose or repeated doses. These data 
suggest that the irrever sible binding mode of MRZ can overcome the resynt hesis o f proteasom e 
subunit s in nucleated cells, as expected for an irreversible proteasom e inhibitor . 
In contrast to the rapid and robust inhibit ion of CT -L activit y, C-L and T -L activit ies were 
unchanged or increased in the first cy cle of MRZ dosing, suggest ing co mpensatory 
hyperact ivation in response to effect ive blockade of CT -L act ivity (Levin, 2016 ).
Importantly, 
this response was overcome by  further treatm ent wit h MRZ, wi th inhibit ion of T-L and C -L 
activit y noted across dose levels wit h repeated dosing. These data suggest that init ial potent 
inhibit ion of CT-L activit y leads to a com pensatory  hypera ctivati on of  the C -L and T -L subunits.

Confident ial and Propri etary 54 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020As CT -L activit y beco mes fully inhibi ted by  the i rreversible act ivity of MRZ, progressive 
inhibit ion of the hyperact ivated C -L and T -L subunits occurs, ult imately result ing in robust pan -
proteasome inhibit ion within 2cycles in the m ajority ofsubjects .
Similar patterns of pan -proteasom e inhibit ion by MRZ have been observed in more recent, 
multiple agent studies, as in the single agent studies detailed above. In Study  NPI -0052- 107, in 
which MRZ is administered twice we ekly in co mbinat ion with pom alidomide and DEX, mean 
CT-L inhibit ion of 80% i s observed in Cycle 1 at the 0.4 mg/m2dose, and ~100% inhibit ion of 
CT-L is observed by the last infusio n of Cycle 1 (Day  11) at the 0.5 m g/m2dose (RP2D). As in 
the single agent studi es, minimal inhibit ion with some act ivation of T -L and C -L activit y were 
observed during Cycle 1, however with repeated administration of MRZ, inhibit ion of these 
hyperact ivated subunits beco mes apparent in Cycles 2 and 3.   Similarly, preliminary data
demonstrate pan -proteasome inhibit ion of MRZ in subject samples of PWB and PBMC in 
subjects with Grade IV m alignant glio ma (MRZ -108). In thi s ongoing study , MRZ i s infused 
once weekly, in co mbinat ion with bevacizumab. Preliminary data from the RP2D MRZ do se 
cohort (0.8 mg/m2) dem onstrate pan -proteasome inhibit ion of MRZ in subject samples of PWB 
and PBMC, with mean CT -L inhibit ion of ~70% was observed after the first MRZ dose of 
Cycle 1, and persisted at the time of the second MRZ dose of Cycle 1.  Subsequ
ent MRZ doses 
resul ted in 100% inhibit ion of CT -L post -infusio n, and 60 -80% inhibit ion prior to the next 
infusio n.  A slight increase in T -L and C -L activit y in PWB samples was observed after the first 
MRZ infusio n, after which inhibit ion of T -L (up to 70% post-infusion) and of C -L (up to 50% 
post-infusio n) through Cycle 6.  Persistent inhibit ion of T -L and C -L was observed at the time of 
the next MRZ dose, demonstrating the irreversible nature of pan- proteasom e inhibit ion induced 
by MRZ in these non -nucleated cells.  Pre -and post -infusio n inhibit ion of T -L and C -L was less 
robust in the PBMC samples as co mpared with PWB specimens, with maximum levels o f 
40-60% inhibit ion observed for both T -L and C -L activit y.
1.4.6. Pharmacokinetics
The who le blood human pharmacokinet ics (PK) of MRZ administered as a single agent have 
been assessed in clinical Studies NPI -0052- 100, NPI -0052- 101, and NPI -0052- 102.  Blood levels 
have been measured fo llowing intravenous (IV) doses of MRZ from 0.025 to 0.9 mg/m2.  
Depending on the study , doses were administered either as a bo lus over 1 minute or as a bolus 
and as an infusio n with a no minal infusio n time o f 10 to 120 minutes.  Preliminary PK analyses 
indicate the PK profile in humans is similar to the profile observed in animal studi es, ie, the drug 
has a short half -life in who le blood with init ial t1/2 estimates i n the range of 3.6 ± 0.6 to 8.7 ± 
6.8 min fo llowing a 1- 10 min IV infusio n.  Similar t1/2 values were observed (range 
6-
15minutes) following a 120 -minuteinfusio n. 
More recent ly, the PK of MRZ in who le blood were assessed in Study  NPI -0052- 107, in which 
MRZ is administered twice weekly  as an infusi on for 120 min on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 
28-day cycle, in combinat ion with pom alidomide (administered orally, 3 o r4 mg/ day, days 1 -21) 
and DEX (administered orally, 5 or 10 mg, Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 22, and 23). 
Blood l evels have been measured fo llowing IV MRZ doses of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/m2(lyophile 
formulation) on Study  Day 8. Noncom partmental  pharmaco kinet ic analysis o f these data 
revealed similar parameter estimates to those obtained fro m prior clinical studi es. MRZ

binding of MRZ to blood components. MRZ did not appear to affect the PK of either 
co-administered pomalido mide or DEX. 
PK of MRZ in who le blood were also assessed in Study  MRZ -108, in which MRZ is 
administered once weekly as an infusio n for 10 min on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle, in 
combinat ion with bevacizumab (BEV, administered I V at a dose of 10 mg/kg). Blood MRZ 
levels were measured fo llowing IV MRZ doses of 0.55, 07, and 0.8 mg/m2(lyophile 
formulation) on Study  Days 1 (pre -dose and end -of-infusio n only ) and 15 (full PK sampling).  
Serum  BEV concentrati ons were m easured on Days 1 and 15, pre -dose and at the end -of-
infusio n. Noncompart mental analysis of the MRZ PK data revealed similar T 1/2, Vd, and CL 
param eter estimates to those obtained fro m in the NPI -0052- 107 study , and again these 
param eter estimates appeared to be dose -independent. Earlier T maxvalues and higher C maxvalues 
were observed in MRZ -108 than in NPI -0052- 107, which were ant icipated based on the shorter 
MRZ infusio n time. MRZ did not appear to affect the PK of co -administered BEV.  
The PK of MRZ in who le blood wa s also assessed in Study MRZ -112 in which MRZ was 
administered as a 10 min IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, 29 and 36 of the 6 -week concomitant 
treatm ent cycle, in combinat ion with temozolomide (TMZ), administered orally  at a dose of 75 
mg/m2/day  and radi otherapy delivered 5 days/w eek for 6 w eeks. Blood MRZ levels were 
measured fo llowing IV MRZ doses of 0.55, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/m2on study  Days 1 and 8. 
Blood sam ples were taken at pre -dose, immediately prior to the end of infusio n, and then at 5 
and 60 minut es post -infusio n on Day  1; and pre -dose and immediately  prior to end of infusio n, 
and then 2, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post -infusion on Day 8. PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, 
t1/2, AUC0- t, AUC0 -inf, CL, Vd) were estimated fro m the Day  8 data by  non-compartmental 
analysis (NCA). Serum TMZ concentrations were measured on Day s 1 and 15, pre -dose, 1-hour 
post-dose, and 24 h ours post -dose (prior to the next TMZ dose). Plasma TMZ concentrations 
were m easured to assess TMZ peak and trough levels.   
Analysis of the MRZ PK data revealed 
similar t1/2 (6.6 to15.4 min), Vd (64 to 122 L), and CL (341 to 4164 L/hr) parameter estimates 
to those obtained in previous clinical studies with MRZ administered as a single agent, and again 
these parameter estimates appeared to be dose-independent.  MRZ did not appear to affect the 
PK of co -administered TMZ.

Part 1 is a Phase 1, mult icenter, open -label, 3+3, dose -escalat ion study  in subjects with G4MG
who are in first or second relapse and who have not previously received any BEV or other anti -
angiogenic agent, including :sorafenib, sunit inib, axit inib, pazopanib, evero limus, or cilengit ide 
or MRZ or any  other proteasom e inhibi tor, including bortezomib (BTZ) ,carfilzo mib (CFZ) , or 
ixazo mib (IXZ) .  Three to 6 evaluable subjects per cohort will be enrolled: up to 24subjects to 
determine the MTD /MAD (Part 1 dose -escalation) and an addit ion of 12 or more subjects to 
confirm the MTD /MAD (Part 2 MTD /MAD expansion) and assess preliminary act ivity,to a total  
of up to 36 subj ects.  Subj ects m ay not be enrolled in more than 1 cohor t.
The Part 1 Phase 1 portion will be fo llowed by a Part 2 Phase 2 study  of single agent MRZ 
administered as a 10 -minute infusion at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2(the MAD) every week for 3 weeks 
in 28 -day cycles.  Thi s porti on of  the study  will be conducted as a 2 -stage sequential design of up 
to 30 response -evaluable subjects .
Part 2 Phase 2 will be fo llowed by Part 3 Phase 2 study  of combinati on MRZ and BEV.  MRZ 
will be administered as a 10- minute infusio n every week for 3 weeks in 28 -day cycles at a 
starting dose of 0.8 m g/m2(the RP2D fro m Phase 1).  After 1 cycle without a DLAE , the dose of 
MRZ will be incr eased to 1.0 mg/ m2.  Ifthe increased dose is tolerated with no DLAEs , the dose 
will be further increased to1.2 mg/m2in the next c ycle.  BEV will be administered every  2 
weeks (Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle) at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg.  
DLAEs are MRZ -related AEs which are: 1) related to disturbances in the cerebellum ( ie, ataxi a, 
dizziness, dysarthria, fall, gait disturbances) plu s hallucinat ions of any grade or 2) Grade ≥ 2 
other AEs.  
This porti on of  the study will be conducted in approximately  40 eligible subjects of which, based 
on the AEs seen in Part 1 of the study , about 24 subjects are expected to be eligible for intra -
patient dose escal ation.
Part 4 Phase 1 will also study  thecombinat ion of MRZ and BEV.  MRZ IV formulat ion will be 
reconstituted and administered enterally via NG tube for the first 28 -day treatment cycle, with 
three doses administered on Days 1, 8 and 15. BEV will be administered as an IV infusio n on 
Day 15, approximately  10 minutes after the completion of the MRZ enteral dose administration.  
In Cycle 2 and all subsequent cy cles, MRZ will be administered IV at the recommended dose 
and schedule determined i n Phase 1 Part 1: MRZ 0.8 mg/m2IV weekly for three weeks (Days 1, 
8 and 15) of a 28 -day cycle and BEV 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 15.
Subjects must receive at l east 2 doses of MRZ via NG tube during Cycle 1 to be evaluable.  One 
to six evaluable subjects pe r cohort will be enro lled in the first 3 dose -escalat ion cohorts, and 
three to six evaluable subjects per cohort will be enro lled in the next 6 dose cohorts, to determine 
the MTD (Part 4 dose
-escalation). Approximately 6 additional subjects will be enrolle d to 
confir m the MTD (Part 4 dose -expansio n) and assess preliminary  activity to a total  of up to 
approximately  24 subjects.  Subj ects m ay not be enrolled in more than 1 cohort and there will be 
no intra -subject dose escalat ion.This porti on of  the study  will be conducted in approximately  24 
eligible subjects.

Confident ial and Propri etary 69 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020In Part 5 Phase 1of the study , all subjects will receive MRZ infused over 10 -minutes IV at the 
dose and schedule recommended fro m Phase 1 Part 1: MRZ 0.8 mg/m2IV weekly for 3weeks 
(Day s 1, 8 ,and 15 ) of a 28- day cycle. Full PK sampling will be done on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 
Day 8, and Cycle 1 Day  15, wi th blood sam ples collected at pre -dose, immediately prior to end 
of infusio n (EOI) ,and then 2, 5, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post -EOI, for determ ination o f 
blood MRZ concentrations.  BEV will be administ ered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes on 
Cycle 1 Day 15, immediately fo llowing the MRZ PK blood sample co llection.
In Cycle 2 and all subsequent cy cles, MRZ will be administered IV at the same dose and 
schedule (0.8 mg/m2IV weekly for 3weeks (Day s 1, 8 ,and 15) of a 28- day cycle), wi th IV 
MRZ infused over 10 minutes.  BEV will be administered as an IV infusio n (90 minutes 1stdose, 
60minutes 2nddose,and 30 minutes afterward assuming tolerabilit y) at a dose of 10 mg/kg on 
Days 1 and 15 of every 28 -day cycle.  BEV will be administered approximately  10minutes after 
the end of the MRZ IV infusio n. Approximately  12 eli gible subjects will be enrolled in the study  
at a single center.

Confident ial and Propri etary 71 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 20205. PROCEDURES
Study  visit s and procedures will be performed as outlined in Table 1for subjects in Parts 1, 2, 
and 3 ,Table 2for subjects in Part 4 Phase 1 , and Table 3for subjects in Part 5 Phase 1 .
The study  will consist of Screening, Baseline, Treatment, and Follow -up peri ods.  Except where 
otherwi se stated, the procedures apply  to all Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts of the study .Neurological 
coordinat ion assessment and qualit y of life assessment will not be done in Part 4 Phase 1.
5.1. Screening
Screening procedures may not be done prior to the signing and dating of the Informed Consent 
Form  (ICF) .  However, the results of tumor assessments done as part of standard of care that are 
within the 14-day (+3 days)screening period do not have to be repeated if they were done at the 
participat ing site.  However, if results are not available, then tumor assessments are to be 
conducted within 14 days prior to Cy cle 1 Day  1.  The screening period for assessments that 
include medical history  (including demographics and cancer history ), pri or medicat ions and 
procedures may not exceed a 28 day(+3days for scheduling conflicts) window prior to start of 
study  treatm ent (Cy cle 1 Day  1).
5.2. Baseline
Physical examinat ion including height, weight, and vital signs, Karnofsky Performance Status 
(KPS) scale (see Appendix A), ECGs , laboratory  tests including hematol ogy, coagul ation, 
chemistry , 
urinalysis; and, as appropri ate, pregnancy  tests .  
 
5.3. Treatment
Safety tests and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures ( Table 1for Part 1 Phase 1, Part 2 Phase 2, and Part 3 Phase 2 ; Table 2for Part 4 
Phase 1; Table 3for Part 5 Phase 1).  PK sam ples correl ated wi th ECG will be obtained prior to 
the start of treatm ent and then after dosing at selected time points for Part 1 Phase 1, Part 4 Phase 
1, and Part 5 Phase 1. Part 5 Cycle 1 Day 1 ECGs will  be collected by  Holter m onitor 
continuously through completion of the 60- minute PK blood collect ion.Tumor assess ments will 
include MRI scans at the end of every  even numbered cy cle(± 7 day s)using RANO 2010 
criteria for assessment.   Subjects may cont inue treatment with MRZ for 1 or 2 cycles after an 
MRI indicates progression of disease, if according to the Invest igator’s j udgement ,the MRI i s 
interpreted as showing possible pseudo -progression, and there is no significant clinical 
deteri oration of  the subject or if it is in the best interest of the subject . 
Funct ional status using the KPS will be conducted in both Phases.   
 
Subjects m ay continue on study  treatm ent until disease progression ,unacceptab le toxicit y, 
withdrawal  of consent, or terminat ion of the study .

Confident ial and Propri etary 72 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 20205.4. End-of-Treatment Visit
An End -of-Treatment Visit shoul d occur when a subject discont inues study treatment.  Tests are 
primarily to ensure there are no late oc curring AEs a nd that AEs have r esolved or have 
stabilized.  Addit ional follow-up visit s may be conducted to follow ongoing AEs that are 
resolving.  If a subject cannot or will not make this visit, attempts to gather information on the 
status of AEs should be made by telephone or other means.
5.5. Post Study Follow-up
All subjects will be fo llowed forsurvival during the follow-up peri od for as l ong as they  are 
alive.  Post Study  follow-up will occur every  3 months (±7days) after the End-of-Treatm ent
Visit.  During l ong-term follow-up, the following inform ation will be co llected: survival, first 
subsequent ant i
-GBMsystemic regimens ,and treatment outcomes .
5.6. Activity Assessments
Tumor response, incl uding progressive disease, will be assessed wit h MRI at the end of every
2cycles o f therapy  according to the RANO criteria (Wen 2010 ), including:
Radiographic Overall  Response Rate 
Progression -free Survival (PFS) 
Overall Survival (OS)
Confirmation o f response at 4 weeks (± 2 days) after the response is to be performed.
Ifthe Investi gator believes that an MRI indicat ing tumor progression by RANO criteria may 
reflect pseudo -progression, and there is no significant clinical deterioration of the subject , the 
subject may be continued for 1 or 2 addit ional cycles (at the discre tion of  the Investi gator based 
on the subject ’s clinical condit ion) before another MRI assessment is conducted.  If a subject is 
taken off study  for progressive di sease by  imaging and subsequent biopsy  or surgi cal resecti on 
shows no evidence of disease, th e subject will be counted as a responder.  In this case, the 
subject may return to the study for addi tional treatment with MRZ, using a post -procedure MRI 
as the new baseline.
5.7. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments: MRZ (Part 1 Phase 1 ,
Part 4 
Phase 1, and Part 5 Phase 1)
Blood shoul d be drawn from  the contral ateral  arm to the infusio nsite and using an indwelling 
catheter to avoid mult iple needle st icks is recommended.  Sam ple collection t ime should be 
recorded on the tube label and Case Report Form (CRF) as day: hour: minute.  Nominal t ime of 
blood collection are given as “t ime po ints”; it is criti cal that an accurately collected actual time 
of the sam ple is wri tten on the CRF and on the blood tubes (date entered as dd:mm:yyyy; time 
entered using a 24 -hour clock, hh:mm).
In Part 1 Phase 1, MRZ samples will be obtained before treatment and just prior to end of 
infusio non Cy cle 1 Day  1.In Part 1 Phase 1, o n Cycle 1 Day 15, MRZ blood samples 
will be obtained before treatment, just prior to end of infusi on, and 2, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 
90, and 120 minutes after the infusion .

Confident ial and Propri etary 80 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 20207. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS
7.1. Description of Investigational Product(s)
MRZ is an invest igational product that will be provided by the Sponsor.  BEV is available 
commercially  and will  be provi ded by the Investi gator vi a prescript ion to subjects who are 
enrolled into this study .
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
7.2.1. Administration of MRZ in Part 1 Phase 1
MRZ will be administered IV over 10 minutes or longer depending upon cohort (refer to 
Directions for Use regarding direct ions for administration time).  Volume of administration will 
vary based on assigned dose and subject body  surface area (BSA) .  To mit igate the possibilit y of 
renal dysfunction, subjects will receive norm al saline administered at 350 mL/hour for 1 hour 
before and for 2 hours after the MRZ infusio n. The MRZ infusio n will be started after 
approximately  350 mL of saline have been given over 1 hour.  After the MRZ infusio n has been 
completed, approximatel y 700 mL of saline will be given over 2 hours, for a total volume of 
saline infusio n equal to approximately 1 L.  
Subjects should maintain good oral hydration during the study ( eg, 2 L/day ).  The vol ume and 
durati on of  hydrat ion may be reduced at the disc retion of the Invest igator, especially for subjects 
with low body  weight or wi th condi tions sensi tive to fluid overl oad.
Subjects m ust not drive a vehicle or operate heavy  machinery  while on this study .
The lyophilized drug product contains 2 mg API and 60 m g sucrose bulk excipient.  Cartons 
contain one vial of ly ophile together wi th a Dil uent vi al containing 55% propylene glycol, 5% 
ethano l, and 40% ci trate buffer pH 5 (20 mL fill; 10 mL intended for use).  The ly ophile drug 
product reconstituted with 10 mL diluent results in a dosing solut ion comprised of 
55% propylene glyco l, 40% citrate buffer and 5% ethano l, with 6 mg/mL sucrose as a 
pharmaceut ical excipient.  T he drug is delivered at 0.2 mg/mL a t a final dosing sol ution of  
pH~6.  A dose of 0.7 mg/m2will resul t in approximately 7 mL o f infusate.
7.2.2. Administration of BEV in Part 1 Phase 1 ,Part 3 Phase 2 , Part 4 Phase 1 , and 
Part 5 Phase 1
BEV will be administered as an IV infusio n (90 minutes 1stdose, and if tolerated 60 minutes 2nd
dose and 30 minutes on subsequent doses if tolerated ) as described in the current package insert.  
During Part 5 Phase 1, the first dose of BEV will be administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 5
immediately  following the 60-minute PK blood collect ion.  During all other treatment cycles,
BEV will be administered approximately 10 minutes after the end of the MRZ administration 
when co -administered on the same day .
7.2.3. Administration of MRZ in Part 2 Phase 2
MRZ (0.8 m g/m2) will be administered IV over 10 minutes (refer to Direct ions for Use).  To 
mitigate the possibilit y of renal dysfunction, subjects will receive normal saline administered at

7.2.4. Administration of MRZ in Part 3 Phase 2
MRZ will be administered IV over 10 minutes (refer to Direct ions for Use).  The lyophilized 
drug product is the same as used in previous parts .
Starti ng dose in each subject will be 0.8 mg/m2.  Intra -patient dose escalat ion will be used.  After 
the first cy cle wi thout a DLAE, the dose will be increased by 0.2 mg/m2to 1.0 mg/m2(an 
increase of 25% ).  After one more cycle wit hout a DLAE the dose of MRZ will be increased to 
1.2 m g/m2(an increase of 20%) forthat cy cleand subsequent cycles.
Subjects should be encouraged to maintain good oral hydration during the study  (eg, 2 L/day ).  
Renal dysfunct ion has not been observed during the conduct of the study , incl uding in Part 2 
Phase 2 where vo lume and duration of pre and post dose hydration was reduced.  It is therefore 
not consi dered a safety  concern and will not be required in Part 3 Phase 2.  Should ren al function 
beco me a safet y issue, pre -dose hy dration will be reinstated if thought necessary by the 
Sponsor’s medical mo nitor and study  team  and the Invest igators.
Subjects m ust not drive a vehicle or operate heavy  machinery  while on this study .
7.2.5. Administr ation of MRZ in Part 4 Phase 1
Subjects should not eat or drink for 2 hours prior to and 2 hours after enteral administration of 
MRZ via NG tube.
In Cycle 1, MRZ IV formulat ion will be reconst ituted and administered enterally via NG tube 
over up to 10 minutes (refer to Direct ions for Use).  Volume of administration will vary based on 
assigned dose and subject body  surface area (BSA).  The vo lume of MRZ administration is 
calculated by: Vol ume = Dose (mg)* BSA (m2)/ 0.2 (conc. of MRZ in so lution in mg/mL). The 
lyophilized drug product i s the same as used in previous parts of the protocol .
In Cycle 2 and all subsequent cy cles, MRZ (0.8 mg/m2) will be administered IV over 10 minutes 
(refer to Direct ions for Use).  
Subjects should be encouraged to maint ain good oral hydration during the study  (eg, 2 L/day ).  
Renal dysfunct ion has not been observed during the conduct of the clinical studies in GBM , 
including in Part 2 Phase 2 where vo lume and duration of pre and post dose hy dration was 
reduced, and in Par t 3 Phase 2 where pre and post dose hy dration was not required.  It i s

days despite adequate supportive therapy or prevent ing the next scheduled dose from 
being administered within 4 days of scheduled day ; for ≥Grade 3 fatigue to be 
considered a DLT, it m ust be present for more than 7days.
Subjects without DLT in Cycle 1 who do not receive 3 MRZ doses or 2 BEV doses within 
5weeks from first dose will not be evaluable for DLT and will be replaced.
Part 2 Phase 2
If at any  time after 3 subjects are enrolle d, the incidence of AEs that fit the definit ion of DLT 
from Phase 1 occurs in >33% of the subjects, then enro llment will be paused.  Available data 
will be reviewed and a decisio n regarding continuing to enroll subjects at the 0.8 mg/m2over 
10minutes dos e in Phase 2 is agreed between the Sponsor and Invest igators.   Adjustment 
downward on dose or lengthening infusio n duration will be considered and the Phase 2 portion 
restarted at the selected dose and infusio n time.

Subjects who do not have a DLT in the first cy cle of  a dose cohort will be replaced if they do not 
receive at least two doses of enterally -administered MRZ, with the second dose administered no 
more than 7 days after the scheduled dose.  Subjects who demon strate intolerabilityto enteral  
MRZ administrati onfor any  reason may continue to receive subsequent MRZ treatments 
intravenously.
Part 5 Phase 1
Amendment 5 does not include an assessment of dose -limit ing toxicit y, as MRZ will  be 
administered by  IV infus ion at the MTD as confirmed in Part 3 Phase 2 (0.8 mg/m2on Days 1, 8,

7.2.8. Dose Escalation Process and MTD /MAD Determination
Part 1 Phase 1 
Initially 3 subjects will be enrolled into a cohort, commencing with Cohort 1 and the doses 
shown in Table 5.Dose escalation will proceed as fo llows:
If none of the first 3 evaluable subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during 
Cycle 1, then enrollment into the next dose cohort can be init iated.
If ≥2 of the fi rst 3 evaluable subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during Cycle

Confident ial and Propri etary 92 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020The MTD i s defined as the dose level below the cohort where DLT is observed in at least 
2subjects in the same cohort during Cycle 1.  Intermediate dosing levels may  be expl ored if 
indicated.   The dose of 0.8 mg/m2will not be exceeded and will be the MAD.
During the dose escalat ion phase of the protocol, if 2 DLTs are noted in the first 2 subject s of a 
cohort pri or to the thi rd subject being enrolled, the third subject will not be enrolled in that 
cohort.  If there is 1 DLT in the first 3 subjects and the cohort is expanded and another DLT is 
noted prior to enrolling all 6 subjects in the cohort, further enro llment in that cohort will be 
halted.  If during the dose expansio n phase there are ≥3 DLTs in the first 6 o r fewer subject s 
then the MTD will be reassessed by the Invest igators and Sponsor .
Teleconferences between Triphase and the clinical study  sites will occur at least every  other 
week to discuss safet y.  Once the MTD /MAD has been ident ified, a cohort of at least 
12additional, evaluable subjects for a total of 36 subjects will be treated at the MTD /MAD to 
further confirm the safet y and to assess preliminary  activity for the combinat ion treatment.   This 
cohort may be used to determine the RP2D.
Part 4 Phase 1 
A modified 3+3 design will be used to define the MTD for MRZ IV form ulation reconst ituted 
and administered enterally via NG tube in the first 28- day cycle, wi th MRZ administered on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 and BEV on Day  15. Initially one subject will be enrolled into each of the first 
3 dose cohorts to expedite dose -escalat ion into the ant icipated therapeutically  effect ive dose 
range, f ollowed by enrollment of 3 subjects each into the next 6dose cohorts. 
Enteral MRZ dose escalat ion will proceed as fo llows:
If the first DLT -evaluable subject in dose cohort 1 does not experience a DLT or 
intermediate toxi city during Cycle 1, then enrollment into the next dose cohort can be 
initiated. Interm ediate toxi city is defined as any  Grade 2 or hi gher adverse event t hat 
is deemed clinically  significant by  the Invest igator and which cannot be clearly 
ident ified as being related to the underlying condit ion, comorbid condit ion, or 
concomitant medicat ion.
If the first DLT -evaluable subject in a 1 -subject dose cohort exper iences a DLT 
during Cycle 1, then up to 5 addit ional subjects will be enro lled into the same cohort.
The 1 -subject cohorts will be expanded to 3 subjects with the second instance of first -
cycle intermediate toxicit y.  Interm ediate toxicit y is defined as an y Grade 2 or hi gher 
adverse event that is deemed clinically significant by the Invest igator and which 
cannot be cl early ident ified as being related to the underlying condit ion, com orbid 
condi tion, or concomitant medicat ion.  Once a 1- subject cohort has bee n expanded, 
all subsequent cohorts will have at least 3 subjects (unless the first 2 subjects have 
DLT prior to the enrollment of a third subject).
If there are 2 subjects with DLT in Cohort 1, then 3 subjects can be enrolled in Cohort

approximately  20%.
Once the MTD has been ident ified, a cohort of approximately 6 addit ional, evaluable subjects 
will be treated at the MTD to further confirm the safet y of the combinat ion treatment.
Teleconferences between Sponsor and the clinical study sites will occur at least every other week

decide on the dose of the next cohort.
7.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
Part 1 Phase 1
Treatments consist of IV doses of MRZ and BEV.  Subjects will enter the study  sequent ially and 
be assigned to a cohort (dose l evel) based on the evaluat ion of subjects who were previously 
treated according to the dose escalat ion scheme.  Once the RP2D is determined, subject s will be 
treated at the RP2D in the expansio n cohort unless the Invest igators and Sponsor agree to a lower 
dose for safet y reasons.
Part 2 Phase 2
Treatments consist of IV doses of MRZ.  Subjects will enter the study  sequent ially.
Part 3 Phase 2
Treatment consists of IV doses of MRZ and BEV.   Subject swill enter the study  sequent ially.
Part 4 Phase 1
Treatments consist of once -weekly enterally administered doses of MRZ IV form ulation 
reconstituted and administered via NG tube (Day s 1, 8, and 15), with a single IV dose of BEV on 
Day 15.  Subj ects will enter the study  sequent ially and be assigned to a cohort (dose level) based 
on the evaluation of subjects who were previously treated according to the dose escalat ion

BEV in each 28- day cycle.  Subj ects who do not have a DLT in the first cycle of a dose cohort
will be replaced if they  discont inue treatment with MRZ or BEV in Cycle 1 for any other reason.  
Subjects who miss a dose of MRZ or BEV or cannot receive all doses within 5 weeks fro m first 
dose during Cycle 1 and do not have a DLT will not be evaluable for DLT and will be replaced.  
After MTD /MAD has been determined in the dose -escalat ion part of the study , at least 
12additional subjects will be treated at the MTD /MAD in an expansio n cohort to confirm the 
safet y and assess the preliminary activity for the combinat ion of MRZ + BEV administered up to 
a total  of 36 subject s.
For all analyses by dose cohorts, the MTD /MAD confi rmation cohort subjects will be combined 
with the corresponding dose cohort in the MTD /MAD determinati on phase as one single dose 
cohort.
Part 2 Phase 2
Subjects enrolled in the Part 2 Phase 2 portion of the protocol will receive 0.8 mg/m2MRZ IV on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28 -day cycles. A minimum of 15 response -evaluable subjects will be 
enrolled in Stage 1, and up to 15 addit ional response -evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Stage 
2, for a maximum of 30 response -evaluable subjects .  After the first 15 response -evaluable 
subjects in the fi rst stage have received 2 or more cycles of therapy , available study  data will be 
reviewed by  the Phase 2 Review Committe e consisting of the Invest igators at each study  center, 
the Medi cal Monitor, and the Sponsor’s Chief Medical and Scient ific Officers and Study  
Coordinator. The Phase 2 Review Co mmittee will recommend whether to enroll the second stage 
based on an assessmen t of both safet y and efficacy .  If there are no safet y concerns and clinical 
benefit is demonstrated with evidence of disease response , defined as at least one response 
(partial response (PR) or better )as determined by RANO cri teria, in 15response -evalua ble 
subjects , then 15 additional response -evaluable subjects will be enro lledin Phase 2 .  Otherwise, 
there will be no further enrollment into the study .
Efforts will be made to ensure the correct number of subjects is accrued, and enrollment will be 
caref ully monitored and communicated wi th the si tes.  There m ay be instances where, as a result 
of simultaneous screening act ivities, subjects may qualify  for the study  at the sam e time,

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening conco mitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory  test val ues (as specified by the crite ria in Section10.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any  worsening ( ie, any clinically  significant adverse change in the frequency  or 
intensity of a pre -exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or s yndro me 
shoul d be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of 
the diagnosis or syndrome. 
Overdose (accidental or intent ional), abuse, withdrawal, sensit ivity or toxici ty to study  treatm ent 
shoul d be reported as an AE .  If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and AE 
shoul d be reported as separate terms. Any sequelae of an accidental or intentional overdose of 
an invest igational product should be reported as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequelae of an 
overdose are an SAE, then the sequelae must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE 
CRF. The overdose result ing in the SAE should be ident ified as the cause o f the event on the 
SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself. Medication errors, 
defined as an overdose with > 105% of drug administered, or underdose, defined as < 95% of 
dose administered, are to be reported as AEs.  Prescribed dose reductions for AEs are not 
considered medicat ion errors. On a schedule or frequency ba sis, an overdose is defined as 
anything m ore frequent than the protocol required schedule or frequency. On an infusio n rate 
basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol -specified rate. Complete data 
about drug administration, includin g any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was 
accidental  or intent ional, should be reported in the case report form. 
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study .  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all o f the following param eters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , 
pathol ogical, radi ological or surgical  findings, physical examinat ion findings, or findings from 
other tests and /orprocedures.
All SAEs will be recorded by  the Invest igator from the t ime the subject sig ns informed consent 
until 28 days after the l ast dose of study  treatm ent and those SAEs made known to the 
Invest igator at any  time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study treatment .  AEs are 
recorded fro m the start of the first infusio n of study  treatm ent.  AEs occurring before the first 
infusio n of IP are considered medical history  and shoul d be recorded on the medical history  
CRF.  AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and in 
the subject ’s source docum ents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.

Confident ial and Propri etary 101 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 202010.2.1. Seriousness 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening ( ie, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
Requi res inpat ienthospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substan tial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life 
threatening or resul t in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the othe r outcom es listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on. However, hospitalizat ion 
or prol onged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
Routine treatment or monitoring o f the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any 
deteri oration in condit ion.
The administratio n of blood or platelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.  However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igatio ns (eg, surgery , scans, 
endoscopy , sam pling for l aboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling).  However, 
hospi talizati on or prol onged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
A procedure that is planned ( ie, planned pri or to starting of treatment on study ); must 
be docum ented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospitalizat ion or prolonged 
hospi talizati on for a c omplicati on remains a reportable SAE.
An elect ive treatment of or an el ective procedure for a pre -exist ing condit ion 
unrelated to the studied indicat ion. 
Emergency  outpati enttreatm ent or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling ot her seriousness criteria above.

Confident ial and Propri etary 102 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed.
For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study treatmen t, acti on taken regarding study  treatm ent, and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/intensityof the event. 
The severit y/ intensi tyof AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms accordin g to 
the current active minor versio n of theCommo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (NCI -
CTCAE, Version 4.03).
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f study  treatm ent
and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to study  treatm ent
administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient explanat ion for 
the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of study
treatm entcaused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the study  treatm ent
and the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently availa ble 
inform ation.  Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.   For regul atory  purposes, i t is the Sponsor that is responsible for making the final 
causalit y assessment.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, t he Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event .  
For AEs that become SAEs, the start date of the SAE will be when the seriousness criteria 
are met.  The original AE will have a stop date the same as the start date of the SAE.  The SAE
will have a stop date of when the seriousness criteria are no longer met.  If the AE continues after 
the seri ousness criteria are no longer met, then a new AE will be recorded with a start date the 
same as the SAE stop date and a stop date when the AE is completely resolved.  In all cases, the

maximum grade should be used to categorize severit y.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with each stu dy drug as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable ( eg,discont inuat ion, interrupti on,or reduction of study  treatm ent, as appropriate) and 
report if conco mitant and/or addi tional treatm ents were given for the event . 
10.2.6. Outcome
The I nvestigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, returned to baseline, stabilized, or 
died (due to th e SAE or due to another cause) . 
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is to be considered an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therap eutic 
intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  If the abnormalit y was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnormalit y shoul dbe recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a posit ive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) o f a female subject occurring while the subject is on study  treatm ent or wi thin28 
days of the subject’s last dose of MRZ or 6 m onths of the subject’s last dose of BEV are 
considered immediately reportable events.  Study treatment is to be discont inued immediately .  
The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or posit ive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene

Confident ial and Propri etary 104 MRZ -108 Amendment 5 Final: 18Mar 2020The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gyneco logist, preferably  one 
experienced in reproductive toxicit y for further eval uation and counseling.  
The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy , and m ust 
notify Celgene Drug Safet yimmediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal ( eg,spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator 
shoul d report the abnormal outcome as an AE .  If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the seri ous 
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Inves tigator’s knowl edge of  the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or approved equivalent form .
All neonatal  deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs.  In addit ion, any infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safet yby 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approve d equivalent form .
10.4.2. Male Subjects
If a f emale partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking study  treatm entshoul d notify  the Investi gator, and the pregnant female partner 
shoul d be advised to call her healthcare provi der immediately .
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any serious criterion requires reporting as an SAE within 24 hours of the 
Invest igator’s knowledge of the event.  This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as 
any fo llow-up reports.
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to IP) that occur during the study  
(from the time the subject signs informed consent unt il 28 days after the last dose of IP)  or any 
SAE m ade known to the Investiga tor at any  time thereafter that are suspected of being related to 
IP.  Seri ous adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) are to be recorded 
within the CRF, but do not require reporting to Celgene Drug Safety.
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant 
initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of a ll SAE 
inform ation on file including correspondence wit h Celgene and the IRB/EC.
The SAE is reported direct ly to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method 
using the SAE Report Form or approved equivalent form. The SAE report should prov ide a 
detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospital records and other 
relevant docum ents. If a subject died and an autopsy  has been perform ed, resul ts of the autopsy  
report and/or death certificate are to be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y as soon as these become 
available. Any  follow-up data, including responses to safet y queries, should be detailed in a

qualificat ions. If the IRB/EC will not disclo se the names, occupations and qualifications of the 
committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composit ion of 
the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number 
may be accepted as a subst itute for this list. Formal approval by  the IRB/EC shoul d mention the 
protocol  title, number, am endment number (if applicable), study  site (or regi on or area of 
jurisdict ion, as applicable), and any  other docum ents reviewed. It must ment ion the date on 
which the decisio n was made and must be officially signed by  a commi ttee m ember. Before the 
first subject i s enrolled in the study , all ethical and legal requirements must be m et.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance wit h local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
shoul d also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all co mmunicat ion with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinat ing Invest igator and the IRB/EC. This statem ent al so applies to any  
communicat ion between the Invest igator (or Coordinat ing Investigator, if applicable) and 
regul atory  authori ties.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study  must be reviewed by Celgene and/or 
Triphase and the IRB/EC prior to use.

All aspects of the study  will be carefully mo nitored by  Triphase or its authori zed representative 
for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns wit h respect to current GCP and standard 
operating procedur es.
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Triphase ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study .  All aspects of the study  are reviewed with the Invest igator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study , a 
Triphase representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for o btaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator.  Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilit ies, 
investigat ional product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study  
docum entati on will beinspected/reviewed by the Triphase representative in accordance wit h the 
Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any result ing 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
correcti ons will be made direct ly to the CRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper rec ording be verified.  Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, CRFs ,andapplicable supporting records of study  subject parti cipat ion for 
audits and inspect ions by IRB/IECs, regulatory  authori ties (eg,FDA, EMA, Healt h Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Invest igator shoul d make every  effort to be available 
for the audi ts and/or inspect ions.  If the Investigator is contacted by  any regulatory  authori ty 
regarding an inspect ion, he/she should contact Celgene and/or Triphase immediately.
A Product Qualit y Complaint (PQC) i s any  written, el ectroni c, or oral  communi cation that 
alleges deficiencies related to the ident ity, qualit y, durabilit y, reliabilit y, safet y, effect iveness, 
purity, or perform ance of any  drug product m anufactured by  or on behalf of Celgene Corporation 
after it is rel eased for distribut ion.  PQCs m ay reduce the usabilit y of the product for its intended 
funct ion or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the subject.  
Examples of PQCs include (but are not limited to): mixed product, mislabeling, lack of effect, 
seal/packaging breach, product missing/short/overage, con taminati on, suspected falsified, 
tampered, diverted or stolen material, and general product/packaging damage. If y ou becom e 
aware of a suspected PQC, y ou are obligated to report the issue immediately . You can do so by  
emailing custom ercomplaints@celgene.com or by  contacting the Celgene Customer Care Center 
(1-888-423- 5436).

Confidential and Proprietary 1 27 Ma rch 2017 AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
Protocol MRZ-108 Amendment 3 
1. AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND DESCRIPTION 
Summary 
In Amendment 3, all subjects will receive IV MRZ infusion followed by IV BEV infusion.  MRZ 
will be administered as a 10-minute, IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle using 
intra-patient dose escalation.  Starting dose will be 0.8 mg/m2 (RP2D dose).  If the starting dose is 
t
olerated and no Dose Limiting Adverse Event (DLAE) is observed, the dose will be increased to 
1.0 mg/m2 after1 cycle.  If the increased dose is tolerated again and no DLAE is observed, the dose 
o
f MRZ will be increased to 1.2 mg/m2 after 1 more cycle.  Dose reductions will be applied as 
necessary and according to the toxicities noted.  DLAEs are defined as MRZ related AEs observed 
w
hich are: 1) related to disturbances in the cerebellum (i.e. ataxia, dizziness, dysarthria, fall, gait 
disturbances) plus hallucinations of any grade. 2) Any other AEs of Grade  ≥ 2. 
If the starting dose of 0.8mg/m2 is not tolerated (after appropriate medical treatment of adverse 
e
vents, if applicable), the dose will be decreased to 0.7 mg/m2.  A further reduction to 
0.55 mg/m2 is allowed, if necessary. 
Rationale 
Central nervous system (CNS) AEs were noted during the early development of MRZ in subjects 
with solid tumors, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.  Based on this early data the assumption 
wa
s made that the drug was blood-brain barrier penetrant, and this assumption led to explorin g 
MRZ in G4 MG.  
In Part 1 of this study, conducted under Amendment 1 (note: original protocol was not 
implemented), the combination of MRZ and a fixed dose of BEV was studied in a Phase 1 study; 
the maximum dose level for MRZ to be studied was set at 0.8 mg/m2 because of the CNS AEs 
observed in the early studies. The RP2D of MRZ was determined to be 0.8 mg/m2 with BEV, 
howe
ver a MTD for MRZ + BEV (as defined in the protocol) was not determined.   
I
n Part 2 of this study (Amendment 2) MRZ was studied as a single agent in the same subject 
population in order to explore whether MRZ has activity as a single agent in relapsed or 
recurrent G4 MG.  A Phase 2, 2-stage design was used to assess the activity of MRZ as a single 
agent.  The preliminary results of the Phase 2 portion (Part 2) of the study, determined that single 
a
gent MRZ at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/m2 is active with 1 partial response documented in 
15 subjects the first stage of the 2-stage design.  The second stage is ongoing/recruiting at 
pr
esent, for a total of 30 subjects. 
Analysis of safety and efficacy data from the MRZ + BEV combination (Part 1 of this protocol) 
suggests that subjects experiencing certain AEs associated with the central nervous system 
(CNS) have a better outcome in terms of ORR, PFS, and OS than subjects not experiencing any 
of
 these CNS AEs.  The assumption and justification for adding Part 3 to this protocol is that 
these
 CNS AEs are indicative of higher MRZ concentrations in the brain leading to both toxicity

Confidential and Proprietary 2 27 Ma rch 2017 and efficacy.  It seems reasonable that CNS AEs may be a marker for higher drug concentrations 
in t
he brain. 
On 4 January 2017, an analysis of data from all 36 subjects enrolled in Part 1 with a median 
follow up of 9.2 months for surviving subjects was performed.  Interestingly, when a group of 6 
AEs re
lated to disturbances in the cerebellum (plus hallucinations), were combined (i.e. ataxia, 
dizziness, dysarthria, fall, gait disturbances and hallucinations) and related to efficacy 
parameters, an apparent difference was observed between the 23 subjects with any of these AEs 
of any grade during treatment as compared to the 13 subjects without occurrence of any of these 
AEs at an
y time; the median PFS was 5.5 months as compared to 2.8 months, and the median OS 
was 10.4 months as compared to 6.3 months respectively.  
When further analyzing this group of 6 AEs, it was the case that 19/23 (83%) of subjects 
experienced one of more of these AEs during Cycle 1 or Cycle 2, and 15/23 subjects (65%) 
experienced one or more of these AEs during the first cycle of MRZ + BEV treatment.  These 
AEs w
ere general ly reversible with treatment delay and/or dose reduction. 
This ana
lysis of a fairly mature dataset from all subjects included in Part 1 of this study 
generated the hypothesis that subjects with certain CNS events do better than those without, 
which suggests that those with the highest MRZ levels in the brain, as suggested by these AEs, 
do better than those without these events, which suggests lower brain levels of MRZ.  This 
portion of the
 study (Part 3) presented in Amendment 3 is designed to deliver to each subject a 
high dose
 of MRZ as long as they can tolerate it and to get point estimates for efficacy 
parameters including ORR, PFS, and OS.  For the same reason that the Part 2 Phase 2 was added 
to t
his study rather than as a separate protocol (namely, to keep the population homogenous), the 
results from subjects in this Part 3 can be compared to those in Part 1.

Protocol MRZ-108 Amendment 2 Summary Triphase R &D I Corp. 
Confidential and Proprietary 1 10 January 2016 AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
Protocol MRZ-108 Amendment 2 
1. AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND DESCRIPTION 
Amendment 2 was to amend the study to a Phase 1/2 study and add up to 30 response-evaluable 
patie
nts.  During the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study, responses to treatment were 
demonstra
ted.  These responses justify the expansion cohort within the Phase 1 portion of the 
study to obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate to the combination of MRZ and BEV.  
However, it will take a larger randomized study to determine if the combination of MRZ and 
BEV has greater activity than BEV alone.  Prior to undertaking such a trial, it would be 
important to determine if MRZ as a single agent has activity in relapsed or recurrent Grade 4 
malignant glioma (G4 MG).  A small Phase 2 study, at the dose and schedule of MRZ 
determined in Phase 1, is warranted to assess the activity of MRZ as a single agent.  The results 
of the Pha
se 2 will help determine if it is worthwhile developing MRZ as a single agent or in 
combination with BEV in relapsed or recurrent G4 MG. 
Because the dose level of 0.8 mg/m2 was tolerated in the Phase 1, dose escalation portion of the 
study whe
re MRZ was combined with BEV, it is expected that the single agent will also be 
tolerated at this dose.  Because this and other MRZ trials do not suggest renal damage as a direct 
result of MRZ, the IV hydration will be shortened to 250 mL infused over 30 minutes prior to 
MRZ dosing in the Phase 2 portion.  Renal function will continue to be monitored and, if 
necessary, hydration can be increased in specific patients at the discretion of the investigator. 
Revisions are shown in detail in the sections that follow.  Significant changes introduced with 
Amendment 2 are
 as follows: 
1. The titl
e was changed accordingly to include the Phase 2 portion of the trial: Phase 1,
Multicenter, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation, Combination Study of Marizomib and

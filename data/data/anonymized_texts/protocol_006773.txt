Study Overview – Reducing  Daily  Palliative IGRT  
1. Study objective  
a. To reduce preference sensitive, unnecessary daily imaging during palliative radiation 
treatment within 5 sites of Penn Radiation Oncology  using  a default prescription option  
2. Study arms  
a. The intervention will consist of a default prescription order set that does not include 
daily imaging for palliative cases. Preceding the intervention, there will be a 12 -month 
retrospective pre -intervention period that will establish baseline use of image  guidance  
during palliative radiation at Penn. Implementation  of the default will occur in an 
interrupted time series design with two comparison groups:  
i. Intervention arm  (Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine - PCAM ) 
1. 2/10/2017 -3/9/2017: 1 month roll out  
a. Intervention announced to entire group at faculty meeting and 
by email  
b. Individual meetings with intervention group attendings to 
assure awareness and use of default prescription order  
c. Educational meetings with therapists to introduce new default 
prescription  
2. 3/10/2017 -6/9/2017: 3 month intervention period  
a. Only the intervention arm  (PCAM)  has access to the default 
option and the usual practice group  (satellites)  does not 
undergo the i ntervention  
3. 6/10/2017 -10/10/2017: Crossover period  
a. Default intervention is introduced to usual care group. 
Intervention group continues to practice without any change.  
ii. Usual practice / control group (Pennsylvania Hospital, Chestnut Hill, 
Doylestown, Val ley Forge)  
1. 2/10/2017 -6/9/2017: Control period  
a. Usual practice group does not undergo intervention and serves 
as control to intervention group during this time  
2. 6/10/2017 -7/9/2017 : 1 month roll out  
a. Intervention announced to usual practice  group at faculty 
meeting and by email  
b. Individual meetings with usual care  group attendings to assure 
awareness and use of default prescription order  
c. Educational meetings with therapists to introduce new default 
prescription  
3. 7/10/2017 -10/10/2017: 3 month  intervention period  
3 
  a. Both arms undergo the intervention  
3. Default Intervention  
a. Default prescription order set that does not include daily imaging for palliative cases  
4. Outcome measures  
a. Primary  Outcome  
i. Change in daily IGRT use  from baseline pre-intervention period to intervention 
periods  with in the control and intervention arms  
1. Daily IGRT defined as at least 80% (i.e., 4 of 5 days, on average) of 
treated fract ions in a treatment course have image guidance  
ii. Change in daily IGRT use between co ntrol and intervention arms during first 
intervention period (3/10/17 -6/9/17)  
b. Secondary  Outcomes  
i. Rate of images  per total fractions (outcome as continuous variable)  
1. Change in rate  of images  per total fractions  taken pre and post 
intervention in each arm  
ii. Multivariate analysis for factors associated with reduction in daily IGRT  
1. Cohort (intervention vs. control arms)  
2. Age  
3. Sex 
4. Race  
5. ECOG  
6. Insurance type (Commercial, Medicare , Medicaid, Uninsured , 
Unknown ) 
7. Target  type  (Brain, bone, soft tissue,  multiple sites,  other)  
8. Prior radiation  (course 1 vs. not course 1)  
9. Total number  of fractions  per course  
10. Dose per fraction  
a. Charles will send us a distribution of this data and we will 
bucket it accordingly.  
11. Attending  
12. Time of day  
13. Location (PCAM vs. sate llite)  
c. Exploratory  Analyses  
i. Change in treatment time (in minutes)  
1. Change in total treatment time between pre - and post -intervention 
periods in each arm  
ii. Cost analysis  
1. Change in cost before and after intervention implemented in each arm  
a. Use CPT codes (charges) and Medicare standardized 
reimbursements to determine change in healthcare costs pre 
and post default intervention  
 
Analysis Plan  – Reducing  Daily  Palliative IGRT  Commented [SS1]: Insurance status is from the Epic output as 
follows: Unknown, Blue Shield, Commercial, Managed Care, 
Managed Medicaid, Managed Medicare, Medicaid, 
Medicare, Self pay.   These can probably be further 
consolidated - Perhaps: un known, self pay, (Blue 
shield+commercial+managed care), (Managed 
Medicaid+Medicaid), (Managed medicare+medicare).

  2. Change in rate of images per total fractions  between PCAM 
(intervention group) and satellites (cont rol group) during first 
intervention period (3/10/17 -6/9/17)  
c. Treatment time  
i. We have 3 times recorded for each patient at the level of each fraction  
1. Activity time  
a. This is the time until treatment start (while patient is being set 
up for treatment), and is the window during which IGRT would 
be acquired  
b. We will need to account for small percentage (~4%) of missing 
data in activity time  
2. Treatment start (won’t really use this)  
3. Treatment end  
ii. Create variable to calculate “total treatment time ” (treatment end – activity 
time start )  
1. Total treatment time = activity  (set up)  time + treatment time  
iii. Following comparis ons needed with 95% CI and p values:  
1. Change in activity time  between pre and post intervention periods  
a. Calculate this separately for PCAM vs. satellites  
i. PCAM: pre intervention (2/10/16 -2/9/17) vs. post 
intervention (3/10/17 -10/10/17)  
ii. Satellites: pre intervention (2/10/16 -2/9/17) vs. post 
intervention (7/10/17 -10/10/17)  
2. Change in activity time  between PCAM  (intervention group) and 
satellites (control group) during first intervention period (3/10/17 -
6/9/17)  
3. Change in total treatment time  between pre and post intervention 
periods  
a. Calculate this separately for PCAM vs. satellites  
i. PCAM: pre intervention (2/10 /16-2/9/17) vs. post 
intervention (3/10/17 -10/10/17)  
ii. Satellites: pre intervention (2/10/16 -2/9/17) vs. post 
intervention (7/10/17 -10/10/17)  
4. Change in total treatment time  between PCAM (intervention group) 
and satellites (control group) during first interv ention period (3/10/17 -
6/9/17)  
d. Cost analysis  
i. We will evaluate radiotherapy -related expenditures during the course of 
radiotherapy, calculated according to prior methods by summing the 
reimbursement of claims for radiotherapy simulation, planning, physics, 
delivery, and management (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 77261 
and 77999).[1] Because patients have a mix of commercial and government 
insurers, we will utilize the national Medicare base rate to normalize 
reimbursement for each CPT code, and i n secondary analyses will utilize actual 
6 
  claims paid reimbursements. We will compare adjusted mean expenditures 
between the intervention and usual groups using generalized linear models with 
gamma distribution and log -link function. We will estimate adjust ed mean 
differences by first exponentiating the model -based linear predictions for the 
average intervention and usual care groups separately and then calculating their 
arithmetic difference.

13. Location (PCAM vs. satellite)  
d. Assess missing data  
e. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses for covariates in relation to primary outcome (daily 
IGRT use)  
Methods:  
For the main analysis model, we used PROC GENMOD to fit models based on generalized estimating 
equations with a logit link and an independence correlation structure using the attending physician as 
the clustering unit with month and site as covariates.  In sensitivity analyses, the main model was 
estimated by also adjusting for patient characteristics i ncluding age, sex, race,...,...,,etc.   
To obtain the adjusted difference in the percentage of patients receiving daily IGRT imaging  between 
intervention and non -intervention groups and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), we used the bootstrap 
method,  resamplin g patients 1000 times. Resampling of patients was  by physician  to maintain clustering 
at the physician level. All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9. 4. 
 
 
 Commented [SS7]: CR: Note: It's possible we might use a  
different correlation structure.  We can modify what goes in 
the list of the covariates for the sensitivity model.

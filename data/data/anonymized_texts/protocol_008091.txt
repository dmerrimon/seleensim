Title of Study
Interventional, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active reference (fluoxetine), fixed -dose study of 
vortioxetine in paediatric pati ents aged 12 to 17 years, with Major depressive disorder (MDD)
Study Sites and N umber of Patients Planned
Approximately 100 sites are planned in approximately 15 countries worldw ide (specialists, mainly outpatient 
clinics) with patients from the Europe an Union ,Europe outside the European Union , North America, and other 
geographical regions.
Approximately 750 patients are planned for enrolment to the 4 -week treatment with standardised brief 
psychosocial intervention (BPI) and placebo period (Phase A). At t he end of Phase A a total of 600 patients 
(depending on the blinded sample size reassessment, section 18.11 )with incomplete improvement are to be 
randomised to the 8 week double- blind Phase B in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, 
fluoxetine 20 mg , or placebo.

Page 3of 86Study Methodology
This is an interventional, multi -national, multi -site, randomised, tw o phase, single -and double- blind, parallel -
group, placebo -controlled, active -reference (fluoxetine), fixed -dose study.
The screening period will be 5 to 15 days followed by a 4 -week single -blind period (Phase A) of treatment 
with standardised brief psychosocial intervention and single -blind (patients and parents) placebo. Patients 
who demonstrate an incomplete improvement of depressive symptoms at the end of Week 4 w ill be 
randomised to a double- blind, 8 -week treatment period (Phase B) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio t o vortioxetine 10 mg/day, 
vortioxetine 20 mg/day, fluoxetine 20 mg/day, or placebo. Patients and parents are blinded to the time point of 
randomisation to Phase B.
There w ill be 2 baselines in this study: Baseline A (Week 0) of the 4 week single -blind Phas e A and Baseline 
B (w eek 4) of the 8 week double -blind Phase B.  
Incomplete improvement in depressive symptoms is defined as patients demon strating a <40% reduction from 
Baseline A on the Children depression rating scale revised version (CDRS -R), and with a (CDRS -R) ≥40 total  
score and confirmed by a Parent Global Assessment –Global Improvement (PGA) value of >2.
A total of 600 patients (depending on the blinded sample size reassessment, see section 18.11 ) areplanned to 
be randomised to Phase B. Randomisation will be done blinded at the end of Phase A (Week 4) using an 
Interactive Voice/Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS).
Patients participating in Phase B will be asked to come back to the study site for a safety follow  up 4 w eeks 
after early withdrawal or completion. This procedure w ill not apply for patients entering in an extension 
study. 
Patients randomi sed to the 10 mg/day vortioxetine group will receive a low er initial dose (5 mg/day for 2 
days) prior to rec eiving 10 mg/day. Patients randomi sed to the 20 mg/day vortioxetine group will receive a 
lower initial dose (5 mg/day for 2 days followed by 10 mg/day for 2 days and 15 mg/day for 2 days) prior to 
receiv ing 20 mg/day. Patients randomis ed to the fluoxetine 20 mg/day group will receive a low er initial dose 
(10 mg/day for 6 days) prior to receiving 20 mg/day.
Based on tolerability the dose may be reduced at Week 8 (Visit 10 = Week 4 of Phase B). For patients 
randomised to vortioxetine the reduction will be by5 mg/day and for fluoxetine 10 mg/day. No dose increase 
will be allow ed.
Patients who do not fulfil the criteria of incomplete improvement in Phase A at Week 3 w ill be w ithdrawn 
from the study before Week 4 . Patients who do not fulfil the criteria of incom plete improvement at week 4 
will be w ithdrawn from the study and not participate in the double -blind Phase B of the study. No specific 
study related follow -up is required for these patients. How ever as rescue procedure, they may receive up to 4 
outpatient visits to the study site for consultations over a tw o-month period. 
Patients will receive 5 sessions of standardised brief psychosocial intervention at Week 1,2,3,5 and 8. 
Supportive psycho -educative material will be handed out topatients and families at the Screening Visit.
The study design is presented in Panel 1and the scheduled assessments are summarised in Panel 2.
Efficacy and safety measures will be assessed at re levant time points during the study summarised in Panel 2.
Target Patient Population
The patient has Major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed according to DSM -5™.
The patient has a CDRS -R total score ≥45 at the Screening Visit and the Baseline A Visit (Week 0).
The patient has a Clinical Global Impression –Severity of Illness (CGI -S) score ≥4 at the Screening Visit and

Page 6of 86Statistical Methodology
The follow ing analysis sets will be used to analyse and present the data:
all-patients -enrolled (APES) –all patients enrolled to the 4 -week single -blind period (Phase A) who 
received at least one dose of IMP 
all-patients -randomised  Phase B (APRS) –all patients randomised to the double -blind, 8 -week treatment 
period (Phase B)  
all-patients -treated  set Phase B (APTS) – all patients randomised to the double -blind, 8 -week treatment 
period (Phase B) who took at least one dose of double -blind IMP 
full-analysis set Phase B (FAS) –all patients in the APTS who had a valid Baseline B assessmen t and at 
least one valid post -Baseline B assessment of the CDRS -R total score.
The efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS 
Primary analysis:
For the primary endpoint (change from Baseline B in the CDRS -R total score to Week 8 in phase B (Week 
12)), com parisons of the pooled doses of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg/day versus placebo w ill be made using 
Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) with freely varying mean and covariance structure and 
with country as a fixed factor and Baseline B CDRS -R score as a covariate interacting with visit. Treatment 
(vortioxetine 10 mg/day, vortioxetine 20 mg/day, fluoxetine, and placebo) is included as a fixed factor 
interacting with visit. For the primary endpoint a contrast test with weights 0.5, 0.5, 0, and -1, respectively , 
to estimate the average effect of the pooled doses of vortioxetine against placebo, based on the LSMeans for 
the treatment by visit interaction at Week 8 in phase B (Week 12). This will be evaluated at a tw o-sided 5% 
significance level. Subsequently ea ch vortioxetine dose will be tested separately against placebo using a 
two-sided 5% significance level. To adjust for multiplicity a closed testing strategy is applied w here 
statistical significance can be claimed on the individual doses only if significan ce is claimed for the pooled 
vortioxetine doses .1
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint: 
The primary endpoint will also be analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA ,OC and last 
observation carried forw ard [LOCF]) as sensitivity analysis. Th e Missing at Random assumption behind the 
MMRM model will be investigated.
Analyses of other efficacy endpoints:
For continuous endpoints, the same methodology as the primary analysis described for the primary endpoint 
will be used. In addition ANCOVA will be performed (OC and LOCF).
For dichotomous endpoints, such as response and remission, logistic regression with treatment as a factor 
and the baseline score as a covariate w ill be used. This will be done based on OC, LOCF and NRI.
The potential treatment effect on cognitive dysfunction will be separated into a direct effect and an indirect 
effect that is mediated through an improvement in depression. These effects will be estimated using two 
ANCOVA models. In the first model the change from baseline in SD MT (number of correct digits) is the 
dependent variable, while change from baseline CDRS -R total score is included as a covariate and treatment 
as a factor. This model gives an estimate of the direct effect. In the second ANCOVA model change from 
baseline CDRS -R total score is the dependent variable while treatment is a factor. Combining the estimated 
treatment effect in this model with the relation between CDRS -R and SDMT in the first model gives an 
estimate of the indirect effect. Finally, the estimated d irect and indirect effects will be expressed as 
proportions of the total effect. The analyses are performed using change from Baseline B after 4 Weeks of 
treatment and after 8 w eeks of treatment as endpoint, respectively. Also, both OC and LOCF are 
conside red.
The safety analyses will be based on the APES and the APTS.

No interim analyses for efficacy are planned. A DMC will monitor safety data at regular intervals to be 
specified in the Data Monitoring Committee Charter. To ensure that the study is sufficiently pow ered an 
estimate of the variability of the primary endpoint and the withdrawal rate will be obtained. The analysis will 
be performed after at least 75% of the initially planned randomised patients have either com pleted or 
withdrawn from the study and w ill be based on blinded and pooled data from all groups. Based on these 
estimates the pow er calculation will be updated and adequate actions will be taken if the study has lost power.
Since all analyses are done with blinded data, there is no inflation of the Type 1 error rate and no alpha 
adjustment is necessary.
Patient disposition and demographics will be summarise d using descriptive statistics.
Phar macokinetic Analysis
Sparse PK samples (2) w ill be collected to m easure vortioxetine and fluoxetine plasma concentration; however 
the population PK analysis will only be conducted for vortioxetine . Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine will be 
listed. The population PK of vortioxetine will be assessed by means of nonlinea r mixed effect modelling and 
the results from the analysis will be reported in a separate population PK report.
Sample Size Considerations
Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 11 on the treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint and a 
withdrawal rate of 15 -20%, then randomising 120 patients per group and applying a closed testing procedure to 
keep the overall significance level at 5% will provide a power of at least 85% for claiming significance of the 
pooled vortioxetine doses if both doses have an e ffect of 4 points at Week 8 in Phase B (Week 12).
The blinded sample size reassessment will ensure that the pow er of at least 85% is maintained in the study.

Page 8of 86Ethical Rationale for Study and Study Design
In May 2014, WHO's Health for the w orld’s adolescent s report reveals that depression is the predominant cause 
of illness and disability for both boys and girls aged 10 to 19 years and adds that the top 3 causes of adolescent 
deaths globally are road traffic injuries, HIV/AIDS, and suicide. Worldwide, an est imated 1.3 million 
adolescents died in 2012. The prevalence of Major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated to be approximately 
2% in children and 4% to 8% in adolescents. 
As outlined in the EMA Assessment of the Paediatric Needs in psychiatry there is a therapeutic need in the 
paediatric population of depressed patients. Only one antidepressant, fluoxetine, is currently approved in 
Europe for the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents. In the US only fluoxetine is approved for 
children and fluoxetin e and escitalopram for the adolescent population. Development of a new antidepressant 
will increase and strengthen the pharmacological treatment options for this patient population. This study is part 
of the agreed EMA Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for vortioxetine and the US Pediatric Research Equity 
Act(PREA) with the purpose to investigate the anti -depressive effect of vortioxetine in MDD patients aged 12 
to 17 years. It is the expectation that the investigation plan will provide positive effica cy data, w ith a favourable 
safety and tolerability profile, and therefore demonstrate a positive benefit -risk ratio for the use of vortioxetine 
in the paediatric population.
Vortioxetine is approved in the US, EU and a number of other countries for the tre atment of MDD in the adult 
population. The evaluation of the safety and tolerability of vortioxetine is based on data from a large clinical 
development programme in adult and elderly patients. In the overall clinical development programme treatment 
with vo rtioxetine at the therapeutic doses (5 -20 mg/day) was safe and well tolerated. The approved 
recommended dose range of 5 -20 m g/day  for adults was evaluated in a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study 
performed in the paediatric population (aged 12 to 17 years) designed to guide the choice of doses to be used in 
the planned paediatric investigation plan. Hence the chosen doses of vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg/day) for this 
study is based on the results from the paediatric pharmacokinetic and tolerability study a nd the knowledge from 
the adult studies. As the sole antidepressant approved both in children and adolescents for MDD in EU and US, 
fluoxetine has been selected as comparator, to provide evidence of assay sensitivity.
The presence of a high placebo respon se rate is known to be a confounding factor in antidepressant studies, 
particularly in those enrolling children and adolescents. The recent studies of duloxetine in the treatment of 
paediatric patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) were failed as ne ither duloxetine nor the active 
control (fluoxetine, with known efficacy in children and adolescents with MDD), were statistically significantly 
different from placebo on the primary outcome measure.  
The present study is designed with the aim to low er the placebo response and includes a single -blind phase 
(Phase A) where patients who respond to standardised brief psychosocial intervention will not be eligible for 
entering the double -blind IMP treatment p hase (Phase B). Furthermore patients and parents are blinded to the 
time point of randomisation to the double -blind phase in order to low er expectations. This study will permit the 
investigation of the efficacy and safety of a new potential treatment of MDD in paediatric patients and the 
inclusion of a plac ebo group has major scientific importance in this evaluation to ensure adequate evaluation of 
efficacy as well as distinguishing disease manifestations from adverse reactions of the compound. The choice of 
the double -blind 8 w eek study duration is based on previous experience with positive studies and European 
guidelines.

Page 9of 86The patients will be asked to attend the investigational clinic at regular intervals to ensure an adequate follow -
up. All visits will be performed on an outpatient basis at the clinic oth er than the follow -up visit that can be a 
phone call. In order to minimize potential pain, distress, and fear, patients will be seen in facilities which will be 
appropriate for childcare. T he study personnel who interact with study participants will be exp erienced health 
care professionals (physicians with paediatric qualification, qualified paediatric nurses or psychologists) and 
their education, training and experience will be documented. Age -appropriate explanations w ill be given to the 
child prior to an y investigation or procedure, in order to decrease anxiety and anticipation of pain. P otentially 
painful procedures such as venipuncture will be minimized with the use of topical anaesthesia. Blood sampling 
will be limited to the minimum required for obtai ning valid data for evaluation. The number of blood samples 
and visits has been carefully evaluated against the value for the overall objectives of the study.
The investigator plays an important role in protecting the safety of the patient. The assessment of potential 
burden and risk is defined specifically in the clinical study protocol (safety rating scales, recording of adverse 
events, clinical safety laboratory tests (blood biochemistry, haematology and urine analysis), vital signs (blood 
pressure andpulse rate,), w eight, electrocardiogram and physical examination) and these will be evaluated by 
the investigator at each visit to ensure patient’s safety and wellbeing. If it does not remain in the patient’s best 
interest to stay in the study the investiga tor will ensure that the patient is excluded. If the patient is not 
completing the study, a treatment will be offered to the patient at the discretion of the investigator in line with 
clinical practice. 
In accordance w ith Good Clinical Practice , qualified medical personnel at H. Lundbeck A/S will be readily 
available to advice on study -related medical questions. Medical monitoring and safety surveillance will be 
performed throughout the study, according to Lundbeck standard procedures and H. Lundbeck A/S w ill 
regularly monitor and re -examine the balance of risk and benefit of the full clinical study so that the health and 
well-being of paediatric patients enrolled will be safeguarded. 
The selection criteria exclude the participation of patients at signific ant risk of suicide, and patients becoming at 
significant suicidal risk during the study will be w ithdrawn. Throughout the study, potential suicidal risk will be 
assessed both by rating scale (The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and/or by the inves tigator’s 
judgement. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be established in order to review  the safety and tolerability 
data throughout the study. The sam e DMC will cover all the clinical studies in the paediatric vortioxetine 
program.

a. This visit should take place as soon as possible after the patient withdraws from the study . Any visit during 
Phase A, can be converted in to a w ithdrawal visit on the day of the visit. The BPI is optional if a visit 
during Phase A is converted into a w ithdrawal visit.
b. This can be a telephone contact, unless an SAE has occurred since the last visit or there was a clinically 
significant abnormal safety laboratory test value at the last visit. In such cases, safety follow -up(s) must be 
scheduled to allow  for a medical examination and/or blood sampling. Further safety follow -up visits 
beyond 30 days may be needed as judged by the investigator (if further safety follow -up visits are 
performed, these must be recorded in the patient ’s medical record, and not in the eCRF). All enrolled 
patients shoul d have a safety follow -up visit unless they continue into the extension study.
c. If the date of a patient visit does not conform to the study plan, subsequent visits should be planned to 
maintain the visit schedule relative to randomisation/baseline s. 
d. The Kiddie- Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School -aged Children, Present and 
Lifetime version (K -SADS -PL) will be used to confirmed diagnosis of Major depressive disorder (MDD) 
and to assess possible psychiatric co -morbidities.
e. Must be a blood pregnancy test and s hould be performed at the S creening Visit and if the patient has 
completed or withdrawn in Phase B according to local requirements for extra pregnancy tests durin g the 
study.
f. Should only be performed if the patient has completed or withdrawn in Phase B .
g. A urine drug screen and a alcohol test are required at the designated time. At any time during the study at 
the discretion of the investigator a drug and/or alcohol screening can be conducted.
h. The PGA assessment should be in reference to Baseline A. 
i. One familiarity session for SDMT must be performed at the Screening Visit. This should be documented in 
the medical records. No data are to be entered in the eCRF.
j. Sampl es will be collected at the designated time points. Any results of the Translational Medicine 
Assessments will not be available at the time of reporting and w ill consequently not be part of the actual 
report of the study.       
k. Pre-treatment adverse event s (before IMP intake i.e. before Baseline B) must be recorded on the Adverse 
Event Form in the eCRF. Adverse events from open questioning in addition to all spontaneously reported 
adverse events must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF. If th e adverse event is an SAE, 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form must also be completed. For practical reasons, questioning for 
adverse events could follow  vital sign assessments. In addition, the tolerability will also be assessed using

1.1 Background
1.1.1 Overview
Mood disorders in children and adolescents are among the most debilitating il lnesses, exerting 
a major impact on family and social functioning, school performance and an increased risk of 
recurrence, substance abuse, psy chiatric comorbidity  and suicidalit y.2,3,4,5In May  2014, 
WHO's Health for the world’s adolescent s6report reveal s that depression is the predominant 
cause of illness and disability  for both boy s and girls aged 10 to 19 y ears and adds that the top 
3 causes of adolescent deaths globally are road traffic injuries, HIV/AI DS, and suicide. 
Worl dwide, an estimated 1.3 mill ion adolescents died in 2012. The prevalence of Major 
depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated to be approximately  2% in child ren and 4 to 8% in 
adolescents .4,5,7,8
Only one antidepressant, fluoxetine, is currently  approved in Europe for the treatment of 
MDD in children and adolescents. In the US onl y fluoxetine is approved for children and 
fluoxetine and escitalopram for the adolescent population. Development of a new
antidepressant will increase and strengthen the pharmacological treatment options for this 
patient population.
Signs and s ymptoms of MDD are similar to the adult population ,but depressive disorders 
meeting the diagnostic criteria rarely is present before the age of seven years.9,10The clinical 
picture may  differ according to age at presentation. Children may  have mood liability , 
irritability , low frustration tolerance, somatic complaints, and/or social withdrawal i nstead of 
verbali sing feelings of depress ion,whilst adolescents are more likel y than children to 
complain of feelings of hopelessness/helplessness, lack of energy  and to have a higher rate of 
suicidal thoughts.11,12For this reason separate studies are to be conducted in children and 
adolescents.10
The aim of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  of vortioxetine 10 mg/day  and 20 mg/day  
versus placebo after 8 weeks of treatment on depressive sy mptoms in children aged 12 to 17
years with a DSM- 5™ diagnos is of MDD.
The following sections provide an overview of the nonclinical and clinical data currentl y 
available for vortioxetine. For further information please refer to the current version of the 
Investigator’s Brochure .13
For information on the reference compound fluoxetine please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC)/Prescribing Information.

Page 25of 861.1.2 Nonclinical Data
The mechanism of action of vortioxetine is thought to be related to its direct modulation of 
serotonergic receptor activity  and inhibition of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT). 
Nonclinical data indicate that vortioxetine is a 5- HT3, 5- HT7, and 5 -HT1D receptor 
antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5- HT1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 
SERT, leading to modulation of ne urotransmission in several s ystems. This multimodal 
activity  is considered to be responsible for the antidepressant and anxioly tic-like effects and 
the improvement of cognitive function, learning and memory  observed with vortioxetine in 
animal studies.14
Average exposures to vortioxetine and metabolites at the relevant human therapeutic doses 
are below the toxicity  levels (NOAEL) determined in animals. In support of the paediatric
program, 3 juvenile toxicity  studies were completed. These studies concluded that no new or 
critical vortioxetine treatment-related findings were seen in juvenile rats compared to the 
repeat -dose toxicity  and reproductive studies in adult rats.
1.1.3 Clinical Data
1.1.3.1 Pharmacokinetics
In adults, vortioxetine has shown to be a compound with sl ow absorption, large volume of 
distribution and medium clearance. Vortioxetine is slowly , but well absorbed after oral 
administration and the peak plasma concentration is reached within 7 to 11 hours. Following 
multiple dosing of 5, 10, or 20 mg/day , mean Cmaxvalues of 9 to 33 ng/mL  were observed. 
The absolute bioavailability  is 75%. No effect of food on the pharmacokinetics was observed. 
The mean volume of distribution (V ss) is 2,600 L , indicating extensive extravascular 
distribution. Vortioxetine is high ly bound to plasma proteins (98 to 99%) and the binding 
appears to be independent of vortioxetine plasma concentrations. Vortioxetine is extensively  
metabolised in the liver, primarily  through oxidation catal ysed by CYP2D6 and to a minor 
extent CYP3A4/5 an d CYP2C9, and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. No inhibitory  or 
inducing effect of vortioxetine was observed in the drug -drug interaction studies for the CYP 
isozy mes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, 
or CYP3A4/5. Vort ioxetine is a poor P -gp substrate and inhibitor. The major metabolite 
(Lu AA34443) of vortioxetine is pharmacologically  inactive. The mean elimination half -life 
and oral clearance are 66 hours and 33 L/h, respectively . The pharmacokinetics islinear and 
time independent in the dose range studied (2.5 to 60 mg/day ).13
In stud y 12708A, entitled An open- label study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and 
tolerability of Lu AA21004 in connection with multiple oral dosi ng of Lu AA21004 in child 
and adolescent patients with a DSM- IV-TRTMdiagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder , the 
pharmacokinetic properties of vortioxetine in the children and adolescent population after 
14 day s of dosing with 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg wer e investigated. Data showed that t he exposures 
to vortioxetine and its metabolite L u AA34443, in terms of C maxand AUC, increased in a 
dose-proportional manner and were generally  lower in the adolescent patients than in the 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 26of 86children, but data suggests that the doses tested (5 to 20mg/day  vortioxetine) and the up-
titration scheme emplo yed in this study  are appropriate for the paediatric population. 
1.1.3.2 Efficacy
Vortioxetine has been approved in the US, EU and a number of other countries for the 
treatment of MDD in the adult population. Broad efficacy  on depressive s ymptoms has been 
proven in an extensive clinical development program. Vortioxetine was efficacious, safe, and 
well tolerated in adults and in the elderl y with MDD in short -term treatment and long -term
maintenance. This also includes proven effect of vortioxetine on cognitive dy sfunction in 
adult patients with MDD, assessed using a range of objective neurops ychological tests.
To date, the efficacy  of vortioxetine has not y et been investigated in childre n with MDD.
1.1.3.3 Safety
The evaluation of the safety  and tolerabilit y of vortioxetine is based on data from a large 
clinical development programme. In the completed P hase II to IV short -and long -term studies
in adults , more than 8000 patients with M DD or Gener alized Anxiety  Disorder (GAD)
received vortioxetine at doses of 1 to 20 mg/day , corresponding to an overall exposure >3200 
patient -years. Overall short -and long -term treatment with vortioxetine at the therapeutic 
doses (5- 20 mg/day ) was safe and well tole rated in adults and in the elderly . The incidence of 
nausea, the most common adverse event (AE), showed a trend towards a dose- response 
relationship. For vortioxetine, at the therapeutic doses, the incidences of adverse events such 
as insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, and h yperhidrosis, were at placebo level, as was the 
incidence of sexual dysfunction. The changes in body  weight, vital signs, ECGs (including the 
QTc interval), and clinical safet y laboratory  tests (including liver and renal tests) were at 
place bo level for all therapeutic doses of vortioxetine. Abrupt discontinuation of vortioxetine 
after short, as well as after long- term treatment was well tolerated. Based on an 8 -week 
vortioxetine study , the direct switch from ≥6 -week treatment with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor/serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI /SNRI) to vortioxetine was well 
tolerated.
The tolerability  of vortioxetine in multiple oral doses of 5 to 20 mg/day  was also evaluated in 
an open label stud y among children and adolescent patients (aged 7 to 17 y ears) with a 
DSM -IV-TR™ diagnosis of depressive or anxiety  disorder . The purpose of this uncontrolled, 
open -label stud y was to assess the safet y, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in 
children and adolescents with depressive or anxiety  disorder and to provide supportive 
information for its dose regimen in paediatric efficacy  and safety  studies. In total 24 children 
and 24 adolescents received vortioxetine. Based on the data f romthis study, no concerns were 
raised on the safet y and tolerability profile of vortioxetine among paediatric patients with 
depression or anxiety . Vortioxetine was safe and well tolerated following 14 day s of dosing as 
well as during an initial up -titration period. Overall, the adverse event profile in adolescents 
and children appeared similar to that of the adult population. Nausea and headache were the 
TEAEs with the overall highest incidence in this study ,  reported in 11 (N ausea ) and 12 
(headache ) patients. Nausea is also the most common TEAE in studies with adult patients, 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 27of 86with an incidence of approximately  20 to 30% following 5 to 20 mg vortioxetine. Other 
common TEAEs were sedation, abdominal pain upper, fatigue, and vomi ting. There was no 
apparent relationship between dose and the incidence of these adverse events. 
1.2 Rationale for the Study
Mood disorders in children and adolescents are among the most debilitating illnesses, exerting 
a major impact on family and social fun ctioning, school performance and an increased risk of 
recurrence, substance abuse, psy chiatric comorbidity  and suicidalit y.2,3,4,5
As outlined in the EMA Assessment of the Paediatric Needs in psychiatry there is a 
therapeutic need in the paediatric population of depressed patients.15Although several acute 
treatment studies of antidepressants have been completed in the MDD patient population, 
only two antidepressants have shown replicate efficacy  in two or more trials, and have 
received regulatory  approval for the treatment of MDD in paediatric patients .Fluoxetine in 
the treatm ent of children and adolescents with MDD,16,17and escitalopram in the treatment of 
adolescents with MDD.18,19
Specific studies are necessary  in the paediatric population and s eparate studies should 
generally  be conducted in children and adolescents.20This study  is part of the agreed EMA 
Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for vortioxetine and the US Paediatric Research Equity 
Act (PREA) with the purpose to investigate the antidepressive effect of vortioxetine in MDD 
patients aged 12to 17years. It is the ex pectation that the investigation plan will provide 
positive efficacy  data, with a favourable safet y and tolerability profile, and therefore 
demonstrate a positive benefit -risk ratio for the use of vortioxetine in the paediatric 
population.

3Study Design
3.1 Overview of the Study Design
This study  has been designed in accordance with theDeclaration of Helsinki.21
This is an interventional, multi- national, multi -site, randomised, t wo-phase, single -and 
double -blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, active reference (fluoxetine), fixed -dose 
study .
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ,22and 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
An over view of the study is presented in Panel 1
The study  will consist of a screening period of 5- 15 day s and will consist of two phases
(Phase A and Phase B) after this screening period.
Phase A is a single blind 4- week s period where patients ( andparents )are blinded and receive 
placebo + Brief Psy chosocial Intervention (BPI). If not responding to BPI/placebo then 
patients are randomised into Phase B .
Phase B is a double -blind 8-weeks period where patients and investigators are blinded. In this 
phase all patients continue to receive BPI and in addition either placebo, vortioxetine 10 mg, 
vortioxetine 20 mg, or fluoxetine 20 mg.
The patient is a boy oragirl, aged ≥12and ≤17at Screening Visit with a diagnosis of MDD
according to DSM- 5TM Criteria and a CDRS -R score ≥45 and a CGI -S score ≥4 at the 
Screening Visit and the Baseline A Visit (Week 0).
Approximately  750 patients are planned for enrolment to the 4 -week treatment with 
standardised brief psychosocial intervention and single -blind placebo period (Phase A). At the 
end of Phase A (Baseline B) a total of 600 patients (depending on the blinded sample size 
reassessment, see section 18.11 )with incomplete improvement are to be randomised to the 8 
week double -blind Phase B in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to vortioxet ine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, 
fluoxetine 20 mg, or placebo. Incomplete improvement in depressive s ymptoms isdefined as 
a <40% reduction from B aseline A on the Children depression rating scale revised version 
(CDRS -R), and with a (CDRS -R) ≥40 total score and confirmed b y a Parent Global 
Assessment - Global Improvement (PGA) value of >2.

Page 29of 86Patients who do not fulfil the criteria of incomplete improvement in Phase A at Week 3 will 
be withdrawn from the study  before Week 4 . Patients who do not fulfil the criteria of 
incomplete improvement at week 4 will be withdrawn from the stud y and not participate in 
the double- blind Phase B of the study . No specific study  related follow- up is required for 
these patients. However as rescue procedure, they may  receive up to 4 outpatient visits to the 
study  site for consultations over a two -month period. 
Patients will receive 5 sessio ns of standardised brief psychosocial intervention at We ek 
1,2,3,5 and 8.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be established in order to review the safet y 
and tolerability  data throughout the study .
An internal safet y committee at H. Lundbeck A /S has been set up for vortioxetine, who will 
perform regular evaluations of blinded safet y data.
3.2 Rationale for the Study Design
The proposed Stud y 12710A is a randomised, two-phase single -and double -blind, fixed -dose 
study  with the primary  objective to evaluate the efficacy  of vortioxetine 10 mg/day  and 20 
mg/day  versus placebo after 8 weeks of treatment on depressive s ymptoms in adolescents
with a DSM- 5™ diagnosis of MDD. Secondary  objectives are to evaluate the efficacy  of 
vortioxetine 10 mg/day  and 20 mg/day  versus placebo during the 8 weeks of treatment on 
global clinical impression, functionality , health -related quality  of life and to confirm the 
population pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine in paediatric patients, aged 12to 17years. In 
addition the e fficacy  of vortioxetine 10 mg/day  and 20 mg/day  versus placebo on co -morbid 
symptoms will be explored.
In the overall adult clinical development programme treatment with vortioxetine at the 
therapeutic doses (5 -20 mg/day ) was safe and well tolerated. It has been suggested that a 
failure to conduct and use information from appropriatel y designed preliminary 
pharmacokinetic and dose -finding studies has contributed to the failure of several large scale 
antidepressant studies in the paediatric MDD population.23The chosen doses of vortioxetine 
(10 and 20 mg/day ) for this study  is based on the knowledge from the clinical development 
programme in adult patients and from the paediatric pharmacokinetic and tolerability  study  
performed in the paediatric population (ag ed 12 to 17years) designed to guide the choice of 
doses to be used in the planned paediatric investigation plan.
The presence of a high placebo response rate is known to be a confounding factor in 
antidepressant studies, particularl y in those enrolling ch ildren and adolescents. The recent 
studies of duloxetine in the treatment of paediatric patients with Major depressive disorder
(MDD) were failed as neither duloxetine nor the active control (fluoxetine, with known 
efficacy  in children and adolescents with MDD), were statisticall y significantly  different from 
placebo on the primary  outcome measure.24,25
The present study  is designed with the aim to lower the placebo response and includes a 
single -blind phase (Phase A) where patients who respond to standardised brief psychosocial 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 30of 86intervention and/or placebo will not be eligible for entering the double -blind I MP treatment 
Phase (Phase B). Furthermore patients and parents are blinded to the time point of 
randomisation to the double- blind phase in order to lower e xpectations. 
The choice of the double -blind 8 week stud y duration is based on previous experience with 
positive studies and European guidelines.20The 4 -week single -blind period (Phase A) of 
treatment with sta ndardised brief psychosocial intervention and single -blind (patients and 
parents) placebo run -in phase is in alignment with the new Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of depression20and consistent with the NICE treatment 
guideline .26Studies should include only  patients with insufficient response to psy chotherap y 
and all subjects should receive ps ychosocial interventions throughout the trials.20For this 
reason patients who respond to placebo and or standardi sed brief psychosocial intervention 
received during the 4 -week single blind period will not be included in the 8 week double blind 
treatment period. 
To standardise the ps ychosocial intervention, a brief ps ycho social intervention program (BPI) 
is developed for this study  The BPI arises from the Specialist Clinical Care (SCC) programme 
and has its origins in the work of the ADAPT27RCT team in order to implement high qualit y 
psychoso cial intervention in the study .It is a pragmatic sy nthesis of clinical practice that 
results in good qualit y specialised ps ychosocial care for depressed children and adolescents .
A detailed description of key  elements of comprehensive BPI case mana gement is provided in 
a manual that will be delivered to the site. 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the CDRS -R total score , The CDRS -Ris the most 
widely  used rating scale in clinical trials for assessing severity  of depression and change in 
depressive s ymptoms in children and adolescents with depression. The CDRS -R is based on 
the adult Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The Psy chometric anal yses provide evidence 
that the CDRS -R is a valid measure of severity  and improvement of depressive sy mptoms in 
paediatric patients. A score of ≥40 is indicative of depression, whereas a score ≤28 is often 
used to define remission (minimal or no sy mptoms).
The Parent Global Assessment - Global Improvement (PGA) is used as a secondary  efficacy  
measure of the antidepressant eff ectsymptoms and to confirm incomplete improvement in 
depressive s ymptoms. The PGA has been used receptively  and successfully in studies in 
ADHD. The General Behavior Inventory  10-Item Depression Scale28will also be used to 
assess depressive sy mptoms. The GBI 10-item version has been shown to discriminate 
between diagnostic groups using youth self -report.28, 29The CGI -S and CGI -I are used for 
assessing disorder severity  and improvement.30
The Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and the PedsQL Present Functioning Visual 
Analogue Scales (PedsQL™ VAS) will be used to assess functionalit yand the Paediatric 
Quality of Life Enjoy ment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ -LES-Q)31will be used to 
assess health- related quality  of life . Children and adolescents with MDD are at high risk of 
having severe difficulties in various domains of functioning and in qualit y of life .2,32
Both the CGAS , PedsQL™ VAS and PQ- LES-Q are val idated scales appropriate for use in 
children and adolescents with psy chiatric disorde rs.32,33

Page 31of 86Cognitive d ysfunction is well recognised in Adult MDD but available neuropsy chological 
data on the cognitive perform ance of children and adolescents with MDD yields mixed 
results,34and it is not known if parameters like age, depression severity  or an antidepressant 
treatment are correlated to the cognitive impairments of children and adolescents with MDD. 
The Sy mbol Di git Modalities Test (SDMT),35is an objective measure of cognitive 
dysfunction that integrates elements of attention, speed of processing and executive function 
including working memory . The SDMT was developed to identify  individuals with 
neurological impai rment and measures the time to pair abstract sy mbols with specific 
numbers. It is an inverse form of the Digit Sy mbol Substitution Test (DSST)36prompting for 
numbers instead of s ymbols. The SDMT has a high sensitivity  to cognitive impairment in 
neurops ychiatric disorders, is sensitive to change, there are p aediatric norms and it has been 
used in the p aediatric population.37,38In addition the SDM Tcorrelates well with the DSST 
(0.80 for normal subjects) which has shown sensitivity to treatment induced change of 
cognitive function in the adult population of patients with MDD.
4Ethics
4.1 Ethical Rationale
Patients will be fully  informed about the study  including the risks and benefits of his or her 
participation. The patient may  withdraw from the study  at an y time, for any reason. 
Unscheduled visits can be made and immediate withdrawal is possible. Throughout the study , 
signs of suicidal risk will be assessed and patients at risk will be withdrawn.
The risks associated with the study  are considered, well controlled by cautionary  measures in 
the study  design, and well balanced with the potential benefits of the treatment. Vortioxetine 
is approved in the US, EU and a number of other countries for the treatment of MDD in the 
adult population. The evaluation of the safet y and tolerability  of vortioxetine is based on data 
from a large clinical development programme in adult and elderl y patients. In the overall 
clinical development programme treatment with vortioxetine at the therapeutic doses 
(5-20mg/day ) was safe and wel l tolerated. The approved recommended dose range of 
5-20mg/day  for adults was evaluated in a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study  performed 
in the paediatric population (aged 12to 17years) designed to guide the choice of doses to be 
used in the planne d paediatric investigation plan. Hence the chosen doses of vortioxetine (10 
and 20 mg/day ) for this study  is based on the results from the paediatric pharmacokinetic and 
tolerability  study  and the knowledge from the adult studies. As the sole antidepressant 
approved both in children and adolescents for MDD in EU and US, fluoxetine has been 
selected as comparator, to provide evidence of assay  sensitivity .
This study  will permit the investigation of the efficacy  and safety  of a new potential treatment 
of MDD in paediatric patients and the inclusion of a placebo group has major scientific 
importance in this evaluation to ensure adequate evaluation of efficacy  as well as 
distinguishing disease manifestations from adverse reactions of the compound. The patients 
will be asked to attend the investigational clinic at regular intervals to ensure an adequate 
H.Lundbeck A/S

Page 32of 86follow -up. All visits will be performed on an outpatient basis at the clinic ,other than the 
follow -up visit that can be a phone call. In order to minimize potenti al pain, distress, and fear, 
patients will be seen in facilities which will be appropriate for childcare . The study  personnel 
who interact with the patients will be experienced health care professionals (phy sicians with 
paediatric qualification, qualified paediatric nurses or psy chologists) and their education, 
training and experience will be documented. Age -appropriate explanations will be given to 
the child prior to an y investigation or procedure, in order to decrease anxiety  and anticipation 
of pain. Potentially  painful procedures such as venipuncture will be minimized with the use of 
topical anaesthesia. Blood sampling will be limited to the minimum required for obtaining 
valid data for evaluation. The number of blood samples and visits has been carefull y 
evaluated against the value for the overall objectives of the study .
The investigator play s an important role in protecting the safet y of the patient. The assessment 
of potential burden and risk is defined specificall y in the clinical study  protocol (saf ety rating 
scales, recording of adverse events, clinical safety laboratory  tests (blood biochemistry , 
haematology  and urine analy sis), vital signs (blood pressure andpulse rate), weight, 
electrocardiogram and phy sical examination) and these will be evalua ted b y the investigator 
at each visit to ensure the patient’s safet y and wellbeing. If it does not remain in the patient’s 
best interest to stay  in the study  the investigator will ensure that the patient is excluded. If the 
patient is not completing the st udy, a treatment will be offered to the patient at the discretion 
of the investigator in line with clinical practice. 
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,22qualified medical personnel at L undbeck or a 
delegate specify  will be readily  available to advise on study -related medical questions. 
Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the study . Safety  data will be reviewed 
regula rly by the Lundbeck Vortioxetine Safety  Committee to ensure that prompt ac tion is 
taken, if needed, to maximise patient safet y.
The selection criteria exclude the participation of patients at significant risk of suicide, and 
patients becoming at significant suicidal risk during the stud y will be withdrawn. Throughout 
the study , potential suicidal risk will be assessed both by  rating scale The Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale and/or by  the investig ator’s judg ement. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee will be established in order to review the safet y 
and tolerability  data throughout the study .The same DMC will cover all the clinical studies in 
the paediatric vortioxetine program.
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,22the investigator will be responsible for all study-
related medical decisions.
4.2 Informed Assent/ Consent
No study -related procedures, including an y screening procedures, may be performed before 
the investigator has obtained written assent from the patient and written informed consent 
from his or her parents/ legal representative.

prior to the Screening Visit to ensure that the patient meets the selection criteria is a study -
related activity  and must not occur before the Informed Assent/ Consent Form shave be en
signed.
Minors are dependent on their legal representative(s) (ty picall y their parent[s]) to assume 
responsibility  for their participation in clinical studies.39
If the informed assent/ consent process may  be delegated, the requirements for the delegates 
must be documented prior to the start of the stud y. National laws must always be adhered to 
when allowing potential delegation. Anydelegation must be documented in the site 
delegation log .
The investigator must identify vulnerable patients, that is, patients whose willingness to 
participate in thisstudy  might be unduly influenced by  the expectation ,regardless of whether 
it is justified, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory  response from senior
members of a hierarch y in case of refusal to participate. Patients thus identified must be 
excluded from participation in the study .
Prior to obtaining written informed assent/ consent, the investigator or a designee must explain 
to the patients andtheir legal representatives the aims, methods, and potential hazards of the 
study and any  discomfort it may  entail. The patients andtheir legal representatives must be 
informed that their participation in the study  is voluntary  and that they  are free to withdra w 
from the study  at any  time without justify ing their decision. The p atients andtheir legal 
representatives must be informed of the possibility  of withdrawing assent/ consent 
(section 8.5).
The p atients and thei r legal representatives must be given ample time and opportunity  to 
enquire about details of the study  prior to deciding whether to participate in the study .
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that all questions about the study  are 
answ ered to the satisfaction of the patients andtheir legal representatives . Prior to including a 
patient in the study , anInformed Assent Form must be signed and dated b y the patient and an 
Informed Consent Form must be signed b y his or her legal representat ive and signed and 
dated b y the investigator or a designee . The patients and their legal representatives must
receive a cop y of the written information ( Patient Information Sheet ) as well as a copy  of the 
signed Informed Assent/ Consent Form s.
The consent procedures described above will only  be implemented if allowed by  local law 
and regulations and will only  be initiated after approval by  the relevant ethics committees.
The blood samples for exploratory biomarker analy sis may be shared with academic or publ ic 
institutions and companies ; however, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and 
their use in accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a material 
transfer agreement .

ensure compliance with the above- mentioned legislation.
4.4 Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
This study  will be conducted only  after approva l of the protocol has been granted by  the 
appropriate IEC orIRBand a cop y of the written approval has been received by  Lundbeck.
The investigator must not screen any patients before receiving written approval from the IEC 
orIRB.
The IEC orIRB must be i nformed when specific types of protocol amendments have been 
made and must be asked whether a re -evaluation of the ethical aspects of the study  is 
necessary .
If applicable, interim reports on the study and reviews of its progress will be submitted to the 
IEC orIRB by the investigator at intervals stipulated in its guidelines.

6.1 Treatment Regimen
The screening period will be 5 to 15 day s followed by  a 4-week single -blind period (Phase A) 
of treatment with standardised brief psychosocial intervention and placebo. Patien ts who 
demonstrate an incomplete improvement of depressive sy mptoms at the end of Week 4 will 
be randomised to a double- blind, 8 -week treatment period (Phase B) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
vortioxetine 10 mg/day , vortioxetine 20 mg/day , fluoxetine 20 mg/day , or placebo.
Patients randomis ed to the 10 mg/day vortioxetine group will receive a lower initial dose 
(5 mg/day  for 2 day s) prior to receiv ing 10 mg/day . Patients randomised to the 20 mg/day  
vortioxetine group will receive a lower initial dose (5 mg/day  for 2 day s followed by  
10 mg/day  for 2 day s and 15 mg/day  for 2 day s) prior to receiving 20 mg/day . Patients 
randomis ed to the fluoxetine 20 mg/day  group will receive a lower initial dose (10 mg/day  for 
6 day s) prior to receiving 20 mg/day .
Based on tolerabil ity the dose may  be reduced at Week 8 ( Visit 10 = w eek 4 of Phase B). For 
patients randomised to vortioxetine the reduction will be by5 mg/day  and for fluoxetine 10
mg/day . No dose increase will be allowed.
The dose titration schedules are presented in Panel 3.
The capsule should be taken orall y, once dail y, preferabl y in the morning.

Page 41of 866.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment
The p atients will be assigned a screening number by the eCRF s ystem, and thatnumber will 
be used to identify  them throughout the stud y.
An Interactive Voice /Web Response S ystem (IV RS/IWRS ) will be used in this study . When a 
patient is to be randomised, the in vestigator will contact the IVRS/I WRS . The IVRS/I WRS
will allocate the pati ent to a treatment group during the call and assign the patient a 
randomisation number in accordance with the specifications from the Department of 
Biostatistics, H. Lundbeck A/S, and then follow up by  fax, e -mail, or the web (depending on 
availability  or preference at the site).
6.5 IMP Accountability
The IMP (s)must be tracked at each site using two logs:
•asite-specific log to track the complete inventory  (that is, what is shipped between the site 
and L undbeck)
•a patient -specific log to track what is dispens ed to and returned b y the patient
The investigator and the pharmacist (if applicable) must agree to only dispense IMP to 
patients enrolled in the study . The investigator or the pharmacist (if applicable) must maintain 
an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of the IMP(s). This record must be available 
for inspection at an y time.
6.6 Unblinding Procedures
GPV ,andtheinvestigator or the pharmacist (if applicable) will have access to the details of 
the double- blind treatment for each patient. Access to these details will be via IVRS/I WRS .
The IVRS/I WRS unblinding procedure is described in the IVRS User Guide .
The investigator may  only  break the code if knowledge of the IMP is necessary  to provide 
optimal treatment to the patient in an emergency  situation. I f possible, the investigator must 
consult the CRA before breaking the code. The investigator must record the date, time, and 
reason for breaking the code on the Completion/ Withdrawal Form (this corresponds to the
Completion/Withdrawal Visit , as the pa tient must be immediately  withdrawn from the study ) 
and sign the form. If the emergency  situation was an adverse event, it must be recorded on an 
Adverse Event Form . The CRA must be notified immediately . 
The IVRS/I WRS will also capture the date and time o f the code break call. I nformation on the 
allocated treatment will be provided during the call and byfax or e- mail,depending on 
availability /preference.

After completion of the study  or withdrawal from the study , the patient must be treated in 
accordance with normal practice .
No IMP will be provided by  Lundbeck.
7Concom itant Medication
Concomitant medication is any  medication other than the IMP sthat are taken during the 
study , including the S creening Period .
The concomitant medica tions that are disallowed or allowed with restrictions during the stu dy 
are summarised in Appendix II .
Details of all concomitant medication (prescription and over -the-counter) taken <3 months 
prior to the Scree ning Visit must be recorded in the eCRF at the first visit. Any  changes 
(including reason for changes) in concomitant medication must be recorded at each 
subsequent visit. For an y concomitant medication initiated or for which the dose has changed 
due to a new disorder or worsening of a concurrent disorder , the disorder must be recorded as 
an adverse event.
Concomitant medication initiated after the last dose of IMP must only  be recorded if 
associated with an SAE.
8Study Visit Plan
8.1 Overview
An overview of the procedures and assessments to be conducted during the study  and their 
timing is presented in Panel 2. Further details are in chapter 9.
After completing or withdrawing from the study, the patient must be treated in accordanc e 
with usual clinical practice . However, this will not apply  for patients entering in an extension 
study . 
8.2 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Screening Visit takes place betw een Day  –5and Day  –15 prior to Baseline A. 
In exceptional cases, the visit interval between the Screening and Baseline Visits may  be 
extended up to 30 day s with consent from the Medical Monitor at Lundbeck, provided the 
Medical Monitor accepts the ration ale provided for the extension.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 43of 86The screening period begins when the first screening assessment is done, after written 
Informed Assent/ Consent has been obtained. If there is a need for w ashout of disallowed 
medication it should begin before an y screening a ssessment is done and must comply  with the 
required was hout periods in Appendix II . Screening assessment is described in Panel 2.
8.2.1 Pre-screening
Each site must record in a pre -screening log which patients attended the Screening Visit.
Preferabl y within 24 hours from the Screening Visit, a study -specific Pre- Randomis ation 
Form needs to be completed by  the site and transmitted to the Contract Research Organisation 
(CRO) for their review. A confirmation that the patient can continue further with the study  
procedures is required before randomization.
8.2.2 Patient Identification Card
Each patient will be provided with a patient identification c ardthat states, at a minimum, the 
name of the IMP, the study  number, the patient identification number, the investigator’s 
name, and an emergency  telephone number providing 24- hour service.
Thepatient identification card should be returned to the investigator upon completion of the 
patient’s participation in the study .
8.2.3 Re-screening
Re-screening is only  allowed for patients with a complete Screening Visit and who fail to 
attend the Baseline A visit within th e planned window due to e.g. logistical constraint s.
Only  the sponsor’s medical expert (o r the CRO’s medical monitor) may  give permission to 
re-screen a patient.
Authorisation for re -screening may  only be granted by  the sponsor’s medical expert /CRO 
medical monitor after a thorough review of all data from the original Screening Visit.
At the new Screening Visit, the patient (and/or his or her legal representative (if applicable) 
and the responsible caregiver )must sign new Informed Assent/ Consent Form s. At the new 
Screening Visit, the patient will be assigned a new screening number. A re -screen ed patient 
must have a complete new Screening Visit, and all the eligibility  criteria must be re -assessed 
at the new Screening Visit.
The following information will also be recorded in the eCRF at the new Screening Visit:
•that the patient has previously  been screened for the study
•that re -screening has been authorised by  the sponsor’s medical expert or state who
•the screening number that was assigned to the patient at the original Screening Visit
If a patient is re- screened, no data from the original Screening Visit will be used.

8.3 Phase A (Visit 2 to 5)
Phase A starts wi thBaseline A (Week 0) for the 4 week single -blind phase.
Patients eligible for entering phase A will receive BPIat Week 1, 2 and 3 (visit 3, 4 and 5) 
and placebo. Patients who do not fulfil the criteria of incomplete improvement in Phase A at 
Week 3 will be withdrawn from the study  before Week 4 . Patients who do not fulfil the 
criteria of incomplete improvement at week 4 will be withdrawn from the study and not 
participate in the double -blind Phase B of the study .No specific study  related follow -up is 
required for these patients. However, as rescue procedure, they  may  benefit from up to four 
outpatient visits to the study  site for consultations over a t wo-month period.
8.4 Phase B ( Visit 6to 12)
Phase B starts wi thBaseline B (Week 4) for the 8 week double -blind phase.
The patients eligible for Phase B will be randomised at visit 6 (week 4) to one of the four 
treatment arms and receive BPI at Visit 7 and 10.
8.5 Withdrawal Visit (Visit 12)
Patients who withdraw from the study  prior to the Completion Visit will be asked to attend a 
Withdrawal Visit , if at all possible. The visit must be scheduled as soon as possible after 
withdrawal.
No new information will be co llected from patients who withdraw, except information 
collected in relation to the scheduled Withdrawal Visit or needed for the follow-up of adverse 
events (section 11.5).
The reason for withdrawal must be reco rded on the Reason for Withdrawal Form .
For a patient and/or his or her legal representative who withdraw assent/ consent:
•if the patient and/or his or her legal representative withdraw assent/ consent during a visit 
and then agrees to it being the final visit, the investigator will complete the visit as a 
Withdrawal Visit and all the data collected up to and including this visit will be used
•if the patient and/or his or her legal representative withdraw assent/consent during a 
telephone conversation, the inv estigator will ask the patient if he or she will attend a 
Withdrawal Visit. I f the patient:
agrees to attend a Withdrawal Visit, all the data collected up to and including this visit 
will be used
refuses to attend a Withdrawal Visit, the investigator should attempt to follow the 
patient’s safet y and future treatment ; any information collected will only  be recorded in

8.6 Safety Follow -up Visit/Contact (Visit 13)
The safety  follow -up is conducted to capture serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur during 
the Safet y Follow -up Period as well as t o follow up on the outcome of adverse events on-
going at the end of the Treatment Period. The safety  follow -up may either be conducted as a 
visit to the site or as a telephone contact. The safet y follow -up must be conducted 
approximately  30days after the last dose of IMP.
If any new SAEs have occurred since the last assessment at which the patient received IMP, 
the safet y follow-up must, when possible, be a visit to the site.
For adverse events that were on -going at the end of the Treatment Period and that resolved 
during the Safet y Follow -up Period, the stop date must be recorded. For non-serious adverse 
events still on -going at the safet y follow -up, the stop date must be recorded as “on- going”. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution or the outcome is know n.
Patients with a clinical safety laboratory  test value that was out-of-range at the Completion or 
Withdrawal Visit and judged clinicall y significant must be followed according to accepted 
medical standards for up to 30days or until the value normalises or stabilises or a diagnosis or 
a reasonable explanation has been established . For these patients, safety  follow -up visits must 
be scheduled to allow for a medical examination and/or blood sampling. The investigator 
must decide whether further safet y follo w-up visits are required after 30days. If further safety  
follow -up visits are made, these must be documented in the patient’s medical record and not 
in the eCRF.
Patients who withdrew due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4)should be 
followed until the values normalise or stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has 
been established (see section 11.5).
The safety  follow -up for patients who with draw assent/ consent must be performed , if at all 
possible; any  information collect ed will be recorded in the patients’ medical records.
8.7 End-of-study Definition
The end of the stud y for an individual patient is defined as the last protocol- specified contact
with that patient. The overall end of the study  is defined as the last protocol -specified contact

Page 46of 869Brief Psychological intervention (BPI) 
The patients will receive treatment with standardised brief psychosocial intervention during 
the study . The treatment will be spread across 5 sessions. There will be 3 sessions in Phase A 
(Weeks 1, 2 and 3), followed b y 2 sessions in Phase B (Weeks 5 and 8). BPI for depression41
is a comprehensive package of specialist care for children and adolescents with depression. It 
arises from the practise and formulation of a Specialist Clinical Care (SCC) programme and 
has its origins in the work of the ADAPT RCT27team . It comprises: assessment, formulation, 
case management, achieving engagement with the y oung person and their parents, planning 
and delivery  of treatment. I t is structured around core clinical skills, key  elements known to 
counter depressive tendencies, psy cho-education & liaison and multi -systemic formulation 
(biological, psy chological and social elements). A detailed description of key  elements of BPI 
case management is provided in a manual that will be delivered to the site. The manual is 
intended as a guide to practice, not a session- by-session pre scription. It is expected across the 
treatment period that due consideration is given to all elements described in the manual. The 
clinician is directed to use their clinical discretion to decide in which session to apply  which 
element of BPI. Session length for BPI  will be up to 30 minutes.

10.1.3 The Kiddie -Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged 
Children, Present and Lifetime version (K- SADS -PL). 
The K -SADS -PL42is a semi -structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and 
past episodes of ps ychopathology in children and adolescents. The K -SADS -PL is interviews 
with the parent(s), the child, and information from other sources ( for example, school report). 
The unstructured introductory  interview establishes a rapport with the parent(s) and the child, 
the screening interview (comprising 82 -items to survey  key symptoms for current and past 
episodes of 20 different diagnostic areas) provides a diagnosis, and responses to skip -out 
criteria determine whether additional interviewing is necessary . If necessary, the additional 
interview consists of a maximum of five diagnostic s upplements (affective disorders,
psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders ,behavioural disorders ,and substance abuse, eating, and 
tic disorders). The K -SADS -PL items are scored using a 2- point or a 3 -point scale from 1 (no 
symptoms) to 3 (threshold levels of s ymptomatology ). It takes approximately  180 minutes to 
complete both K -SADS -PL interviews (parent(s) and child). 
10.1.4 K- SADS -PL Rater Qualification and Certification
The K -SADS -PL should be administered b y a rater who has adequate experience with 
paediatric patients with MDD. The rater should be a ps ychiatrist or DO s pecialised in child

A urine drug screen and a blood alcohol test are required at the designated time. At any  time 
during the stud y at t he discretion of the investigator a drug and/or alcohol screening can be 
conducted .Patients whose urine drug screen is positive for cocaine or other illicit drugs must 
be withdrawn from the study .However, if a patient tests positive for opiates due to in cidental 
use of codeine -containing medication, as assessed in a clinical interview, the drug screen may  
be repeated up to three weeks later, but the retest result must be available from a central 
laboratory  latest at Visit 2 and has to be negative for this patient to be eligible for enrolment. 
If a patient tests positive for amphetamines due to his/her ADHD current treatment, as 
confirmed b y a clinical interview, the patient is eligible for enrolment . If patients have a 
positive blood alcohol result at scre ening they  may  continue in the study  but only  after

The CDRS -R43is a clinician -rated scale to measure the severit y of depression of children and 
adolescents. The CDRS-R consists of 17 items: 14 items rate verbal observations, and three 
items rate nonverbal observati ons (tempo of language, h ypoactivity , and nonverbal expression 
of depressed affect). Depression symptoms are rated on a 5 -point scale from 1 to 5 for the 
verbal observations, and a 7-point scale from 1 to 7 for the nonverbal observations. The total 
score r anges from 17 (normal) to 113 (severe depression). The CDRS -R can be administered 
by a clinician after a training session. It takes approximately  20 to 30 minutes to administer 
and rate the CDRS- R.

Page 49of 8610.2.1.3 Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI -S/I)
The CGI30was developed to provide global measures of the severit y of a patient’s clinical 
condition and improvement or worsening during clinical studies.
The clinician will use the scale to assess depressive sy mptoms. 
The CGI consists of two clinician -rated subscales: severit y of illness (CGI -S) and global 
improvement (CGI -I). 
The CGI -S provides the clinician’s impression of the patient’s current state of mental illness. 
The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severit y 
of the patient’s current mental illness on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 ( Normal -not at all
ill) to 7 ( among the most extremely ill patients ).
The CGI -I provides the clinician’s impression of the patient’s i mprovement (or worsening). 
The clinician assesses the patient’s condition relative to B aseline Aon a 7- point scale ranging 
from 1 ( very much improved ) to 7 ( very much worse ). In all cases, the assessment should be 
made independent of whether the rater bel ieves the improvement is drug -related or not.
An experienced clinician can use the CGI after a short training session. I t takes 1 to 2 minutes 
to score the CGI after a clinical interview.
10.2.1.4 Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) 
The CGAS44is a clinician -rated global scale to measure the lowest level of functioning for a 
child (4 to 16 y ears) during a specified time period. The CGAS contains behaviourall y-
oriented descriptors at each anchor point that depict behaviours and life situations applicable 
to a c hild. The items range in value from 1 (most functionally  impaired child) to 100 (the 
healthiest). A total score above 70 indicates normal function. The CGAS can be administered 
by a clinician after a training session. It takes approximately  2 minutes to ad minister CGAS.
10.2.1.5 CDRS -R, CGI, CGAS Rater Qualification and Certification
The CDRS -R, CGI andCGAS sc alesshould only  be administered by  a rater who has 
adequate experience with paediatric patients with MDD and who has adequate experience in

10.2.2.1.1 The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
The Sy mbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)45  is a cognitive test designed to assess speed of 
performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision- making and ps ychomotor skills. The 
SDMT consists of 110 geometric sy mbols that the patient has to substitute with a 
corresponding digit in a 90 -second period. Each correct digit is counted, and the total score 
ranges from 0 (less than normal functioning) to 110 (greater than normal functioning). The
written version of the test will be used in this study . It takes approximately  5 minutes to 
complete and score the SDMT.
10.2.2.1.2 SDMT Rater Qualification and Certification
The SDM Tshould only  be administered by a rater who has adequate experience with

depressive s ymptoms in children and adolescents. The ten depression items are rated on a 4 -
point scale from 0 ( never or hardly ever) to 3 ( very often or almost constantly ). The total 
score ranges from 0 to 30,with higher scores indicating greater pathology . It takes 
approximately  5 minutes to complete the GBI 10 -item depression scale.
10.2.3.1.2 Parent Global Assessment –Global Improvement (PGA)
The PGA47is a parent -rated variation of the CGI -I to evaluate the severit y of the child’s 
symptoms. The PGA reflects assessments of change from Baseline Asymptoms using a 7 
point scale ranging from 1 (very  much improved) to 7 (very  much worse). It takes 1 to 2 
minutes to score t he PGA.
10.2.3.1.3 The PedsQL Present Functioning Visual Analogue Scales (PedsQL™ VAS)
The PedsQL™ VAS48is designed to measure at -that-moment functioning in children and 
adolescents. The PedsQL VAS consists of 6 domains: anxiety , sadness, anger, worry , fatigue 
and pa in using visual analogue scales. The functionality  for each domain is measured on a 10

Page 52of 86cm line with a happ y face at one end and a sad face at the other. The patients are asked to 
mark on the line how they feel. The total score is the average of all 6 items , and the emotional 
distress summary  score is the mean of the anxiety, sadness, anger, and worry items. It takes 2 
to 5 minutes to administer and rate the PedsQL VAS.
10.2.3.1.4 Paediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ -
LES -Q)
The PQ -LES-Q49is a patient -rated scale designed to assess satisfaction with life. It is an 
adaptation of the Quality  of L ife Enjoy ment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q -LES-Q), 
which is used to measure quality  of life in adults. The PQ LES Q consist of 15 items, ite m 1-
14 assess the degree of satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily  
functioning and item 15 allows subjects to summarize their experience in a global rating. 
Each item is rated on a 5 -point scale from 1 ( very poor ) to 5 ( very good ).The total score 
range of item 1 -14 is 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. It takes 5 to 
10 minutes to complete the scale.
10.3 Blood Sampling for Vortioxetine and Fluoxetine Quantification
Blood samples (2 x 1 mL) for IMP analy sis wi ll be collected in EDTA tubes, simultaneously  
with clinical safet y lab samples. The blood sampling and handling procedures are described in 
the study -specific Laboratory Specification Manual .
The blood samples will be anal ysed for vortioxetine and fluoxeti neusing methods validated 
in accordance with the EMA Guideline on B ioanalytical Method Validation50and the FDA 
Guidance for Industry .51A bioanaly tical protocol will be prepared by  Lundbeck before the 
plasma samples are anal ysed.
Selected samples will be subjected to incurred sample re- analysis (ISR)for fluoxetine as part 
of the in -study  method validation of the applied bioanaly tical method. PK results and I SR 
results will be clearl y distinguished from each other in the bioanal ytical study  report that will
be prepared b y the Department of Bioanal ysis, H. Lundbeck A/S.
10.4 Safety Assessments
10.4.1 Adverse Events
The p atients will be asked a non -leading question (for example , “how do you feel?” , “how 
have you felt since your last visit?” ) at each visit, starting at theScreening Visit . Adverse 
events (including worsening of concurrent disorders , new disorders , and pregnancies) either 
observed b y the investigator or reported spontaneously b y the patient will be recorded, and 
the investigator will assess the seriousness a nd the intensity  of the adverse event and its 
relationship to the IMP. Results from relevant tests and examinations, such as clinical safet y 
laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECGs, or their corresponding conditions will also be recorded 
as adverse events if considered b y the investigator to be clinically  significant.

Page 54of 86Blood samples for the clinical safety laboratory  tests will b e collected as outlined in Panel 2
of the Clinical Study Synopsis . The blood sampling and handling procedures are described in 
thestudy -specific Laboratory Specification Manual .
The blood and urine drug scr een samples will be analy sed at the central laboratory .
The additional urine samples will be collected and anal ysed at the site using dipsticks. If the 
dipstick evaluation is positive or abnormal, further anal ysis will be performed at the central 
laborator y.
The investigator must review (initial and date) the results of the clinical safet y laboratory  tests 
as soon as possible after receipt of those results. Out -of-range values must be interpreted by  
the investigator as “not clinically  significant” or “clinically  significant” with a comment 
concerning the planned follow- up. Tests for clinically  significant out -of-range values must be 
repeated, or an appropriate clinical follow -up must be arranged by  the investigator and 
documented on the laboratory  report, until the value has stabilised or until the value has 
returned to a clinicall y acceptable value (regardless of relationship to I MP). Any  value that is 
out-of- range at the Completion or Withdrawal Visit and judged clinically  significant must be 
followed accor ding to accepted medical standards for up to 30 days or until the value 
normalises or stabilises or a diagnosis or reasonable e xplanation has been established. Any 
out-of- range values followed after the last protocol -specified contact with the patient willbe 
documented in the patient’s medical record.
Clinically  significant out -of-range values must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
The central laboratory  will be notified by the sponsor w hen the biological samples may be

10.4.3 V ital Signs
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using a standard digital meter after the patient 
has rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. Pulse rate will be recorded before each 
blood pressure measurement.
The patient must then be instructed to change from a supine to a standing position in a manner 
that includes passing through a sitting position before assuming an upright position. Blood 
pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the patient has been standing for at least 1 
minute , but no longer than 5 minutes.
Vital signs should be assessed prior to blood sampling.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Report Form.

Height will be measured with a stadio meter, without shoes.
Patients will be weighed wearin g light clothing and no shoes. A similar amount of clothing 
must be worn on each occasion.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
10.4.5 Electrocar diograms (ECGs)
A standard 12-lead electronic ECG (eECG) will be performed using digital ECG recording 
equipment provided to the investigator or, upon agreement, to an external cardiology  centre.  
The eECGs will be transferred digitall y to a central ECG la boratory  for evaluation, and the 
results from the central ECG laboratory  will include the RR, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals.
The investigator will, during the study  be provided with the results and a cardiological 
interpretation of the ECG performed b y a paediatric cardiologist from the central ECG 
laboratory .
The investigator has the final decision on the clinical significance of the ECG evaluation.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on the Adverse 
Event Report Form .
10.4.6 Physical and Neurological Examinations
The investigator may  appoint a designee to be primarily  responsible for performing the 
physical examinations provided this is permitted according to local regulations. The 
investigator must take responsibility  for reviewing the findings.
The ph ysical examination  must, at a minimum, include an examination of appearance, 
extremities, skin, head, neck, ey es, ears, nose, throat, lungs, chest, heart, abdomen and 
musculoskeletal sy stem. The examination at the Screening V isit will be considered the 
baseline ph ysical examination.
The neurological examination must be performed by  a ph ysician.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Report Form .
10.4.7 Tanner evaluating
Tanner staging is a scale for assessing phy sical development and sexual maturity  during onset 
and progress of pubert y.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 56of 86The scale includes five stages of pubertal changes (called Tanner stages) separate for males 
and for females.
For female the 5 stages of maturat ion are recognized by  assessing pubic hair and breast 
development. For male the 5 stages of maturation are recognized b y assessing pubic hair, 
growth of penis and testicles. Post- pubert y is defined as a Tanner stage = 5 in both of 
observed criteria. 
The e valuation of Tanner stage will be performed by  physician or trained nurse - they will be 
provided with figures depicting the somatic changes and tables describe these changes in 
words to facilitate the staging. Tanner staging will be performed at Screening Visit.
10.4.8 Assessment Tools
The Paediatric Adverse Event Rating Scale (PAERS), The Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS) and GBI mania, will be used for evaluation of tolerability  and safet y.
The PAERS , C-SSRS , and GBI will be administered in the lo cal language. Only  the scales 
provided for this Lundbeck study  should be used.
Detailed instructions on how to administer the scales and how to score using the scales will be 
provided to the sites in a Rater Guideline .
10.4.9 Paediatric Adverse Event Rating Scale (PAERS)
The PAERS52is a clinician -rated scale designed and validated to assess adverse events 
occurring in paediatric patients who are treated with psychotropic medication in clinical 
studies.  
The PAERS consists of 45 items: 43 specific signs and sy mpto ms and two to be specified. 
Each item specifies if the adverse event was present recentl y, if it was resolved ( No, Yes ), 
related to drug ( No, Study drug, Other drug, Drug- drug interaction ), its severity  (Mild, 
Moderate, Severe, Extreme ) and if it impaired function ( No, Yes ).
The PAERS can be administered b y a clinician after a short training session. It takes 
approximately  10 minutes to administer and score the PAERS.
The PAERS must be applied after the non -leading, open questions on any adverse events (se e 
section 10.4). As this recording of adverse events should precede the use of the PAERS, the 
numbers of adverse events captured b y these two methods potentially  differ.
10.4.10 Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The C -SSRS53is a semi -structured interview developed to sy stematically  assess suicidal 
ideation and behaviour of patients participating in a clinical study . The C -SSRS has 4

Page 57of 86questions addressing suicidal behaviour, 5 questions addressing suicidal id eation, and sub -
questions assessing the severit y. 
Different versions of the scale are available: in this study , the “Baseline Screening ” version 
will be applied at the Screening Visit and the “Since last visit” version will be applied other 
visits includi ng the C -SSRS. 
An experienced clinician can use the C -SSRS after a short training session. I t takes 
approximately  5 minutes to administer and rate the C -SSRS.
10.4.11 General Behavior Inventory (GBI) 10-Item Mania Scale
The GBI 10- item mania scale54is a parent - and subject -rated scale designed to screen for 
manic sy mptoms in children and adolescents. The 10 items are rated on a scale from 0 ( never 
or hardly ever ) to 3 ( very often or almost constantly ). The total score ranges from 0 to 30 
points, with high scores i ndicating greater pathology . It takes approximately  5 minutes to 
complete the GBI 10 -item mania scale.
10.4.12 Rater Qualification and Certification
PAERS and C-SSRS should only  be administered by  a rater who has adequate experience 
with paediatric patients and wh o has adequate experience in rating scales. The rater should be 
a psy chiatrist or DO specialised in child and adolescent psy chiatry , or a clinical paediatric
(neuro -) psychologist involved in clinical practice. Any exception s must be discussed with 
and app roved by  Lundbeck.
Only  raters who have been certified in a study -specific Rater Certification Programme will be 
authorised to rate in this study . Documentation of training and certification will be delivered 
to the raters for archiving in the investigator trial master file (TMF). No patient may  be rated 
before the documentation has been delivered.
New raters joining the study  will be trained and certified locall y using the same certification 
process.
10.5 Exploratory Assessments
10.5.1 Multidimensional Anxiety Scale f or Children short version (MASC -10)
The MASC -1055is designed to screen for anxiety  in children, and is based on the 39- item 
MASC. The MASC -10 consists of 10 items assessing ph ysiological s ymptoms, social anxiety , 
harm avoidance, and separation/panic. The a nxiety  symptoms are rated on a 4 -point scale 
from 0 (never true about me) to 3 (often true about me). Total score ranges from 0 to 30, with 
higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety . The MASC -10 takes approximately  5 
minutes to administer and score .

Page 58of 8610.6 Exploratory Biomarker Assessments
10.6.1 General Considerations
Although the possible future exploratory  biomarker anal yses will help to increase our 
understanding of the aetiology  of MDD and the molecular basis of the drug response, the 
efforts described in th is protocol are strictly  research based. Therefore , as the complex 
interactions between genes and disease are currently  not characterised to a level that translates 
to a meaningful clinical advantage, individual results from the exploratory  biomarker anal yses 
will not be given to the patients. For the same reasons, individual results will not be added to 
the patients’ medical records.
The patients will have no direct benefit from the exploratory  biomarker analy ses.
As blood sampling for the exploratory  geno mics, proteomics, and metabolomics is an integral
part of the stud y, the main Patient Information Sheet covers these anal yses. Conversel y, blood 
sampling for the possible future genetic biomarker anal ysis is optional and a separate Patient 
Information Shee tcovers this analy sis.
The blood samples for possible future explorat orybiomarker anal ysis, or the data derived 
from these blood samples, may  be shared with academic andpublic institutions and other 
companies. However, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and their use in 
accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a Material Transfer 
Agreement . Furthermore, the results based on the anal ysis of the samples may  be pooled 
across studies to increase the statistical power of the anal yses.
A patient and/or his or her legal representative (if applicable) may, at an y time and without 
stating a reason, specifically  request the destruction of the patient’s exploratory  biomarker 
sample, irrespective of his or her continued parti cipation in the study . The investigator must 
send a written request on behalf of the patient to the international study  manager. The 
investigator will receive written confirmation from L undbeck when the sample has been 
destroy ed.
The blood samples for geno mics, proteomics, and metabolomics will be single -coded using 
the patient’s screening number. The blood samples for genetic biomarker analysis will be 
double -coded as described in EMA ’s position paper on pharmacogenetic terminology56to 
ensure patient priva cy protection.
10.6.2 Blood Sampling for Gene Expression Profiling
Blood samples for gene expression profiling will be collected in 2.5 mL PaxGene RNA tubes .
The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the stud y for this purpose will be 
7.5mL.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 59of 86The samples for gene expression profiling will be shipped to a Central Laboratory for sample 
storage.  Sample preparation and anal ysis may  be performed by  a Contract Research 
Organisation (CRO) or by a bona fide research collaborator .
10.6.3 Blood Sampling for Metabolomic/P roteomic Biomarkers
Blood samples for metabolomic/proteomic biomarkers will be collected in 2 mL  K2 EDTA 
tubes.
The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the stud y for this purpose will be 6 mL.
The samples for metabolomic/proteomic biomarkers wil l be shipped to a Central Laboratory
in the U nited States for sample storage. The analysis may  be performed by  a Contract 
Research Organisation (CRO) or by  a bona fide research collaborator.
10.6.4 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics
It is optional for the patient to donate a blood sample for exploratory  pharmacogenetic 
analysis.
A blood sample (2 mL) will be collected in K3 EDTA tube for subsequent DNA extraction.
Blood tubes will be shipped on dry  ice to the central laboratory , where DNA will be extracted 
and re tained. DNA aliquots will be shipped to a Central Laboratory for storage. 
The genetic variants to be anal ysed may  include single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) and 
copy  number variations (CNVs). The analy tical methods may  be pol ymerase chain reaction 
(PCR), qPCR (quantitative PCR), sequencing, or whole genome scans on microarray s. The 
analysis may  be performed by  a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) or by  a bona fide 
research collaborator.

10.8 Total Volume of Blood Drawn and Destruction of Biological Material
The total volume of blood drawn from each patient will be approximately  47.5mL during the 
study .
Additional blood samples may be required if the original blood samples are not viable or if re-
testing is required.
All biological samples will be retained at the bioanaly tical facility  until the results have been 
reported. The samples will subsequently  be destroy ed by  the responsible analytical laboratory . 
The bioanal ytical lab will retain the samples until the bioanal ytical report is final and no 
longer than 1 year from LPLV. The I SM/CR S will be notified that the samples are to be 
destroy ed, and the documentation for sample destruction will be kept in the bi oanal ytical 
study  file.
The blood samples and any  derived material for possible future exploratory  pharmacogenetic 
analyseswill be destro yed ≤15 years after the end of the study  (see definition in section 8.7) 
bya Central Laboratory .
The blood samples and any derived material for possible future exploratory  gene expression 
profiling and metabolic or proteomic biomarker assessments will be destroyed ≤10years after 
the end of the stud y(see definition in section 8.7) by a Central Laboratory .
10.9 Treatment Compliance
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to account for all IMP (ref to IMP accountabilit y 
section 6.5). The investigator or her/his designee must agree not to dispense any  IMP to any  
person, except patient/parents included in the study  and he/she/they must further agree onl y to 
use IMP in accordance with protocol.
In addition, measures of the blood concentration of vortioxetine and fluoxetine will indicate 
whether patient has been overall compliant throughout the study .

Page 61of 8611Adverse Events
11.1 Definitions
11.1.1 Adver se Event Definitions57
Adverse event –is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be any  unfav ourable and unintended sign ( including clinically  
significant out -of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory  tests, 
vital signs, ECGs), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal
product , regardless of whether it is considered related to the medicinal product .
It is Lundbeck policy  to collect and record all adverse events, including pre-treatment adverse 
events , that is, those that start after the patient has signed the Informed Assent Form and prior 
to the first dose of IMP.
Serious adverse event (SAE) –is an y adverse event that:
•results in death
•is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypotheti cally  might have caused death 
had it been more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
•results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
•is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
•is medically important (th is refers to an event that may  not be immediatel y life-threatening 
or result in death or hospitalisation, but may  jeopardise the patient or may  require 
intervention to prevent any  of the SAEs defined above)
Examples of medically  important events are intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm ;
blood dy scrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation; or development of drug 
dependency ordrug abuse.
Planned hospitalisations or surgical interventions for a condition that existed before the 
patie nt signed the Informed Assent Form and that did not change in intensity  are not SAEs. 
Emergency  room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital are not necessarily  
SAEs; however, they  must be evaluated to determine whether they  meet any  of the SAE 
definitions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically  important] event).
The C -SSRS has 5 questions addressing suicidal ideation. If level 4 or 5 has been answered 
“yes”, a corresponding SAE should be reported.
Non-serious adverse event –is any  adverse event that does not meet the definition of an SAE.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 62of 86If there is an y doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, a 
conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) – is any adverse event that is 
assessed as serious, unexpected ( its nature or intensity  is not consistent with the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure for vortioxetine13or the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC)/Prescribing Information for Fluoxetine ),and related to an 
investigational product by either the investigator or the sponsor.
Overdose –is a dose taken by  a patient that exceeds th e dose presc ribed to that patient. Any  
overdose (and associated sy mptoms) must , at a minimum, be recorded as a non -serious 
adverse event .
11.1.2 Adverse Event Assessment Definitions
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator must assess the intensity of theadverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form :
•Mild –the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal activities.
•Moderate – the adverse event is sufficiently  uncom fortable to produce some impairment of 
the patient’s normal activities.
•Severe –the adverse event is incapacitating , preventing the pa tient from participating in his 
or hernormal activities.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the causal relationship between theadverse event and the IMP 
using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious 
Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Probable –the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on 
rechallenge, and another aetiology  is unlikel y or significantly less likel y.
•Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an 
alternative aetiology  is equally  or less likel y.
•Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to the I MP or is due to 
underly ing/concurrent illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse event ).
An adverse event is considered causall y related to the use of the I MP when the causalit y 
assessment is probable or possible .
For pre -treatment adverse events, a causalit y assessment is not relevant.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 63of 86Assessment of Outcome
The investigator must assess the outcome of theadverse event using the following definitions, 
and rec ord it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Recovered – the patient has recovered completel y, and no symptoms remain.
•Recovering –the patient’s condition is improving, but sy mptoms still remain.
•Recovered with sequ elae –the patient has recovered, but some sy mptoms remain (for 
example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normall y, but has some motor 
impairment).
•Not recovered – the patient’s condition has not improved and the s ymptoms are unchanged 
(for exam ple, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic).
•Death
11.2 Pregnancy
Although not necessarily considered an adverse event, apregnancy  in a patient in the study  
must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form , as well as on a Pregnancy Form (paper), even if 
no adver se event associated with the pregnancy  has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to 
Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs.
An uncomplicated pregnancy  should not be considered an SAE. If, however, thepregnancy  is 
associat ed with an SAE, the appropriate serious criterion (for example, hospitalisation) must 
be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event Form . Examples of pregnancies to be reported as 
SAEs (medicall y important) are spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and malformat ions.
The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy  and report it on a 
Pregnancy Form (paper).  The follow- up must include information on the neonate at least up 
until the age of 1 month.
11.3 Recording Adverse Events
Adverse events (including pre-treatment adverse events) must be recorded on an Adverse 
Event Form . The investigator must provide information on the adverse event , preferabl y with 
a diagnosis, or at least with signs and s ymptoms; start and stop dates (and start and stop time 
if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours) ; intensity ; causal relationship to I MP; action 
taken; and outcome. If the adverse event is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be 
stated (for example, medication error, accidental overdose, or intentional o verdose). If the 
intensity  changes during the course of the adverse event, this must be recorded on the AE 
Intensity Log .
If the adverse event is serious, this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . 
Furthermore, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE 
to Lundbeck immediately  (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (section 11.4).
Adverse events , including clinically  significant out-of- range clinical safet y laborat orytest
values and findings from for example, ECGs, must be recorded individuall y, except when 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 64of 86considered manifestations of the same medical condition or disease state; in such cases, they  
must be recorded under a single diagnosis.
11.4 Reporting Serious Adver se Events
The investigator must report SAEs to L undbeck immediately  (within 24 hours) after 
becoming aware of them by  completing a Serious Adverse Event Form .
The initial report must contain as much information as possible and, if more information 
about th e patient’s condition becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event Form must be 
updated with the additional information.
If the investigator cannot report the SAE in Rave®, then he or she must complete and sign the 
Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and s end it to :
Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV)
Fax: +45 36 30 99 67
e-mail: safet y@lundbeck.com
Lundbeck will assume responsibility  for reporting SAEs to the authorities in accordance with 
local regulations.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to be famili ar with local requirements regarding reporting 
SAEs to the IEC orIRB and to act accordingl y.
Lundbeck will assume responsibility  for reporting SUSARs to the authorities in accordance 
with local regulations. In those Member States of the European Union tha t have implemented 
the European Union Clinical Trials Directive58and in Norway , Liechtenstein, and Iceland, 
that is, in the countries where unblinded expedited safet y reporting is required, Lundbeck will 
also assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to t he ethics committees.
Lundbeck will assess the expectedness of SAEs and inform the investigator(s) about 
SUSARs, at a minimum, in the monthly , blinded SUSAR listings. CI OMS -I reports for 
SUSARS are not normally  distributed to investigators in those countri es where SUSAR 
listings are sufficient. However, if the CIOMS -I reports are required (for example, by  the 
local EC/I RB/REB), they will be sent to the investigator.
11.5 Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events
Patients with adverse events must be treated in accordance with usual clinical practice at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Non-serious adverse events must be followed up until resolution or the safety  follow -up 
assessment, whichever comes first. At the safety follow -up, information on new SAEs , if an y, 
and stop dates for previously  reported adverse events must be recorded.

Confidential
Page 65of 86It is the responsibility  of the investigator to follow up on all SAEs until the patient has 
recovered, stabilised, or recovered with sequelae, and to report to Lundbeck allrelevant new 
information using the same procedures and timelines as those for the initial report. Relevant 
information includes discharge summaries, autopsy  reports, and medical consultations.
SAEs that are spontaneously  reported b y a patient to the investigator af ter the safet y follow -
up assessment must be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the stud y. 
These SAEs will be captured in the GPV database.
Patients with clinically  significant out-of- range clinical safet y laboratory  test values at the 
Completion or Withdrawal Visit must be followed in accordance with usual clinical practice 
and be scheduled for a Safet y Follow -up Visit to allow for a medical examination and/or 
blood sampling (see section 8.6).
Patients who withdra w due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4) must be followed 
until the values normalise or stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has been 
established. Additional medic al examinations (for example, ultrasound scanning and/or 
sampling for serology , conjugated bilirubin, INR) should be considered. A gastroenterology  
or hepatology  consultation should also be considered.
Data Monitoring Committee
The Data Monitoring Committe e (DMC) includes child and adolescent psychiatrists . The 
DMC ensures that the ethical principles are observed and monitors the safety of the patients. 
The DMC will be informed to what extent the data and analy ses provided to them have been 
quality  controll ed. Members of the DMC will not be involved in other study- related tasks. 
The details of the DMC procedures are described in the Data Monitoring Committee Charter .
The same DMC will cover all the clinical studies in the paediatric vortioxetine program.
12Data Handling and Record Keeping
12.1 Data Collection
12.1.1 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs)
eCRF swill be used to collect all the data related to the study , except the external data 
described in section 12.1.3 .
The eCRFs use third party software (Rave®) to capture data via an on -line sy stem on a 
computer. Data related to the study  will be recorded electronically  in a central database over 
encry pted lines, and all entries and modifications to the data will be logged in an audit trail. 
Access to the s ystem will only  be granted after appropriate and documented training. Written 
instructions for using the sy stem will be provided along with the training.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 66of 86Electronic signatures will be used where signatures are required on pages and/or visits. 
Automated data entry  checks will be implemented where appropriate; other data will be 
reviewed and evaluated for accuracy  by the CRA. All entries, corrections, and changes must 
be made b y the investigator or adelegate .
12.1.2 Patient Binders
12.1.2.1 Use o f Patient Binders
Lundbeck will provide a Patient Binder for each patient.  The Patient Binder contain s
different ty pes of source documents, organised by  visit and ty pe. A ballpoint pen with 
waterproof ink must be used to enter information in the Patient B inder .
12.1.2.2 Rating Scales and Patient -reported Outcomes (PROs)
The Patient Binder contain spaper versions of the rating scale, K -SADS -PL,the 
neurocognitive test, SDTM and the PRO, PedsQL  VAS. They will be completed by  the 
rater(s) and the patient, respectivel y.The data will be transcribed to the Scoring Sheets in the 
eCRF by  the investigator or a delegate.
The rater (s)must verify  that all the entries in the Scale Section are accurate and correct by  
signing and dating the relevant pages.
The patients will be a sked to comp lete the PROs in their local language. The patients’ 
responses may only be corrected by the patient .
12.1.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Fallback Forms
Serious Adverse Event F allback Formsmust be used when the eCRF cannot be accessed.
12.1.3 External Data
All elec tronic data will be transferred using a secure method accepted by  Lundbeck.
The clinical safet y and/or efficacy  laboratory  test results will be transferred by the central 
laboratory .The data will be loaded into the eCRF .
The electronic data received from the following vendors will be kept in a secure designated 
storage area outside the eCRF :
•In case of an y electronic Assessment(s) / PRO (s)theresults will be transferred by
designated vendor.
•The results of the IMP analy sis will be transferred by  Lundbeck D epartment of Bioanaly sis
•The ECG results will be transferred b y the central ECG laboratory .

Page 67of 8612.2 Retention of Study Documents at the Site
12.2.1 eCRF Data
If a site close sbefore the study has been completed, the investigator will continue to have 
read-only access to the eCRF. If a site closes after the study  has been completed , the 
investigator will no longer have read access to the eCRF. Instead, each site will be provided 
with a CD -ROM containing the data related to the site (including eCRF data, queries, and the 
audit trail). As a CD- ROM is not considered a durable medium and may  therefore not be 
readable for the full retention period (for example, 15 y ears [if required by  the applicable 
regulatory  requirements]), it is possible for the investigator to request a new CD-ROM with 
the data related to the site.
12.2.2 Other Study Documents
The investigator must keep the investigator’s set of documents in the investigator TMF for at 
least 15 y ears after the C linical Study R eport has been approved or in accordance with 
national r equirements, whichever is longer .
Since off- site storage is used, a study -specific binder will remain at the site after the other 
study -specific documents have been shipped for off -site storage . This binder is considered 
part of the investigator TMF and must be kept in a secure place b y the site for the required 
period of time. The binder must contain, at a minimum, the following documents: a cop y of 
the Investigator TMF Index , a certified copy  of the Patient Identification Code List , and a 
Retrieval Form .
Lundbeck will notify  the investigator in writing when the required storage period has expired 
and when the documents may  be destroy ed according to regulations.
13Monitoring Procedures
Prior to including patients in the study , the investigator must sign a sou rce data agreement that 
identifies the source documents (original documents, data, and records) at the site .The 
document will also list which data may  be recorded directl y on the eCRFs .
If the investigator does not have a patient’s medical records, the in vestigator must attempt to 
obtain copies or a written summary  of relevant medical records from the doctor who had 
treated the patient earlier and include the pertinent documentation in the patient’ s medical 
records at the site . The investigator must obtain medical records documenting the patient’ s 
lifetime MDD episodes and general medical history  for the 3 months prior to the study .
During the study , the CRA will visit the site to ensure that the protocol is being adhered to
andthat all issues are being recorded, to perform source data verification, and to monitor IMP
accountabilit y. The visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 68of 86eCRFs, the site ’s recruitment rate ,and the compliance of the site to the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practice .In addition, the CRA will be available for discussions by  telephone.
Source data verification requires that the CRA be given direct access to all the source 
documents . Direct access includes permission to examine, analy se,and verify  any records and 
reports that are important forthe evaluation of the study .
In this stud y a Risk Based Monitoring approach will be applied.
14Audits and Inspection s
Authorised personnel from Global Clinical Quality  Assurance at Lundbeck and quality  
assurance personn el from business partners may  audit the study  at an y time to assess 
compliance with the protocol and the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all other 
relevant regulations.
The patients must be informed that authorised personnel from Lundbeck may wish to review
their medical records. The investigator must be aware and the patients must be informed that 
representatives from regulatory  authorities may  also wish to inspect source data, such as 
medical records.
The investigator must notify  Lundbeck, without delay , of an announced inspection by  a 
regulatory  authority .
During audits and inspections, the investigator must permit direct access to all the source 
documents, including medical records and other documents pertinent to the study .
During audits and in spections, the auditors and inspectors may  copy relevant parts of medical 
records. No personal identification apart from the screening or randomisation number will 
appear on these copies.
Patient data will not be disclosed to unauthorised third parties, an d patient confidentiality  will 
be maintained at all times.
15Protocol Compliance
Lundbeck has a “no -waiver” policy , which means that permission will not be given to deviate 
from the protocol.
If deviations occur, the investigator must inform the CRA and they must review, discuss, and 
document the implications of the deviation.

Page 69of 8616Study Termination
Lundbeck or a pertinent regulatory  authorit y ma y terminate the study  or part of the study  at 
any time. The reasons for such action may  include, but are not limited to:
•safet y concerns
•proven lack of efficacy  of the IMP in other studies
If thestudy  is terminated or suspended, the investigator must promptly  inform the patients 
and ensure appropriate therapy  and follow -up. Furthermore, the investigator and/or sponsor 
must promptly  inform the IEC or IRB and provide a detailed written explanation. The 
pertinent regulatory  authorities must be informed in accordance with national regulations.
If the risk/benefit anal ysis change safter the termination of the study , the new eval uation must 
be provided to the IEC or IRBifit will have an impact on the planned follow -up of the 
patients who participated in the study . If so, the actions needed to protect the patients must be 
described.

described below .
18.2 Analysis Sets
•The following anal ysis sets will be used to anal yse and present the data:
all-patients- enrol led(APES) – all patients enrolled to the 4 -week Single -blind period 
(Phase A) who received at least one dose of IMP

full-analysis set Phase B (FAS) –all patients in the APTS who had a valid Baseline B 
assessment and at least one valid post -Baseline B assessment of the CDRS -R total score.
•The patients and data will be classified according to these definitions at a Classification 
Meeting held after all the data have been entered in the study  database and before the blind
has been broken.
•The efficacy anal ysis will be based on the FAS .

upper quartiles, minimum and maximum values) will be presented for continuous variables 
and counts and, if relevant, percentages will be presented for categorical variables.
18.4 Patient Disposition
Patient disposition will be summarised bytreatment group andinclude the number of patients 
who completed and the number of patients who w ithdrew from treatment , as well as the 
number of patients in each anal ysis set ( APES, APRS, APTS, andFAS) .
The number of patients who withdrew from treatment will be summarised by  treatment group

Page 72of 8618.5 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographics (sex, age, race), other baseline characteristics (height, weight andBMI ), and 
baseline efficacy  variables will be summarised by  treatment group. 
18.6 Recent and Concomitant Medication
Recent and concomitant medication will be summarised by  anatomical therapeutic chemical 
(ATC) code and generic drug name bytreatment group .
18.7 Exposu reand Compliance
Exposure and compliance will be calculated per patient and summarised by  treatment group .
18.8 Efficacy Analyses
18.8.1 General Efficacy Analysis Methodology
All the statistical tests of the efficacy  endpoints will be two- sided tests performed at the 5%
significance level and all confidence intervals (CIs) will be 95% CIs ,unless otherwise
specified.
18.8.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
For the primary  endpoint (change from Baseline B in the CDRS -R total score to Week 8 in 
phase B (Week 12)), comparisons of the pooled doses of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg/day  
versus placebo will be made using Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) with 
freely var ying mean and covariance structure and with country  as a fixed factor and Baseline 
B CDRS -R score as a covariate interacting with visit. Treatment (vortioxetine 10 mg/day , 
vortioxetine 20 mg/day , fluoxetine, and placebo) is included as a fixed factor interacting with 
visit. For the primary  endpoint a contrast test with weights 0.5, 0.5, 0, and - 1, respectivel y, to 
estimate the average effect of the pooled doses of vortioxetine against placebo, based on the 
LSMeans for the treatment by  visit interaction at Week 8 in phase B (Week 12). This will be 
evaluated at a two -sided 5% significance level. Subsequently  each vortio xetine dose will be 
tested separatel y against placebo using a two -sided 5% significance level. To adjust for 
multiplicity  a closed testing strategy  is applied where statistical significance can be claimed 
on the individual doses only  if significance is cla imed for the pooled vortioxetine doses .1
18.8.3 Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint will also be anal ysed using an anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA, OC 
and last observation carried forward [LOCF]) as sensitivity  anal ysis. The Missing at Random 
assumption behind the MMRM model will be investigated. This sensitivity  anal ysis will be 
performed with a) the same covariates and factors as the primary  anal ysis and b) with age, 
weight and height as covariates as well.

Page 73of 8618.8.4 Test ingStrategy
First the comparison of the pooled doses of vortioxetine to placebo will be tested at a two -
sided 5% significance level. Subsequently  each vortioxetine dose will be tested separatel y 
against placebo using a two -sided 5% significance level. To adjust for multiplicity  a closed 
testing strategy  is applied where statistical significance can be claimed on the individual doses 
only if significance is claimed for the pooled vortioxetine doses.1
18.8.5 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
For continuous endpoints, the same methodology  as the primary  anal ysis described for the 
primary  endpoint will be used. In addition ANCOVA will be performed (OC and L OCF).
For dichotomous endpoints, such as response and remission, logistic regression with 
treatment as a factor and the baseline score as a covariate will be used. This will be done 
based on OC, LOCF and NRI .
The potential treatment effect on cognitive dy sfunction will be separated into a direct effect 
and an indirect effect that is mediated through an improvement in depression. These effects 
will be estimated using two ANCOVA models. In the first model the change from baseline in 
SDMT (number of correct digits) is the dependent variable, while c hange from baseline 
CDRS -R total score is included as a covariate and treatment as a factor. This model gives an 
estimate of the direct effect. In the second ANCOVA model change from baseline CDRS -R 
total score is the dependent variable while treatment is a factor. Combining the estimated 
treatment effect in this model with the relation between CDRS-R and SDMT in the first 
model gives an estimate of the indirect effect. Finally , the estimated direct and indirect effects 
will be expressed as proportions of t he total effect. The anal yses are performed using change 
from Baseline B after 4 Weeks of treatment and after 8 weeks of treatment as endpoint, 
respectivel y. Also, both OC and LOCF are considered.  
18.8.6 Analysis of theExploratory Endpoints
For continuous endp oints, the same methodology  as the primary  anal ysis described for the 
primary  endpoint will be used. In addition ANCOVA will be performed (OC and L OCF).
18.9 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Sparse sampling (2 time points) for vortioxetine and fluoxetine quantification will be 
performed but population PK will be applied for vortioxetine only . Plasma concentrations of 
fluoxetine will be listed. The population PK of vortioxetine will be assessed by  means of 
nonlinear mixed effect modelling and the results from the anal ysis will be reported in a 
separate population PK report.

Page 74of 8618.10 Safety Analys es
18.10.1 Analysis of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified according to the time of onset of the adverse event:
•pre-treatment adverse event –an adverse event that starts onor after the date the patient 
signed the Informed Consent Form and prior to the date of first dose of IMP
•treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) – an adverse event that starts or increases in 
intensity  on or after the date of first dose of IMP. 
Adverse events, sorted by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, will be summarised 
by treatment group .
The safety  anal yses will be based on the APES and the APTS.
Adverse events will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Adverse events from Phase A 
will be reported separately  as will adverse events and other safety  endpoints from Phase B. 
Allocation of TEAEs to Treatment Periods
TEAEs may  be allocat ed into study  periods (these will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan ).
18.10.2 Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints
The clinical safet y laboratory  test values, vital signs, and ECG parameters will be summarised 
by treatment group. Potentially  clinicall y significant (PCS) values will be flagged and 
summarised.
- Adverse events, PAERS scores, clinical safet y laboratory  tests, vital signs, weight/BMI, 
ECG parameters, ph ysical examinations, GBI  scores (using the 10- item mania subscale), and 
C-SSRS scores will be summarised using descriptive statistics . Adverse events and other 
safet y endpoints will be reported separately fo r Phase A and Phase B .
18.11 Interim Analyses
No interim anal yses for efficacy  are planned. A DMC will monitor safety  data at regular 
intervals to be specified in the Dat a Monitoring Committee Charter.
To ensure that the stud y is sufficiently  powered an estima te of the variability  of the primary  
endpoint and the withdrawal rate will be obtained. The anal ysis will be performed after at
least 75% of the initially  planned randomis ed patients have either completed or withdrawn 
from the study  and will be based on bl inded and pooled data from all groups. Based on these 
estimates the power calculation will be updated and adequate actions will be taken if the stud y 
has lost power.

Page 75of 86Since all anal yses are done with blinded data, there is n o inflation of the Type 1 error rate and 
no alpha adjustment is necessary .
18.12 Sample Size and Power
Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 11 on the treatment comparisons for the primary  
endpoint and a withdrawal rate of 15 -20%, then randomising 120 patients per group and 
apply ing a closed t esting procedure to keep the overall significance level at 5% will provide a 
power of at least 85% for claiming significance of the pooled vortioxetine doses if both doses 
have an effect of 4 points at Week 8 in Phase B (Week 12).
The blinded sample size r eassessment will ensure that the power of at least 85% is maintained 
in the study .

Acute lysine administration to raise 2 -AAA  Version 1. 2 
Protocol #   02-14-2017  
4 
 Genetics: Variation in genes encoding enzymes in the lysine degradation pathway (indicated in 
boxes in Figure 2) may influence 2- AAA levels and downstream function. The strongest 
evidence thus far exists for DHTKD1 , variation in which has been associated with 2- Ketoadipic, 
2-Aminoadipic and 2 -Oxoadipic Aciduria8, 11, and Charcot -Marie -Tooth Disease12. DHTKD1  
expression correlates with ATP production in mitochondria in vitro , and siRNA knockdown of 
DHTKD1  leads to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and increased reactive oxygen species 
production, resulting in apoptosis and reduced cell growth13. Variation in mouse Dhtkd1  has 
been found to associate with expression of the gene (eQTL) and levels of protein (pQTL) in 
liver, as well as with serum 2 -AAA levels5. Liver Dhtkd1 expression correlated significantly with 
serum 2- AAA in these mice. Further, liver 2- AAA was n egatively associated with liver mass, 
fasting glucose and serum cholesterol while higher liver 2- AAA was associated with higher 
insulin sensitivity.  
 
2.0  Rationale and Specific Aims  
Diabetes is a major global health concern, associated with significantly  increased mortality and 
high incidence of co- morbidities. The lysine- derived metabolite α -aminoadipic acid (2- AAA) has 
been identified as a novel predictor of diabetes development in humans, identifying at -risk 
individuals before any detectable glucose abnormalities. There is exciting preliminary evidence 
supporting the role of 2 -AAA in development of diabetes, however it is not yet clear whether 2-
AAA is itself causal in diabetes development, or is a biomarker for altered metabolic processes, and many questions remain as to mechanisms of action. The aims of the study are designed to 
test feasibility of 2 -AAA manipulation in humans through acute lysine administration.  
 
Specific Aim : To determine whether acute lysine administration leads to increased 
plasma 2-AAA in humans. Catabolism of lysine leads to generation of 2- AAA. To address the 
hypothesis that acute lysine ingestion leads to increased circulating and excreted 2-AAA in 
humans in vivo , we will administer lysine (10g orally) to healthy volunteers (N=10), and measure 
the level of 2 -AAA in plasma and urine at baseline and serially post -ingestion.  
 Sub-Study Aim : To measure clearance and excretion of lysine and 2 -AAA using stable 
isotope tracer  
13C lysine (5g orally) . Carbon- 13 is a stable naturally occurring heavy isotope 
of carbon. Inclusion of a 13C label on lysine allows  for subsequent  differentiation between 
endogenous and exogenous lysine and 2- AAA for calculation of clearance and ex cretion of the 
lysine bolus.  
 
 
3.0  Animal Studies and Previous Human Studies  
The primary goal of this study is to raise circulating 2- AAA in humans. The effects of 2 -AAA 
administration have not been studied in humans, with no known studies of 2 -AAA 
supplementation in humans. However 2- AAA occurs naturally in the body, and has no known 
adverse effects at physiological levels. Increased dietary lysine in chickens resulted in increased 
2-AAA in muscle14, however the effect of lysine on 2- AAA in humans remains to be tested in 
healthy subjects. Older human studies have demonstrated an increase in 2- AAA following lysine 
administration in children with alpha- aminoadipic aciduria15, 16, a rare condition (< 1/1,000,000),

 with variable clinical phenotypes including intellectual disability, developmental delay, epilepsy, 
muscular hypotonia and ataxia8.Several studies have examined the effects of lysine 
supplementation, albeit without concurrent measurement of 2 -AAA. Acute lysine administration 
in healthy subjects led to increased plasma lysine, lower plasma glucose, a small increase in insulin area, and higher glucagon. When lysine was administered in conjunction with glucose, relative to glucose alone there was a 44% reduction in the 2.5 -h glucose area response, a 
diminished reduction in glucagon, but no change in insulin
17. In T2DM subjects, 
supplementation with essential amino acids or lysine for 2 months showed some evidence of a decrease in postprandial plasma glucose
18.Other studies have shown no effect on glucose 
tolerance19, fasting glucose20, or insulin sensitivity21. Other lysine supplementation studies have 
found variable effects on other biomarkers, including plasma lipids20, diarrhea morbidity, 
respiratory illness and CRP22, anxiety, cortisol and chromogranin-A23, and incidence of herpes 
simplex virus24-26. The stable isotope tracer 13C-lysine replaces 12C with 13C on the lysine 
molecule. Previous studies have used isotope labeled lysine to calculate amino acid flux27, 28. 
Consumption of baked beef as part of a test meal led to increased plasma 2- AAA when 
compared with a test meal including either baked or pickled herring29. Treatment of 
overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes with pioglitazone (45 mg/day) and metformin (1000 mg twice/day) led to a significant reduction in plasma 2- AAA 
and lysine, concurrent with an increase in insulin sensitivity
30. Acute insulin infusion (7 hrs) in 
these subjects also led to a decrease in both lysine and 2 -AAA30, 31. The epilepsy drug 
vigabatrin, which acts through GABA transaminase inhibition, leads to increased 2- AAA in 
plasma and urine, to levels similar to those seen in alpha- aminoadipic aciduria.32

5.0 Enrollment 
 
We will enroll 10 patients (N=5 male, N=5 female) who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
In the sub -study, we will enroll 2 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 The following recruitment approaches will be used:  Vanderbilt CTSA (VICTR) Research 
Notification Distribution List, the linked email system which reaches Vanderbilt faculty and staff, as well as members of the Middle Tennessee community,  and ResearchMatch, a national online 
registry maintained at Vanderbilt which allows people to self -register and express interest as 
research participants. In addition, we will contact lean subjects who had participated in our 
group’s prior research protocols and who had expressed interest in participating in future research studies.  Individuals who participate in the first study (using 10g lysine) who expressed 
interest in participating in future studies may be approached about participating in the sub -study 
for comparison purposes. Subjects may also be identified by means of prescreening the medical record, by the research coordinator.  
 
 
6.0 Study Procedures 
 
Screening  
Subjects will be screened via email and/or telephone. Informed consent will be obtained via 
telephone with a phone consent witness. After consent has been obtained, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility requirements. Subjects 
who meet the inclusion criteria, and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be invited to 
participate in the study.  Subjects who use protein or amino acid supplements but are willing to 
discontinue use for at least 1 week prior to the study may be included.  Additionally, all subjects 
will be instructed to discontinue use of over -the-counter medications, alcohol, and strenuous 
exercise on the day prior to the study visit.  
 Subjects will be requested to record their dietary intake of all foods and beverages on the day prior to the study visit  (see Diet Record Instructions, Appendix A) .  
 
 
Study Visit  
Subjects will be requested to arrive at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center  on the morning of 
the study visit (~8:00 AM) in a fasting state  (at least 8 hours,  with no food or  drink, excluding 
water ). After informed consent has been reviewed and documented, inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility requirements. Subject’s 
medical history and medications will be discussed and documented by study personnel to 
assess for any changes that may potentially exclude the subject from participating. Study

 personnel  will collect the subject’s vital signs, height and weight  prior to study interventions . All 
subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample for baseline 2 -AAA measurement  and will 
undergo a urine pregnancy test (if the woman is of child- bearing potential) .  
 
Following the baseline urine sample, an intravenous line will be inserted into a superficial peripheral vein to perform blood draws.  Subjects will be asked to remain in a seated position for 
the duration of the study, but will be permitted to walk for brief periods throughout the study (e.g. 
to use the restroom).  A baseline blood draw will be taken ( time = 0 hr ) for measurement of 
baseline plasma 2 -AAA levels and related amino acids and metabolites (e.g. lysine, kynurenic 
acid).Immediately following the  baseline blood draw, subjects will be given an oral bolus of L -
lysine (10g) (Ajinomot o USA Inc, Raleigh, NC) in 100ml water . This is an amount of lysine 
equivalent to that which is found in a 10oz serving of beef. A similar dose of lysine has 
previously been shown to alter the response to glucose
17. Blood samples will be taken at  time = 
30 minutes  1, 2, 3, and 4 hrs post -lysine  administration. Normal (0.9%) Saline (NS) will be 
infused at a rate of 10 ml/hr to flush the canula prior to each blood draw, and a 5ml blood 
discard will be performed prior to each collection of samples .  Each blood draw (including 
baseline) will collect  about 20cc of blood, for a total collection of 120cc , or approximately 8 
tablespoons of blood. Blood will be collected into one tube for serum (5ml) and 2 tubes for 
plasma (4ml each). Urine samples will be collected throughout the visit , in 2-hour increments (0-
2 and 2 -4 hrs post -lysine). Although the timing of plasma 2- AAA increases post -lysine have 
never been measured, peak post -prandial plasma 2- AAA levels are expected to be observed 
~3hours post -lysine29. Plasma will be prepared from blood samples, and both plasma and urine 
aliquots will be frozen at -80°C and stored prior to analysis. Plasma and urine samples will be 
prepared for metabolite measurement by methanol extraction and centrifugation in Dr. 
Ferguson’s laboratory using standard protocols33. 2-AAA and other metabolites and biomarkers 
(e.g. lysine, creatinine) will be measured at Vanderbilt core facilities (e.g. Mass Spectrometry 
core) .  
 
Compensation  
Subjects will receive $150 following successful completion of the study visit.  
 
Biomarkers  
Blood and urine samples will be coded for subject confidentiality. Measurements of interest will be performed at Vanderbilt University. For possible future investigations, excess blood and urine samples will be frozen and stored in Dr. Ferguson’s laborator y.  
 
6.1 Sub- Study Procedures – Lysine Tracer  
Screening  
Of subjects who successfully completed the primary study, w e will invite two individuals to return 
for a second visit. If we are unable to recruit  from our original enrollees, we will recruit from 
within the original pool of interested volunteers or from participants who expressed interest in 
our future studies , using the same screening procedures described above.  Subjects will be

 asked about any changes in their health and medications that have occurred since their 
participation in the lysine study.  
 
Study Visit  
Subjects will be requested to arrive at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center on the morning of 
the sub -study visit (~8:00 AM) in a fasting state  (at least 8 hours, with no food or drink, 
excluding water ). After informed consent has been reviewed and documented, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility 
requirements. Subject’s medical history and medications will be discussed and documented by 
study personnel to assess for any changes that may potentially exclude the subject from 
participating . Study personnel will collect the subject’s vital signs, height and weight prior to 
study  interventions.  All subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample for baseline 2- AAA 
measurement  and will undergo a urine pregnancy test (if the woman is of child- bearing 
potential) .  
 Following the baseline urine sample, an intravenous line will be inserted into a superficial peripheral vein to perform blood draws.  Subjects will be asked to remain in a seated position for 
the duration of the study, but will be permitted to walk for brief periods throughout the study (e.g. 
to use the restroom). A baseline blood draw will be taken ( time = 0 hr ) for measurement of 
baseline plasma 2 -AAA levels and related amino acids and metabolites (e.g. lysine, kynurenic 
acid).Immediately following the baseline blood draw, subjects will be given an oral bolus of  
13C 
L-lysine (5 g) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury,  MA) in 50ml water . This is an 
amount of lysine equivalent to that which is found in a 5oz serving of beef. Blood samples will 
be taken at time = 30 minutes 1, 2, 3,  4, 5 and 6 hrs post -lysine  administration . Normal (0.9%) 
Saline (NS) will be infused at a rate of approximately 10 ml/hr to flush the canula prior to each 
blood draw, and a 5ml blood discard will be performed prior to each collection of samples.  Each 
blood draw (including baseline) will collect about 20cc of blood, for a total collection of about 
160cc, or approximately 11 tablespoons of blood. After a 3 -5ml discard, blood will be collected 
into one tube for serum (5ml) and 2 tubes for plasma (4ml each). Urine samples will be collected throughout the visit,  in 2-hour increments (0- 2, 2-4, and 4-6 hrs post -lysine). Plasma will be 
prepared from blood samples, and both plasma and urine aliquots will be frozen at -80°C and 
stored prior to analysis. Plasma and urine samples will be prepared for metabolite measurement 
by methanol extraction and centrifugation in Dr. Ferguson’s laboratory using standard protocols
33. 2-AAA and other metabolites and biomarkers (e.g. lysine, creatinine) will be 
measur ed at Vanderbilt core facilities (e.g. Mass Spectrometry core) .

Biomarkers  
Blood and urine samples will be coded for subject confidentiality. Measurements of interest will 
be performed at Vanderbilt University. For possible future investigations, excess blood and urine 
samples will be frozen and stored in Dr. Ferguson’s laboratory.

7.0 Risks of Investigational Agents  
Lysine Administration: Lysine is expected to be  well-tolerated  by all participants. Lysine is used 
as a dietary supplement, available over the counter, with no known long -term risks. There are 
no additional risks associated with the use of stable isotope tracer 13C lysine. The proposed 
dose of lysine may cause mild gastrointestinal upset in some subjects. This is expected to be 
minor  and transient.  
 
Venous Blood draw:  This is a routine procedure that is considered standard of care in clinical 
medicine. At the study visit, subjects will undergo venous blood draws. All blood draws will be 
performed by trained personnel using universal precautions to protect both the subject and personnel. The risks to subjects are minimal, but may include pain, allergic reaction, infection or bleeding at the needle stick site. These usually resolve without  any specific medical therapy 
over the course of minutes to days.  
 
Private Health Information:  This information will be collected during the course of the study. 
However, only key study personnel will have access to this information, which will be stored i n a 
HIPAA compliant, password protected REDCap database. No protected health information will be shared with employers, insurers, or non -research personnel  
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
Adverse events will be reported to the IRB per Vanderbilt University IRB policy.

 9.0  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and should notify study personnel if they wish 
to withdraw from the study. Subjects may request their biological samples to be destroyed at 
any time. However, any data or biological samples that have already been used for research cannot be destroyed. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator (possible reasons listed below). Subjects will receive financial compensation for 
completion of the visit.  
 
Possible reasons for withdrawal/discontinuation from study include, but are not limited to:  
• Noncompliance with treatment or procedures  
• Decision by participant/participant withdraws consent  
• Significant adverse event deemed by investigator to preclude continued participation  
  
10.0  Statistical Considerations 
Given the pilot nature of this proposal, the primary goal is to detect whether there is a 
measureable increase in 2- AAA in plasma or urine following lysine administration.  
 Based on preliminary analyses in a separate study (N=120 healthy individuals), we expect a mean baseline 2 -AAA of 0.00299 with a standard deviation of 0.0025 (arbitrary units  based on 
mass spec measurements). Accounting for this between- subject variability, in order to detect a 
significant change in 2- AAA post -lysine, we will require a mean post -lysine 2 -AAA concentration 
of 0.0055 (at 80% power, α=0.05). We expect the actual increase to be larger than this, and 
thus expect to be well -powered to detect a difference in this pilot sample. Although  no data exist 
for the expected change in 2 -AAA,  a dietary study measuring 2 -AAA following protein -rich meals 
reported a considerable post -prandial increase in 2- AAA (e.g. > 10 fold increase)
29. 
 The change in 2- AAA will be analyzed both as the overall area under the curve, and as the 
change from baseline to each subsequent timepoint (analyzed by paired T tests).

 11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
Strict confidentiality will be maintained to the fullest extent by the research team, including 
keeping all data in a secure location. All specimens will be coded after they are obtained and 
the code key kept in a secure location.  Blood samples will be coded anonymously to remain 
confidential and identifiers will be kept in a separate, secure location.   Samples may be shared with third parties outside of Vanderbilt for future testi ng but will remain anonymous to the 
recipient.  Subjects may contact the principal investigator at any time to request that samples be 
destroyed.  
12.0 Follow -up and Record Retention  
Anticipated study duration is 1-2 years. Research data will be maintained by the PI after study 
closure. After study closure, research data will be maintained for a minimum of 6 years and 
possibly indefinitely. Data will be stored on the Vanderbilt University computer network in a 
password- protected database. Only members of the study team will have access. Pertinent 
paper documentation will be kept in a locked office and only study personnel will have access. 
Only personnel directly involved with the study will have access to source data and the electronic database.

Diet Record Instructions 
 
You will need to write down ALL food and beverages consumed on the assigned day.  Please 
take the diet record wi th you all day during the day  you are recording intake and record items at 
the same time you consume any food or beverage.  There are four columns that need to include 
information about a food or beverage you consume:  Time, Food/beverage, Amount, and 
Description/Preparation.   
 
Time :  List the time you consumed each food or beverage  
 
Food/Beverage:  Write down the name of the food or beverage.  Use brand names (e.g. Burger 
King, Big Mac, Lean Cuisine) whenever possible.  Remember to list all additions to foods and 
beverages such as cream, sugar, butter, jelly, lemon, ketchup, etc.  For mixed dishes (e.g. pizza, casseroles, etc) list each food item and try to include the amount for each item.  If you 
use a recipe,  divide the total amount used by the number of servings you had.  For example, if 
you used .5 lb of 85% lean ground beef to make a meat loaf that made 4 servings and you had 
1 serving, the total amount of group beef you should include is 1/8 of a pound.  Or if possible, you may provide the recipe and list what proportion of the entire recipe you ate.   
 Amount :  List the amount eaten or drank in ounces (oz), teaspoons (tsp), tablespoons (tbsp), 
cups (c) or in units such as 1 slice of whole wheat bread, or 1  orange.  When listing meats, list 
for cooked amounts.  
 
Description/Preparation:   Describe methods used to prepare food or beverages (ex:  baked, 
grilled).  Include any oil or other products used in the preparing of food (e.g. 1 tsp olive oil to 
sauté vegetables).  Include brand names or fast -food and restaurant names when possible 
 
Reminders List :  Please use this list to remind you to include all food and drink that you 
consume.  
 
1. Record all snacks you ate during each day.  
 
2. Record all beverages such as coffee, tea, water, milk, soda pop, juice, alcohol, etc.

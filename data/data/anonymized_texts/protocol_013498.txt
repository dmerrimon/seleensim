SCHEMA 
 
DoxyPEP: Prospective, randomized, open -label, clinical trial to evaluate the impact of doxycycline post -
exposure prophylaxis on the occur rence of bacterial STIs among men who have sex with men (MSM) and 
transgender women (TGW) PrEP users and people living with HIV  
 
 
Design:  Open- label randomized clinical trial of doxycyline PEP to reduce bacterial STIs (N. 
gonorrheae [GC], C. trachomatis [CT ], and T. pallidum [syphilis]) among MSM and 
transgender women (TGW) living with HIV (PLWH) or on HIV  PrEP.  
 
Study Population: S ample size of 780, approximately equal numbers of PLWH and participants taking HIV pre -
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  
 
Study Sites:  
1. HIV/AIDS Clinic (“Ward 86”), Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, UCSF, San 
Francisco  
2. San Francisco City Clinic, San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco 
(municipal STD  clinic)  
3. Madison HIV/AIDS Clinic, Harborview Medical Center University of Washington,  Seattle  
4. Public Health -Seattle & King County Sexual Health Clinic at Harborview Medical Center,  
Seattle  
 
Primary Study Objectives:  
1. Evaluate the effectiveness of doxycycline post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce 
STI infections in two populations: a) MSM living with HIV and b) MSM/TGW taking HIV 
PrEP 
2. Investigate the impact  of doxycycline  PEP on development  of culture -based  tetracycl ine 
(TCN) resistance in N. gonorrheae and among nasopharyngeal carriers of S. aureus  
 
Secondary Study Objectives:  
1. Assess the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of doxycycline PEP 
2. Investigate the impact of doxycycline PEP  on detection of culture and molecular 
markers of tetracycline (TCN) resistance in C. trachomatis (CT), and T. pallidum  
(syphilis - molecular markers only ) 
3. Evaluate the development  of phenotypic  tetracycline  resistance  among oropharyngeal 
carriers of commensal Neisseria  species  
4. Measure the proportion of sex acts which are covered by doxycycline PEP 
5. Assess the effect of doxycycline PEP on the gut resistome through measuring the 
abundance of tetracycline resistance genes in  stool of  a subset of 50 MSM living with 
HIV and 50 MSM/TGW on PrEP assigned to receive doxycycline PEP as well as rectal 
swabs from all participants, stored for future evaluation 
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
1. Evaluate the diversity of the gut microbiome and quantity and breadth of  drug 
resistance genes in participants on doxycycline PEP and not on  PEP 
2. Assess the association between meningococcal vaccination and incident GC  infection  
3. Evaluate the incidence of nongonococcal, nonchlamydial urethritis and the proportion 
of urethritis  in which Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is  detected  
4. Assess the rate of detection of Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) in urine in each arm and 
the presence of tetracycline and other antimicrobial resistance in MG in each arm.

 5. Evaluate association of doxycycline use with weight change over  time 
6. Evaluate whether doxycycline PEP is associated with PrEP  persistence and HIV 
virologic suppression by comparison of arms and within the doxycycline PEP arm by 
adherence to doxycycline PEP.  
7. Evaluate the incidence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in those diagnosed 
with rectal chlamydia in each arm 
 
 
Approach:  Eligible  participants  randomized to receive  PEP will receive open- label  doxycycline  200 mg 
to be taken ideally  within  24 hours  but no later than 72 hours  after each condomless  sexual 
contact (receptive anal, insertive anal, vaginal, or oral, or use of shar ed sex toys). No more 
than 200 mg will be taken in each 24 hour period. Sexual activity and doxycycline PEP 
usage will be recorded using a smartphone application and asses sment at study visits. At 
enrollment and quarterly for 12 months of follow -up, GC and  CT testing will be conducted 
on samples from the oropharynx, rectum and urine and a blood specimen for syphilis 
serology will be collected. Resistance testing will be conducted on specimens that test 
positive for GC using phenotypic methods, and molecular  techniques for CT and syphilis 
(for syphilis, DNA obtained from mucosal or lesional swabs). Nares and pharyngeal swabs 
will be obtained to evaluate tetracycline resistance among nasopharyngeal carriers of S. 
aureus and commensal Neisseria species (oropharyngeal swab only). Stool samples from 
50 MSM/TGW living with HIV and 50 MSM/TGW on PrEP in the doxycycline PEP arm at 3 
time points will undergo  metagenomic  sequencing for tetracycline resistance genes.  Rectal  
swabs  from all participants who consent will be archived for future evaluation of the enteric 
microbiome and resistome, as well as for presence of  MG.

 1 BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
 
1.1 Background 
The incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) continues to increase in the US, with more than 2 
million diagnoses of syphilis, gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) in 2016.2 This STI epidemic is occurring 
globally and is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), 
including those living  with and without  HIV. In the US, MSM  accounted  for 81% of syphilis  infections  in 2016 and 
38% of gonorrhea cases; the latter represents a nearly 10 -fold increase since 1989. 2 CT is also increasing 
among MSM, with rectal chlamydia rates of 17% and the highest rates of CT diagnosed in STI clinics in MSM ≥ 25 years old.
2 Both MSM living with HIV and MSM without HIV infection on PrEP have ver y high bacterial STI 
incidence, reaching or exceeding 50% new STI diagnoses per year .3, 4 
 
Increasing STI rates have been associated with a rise in serious morbidity, including blindness secondary to 
syphilitic ocular complications.5 Congenital syphilis rates have increased 28% in the past few years;6 it is likely 
that some of this increase comes from ‘bridging’ from MSM to heterosexual populations.7 Distressingly, drug - 
resistant  GC continues  to rise globally8-10 and in the US,11 leading to limited  oral treatment  options;  recent  cases 
of highly -resistant GC in the UK and Australia required treatment with ertapenem.12, 13 Untreated STIs increase 
the risk of HIV transmission from individuals with HIV infection who are not virologi cally suppressed,14, 15 as 
occurs in nearly half of those living with HIV nationwide.16 With the recent CDC -endorsed “U=U” campaign (i.e., 
undetectable=untransmitt able) ,17 condom  use may further  decrease  among  persons  with HIV infection,  and may 
impact  ‘serosorting’  in selection of sexual  partners  and decisions  to use condoms.  Accordingly,  there  is an urgent 
need for innovative,  effective, and acceptable interventions  to halt the rise in syphilis,  GC, and CT among MSM 
and TGW living with and at -risk for HIV infection.  
 
One potential STI control strategy for these high- risk populations is post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 
with doxycycline. Antibiotic prophylaxis against STIs is not a new concept; minocycline was used as PEP for 
GC in the US Navy in the 1940s and showed transient benefits with no clinical harms, but the rapid emergence 
of tetracycline resistance prevented uptake of this approach as a public health strategy 18 A systematic review of 
presumptive periodic treatment of sex workers s howed overall 50% reductions in GC and CT without risk 
compensation or increased AMR,  and this approach is recommended for populations  with high baseline GC and 
CT prevalence 19. The rationale for STI prophylaxis  among MSM  and TGW  is similar,  given the high prevalence 
and incidence of bacterial STIs among MSM living with HIV and MSM on PrEP. An effective STI prophylaxis 
strategy could augment frequent STI screening, partner notification and other efforts to reduce STI acquis ition 
and transmission among  MSM.

 Doxycycline has good tolerability, high bioavailability with oral 
dosing, a 20 hour half -life, and excellent tissue penetration. 
Doxycycline is a first line treatment for CT with very high efficacy 
(97-100%). Doxycycline is used to treat syphilis for persons with 
penicillin  allergy.  Notably,  CT and syphi lis have  not developed  TCN 
resistance in spite of  decades of doxycycline use to treat these 
infections. Doxycycline is not recommended for GC treatment due 
to baseline resistance and increased TCN resistance will not affect 
GC management.  
 
The IPERGAY study demonstrated efficacy of single dose 
doxycyclin e PEP after condomless sex among 232 HIV -negative 
MSM taking event -driven PrEP in France.20 Doxycycline PEP 
resulted in a 47% relative  reduction in new bacterial  STIs (GC,  CT, 
or syphilis) over 8.7 months of follow -up (45.9 v s. 79.6 per 100 
person- years in those assigned to doxycycline PEP vs. no PEP 
control, respectively; Figure 1A . Doxycycline PEP reduced the  
incidence of CT and syphilis,  but not GC (Figure 1B-D), which was 
not surprising given doxycycline resistance in >50% of GC strains 
in France. MSM in IPERGAY had a median age of 38 years, were 
highly educated, majority Caucasian, and highly adherent to event -
driven HIV PrEP. MSM in the doxycycline arm in IPE RGAY took a 
median of 680 mg of doxycycline per month. Adverse events were 
rare and there was no difference in self -reported  sexual  behavior  
between MSM  in the two study  arms.  
 
Limitations  of generalizability  from the IPERGAY  study  include that 
the sample was small  (n=232),  and in contrast  to MSM  in the US 
heavily  impacted by STIs,  MSM  were  older  (median age 38), highly  educated,  and majority  Caucasian. In addition,  
with respect  to adherence to event -driven  doxycycline  PEP,  MSM  in the IPERGAY study  were  highly adherent  to 
event -driven  HIV PrEP  and were  already  ‘cueing’  their TDF-FTC (Truvada) PrEP dosing to their sexual  activity. 
Importantly, uptake and adherence to doxycycline PEP among daily PrEP users are unknown. Additionally, 
IPERGAY did not conduct detailed measurements of the pattern of doxycycline use with sexual practices nor 
evaluate for antibiotic resistance as sociated with intermittent doxycycline use. Doxycycline PEP may be more 
efficacious  for reducing GC incidence  in the US than in Europe,  due to lower  GC TCN resistance  in the US (25% 
vs 55% respectively).11, 20 PEP may also be more  effective  to prevent  GC at non-pharyngeal  sites,  as evidenced 
by the lack of an observed effect on pharyngeal GC incidence,  whereas there was a trend toward reduction in 
rectal and urethral GC infections  with doxycycline PEP in IPERGAY.21 
 
A small study piloted daily doxycycline among 30 MSM living with HIV with a history of syphilis, and showed a 
73% reduction in composite STIs,  without  power  to assess individual  STIs.22 The greater  risk of side effects  and 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with daily dosing of doxycycline have dampened enthusiasm for daily dosing of 
doxycycline as PrEP against STIs. Event -driven doxycycline PEP has not been s tudied in MSM living with  HIV. 
 
Significant scientific knowledge gaps remain about on- demand STI doxycycline PEP in PrEP users and 
MSM living with HIV . MSM in IPERGAY were already ‘cueing’ their Truvada PrEP dosing to sexual activity; 
PEP adherence in daily PrEP users  is unknown.  IPERGAY did not conduct  detailed measurements  of the pattern 
of doxycycline  use with sexual  practices  nor report  antibiotic  resistance associated with intermittent  doxycycline 
use. Doxycycline  PEP may be more  efficacious  for reducing GC incidence in the US than in Europe,  due to lower 
TCN resistance in GC the US (30%  vs 55% respectively) .11, 20 PEP may also be more  effective  to prevent  GC at 
non-pharyngeal sites; there was a trend toward reduction in rectal and urethral infections with doxycycline PEP 
in IPERGAY.21 Notably,  based on the IPERGAY demonstration  of efficacy  with doxycycline  PEP,  providers  have  
Figure 1. IPERGAY Study: Time to first STI (panel a), GC 
infection (panel b), CT infection (panel c), and syphilis 
infection (panel d) 1

10  
 begun to prescribe doxycycline PEP to reduce incident STIs in MSM without a confirmatory study or normative 
guidance. Moreover, the balance of benefits and risks of doxycycline PEP need to be carefully studied in MSM 
living with HIV as well as in PrEP users in a study powered to assess effectiveness for each population. The 
relative benefits and risks of doxycycline PEP may differ in MSM living with HIV and PrEP users due to 
differences in adherence, sexual practices, potential risk compensation, sexual networks, and/or pre- existing 
antibiotic resistance due to higher prior antibiotic exposure among MSM living with HIV.  
 
In summary, a sufficiently -powered, high- quality study is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
doxycycline  PEP in populations  both with and without  HIV infection,  and to evaluate  its impact  on drug 
resistance in target bacterial STIs and resident bacterial microbiota. There is a public health need and 
sufficient clinical equipoise to conduct an effectiveness study of doxycycline PEP as an STI reduction strategy 
for a diverse population of MSM in the US to address the following key scientific questions: 1) Effectiveness of 
doxycycline PEP for bacterial STI prevention in MSM and TGW on PrEP,  2) Effectiveness of doxycycline PEP  
in MSM and TGW living with HIV ; 3) Differential tolerability and impact on antimicrobial resistance between  
MSM/TGW  living  with HIV and MSM/TGW  on PrEP; 4) TCN resistance  in GC, CT and syphilis,  5) TCN resistance  
in commensal  Neisseria  (which  can transfer  TCN resistance)  and potentially  pathogenic  Staph  Aureus  in carriers,  
and 6) effect on the gut resistome  in terms of changes in TCN resistance  genes . 
 
 
1.2 Rationale  
The overall  goal of this study  is to understand the effectiveness  of doxycycline  PEP on reducing STIs in MSM 
and TGW populations at high risk for STI acquisition and to evaluate its impact on antibiotic  resistance.  
 
1.2.1  Doxycycline  Safety  
Several features of doxycycline make it an optimal choice for STI PEP. Doxycycline has been used safely and 
for extended durations as prophylaxis against infections such as malaria23 and for non -infectious conditions 
including rosacea24 and acne vulgaris .25 Doxycycline  is generally  safe and well-tolerated when  used  chronically. 
Side effects  include mild gastrointestinal  symptoms,  photosensitivity,  and rarely  pill esophagitis  and pseudotumor 
cerebri .26 Reassuringly, doxycycline has a much lower risk than other antibiotics for the antibiotic -associated 
diarrhea caused by C. difficile infection,27, 28 and may even exert a protective effect against C. difficile.29, 30 
Doxycycline  is a scalable PEP intervention,  as it is generic,  inexpensive,  and widely  available.  Doxycycline  does 
not require dose adjustment in hepatic or renal failure, including dialysis. In the IPERGAY doxycycline PEP study, 
there was no difference in grade 3 or 4 adve rse events between the study arms. As anticipated, there were more 
gastrointestinal side effects in those on PEP (25%) vs. the non -PEP control arm (14%). Discontinuation of 
doxycycline was uncommon with 8  study participants (7%) stopping doxycycyline due t o side effects attributed 
to doxycycline, the majority of which were gastrointestinal.1 Given the safety profile of doxycycline and the 
enrollment of participants receiving ongoing clinical care for HIV or HIV PrEP, study -specific monitoring will be 
limited  to complete  blood count  and liver function tests  at months  3 and 9 to assess for hematologic  and hepatic 
toxicity,  which  occur  rarely  with chronic  doxycycline  use (<1%).  Assessment  for side effects  (eg., pill esophagitis, 
photosensitivity, new onset headaches), with clinical and laboratory testing if indicated if potential serious 
adverse events are suspected. Participants will receive standard of care monitoring through their HIV or PrEP. 
Typical  standard  of care monitoring  for PLHIV  includes  semi -annual  viral load monitoring,  renal  and liver function 
tests, and annual CBC. Typical standard of care monitoring for PrEP patients includes quarterly HIV tests and 
semi -annual or annual renal  monitoring.  
 
1.2.2  Rationale f or single dose doxycycline as STI  PEP.  
A concern about  a single  post-sex dose of doxycycline  is the long in vivo doubling time of syphilis  (approximately 
30-33 hours)31, 32, which is the rationale for treatment of early syphilis with long- acting IM penicillin or oral 
doxycycline for 14 days. However, the incubation time for syphilis is 10- 90 days,33and doxycycline PEP 
administered within 72 hours of exposure may deliver sufficient chemoprophylaxis to abort primary infection. 
Notably,  in IPERGAY,  a 73% reduction in syphilis  incidence was observed with single  dose  doxycycline.1 In 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
11  
 addition, single dose doxycycline PEP has been shown to be effective for Lyme disease34 and leptospirosis 35, 36 
– spirochetal  diseases  that also have slow doubling times.35, 37 An alternative approach is doxycycline  PrEP (i.e., 
daily dosing).22 However, daily doxycycline PrEP may have a higher frequency of intolerability due to side effects, 
selection of antimicrobial resistance through higher exposure, and greater costs than doxycycline PEP. 
Importantly, MSM in IPERGAY demonstrated their ability  to effectively adhere to peri -coital Truvada PrEP and 
post-coital doxycycline PEP.  
 
1.2.3  Potential for drug  resistance  
An important consideration with intermittent doxycycline use for STI prophylaxis is selection of drug resistance, 
in both target bacterial STI pathogens as well as in microbiota which are potential pathogens or possible 
reservoirs  of antimicrobial  resistance,  such  as S. aureus  and commensal  Neisseria  species.  GC has sequentially 
developed resistance to antibiotics in multiple classes, including those previously or currently recommended for 
treatment. Rates of TCN -resistance in GC in the US are 25% -38% in studies of MSM,11 compared with >50%  in  
Europe.20 Doxycycline  is not currently  recommended as treatment  for GC. IPERGAY has not reported on TCN 
resistance in GC and did not address AMR in other bacterial such as S. aureus and commensal Neisseria 
species. Doxycycline is commonly used to treat CT and syphilis, and there have been no documented cases of 
TCN- resistant  CT or syphilis.  However,  TCN resistance from single  point  mutations  has been reported in related 
organisms such as Chlamydia suis38, 39 and Brachyspira spp .40 in antibiotic -exposed pigs, suggesting that 
development of TCN resistance could evolve (or be acquired from a resistant organism such as E. coli 41). 
Azithromycin -resistant Treponema pallidum emerged from a single mutation42 and rapidly became widespread 
in the US west coast and globally,43 serving as a cautionary  tale. 
 
Repeated antibiotic exposure can foster drug resistance in the normal commensal flora of the body and impact 
the composition of gut microbiome. The effect of doxycycline use on S. aureus is an important consideration, 
given that ∼ 30% of the population are S aureus carriers .44 AMR is concerning for community -based MRSA 
infections, for which doxycycline is sometimes used as an alternative to sulfa drugs .45 Similarly, doxycycline 
exposure could also drive development of TCN resistance in commensal Neisseria species, serving as a 
reservoir that potentially can transfer resistance to GC. Antibiotics affect the larger microbiome, with decreased 
diversity of gut flora and shifts in the predominant species, which may fuel a “dysbiotic” environment and may 
contribute to inflammation and complications such as C. difficile.46-48 In sum, a comprehensive assessment of 
doxycycline PEP is needed, including public health benefits, safety, tolerability, adherence, and AMR among 
bacterial  STIs and organisms  that may can be pathogenic  (e.g. S. aureus  among carriers)  or transfer  resistance 
to GC (e.g., from commensal  Neisseria ). 
 
1.2.4  Rationale for evaluation of meningococcal vaccination status  
A recent  report  from New  Zealand suggests  that vaccination with an outer  membrane- based Group  B Neisseria 
meningitidis  vaccine  is associated with a reduced  risk of gonorrhea in adolescents  and adults  aged 15-30 years 
of age; the estimated effectiveness of the OMV meningococcal vaccine against gonococcal infection to be 33% 
[ NZ OMV is part of the composition of the 4CMenB vaccine, commercially distributed as BEXSERO49 (GSK). It 
is not known if other meningococ cal vaccines are associated with a similar decrease in GC infections. 
Meningococcal vaccination (Serogroup A/C/W/Y) is currently recommended by the ACIP for all PLWH and 
serogroup B vaccination is a consideration for adolescents and young adults50. Meningococcal vaccine status 
will be recorded, with the type of vaccine if known, to evaluate for a potential association of vaccination with 
decreased GC  rates.

 1.2.5  Rationale for evaluation of nongonoccal urethritis (NGU) and Mycoplasma genitalium  (MG) 
Mycoplasma genitalium  is a frequent  cause  of urethritis  in men .51 MG can be detected with nucleic  acid testing; 
however, many public health programs do not routinely test for MG and instead treat  non-gonoccocal urethritis 
(NGU) empirically.52 While azithromycin is superior to doxycycline for treatment of MG, 53, 54 doxycycline does 
have activity  against  MG and use of doxycycline  PEP may potentially  impact  the prevalence of MG, the incidence 
of MG -associated urethritis and the syndrome of NGU. Therefore, urine will be collected every three months to 
look for the presence of asymptomatic  MG as well as at the time of urethral  symptoms,  to evaluate for MG as 
the etiology of urethritis .53, 54 Specimens with MG detected will be stored for future analysis of resistance to 
tetracycline and other antimicrobials.  
 
1.2.6  Rationale for evaluation of longitudinal weight  change  
Tetracyclines have been associated with weight gain in mice,55 as well as in individuals taking tetracycline-  
based combination t herapy for Q fever56 and for Helicobacter pylori.57, 58 Therefore, participants in both arms 
will have weight evaluated at regular intervals to evaluate for pos sible weight gain  
 
1.2.7  Impact of COVID -19 on study conduct  
Study enrollment and the majority of in- person study evaluations were halted in March 2020 due to the COVID - 
19 pandemic and the hold on clinical research required by the participating institutions. As  a result, patients 
enrolled 3/2020 or earlier were unable to undergo regular ascertainment for the STI endpoint during the following 
months. Given the need for full endpoint ascertainment and acknowledging potential changes in sexual behavior 
during the C OVID pandemic, participants enrolled 3/2020 and earlier will be offered a full 12 months of follow up 
at the time of resumption of follow up after COVID restrictions are lifted. Those who decline a 12 month follow 
up will be discontinued. The team will monitor discontinuation rates in this pre- COVID cohort. If there is a 
differential discontinuation in the active vs. control arm, this will be di scussed with DSMB and the team statistician 
with consideration of additional enrollments to ensure adequate pow er for the primary  endpoint  
 
As COVID may continue to impact research activity in the future, the study will allow for electronic consenting as an option, and shipment of doxycycline to participant homes, if necessary and if acceptable to study 
participant s. In-person visits will be preferred when feasible to allow for STI testing, research labs, and pill 
counts. Home collection of STI testing may be considered, as long as there is sufficient data to support the 
testing platforms for use in home collection,  particularly in terms of syphilis testing.  
 
1.2.8  Early closure by the DSMB  and revision to study conduct   
Enrollment into t he DoxyPEP study was stopped early on 5/13/2022 , as a  prespecified  interim data analysis 
demonstrated  that the study  had cross ed pre-specified effectiveness  thresholds . At the time of interimr review 
of  554 participants enrolled,  a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline taken after condomless sex significantly 
reduced the acquisition of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) and 
transgender women (TGW ).  The e ffectiveness of doxycycline PEP  was observed and statistically significant 
both in the cohort of participants living with HIV and the cohort of participants  without HIV who were taking 
PrEP. The strategy of doxyPEP was safe and well -tolerated, with no doxycycline- associated Grade 2 or higher 
adverse events and no doxycycline -associated serious adverse events.  
 
Enrolled participants will be notified of the study early closure and of the finding of doxyc ycline effectiveness  
to reduce STIs. They will also be informed that the impact of doxycycline PEP on antimicrobial resistance in 
STIs, S. aureus , commensal Neisseria  and the gut microbiome is still under investigat ion. This protocol  
modification amends the study to  offer doxycycline to enrolled participants assigned to the standard of care 
arm for the remainder of their 12 month participation. Participants who roll ov er from the control arm  into the 
active doxy cycline PEP arm will undergo  the same  evaluations as specified for  the active arm (e.g., safety 
labs) per the schedule of events and will continue with quarterly study visit s through month 12 . At the time of 
roll over onto active doxycycline PEP, a rectal swab to establish the microbiome baseline prior to starting 
doxycycline will be collected.   Participants who decline to roll over into the active doxycycline arm will have the 
option of remaining on study through  month 12 following the standard of care arm schedule of events . All 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
13  
 participants will review and sign a revised informed consent at the time of their next study visit to consent to 
continuation in the study and to receive doxycycline, for those in control  arm who chose to roll over to active 
doxyPEP.  
 
The goal of continued follow -up through Month 12 of enrolled participants receiving doxy cycline PEP is to 
obtain additional  data on the tolerability and acceptability of doxy cycline PEP and the impact of intermittent 
doxy cycline PEP on an timicrobial resistance and the gut microbiome. This information is critical for 
understanding the risk/benefit profile of doxycycline PEP and to inform  guidelines about the doxyPEP strategy 
which will be  considered both by individuals , providers,  and public health authorities.  
 
 
2 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Design: The overarching goal is to assess the effectiveness of doxycycline PEP on incidence of STIs and 
tetracycline resistance among STIs and commensal bacteria to inform public health policy. Participants will be 
randomized 2:1 (see Schema), with two -thirds receiving doxycycline PEP and one- third receiving the standard 
of care control,  to maximize  data on safety,  tolerability,  adherence coverage of sexual  acts,  and resistance data 
in participants randomized to doxycy cline PEP, without negatively impacting power to measure effectiveness. 
Participants will be counseled about the preliminary effectiveness data from IPERGAY, and the potential for AMR 
in STIs or other bacteria. Possibi lity of unreported doxycycline use in the control arm (contamination) will be 
monitored  through  retrospective batch testing  of doxycycline  metabolites  in hair, to detect  doxycycline  use in the 
prior 3 months.  59 
 
The trial of doxycy cline PEP will be powered to separately assess impact for MSM living with HIV and MSM on 
PrEP because of potential differences in safety, tolerability, adherence, sexual networks, sexual practices, 
background AMR, and ultimately, PEP effectiveness. Eligible participants randomized 2:1 to receive PEP will 
receive open- label doxycycline 200 mg to be taken ideally within 24 hours but no later than 72 hours after 
condomless sexual contact (oral or anal). 200 mg of doxycycline will be taken at most once per 24 hour period 
regardless of the number of sexual acts occurring during this time period. the rationale for 2:1 randomization is 
to maximize  data on doxycycline  PEP safety,  tolerability,  acceptability,  and resistance,  while  providing sufficient 
power for the primary outcome of  the effectiveness of  doxycycline PEP. Sexual activity will be recorded for both 
arms of the study (doxycycline PEP and control condition) by the participant using a smartphone applicati on that 
will be adapted for study use; this will enable comparable assessment of risk in the two arms. PEP pill -taking will 
also be measured by the app to enable assessment of coverage of sex acts by PEP. Sexual activity and adherence will also be assessed in person at quarterly visits.  STI testing will be conducted quarterly from three 
anatomic  sites (pharyngeal,  rectal , and urinary)  and blood obtained for syphilis  testing,  following  CDC guidelines  
for serologic  diagnosis  of syphilis.  Participants  with a positive  STI test will return for STI treatment  and for swabs 
of the affected  site for resistance testing;  culture  based for GC and molecular  methods  for CT and syphilis.  Those 
with signs and symptoms suggestive of syphilis infection and those with a reactive syphilis serologic test that 
indicates a new syphilis infection will have swabs of any current active lesion (if present) as well as mucosal 
swabs from the orophar ynx. Swabs from the anterior nares and oropharynx will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 
12 months to evaluate tetracycline resistance in S. aureus among carriers and orophary ngeal swabs will be 
obtained at baseline and 12 months to evaluate tetracycline resistance in commensal Neisseria  species.  
 
Stool samples fro m 100 participants on the doxycycline PEP arm − 50 MSM and TGW living with HIV and 50 
MSM and TGW on PrEP− will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months to evaluate effects of intermittent 
doxycycline on the gut resistome, using FLASH targeted metagenomic  sequencing to evaluate for tetracycline 
and other  resistance  genes.  Rectal  swabs  will be collected and archived  in all participants  at baseline,  6, and 12 
months for future studies of the impact of doxycycline PEP on the enteric microbiome and resistome.  
 
Study population: This study will enroll 780 participants living with HIV and HIV -negative persons taking PrEP . 
An approximately equal number of  PLWH and HIV uninfected persons taking PrEP will be enrolled.  An 
approximately equal number of participants in each of these cohorts (and in each study arm) will be enrolled in 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
14  
 San Francisco and Seattle.  
 
Current  or planned initiation  of PrEP use is an eligibility  criterion  for enrollment,  because this population of MSM 
and TGW  has high rates  of STIs and is typically  seen quarterly  for PrEP  visits.  However,  participants  may opt to 
stop PrEP  use at any time during the study without affecting their involvement in the study. Any participants 
without HIV infection who subsequently seroconvert will be managed clinically by the study site according to 
local practice (appropriate counseling,  clinic al evaluation,  and immediate  linkage to clinical and psychosocial  
services). These participants will also be retained in the study unless they choose to discontinue study  
participation.

4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF  PARTICIPANTS  
 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
15  
 4.1 Inclusion  criteria  
4.1.1 Willing and able to give written informed  consent  
4.1.2 Age > 18 years  
4.1.3 Male sex at  birth 
4.1.4 Previously HIV -diagnosed 
OR 
HIV-seronegative at the time of last test within the past three months and a current prescription for 
PrEP (both daily or event -driven PrEP permitted) or plan to start PrEP within 30 days after the 
enrollment visit  
4.1.5 Condomless anal or oral sexual contact wi th ≥ 1 male sex -at-birth partners in the past 12  months  
4.1.6 Diagnosed with GC, CT or syphilis in the past 12 months.  
Note: self report of STI is acceptable if documentation not available.  If the participant reports an incident 
STI in the past year at the same clinic where the participant will be enrolled, this diagnosis  should be 
confirm ed by chart review  prior to enrollment. If the diagnosis  from this clinic cannot be confirmed, the 
participant should not be enrolled.  If the STI was reported at a clinical site that is not the study site, and 
records cannot be obtained, self -report will suffice . 
 
Note: Syphilis diagnosis within the last year refers to primary syphilis, secondary syphilis, and 
documented early latent syphilis (< 1 year since last syphilis diagnosis or negative test).  Known late 
latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration would not qualify. Positive syphilis titers which 
represent serofast status and not active disease do not qualify as a syphilis diagnosis. Clinician 
judgement regarding qualifying syphilis diagnosis should be sought when the diagnosis of syphilis in the 
past year is not clear or if there is a question about serofast status vs. active infection.  
 
 
4.2 Exclusion  criteria  
4.2.1 Allergy to tetracycline class 
4.2.2 Current medications which may impact doxycycline metabolism or that are contraindicated  with 
doxycycline, as per the prescribing information. These include systemic retinoids, barbiturates, 
carbamazepine, and  phenytoin.  
4.2.3 Current use of warfarin, as intermit tent doxycycline use can lead to an unpredictable impact on 
INR 
4.2.4 Anticipated use of doxycycline during the coming 12 months for non -STI prevention use (e.g., 
acne treatment).  
 
4.3 Recruitment  
Each site has established local recruitment and screening methods that operationalize protocol -specified 
requirements for eligibility determination in a manner that is tailored to and most efficient for the local study setting and target study population. Each site will use a variety of recruitment approaches, including dir ect 
recruitment at clinics, referrals from other providers of PrEP and ART, and use of online and social networking websites and apps. Recruitment materials will educate participants about STI prevalence and incidence in their 
community and the pilot study  that demonstrated efficacy of doxycycline for reducing incidence of STIs among 
MSM in IPERGAY.  
 
The study will enroll from 4 clinical sites , 2 in Seattle and 2 in San Francisco (Table 1), which have established 
track records of high quality research in M SM and TGW populations integrated into clinical care settings; 
annual retention rates in clinical trials conducted in these sites exceed 80% -90%. The sites have large MSM 
populations that are ethnically and racially diverse.

4.4 Co-enrollment  guidelines.  
Participants may be co- enrolled in other research studies, provided that these are a) observational studies or b) 
evaluation of an FDA approved intervention which is not an antibiotic, is not intended to treat or prevent an STI, 
and is compatible with coadministration of doxycyc line. The study team should be consulted for co- enrollment 
in studies that do not meet this guidance or if there are questions about eligibility for co- enrollment. For any co -
enrolled study, combined blood draws should not exceed current Red Cross phleboto my guidance.  
 
 
5 STUDY  TREATMENT  
 
5.1 Study product  
Generic  delayed release  doxcycyline  hyclate 200 mg capsules  (Mayne Pharmaceuticals)  will be provided by 
the study  to participants  randomized to open -label  PEP, and to participants who choose to roll over to active 
doxycycline PEP following the 5/13/2022 closure of enrollment . Doxycycline  DR is bioequiva lent to 
doxycycline  hyclate IR.  60, 61 Doxycycline  hyclate is widely  available and FDA approved for the treatment  of 
multiple infectious conditions. The full prescribing information can be accessed at : 
https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=cd2ab9b8-9619-4199-8a5d-83377b3274d1 
 
5.2 Safety of  doxycycline  
Doxycycline  is an antibiotic  that can be used for prolonged periods  of several  months  in the treatment  of acne  or 
in the prevention of malaria. The tolerance of repeated- dose of doxycycline in this 12 months study should 
therefore be acceptable.  
 
The most common side effect s of doxycycline are62, 63 
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, diarrhea, epigastric pain, anorexia, glossitis, enterocolitis, anal and genital 
candidiasis  
• Esophageal disorders: dysphagia, pill esophagit is, and rarely esophageal ulceration. Risk for 
esophageal irritation can be reduced by taking doxycycline tablets at least one hour before bedtime (to avoid lying down during doxycycline intake) at a meal with a large glass of water (100  ml). 
• Skin reactions including maculopapular, erythematous and photosensitivity skin reactions. Due to 
concer n for photosensitivity, individuals taking doxycycline are advised to avoid excessive exposure to 
sunlight and UV radiation (such as tanning beds).  
 
Other pos sible but rare adverse effects occurring in < 1% in post -marketing reports include:  
• Hypersensitivity reactions: urticarial, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms  (DRESS)  
• Skin toxicity: fixed drug eruption. Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema 
multiforme, fixed drug eruptions exacerbation of preexisting lupus  erythematosus  
• Pericarditis  
• Hematological disorders: hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia,  eosinophilia 
• Intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor  cerebri)

 5.3 Doxycycline dispensing and administration.  
Doxycycline will be dispensed at each 3- month visit or in shorter intervals per patient prefe rence, with additional 
dispensation as needed to replace lost medication or provide additional medication when needed (see MOPS 
for addition dispensing guidance). Capsules should be stored at room temperature (59- 86o F) to the extent  
feasible. Participants will be instructed to take 200 mg of doxycycline within 24 hours after condomless sexual 
contact, and no later than 72 hours after sex. Condomless sexual contact is defined as receptive anal, insertive 
anal, vaginal, or oral sex (which includes oral/anal and oral/genital contact) or use of shared sex toys without  a 
condom used for the entire time. For partici pants reporting multiple sexual encounters, 200 mg of doxycycline 
will be recommended to be taken every 24 hours until after the last sexual encounter. Participants will be 
instructed not to exceed 200 mg of doxycycline in a 24 hour period. Study staff will instruct participants on 
procedures for replacement of lost medication.  
 
Doxycycline  may be taken  on an empty  stomach  or with food,  and it is advised to take each dose with a large  glass  
of water at least 60 minutes before bed to reduce risk of esophageal irritation. All participants randomized to PEP 
will be advised to avoid excessive sun exposure and artificial UV light, such as tanning beds, and to consider 
use of sunscreen if they will be exposed to sun.  
 
5.4 Concomitant  medications 
Participants randomized to doxycycline PEP should report current and new medications to the study team to 
ensure no concern for drug interactions with doxycycline. The prescribing information for doxycycline 
monohydrate should be reviewed to ensure no potential for drug interactions.  
 
5.4.1  Prohibited  medications  
• Barbiturates  
• Carbamazapine  
• Phenytoin 
• Methoxyflurane  
• Systemic retinoids, such as acitretin and  isotretinoin  
 
5.4.2  Precautionary Medications 
• Antacids containing aluminum, iron, calcium, or magnesium, or bismuth subsalicyclate products 
(such as Pepto -Bismol) may impair doxycycline absorption and should be separated 2 hours 
before or after  doxycycline  
• Oral iron supplements may impact doxycycline absorption. Iron should be separated  2 hours 
before or after doxycycline  
 
5.5 HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV anti retroviral therapy (ART)  
PrEP and ART will not be provided by the study but will be accessible through local providers following the 
standard of care. Each of the participating sites has a clinical infrastructure in place to assist individuals with obtaining ART and PrEP, including fo r those without insurance or whose insurance status changes.

 6.2 Study visits 
Specific study procedures are detailed in Table 6.1. Visits will take place at enrollment and quarterly thereafter,  
up to 12 months.  Interim  visits  may be scheduled for diagnosis  and treatment  of STI and collection of additional 
specimens or for evaluation of possible doxycycline associated adverse events. Participants may also request 
interim STI  testing.  
 
6.2.1 Enrollment  Visit  After  confirming eligibility  through pre-screening and prior to study  procedures,  we will 
obtain written  informed consent  and collect  locating  information;  the latter  will be updated at each study 
visit. At enrollment,  demographic,  behavioral,  and clinical information  will be collected and a release of 
information obtained to permit access to medical records. STI testing for chlamydia and gonorrh ea 
through nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of clinician or self -collected pharyngeal and rectal 
swabs  and first void urine  will be conducted.  Serologic  testing for syphilis  will be conducted.  If required 
STI testing has been conducted within past 30 days, these results may be used for the enrollment 
evaluation. Participants diagnosed with an STI at baseline will be treated; presence of a baseline STI will not preclude enrollment but STI’s present at time of enrollment will not count towards study 
endpoints. All STIs will be reported to the local health department as required per local standard 
procedures.  
 
Randomization Within 14 days of enrollment, participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to open-  
label  doxycycline  PEP or the standard of care control  condition (regular  STI counseling,  screening and 
treatment as indicated). The randomization code and resulting allocation list will be generated and 
maintained by the study statistician. The list  will be blocked and stratified by site. While neither 
participants nor study staff will be blind to each participant’s randomization group once assigned, the randomization scheme will utilize varying block  sizes in order to protect the blind prior to randomization 
of each participant.  
 
6.2.2 Quarterly visits after  enrollment . Quarterly  visits  will be conducted  every  90 days,  +2 weeks/  -10 
weeks. Participants unable to attend a quarterly visit will be asked to return for an unscheduled visit as 
soon as feasible. The quarterly evaluations should be completed at the time of this visit. Subsequent 
visits should occur on the assigned quarterly scheduled to the extent  possible.  
 
6.2.3 Unscheduled interim visits : Participants will be instructed to contact the study site and return for an 
unscheduled visit for any of the following  a) new diagnosis  of STI, b) concern for possible adverse  event 
associated with doxycycline, c) need for additional doxycycline (in participants who were randomized to PEP arm), d) difficulty using the smartphone app, or any other study -related concerns. 
Reimbursement will not be provided for unscheduled visits. All interim contacts and visits will be documented in participants' study records and on applicable CRFs.  
 
6.2.4 Termination visi t: In the event that a participant prematurely discontinues study participation, the  
evaluations for the termination visit shoul d be completed if  possible.  
 
6.3 Instructions for  evaluations  
 
6.3.1 Smart phone application: A smartphone application (app), Blackbook, ( developed in conjun ction 
with UCSF researchers) currently in use to track sexual behavior and PrEP use in young MSM has 
been adapted for use in this study  to measure  daily sexual  risk practices  (both  study  arms)  and 
doxycycline PEP administration (intervention arm only). Study staff will assist with obtaining 
smartphones through local  available resources  such  as Lifeline  Assist , which  make  cell phones  
available to qualifying lower income individuals, when needed and feasible 
(https://www.truconnect.com/lifeline/freephone/signup ). Participant s will be given unique code s to 
permit download of the app from an online resource and guidance on how to use the application.  
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
21  
  
6.3.2 Review of current medications : All participants will have current medications reviewed at screening 
for possible drug interaction with doxycycline.  At subsequent  quarterly  visits,  participants  randomized 
to doxycycline PEP will have current medications be reviewed and any new medications will be 
assessed for possible drug interactions.  
6.3.3 STI symptom  screen . Participants  will be asked about  current  STI symptoms  including dysuria,  rash, 
throat pain, rectal pain/discharge, and genital  lesions 
6.3.4 Symptom assessment . At each visit, participants in both study arms will be asked about possible 
doxycycline side effects, including esophagitis, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, photosensitivity, 
headache, and changes in vision (including blurred, double vision, vision loss). Control arm 
participants  will be asked about  these  symptoms  to establish a comparator  for non-specific  symptoms 
which can occur in the absence of  doxycycline.  
6.3.5 Antibiotic  and STI history : History  will be recorded  of any non-study  provided antibiotics  taken in the 
last 3 months  and any  STI diagnosis  in preceding 3 months,  including the diagnosis  of urethritis  
requiring treatment  but without detection of gonorrhea or chlamydia. At study entry, STI history for 
preceding 12 months will be recorded as well as obtained through chart review when possible.  
6.3.6 Meningococc al vaccination history: At study entry and at month 12, receipt of any prior 
meningococcal vaccination and the type (if known)  will be recorded , using a checklist that will include  
- Serogroup A only (includes MenAfriVa,  PsA- TT) 
- Serogroup B only (includes Trumenba,  Bexsero)  
- Serogroup C only (includes Meningitec, NeisVac  C) 
- Quadrivalent A/C/Y/W (includes Menomune, Menveo,Nimirix,  Menactra)  
- Or other  formulation  
Type of vaccination may be confirmed by chart review if records are available.  
6.3.7 Sexual behavior questionnaire: Participants will be asked to complete a sexual behavior 
questionnaire recording number and type of sexual contacts in the past 3 mont hs at enrollment and 
between visits  
6.3.8 Pill count and doxycycline adherence assessment . Participants assigned to doxycycline PEP  or 
who roll over to receive doxycycline in the control arm  will be asked to bring their doxycycline bottles 
in at each visit for a pill count. They will be asked what proportion of sex acts were covered by PEP 
in the past month and past 3 months, an estimate of overall adherence, and how many total doses of 
doxycycline were taken in the past 3  months .  
 
Note: any period of 7 or more days in which the participant had condomless sexual activity but did 
not take doxycycline will be recorded as a doxycycline interruption. This includes interruptions due to 
lack of doxycycline,  forgetting to take doxycycline, taking medication not compatible with doxycycline, 
or participant decision to temporarily or permanently discontinue study -provided doxycycline.  
6.3.9 Doxycycline  PEP acceptability survey.  At months  6 and 12, participants  assigned to  or now taking 
doxycycline  PEP will be given a brief self -administered questionnaire evaluating acceptability of  PEP 
6.3.10 Risk reduction counseling and offer to provide of condoms/lubricant . At each visit, staff will 
counsel all participants  about STI risk reduction and HIV prevention (if not living with HIV), and the 
importance of adherence to ART and PrEP, according to local standard of care.  
6.3.11 STI testing.  
GC/CT: First void urine and pharyngeal and rectal swabs will be collected for NAAT testing. Swabs 
may be self collected or collected by study staff. GC & CT testing should be conducted at least 14 
days after treatment to avoid false positive nucleic acid r esults.  
 
Note: If GC or CT have been conducted within 30 days prior to study visit and these results are 
available, these results may be used for the quarterly STI assessment. All available STI results should 
be recorded.  
 
RPR: Blood will be collected for non-treponemal assay (RPR or VDRL) with titer if positive. 
Treponemal assay results should be recorded if RPR or VDRL are positive. Syphilis testing will be 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
22  
 repeated quarterly after last treatment for syphilis to determine if titers fall or if not, for cli nical 
evaluation of treatment failure or reinfection. Titers must be interpreted in the context of prior test 
results and current  symptoms  and exposure  history.  The need for treatment  will be based  on 
the clinical assessment of the site investigator based on the serological data and clinical findings. All 
syphilis endpoints will  be determined by the Endpoint Adjudi cation committee (see 10.3)  
 
Note:  It is preferred  to not repeat  syphilis  testing at a quarterly  visit if testing has been done less than 
12 weeks before the visit and these tests are available. All available syphilis test results should be 
recorded.  
 
6.3.12 Rectal swab for future M. genitalium  and other  testing.  
Rectal swab will be collected and stored for future batched M.gen  testing, including M.ge n antibiotic 
resistance testing, and potential testing for other infectious organisms. Swab s may be self -collected 
or collected by study staff.  
 
6.3.13 Urine for M.genitalium  testing  
At the time of urine collection for GC/CT testing, a sample of this urine collection will be stored for 
future batched testing for MG. Remnant urine from GC/CT testing may be used or the initial first catch  
specimen may be divided  into two samples,  as long as the minimum  volume for GC/CT  testing is met. 
See the MOPS for more inf ormation. Urine should also be collected for M.gen  at the time of 
symptomatic urethritis (see Table 6.4.1)  
6.3.14 Nasal and oropharyngeal  swab for Staph ylococcus aureus : nares  and oropharynx  will be swabbed  
and cultured for S. aureus , with antibiotic resistance testing if S. aureus  growth present  
6.3.15 Oropharyngeal swab for  commensal  Neisseria species. At baseline and month 12 , all participants 
will undergo oropharyngeal swab for Neisseria species and TCN -resistance testing if Neisseria 
species are isolated.  
6.3.16 Stool specimen: Stool samples from the first 50 participants living with HIV and 50 HIV - participants 
on PrEP who consent to collection will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months for metagenomic 
resistome studies using 16sRNA amplification of TCN resistance  genes.  In the event that participants 
cannot provide a stool sample at the scheduled visit, they will have up to 2 weeks from the enrollment 
and 12- month visit to return the stool specimens for those visits, and up until two weeks after the 9 -
month visit t o return the stool specimen for the 6- month visit .  
6.3.17 Rectal  Swab  for microbiome testing : Rectal  swabs  will be collec ted and frozen for future  
microbiome analysis. Th ese swabs  may be self collected or collected by study  staff.  
6.3.18 Hair collection : Hair will be collected from all participants who consent to collection and who meet 
eligibility for hair collection (occipital hair length > 0.5 cm and absence of bleaching in area to be 
collected) See manual of procedures for details on hair  collection  
6.3.19 HIV testing and RNA data:  
For PLWH : At entry and month 12, the most recent HIV RNA data available from clinical visits will be 
recorded  
For participants  on PrEP:  At entry,  the most  recent  HIV antibody  or viral test results  from clinical care 
will be recorded.  If no test results  available within  the past 3 months,  HIV testing  should be obtained, 
consistent with standard of care monitoring for PrEP. At month 12, the most recent HIV antibody or 
viral load test results from clinical care will be  recorded.  
6.3.20 ART and PrEP status  
For PLWH , current ART regimen and status (taking vs. not taking) will be recorded at each visit. At 
entry and month 12 for PLWH, the most recent HIV RNA and CD4+ cell count available from clinical 
visits will be recorded if available  
For participants on PrEP  At each  visit for those on PrEP, PrEP status will be assessed (taking vs. 
not taking, and how PrEP is taken - daily vs intermittent ). At entry and month 12, the most recent HIV 
antibody or viral load test results from clinical care will be recorded.  
6.3.21 Hematologic and liver function  tests:  Complete  blood count  (CBC)  (white  count  with differential , 
hemoglobin,  platelets) and liver function testing (AST,  ALT,  total bilirubin  and alkaline  phosphatase)  
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
23  
 will be drawn at months 3 and 9 in those on doxycycline PEP. Testing done through standard of care 
within 30 days of the study visit may also be used if available.  For those in the standard of care arm, 
CBC will be done at the month 12 visit. In the event that  a CBC cannot be obtained at month 12, an 
available CBC from any time during study participation may be used.   
6.3.22 Serum for storage  (Optional): At months 0 and 12, 10 mL of serum will be collected for storage for 
future analysis (non- genetic) in participants who agreed to this. Serum may be collected up to 14 
days after the visit if blood cannot  be collected at the time of the visit. 
6.3.23 Reimbursement : Participants will be reimbursed at the enrollment visit , at quarterly visits, and at the 
time of return for treat ment of STIs with accompanying collection of swabs. An additional 
reimbursement will be provided for participants who consent to the optional stool sample collection at 
the baseline, 6 month , and 12 month timepoints. No reimbursement will be provided at ot her 
unscheduled interim visits such as visits to provide additional  doxycycline.  
6.3.24 Roll over from standard of care to active doxycycli ne:  All participants  initially  assigned to the 
standard care arm will be offered the option to receive doxycycline through the study for the remainder 
of their  12 month follow up period. If a standard of care arm participant elects to initiate doxycycline, 
they will complete a new informed consent at the doxycycline initiation visit, and will be provided with 
instructions and counseling on how to use doxycycline PEP.  If a control arm participant comes  in to 
initiate doxycycline at a time that falls within the visit window for the next scheduled study visit, all 
scheduled visit evaluations will be conducted, in addition to a rectal swab for microbiome testing, if 
not already scheduled. Up to three  bottles of doxycycline will be dispensed at the initial visit - a 
sufficient quantity to ensure enough doxycycline for daily use until the next quarterly visit or the end 
of study visit . If a control arm participant comes in to initiate doxycycline at a time that is before the 
visit window for the next scheduled study visit, doxycycline will be dispensed and a rectal swab 
obtained for microbiome  evaluation. CBC and LFT evaluations for possible doxycycline toxicity will 
occur  at the month 3 and month 9 study visit s per the SOE.  If there is a delay in the participant’s 
ability to come in for a doxycycline initiation visit, it is acceptable for doxycycline to be provided  
through primary care or other provider in advance of visit. Roll over to doxycycline and t he date of 
starting doxycycline will be recorded on a CRF. 
 
6.4 Evaluation at time of presumptive or diagnosed GC, CT and  syphilis  
 
6.4.1  Symptoms suggestive of STI for which pr esumptive STI treatment will be  administered . 
For those who have symptoms of an STI at a study visit given characteristic clinical presentation (such as chancre, rash characteristic of syphilis, symptomatic urethritis or proctitis) such that the treating c linician will 
provide empiric STI treatment while awaiting confirmatory testing, standard STI testing should be obtained from 
urine/pharynx/rectum for GC/CT and blood for syphilis testing. In addition,  the following specimens should be 
obtained for resistance testing from symptomatic anatomic sites  based on the clinical presentation as outlined 
in Table 6.4.1.  
 
NOTE: For specimens collected due to presumptive infection, the resistance testing specimens (swabs/urine 
collection) should be held until definitive STI testing is available. If STI testing indicates no infection, the 
specimens may be discarded. Alternati vely, the site may send all specimens for storage . Specimens that are 
not associated with a confirmed STI will be discarded when the data management team confi rms absence of 
STI. If there is uncertainty about whether STI if present, the specimens should be sent to the BioHUB for testing.  
 
NOTE: Testing for evidence of resistance to GC, CT and syphilis should be conducted prior to STI treatment.  If 
collect ion of  specimens before treatment  is not possible , CT and syphilis testing can be conducted the same 
day of treatment after treatment has been provided. Per the SURRG protocol, GC cultures should only be collected before GC treatment .

 6.4.2  Documented  STI: 
Individuals with positive GC and/or CT NAAT results or with serologic testing indicating a new syphilis infection 
will be contacted to return for STI treatment as well as swabs of affected site for resistance testing or urine 
collection, as outlined in Table 6.4.1  Specifically:  
• Those with positive G C NAAT results will have 
1) a swab obtained from the involved anatomic site and other sites of sexual contact in past 90 
days (to include throat, rectum, urine) if indicated for GC culture- based phenotypic testing 
according to local GC culture protocol,  and 
2) a swab/urine sample obtained from anatomic site of infection only for molecular resistance 
testing.  
• For those with CT infection, a swab or urine specimen will be collected (depending on the site of 
infection) for molecular resistance  testing.  
• For those wit h confirmed rectal or pharyngeal CT, a swab will be collected for chlamydia cell culture. 
Please see MOPS for specimen handing instructions.  
• For those with syphilis serologies indicating new infection and in whom no chancres/mucosal lesions 
are present, a buccal mucosal swab will be obtained for T. pallidum DNA amplification which , if 
positive, will be used for resistance testing. If suspected syphilitic chancre is present, this should be 
swabbed for molecular  testing

6.5 Testing for resistance in setting of STI diagnoses on study  
 
6.5.1  Testing for tetracycline resistance among N.  gonorr oheae  
Positive GC cultures for all participants will be sent to either the University of Washington Neisseria Reference 
laboratory for resistance testing led by our co- investigator, Dr Olusegun Soge at the UW/PHSKC STI program 
or the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory for testing by Dr. Godfred Masinde. Both laboratories participate in the 
Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG) program. GC isolates collected in Seattle and frozen isolates from San Francisco will be shipped to Dr. Soge on a monthly basis for agar dilution 
antimicrobial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobials including tetracycline, as part of the Antimicrobial 
Resistance Lab Network (ARLN) supported by CDC. In addition, Dr. Soge’s laboratory will determine whether 
tetracycline MICs increases among the subset with repeat GC infections during follow - up. 
 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
26  
 6.5.2  Molecular testing for tetracycline resistance genes in C. trachomatis, T. pallidum and N.  gonorrhoeae.  
DNA from positive NAAT tests for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and from buccal or chancre/mucosal lesion 
swabs from those with newly diagnosed syphilis will be evaluated using established CRISPR/Cas9 techniques 
to screen against a comprehensive library of antibiotic resistance mutationsin order to establish rapid throughput 
methodology for the multicenter study. Tetracycline resistance will be assessed using FLASH (Finding Low 
Abundance Sequences by Hybridization)) targeted sequencing of antimicrobial resistance genes that will then 
be compared to an established antibiotic resistance database as well as evaluated for known tetracycline 
mutations that have been documented in the target STIs or closely related organisms64. Molecular resistance 
testing will conducted at the San Francisco Chan- Zuckerberg Biohub under the supervision of collaborating 
investigator Dr. Langlier, who has  extensive expertise in molecular diagnosis of mutations associated with 
antibiotic resistance. Any TCN -resistance mutations in C. trachomatis or T. pallidum will be inve stigated further, 
as clinically relevant tetracycline resistance has not been reported to date. The results will not be reported for use 
in clinical care as these methods are experimental and have not been validated for clinical care. 
 
6.6 Treatment of STIs  
Local clinic standards will be followed for the treatment of STIs diagnosed by laboratory tests or when identified 
syndromically. If doxycycline is used for treatment of an STI for an individual in the PEP arm, doxycycyline PEP 
will be held during treatment and resumed when treatment completed.  
 
6.7 Qualitative interviews  
A qualitative interview will be offered to a subset of participants assigned to take doxycycline, approximately 
20 per site, during months 3- 12, and up to one month after study completion. Qualitative interviews will also 
be offered to 10- 20 providers at each of the sites A separate consent will be provided for these interviews.   
 
6.8 Reenrollment of participants enrolled prior to  3/15/2020  
Participants enrolled prior to the COVID pandemic wil l be re- enrolled starting 7/2020 with the same initial 
assignment. At time of re -enrollment, these participants  will undergo all day 0 evaluations with the exception of 
the following  
• Meningoccal vaccine  history  
• Medical & STI  history  
• Stool sample collection from first 50 PLWH and HIV uninfected on  PrEP  
 
 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND STUDY MONITORING  
 
7.1 Adverse Event Collection Requirements  
 
All AEs must be recorded on eCRFs if any of the following criteria have been met:  
• All grade 2 and higher hematologic and hepatic laboratory abnormalities that are attributed to 
doxycycline in the opinion of the site investigator  
• All AEs meeting SAE definition  
• All grade 3 and 4 adverse events judged to be associated with doxycycline (possibly, 
probably , or def initely  related)  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
27  
 hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above)  
 
All AEs that are recorded must have their severity graded. To grade AEs, sites should refer to the Division 
of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), 
corrected Version 2.1, Ju ly 2017, which can be found on the DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.tec h- 
res.com/docs/default -source/safety/division -of-aids-(daids) -table -for-grading- the-severity -of-adult -and- 
pediatric -adverse- events -corrected -v-2-1.pdf  
 
7.2 AE and SAE attribution to  doxycycline  
In those randomized to receive doxycycline PEP, all AEs and SAEs should have attribution recorded as doxycycline -related or not doxycycline- related, in the judgment of the site investigator.  
 
7.3 Study Monitoring  
 
7.3.1  Study Team  Monitoring  
The study team will monitor the conduct of the study through monthly summary reports of arms of accrual, and  
baseline characteristics  and quarterly  reports  of data pooled over treatment  arms  of data completeness, specimen 
collection, and AEs. The study will review individual participant -level safety data frequently to assess  the relation 
of all reported AEs to study  treatment.  On a monthly  basis,  the study  team  will review  by- arm summaries of 
premature study discontinuations and premature study treatment discontinuations (and reasons) and AEs.  
 
7.3.2  Independent  Monitor  
Study conduct will be monitored by an independent monitor. Monitors will visit participating clinical research sites  
to review  the individual  participant  records,  including consent  forms,  eCRFs,  supporting  data,  laboratory specimen 
records, and endpoints through laboratory and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, 
individuals’ hospital charts), to ensure protecti on of study participants, compliance with the protocol, and 
accuracy and completeness of records. The monitors also will inspect sites’ regulatory files to ensure that 
regulatory  requirements  are being followed  and sites’  pharmacies  to review  product  storage  and management.  
 
7.3.3  Data safety and monitoring board (DSMB)  
An independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened for this study with expertise in STIs, 
PrEP, and HIV care and a biostatistician. The purpose of the DSMB is to monitor the study for operational futility, 
social harms, and efficacy. The DSMB will evaluate the progress of the project, including periodic assessments 
of accrual, retention, safety, performance and variation of the project sites, and other factors that  can affect 
project implementation. The DSMB will review the study after 1/2  of follow-  up time with pre -specified stopping 
rules in terms of the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing the incidence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis 
overall, and the ability of the study to meet its objectives. The DSMB will review STI endpoints which have been 
adjudicated by the STI Endpoints Committee. The DMSB will consider factors external to the project when 
relevant information becomes available, such as policy changes or scientific developments that may have an 
impact on project implementation, safety, and integration of STI PEP in the STI and HIV care  clinics.  
 
The DSMB will conduct reviews every six month and convene by teleconference. Open reports containing 
accrual  and retention rates,  participant  characteristics,  serious  adverse  events,  and social,  will be sent to the 
protocol team and DSMB members the week prior to the DSMB meeting. Only the DSMB members and the 
unblinded biostatistician will receive password- protected closed reports of STI endpoints by randomization arm.

 8 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  ISSUES 
 
8.1 Toxicity  
Only toxicities related to study medications provided through the study will be considered in the toxicity 
management section.  
 
Grade 1 or 2  
Participants who develop Grade 1 or 2 toxicity (per DAIDS toxicity table) felt to be related to doxycycyline may continue study treatment at the discretion of the site investigator with close follow -
up. If a participant chooses to discontinue study treatment, the site should notify the study  
protocol team within 7 days.These  participants will remain on study, off study treatment and have all 
evaluations performed per the SOE.  
 
Grade 3  
• Participants who develop a Grade 3 toxicity thought by the site investigator to be related to study 
drug should have doxycycline PEP withheld and the site should consult with the core protocol 
team. The participant should be reevaluated weekly until the AE returns to Grade ≤2, at which 
time study drug may be reintroduced at the discretion of the site investigator in consultation with 
the protocol  team.  
• Participants experiencing Grade 3 toxicity requiring permanent discontinuation of doxycycline 
PEP should be followed weekly until resolution of the toxicity. Participants will have premature 
study treatment discontinuation evaluations performed as noted on the SOE. These participants 
will remain on study, off study treatment and have all evaluations performed per the  SOE.  
 
Grade 4  
• Participants  with Grade 4 asymptomatic  laboratory  abnormalities  may continue doxycycline  PEP 
if the site investigator has  compelling evidence that the toxicity is NOT related to study  drug.  
• Participants who develop a Grade 4 symptomatic toxicity will have doxycycline PEP 
permanently discontinued and the site should notify study team within 72 hours.  
• Participants experiencing Grade 4 toxicity requiring permanent discontinuation of doxycycline 
PEP should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE or return to baseline. These 
participants will remain on study, off study treatment and have all evaluations performed per the 
SOE.  
•  
8.2 Specific Management of Toxicities Related to Study- Provided Drugs  
Possible intracranial hypertension  (IH) 
Participants taking doxycycline who report new or worsening headaches, visual changes , or vision  loss should 
have doxycycline temporarily discontinued and evaluated for IH if these symptoms persist, including a 
fundoscopic exam to look for papilledema. If IH is ruled- out or an alternate etiology identified, doxycycline may 
be restarted, at the discretion of the site investigator.  
 
Skin erythema  
Increased photosensi tivity is a known possible side effect of doxycycline. Doxycycline may be discontinued if 
skin erythema develops at the discretion of the site investigator and may reinstituted when resolved at the discretion of the site investigation. Any serious skin reaction judged by the local investigator to be related to 
doxycycline should lead to permanent discontinuation of doxycycline .  
 
Fixed drug eruption  
Suspected fixed drug eruption should be evaluated for possible etiologies  – if a doxycycline fixed drug eruption 
is suspected, doxycycline should be stopped.  
 
Allergic  reactions  
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
29  
 Doxycycline should be discontinued permanently if a serious allergic reaction is suspected. These participants 
will remain on study, off study treatment and have all evaluations performed per the SOE.  
 
 
9 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION  
 
9.1 Premature Study Treatment  Discontinuation  
 
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medications or other contraindication to doxycycline  
• Occurrence of an adverse event requiring discontinuation of  doxycycline  
• Request by participant to terminate study  treatment  
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by the physician, even if not addressed in the toxicity 
section of the protocol  
• Requirement for chronic tetracycline use ( >14  days)  
 
Participants who stop doxycycline PEP should be continued on study, off doxycycline PEP with 
continued evaluations as per the SOE. The reason for doxycycline discontinuation should be 
recorded.  
 
9.2 Premature Study  Discontinuation  
 
• Request by the participant to withdraw  
• Request of the primary care provider if she or he thinks the study is no longer in the best 
interest of the participant  
• Participant judged by the investigator to be at significant risk of failing to comply with the 
provisions of the protocol as to cause harm to self or seriously interfere with the validity of the 
study  results  
• At the discretion of the IRB/EC, NIAID, Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), other 
government agencies as part of their duties, investigator, or industry  supporter  
 
 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Outcome measures  
 
10.1.1  Primary  outcome : 
Combined incidence  of GC, CT, or early  syphilis infection  by laboratory - based diagnosis  (e.g.,  positive  GC or CT 
based on NAAT,  syphilis  based on four-fold increase in non- treponemal titers or positive darkfield on exudate 
from a lesion). Incident STI diagnoses will be ascertained through  the study  through  periodic  testing,  interim  visits  
for STI symptoms,  as well as STI surveilla nce from the San Francisco  and King County  Departments  of Health  
and by medical  records provided for participants who receive their care from other clinical  sites.  
 
10.1.2  Secondary outcomes : 
• Safety of doxycycline PEP, measured by evaluation of all Grade 3 and 4  AEs attributed to study medication.  
• Tolerability,  measured using a brief quarterly  questionnaire administered  to both intervention and control  groups  
evaluating side effects  commonly  associated  with doxycycline  as well as recording any discontinuations of 
doxycycline by participants and their  reasons.  
• Acceptability,  assessed  through  a brief questionnaire for all PEP recipients  administered  at month 6 and 12 and 
in-depth structured qualitative interviews for a subset, conducted within 6 m onths of month 12 visit. A separate 
consent will be provided for the in- depth qualitative interview at the time of this interview.  
• Doxycycline coverage of sexual contacts in the prior 3 months,  ascertained by sexual behavior and  doxycycline  
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
30  
 use from the web-based app, augmented by quarterly  adherence questionnaires and pill  counts.  
• Longitudinal  exposure  to doxcycyline  will be assessed using hair collection,  with a semiquantitive evaluation in 
the control arm (doxycycline present vs. absent) and in the PEP arm (doxycycline concentration high vs.  low). 
• Adherence to HIV medications as reflected in viral suppression among participants living with HIV, assessed 
by chart review of HIV RNA levels conducted as standard clinical  care.  
• Discontinuation of PrEP, based on  self-report  
• Residual hair samples of participants without HIV infection on PrEP  will be archived for future tenofovir testing 
to measure adherence to Truvada PrEP.  
 
10.2 Statistical power and analysis  
 
Primary  endpoint:  We selected a sample  size for each cohort  (MSM/TGW  living  with HIV and MSM/TGW  on 
PrEP) to achieve 80% power with 0.05 two- sided Type 1 error, for the endpoint of any lab- detected incident early  
syphilis,  GC and/or  CT infection,  based on quarterly  assessments  for each  person,  10% annual  loss to follow -up 
and an intra-class  correlation of 0.2, reflecting  the high prevalence of STI re-infection that has been observed in 
these populations. With these assumptions, a cohort of approximately 390 of MSM/TGW living with HIV and 390 
of MSM/TGW on PrEP (130 in the control and 260 in the intervention for each cohort) will pr ovide 80% power to 
detect a decrease in quarterly STI prevalence from 10% to 5%, which corresponds to an annual reduction in 
combined STI incidence  from 34% to 19% (Table 10.2.1) . With allowance for 10% lost to follow- up, the sample 
size for each cohort wi ll be approximately 390 participants, for a total sample size of 780. Based on 2017 STI 
incidence data from San Francisco and Seattle  PrEP cohorts  for both GC and CT, we expect  in the control  arm in 
each quarter approximately 5% of participants to have GC, 5% CT and 2% early syphilis, acknowledging some 
will be diagnosed with more than one infection. Based on the higher susceptibility of GC to TCN in the US vs 
France (75% vs < 50%11, 20) and t he 70% reduction of CT and syphilis with PEP in IPERGAY ,1 we anticipate  
effectiveness  of doxycycline  PEP to be 35% for GC, 65% for CT and 65% for syphilis.  Given  these assumptions,  
with a 2:1 randomization  we expect  to see 61 vs 47 GC infections,  47 vs 33 CT infections  and 19 vs 13 syphilis 
infections in the doxycycline PEP and control arms respectively, some of which will occur in the same individuals. 
Sample sizes were computed using nQuery for repeated measures for two pr oportions.  The analysis  will compare  
time-averaged  proportion  of infections  in each  quarter  between  arms, using repeated measure  methods.

 Within the total enrollment of 780, we will not require the enrollment of HIV -infected and uninfected participants 
to be equal. Anticipating the possibility of lower enrollment but possibility of equivalent or  higher STI rates in the 
HIV-infected cohort, Table 10.2.2 assesses the power characteristics of the study with a cohort that contributes 
from 30% to 50% of the total enrolled, with quarterly events rates of 10% and 12%. With a higher event rate or 
a lower intracl ass correlation, the smaller cohort ret ains reasonable power to detect a 50% reduction.

Secondary  endpoints  include evaluation of PEP effectiveness  on incidence of each specific  STI and on time to  
first STI, as well as by site of STI infection  (oral,  rectal,  urethral).  Impact  of risk practices  and sexual  activity on STI 
incidence will be compared between arms. Survey data will be analyzed to understand factors impacting 
acceptability of doxycycline PEP, including demographic factors, socioeconom ic status, substance use, history 
of STI s, HIV infection status, and experience with PEP. The qualitative interviews will be coded using inductive 
(i.e., codes arise from careful reading of the text) and deductive (i.e. , codes arise a priori from topics covered by 
the interview guide) approaches, which when employed together have proven useful  in health services research.  
Interviews  will be coded by at least  two research team  members  who will practice  on a selection  of transcripts  
until >90%  agreement  is reached.  Dedoose,  a web-based program,  will be  used  to facilitate  indexing,  coding,  and 
searching.  The qualitative  team  will meet  regularly  to group  codes into categories and develop major and minor  
themes.  
 For resistance we will assess the proportion with tetracycline resistance in visits with N. gonorrheae and S. 
aureus . Exploratory endpoints include incidence of tetracycline resistance in C. trachomatis and T. pallidum 
using molecular techniques (e.g., CRISPR and CAS -9), for which the molec ular technologies are new and the 
clinical significance of resistance mutations is less clear. Stool samples from 50 participants living with HIV and 
50 participants on PrEP will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months for metagenomic evaluation targeting TCN 
genes.  Overall  TCN resistance  gene abundance  (expressed as dpM/patient)  and the number of distinct TCN 
resistance genes present per participant will be assessed at baseline and evaluated for change over time during 
doxycycline use. Rectal swabs will be collected and stored for future evaluation of shifts  in the fecal  microbiome,  
decrease in flora diversity,  and quantification of TCN-resistant  abundance and diversity  
 
 
10.3 Endpoint  adjudication  
All STI endpoints will be reviewed by a blinded, independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee, following CDC 
guidelines for the diagnosis of STIs .52 Incidence of individual STIs and tetracycline resistance will also be 
evaluated.

 10.4 Post COVID  follow -up 
The team  will monitor  discontinuation rates  in the participants  enrolled prior to the COVID  epidemic  (3/15/2020). 
If there is a differe ntial discontinuation in the active vs. control arm, this will be di scussed with DSMB and the 
team statistician with consideration of additional  enrollments to ensure adequate power for the primary endpoint.  
 
10.5 Analyses after  5/13/2022 closure to enrollment  
Analyses after 5/13/2022 closure to enrollment and doxycycline provision to control  will include the following : 
 
STI incidence :  
- Comparison of STI incidence per quarter in control arm before and after doxycycline initiation 
- Comparison of STI incidence per quarter in all participants receiving doxycycline (including those in 
control arm after rolled over to receive doxycycline) compa red to incidence on control arm prior to 
doxycycline roll over  
 
Antimicrobial r esistance  
- Evaluation of tetracycline resistance in Staphylococcus  aureus , commensal Neisseria  in comparison 
to the control arm and to individual baseline  
- Evaluation of genotypic or phenotypic tetracycline resistance in bacterial STI s in all participants who 
receive doxycycline compared to control arm participants, prior to receipt of doxycycline.  
- Evaluation of changes in the gut microbiome and total gut bu rden of tetracycline resistance before and 
after taking doxycycline PEP  
 
Adherence  
- Evaluation of doxycycline coverage of qualifying sex before and after study closure 5/13/2022  
 
Acceptability  
- Proportion of control arm participants who opt to take study provided doxycycline. Control arm 
participants who terminate study participation will have the reason for termination recorded to 
determine if stopping to receive doxycycline outside of the study.  
 
 
11 PARTICIPANTS  
 
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)  Review 
The study protocol, site- specific informed consent forms, participant education and recruitment materials, and 
other requested documents —including any subsequent modifications —will be reviewed and approved by the 
UCSF IRB, as the single IRB of record r esponsible for oversight of research conducted at the study sites. 
Subsequent to initial review and approval, the UCSF IRB will review the study at least annually.  
 
11.2 Informed  Consent  
A signed consent form will be obtained from the participant.The consent form will describe the purpose of the 
study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy of the consent form will 
be given to the participant and  this fact will be documented in the participant’s record. Electronic consenting will 
be an option to reduce face to face exposure during the COVID epidemic.  
 
11.3 Study records  
Each study site will establish a standard operating procedure for confidentiality protection. Each site will ensure 
that study records including administrative documentation and regulatory documentation as well as documentation related to each participant enrolled in the study, including informed consent forms, locator forms, 
case report  forms, notations of all contacts with the participant, and all other source documents are stored in a 
secure manner.  
 
DoxyPEP protocol Ver 9.0 5/27/2022  
33  
 11.4 Confidentiality  
Participants’ study information will not be released without their written permission, except as necessary for 
oversight by: 
- The Protocol co- Chairs or designees  
- Study  funders  
- University of California, San Francisco IRB 
- University of Washington  IRB 
 
All laboratory  specimens,  evaluation forms,  reports,  and other  records  that leave the site will be identified by 
coded number only to maintain participant confidentiality. The exceptions are STI testing results which are 
subject  to local and state  reporting which  is names -based.  Local  public  health may contact  participants  
diagnosed with STIs for the purpose of surveillanc e and partner notification. Participants will be informed prior 
to STI testing that results are reportable and may lead to contact by local public health if results are positive for 
infection. In addition, GC culture specimens will be evaluated for drug resistance as part of an existing GC 
program evaluating clinical isolates and may contain patient identifiers such as MRN, name or date of visit, according to local laboratory requirements and practice.  
 
All records  will be kept locked.  All computer  entry  and networking programs  will be done with coded numbers only. 
Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by the IRB/EC, NIAID, OHRP, other local, US, and international r egulatory entities as part of their 
duties, or the industry supporters or  designees.  
 
 
12 BIOHAZARD CONTAINMENT  
 
As the transmission of HIV and other blood- borne pathogens can occur through contact with contaminated 
needles, blood, and blood products, appropr iate blood and secretion precautions will be employed by all 
personnel in the drawing of blood and shipping and handling of all specimens for this study, as currently 
recommended by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.  
 
All dangerous goods and materials, including diagnostic specimens and infectious substances, must be 
transported using packaging mandated by CFR 42 Part 72. Please refer to instructions detailed in the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations.

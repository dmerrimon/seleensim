Co-Chairs :  
 
Study Design:  This study is a phase II I, multicenter, double -blinded, 
randomized, placebo- controlled trial des igned to compare AAT 
and corticosteroids  (CS) to placebo and CS  as first  line therapy 
for patients with high- risk acute GVHD.  
 Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) on Day 28 post- randomization between AAT and CS  versus placebo to 
match ( PTM ) and CS  in patients with high -risk acute GVHD. 
 Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives are to assess the following:

2. Cumulative incidence of non- relapse mortality  (NRM) at 6- 
and 12-months post-randomization. 
3. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) at 
6- and 12-months post-randomization. 
4. GVHD-free survival at Day 56 post-randomization. 
5. Proportions of CR, very good partial response (VGPR), PR, and treatment failure (TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 86 
post-randomizations. 
6. Proportion of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 
and 86 post -randomization who receive ruxolitinib or other 
second line therapies approved by the protocol Chairs  as 
next- line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM. 
7. Incidence of systemic infections  to assess safety . 
8. Incidence of A dverse Events (AEs)  at 30 days  post last dose 
of drug to assess safety .

3. Blood ratios of T regulatory to T effector cells (Treg/Teff), Natural Killer (NK) cells and cellular immune  subsets at 
baseline and at Days 14, 28, and 56 post -treatment initiation.  
4. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers at baseline and at Day s 8, 28 and 56 post- treatment initiation.  
5. Overall and organ -specific response rates comparison based 
on Minnesota (MN) risk groups (Revised Minnesota High vs Standard) and organ- specific response rates comparison 
based on biomarker-based risk groups. 
6. Corticosteroid  dose at baseline, Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 86, 
6 months and 12 months post-randomization. 
7. CMV reactivation requiring therapy by Day 56 post -
randomization. 
8. Change in patient -reported outcomes from basel ine to 
Day 28, Day 56, and 6-months post-randomization. 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  Patients meeting the eligibility  criteria should be enrolled as soon 
as possible after the start of CS, but no more than 72 hours afterwards.   
1. Patients experiencing their initial presentation of acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy after allogeneic transplant for any malignant or non-malignant indication. 
2. The clinical diagnosis of acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy with CS. Patients can be enrolled with only a clinically established diagnosis. Biopsy of involved organs with acute GVHD is encouraged but is not required and should not delay study entry. Enrollment/randomization includes commitment to continue steroids with PTM or AAT as specified in the protocol, as well as the required follow -up 
observations. If, according to institutional practice, the intention to treat is dependent upon biopsy results, the patient should not complete enrollment on the BMT CTN 1705 study until the biopsy results are available.  
3. Acute GVHD must meet one (either A or B) of following clinical features within 72 hours prior to enrollment:  
(A) High -risk by Refined Minnesota Criteria (any one 
below): 
Single organ involvement 
a. Stage 4 skin 
b. Stage 3 -4 lower GI 
c. Stage 1 -4 liver 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-3 Multiple organ involvement  
a. Stage 1 -2 lower GI plus any liver 
b. Stage 2 lower GI plus any skin 
c. Stage 3 -4 lower GI plus any liver or skin 
d. Any three organ involvement 
OR:  
(B) Either of the below: 
1. Isolated stage 2 involvement of the lower GI 
tract   
2. Stage 1 lower GI tract disease with skin involvement 
4. Acute GVHD developing after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using any graft or donor source or conditioning intensity.  
5. Patients should not have received systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of active GVHD except for a maximum of 72 hours of prior CS therapy prior to enrollment. Topical skin and GI CS (such as budesonide and oral beclomethasone diproprionate) are allowed.  
6. Patients 12 years of age or older at time of enrollment.  
7. Ability to provide written informed consent from patient, 
parent or legal guardian, and assent if applicable. 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Patients with prior exogenous AAT exposure for GVHD prophylaxis.  
2. Relapsed, progressing or persistent malignancy 
3. Evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) requiring withdrawal of systemic immune suppression.  
4. Patients with acute GVHD developing after administration of a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for relapse / progression of disease. Patients with acute GVHD af ter 
planned donor lymphocyte infusion or planned T cell or NK cell add back are eligible.  
5. Patients with uncontrolled infections will be excluded. Infections are considered controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment, no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or  symptoms will not be interpreted as 
progressing infection.

 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-4 6. A clinical presentation resembling de novo chronic GVHD 
or overlap syndrome (as defined in Appendix C ) developing 
before or present at the time of enrollment.  
7. Patients receiving other drugs for the treatment of GVHD. Note, GVHD prophylaxis agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) may be continued at local Investigator’s discretion. 
8. Patients recei ving systemic CS for any indication within 
7 days before enrollment, except the following:  
a. CS administered as premedication for supportive care (such as before transfusion of blood products or before intravenous medications to prevent infusion reactions, fever, etc.).  
b. If steroid therapy has been administered for treatment of a non- GVHD related condition and tapered to 
< 0.6 mg/kg/day prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone) for 7 or more days prior to enrollment. 
c. Treatment of active GVHD with CS is allowed for up to 72 hours prior to enrollment. 
9. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

saturation [SpO2] > 90%). 
13. Patients with active hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS ) and/or clinical evidence of impaired hepatic function 
(ascites or encephalopathy related to liver disease) who in the judgment of the treating physician are not expected to have normalized bilirubin by Day 56 after enrollment. 
14. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to AAT or any component of the investigational product or PTM (albumin), including congenitally IgA -deficient patients with 
antibodies to IgA or PTM. 
15. Patients unlikely to be adherent to study specific assessments at the transplant center.  
 
Treatment Description:  All patients will receive prednisone 2 mg/kg/day PO 
(or methylprednisolone (MP) at 1.6 mg/kg/day IV) divided into 1-2 daily doses  for at least 72 hours after enrollment. CS may be 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-5 tapered as tolerated accord ing to institutional practice. However,  
corticosteroid taper may not start sooner than 3 days after 
enrollment and the prednisone dose cannot be less than 
0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone (MP 0.2 mg/kg/day) at Day 28 post-enrollment. 
  
 Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive  AAT or PTM.  
Patients will receive AAT/PTM on Days 0 or 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
24, and 28. Responding patients will continue to receive AAT/PTM on Days 35, 42, 49, and 56. 
Accrual Objective:  136 total patients will be enrolled and ra ndomized 1:1 to AAT 
vs PTM . 
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 3 years.  
Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 12 months following randomization. 
Interim Analysis:  The study will consist of one interim analysis for futility after 76 patients are evaluable, at a time coincident with a regularly scheduled meeting of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ( NHLBI )-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) review, then a 12-month analysis after accrual and all 
patients  follow up is complete. A n additional analysis will be 
conducted after all randomized patients complete 6  months of 
follow- up. Multiplicity adjustment is not needed for this analysis 
as all the  patients would have completed the primary endpoint 
visit at Day 28 by the time of analysis. Policies and composition 
of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN Manual of Procedures.  
Stopping Guidelines:  The stopping guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stopping rules” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment. Safety monitoring will be based on Day 56 NRM. 
Toxicity, adverse events, and other safety endpoints will be monitored regularly and reported to the DSMB at each meeting.

  1-1 CHAPTER 1  
1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
1.1 Introduction 
Acute g raft-versus- host disease (GVHD)  is a frequent complication of allogeneic hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT) involving activation of donor T -lymphocytes against host tissues1. 
Despite immune suppression prophylaxis, up to 30- 50% of HCT recip ients will experience acute 
GVHD of varying severity1-3. The syndrome of acute GVHD  involves multiple target organs, 
including the skin (presenting most  frequently as a maculopapular rash), intestinal tract 
(presenting as nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea), and liver (presenting as cholestatic liver injury 
with or without transam inase elevation).  
The mainstay of treatment of acute GVHD  is high dose corticosteroids (CS), typically initially 
dosed at  the prednisone equivalent of 1- 2 mg/kg per day4. High dose CS have several 
shortcomings, including both limited efficacy as well as toxicity including infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis and osteonecrosis . Approximately 
50% of patients respond to CS, while only 30% have a durable response
5-7. Despite these 
limitations, no prospective study has demonstrated an advantage in response rate or survival for 
the addition of a second agent to CS  for the treatment of steroid naïve acute GVHD8-13. 
1.2 Results of Previous Acute GVHD  Therapy Trials  
To date, two multicenter acute GVHD  treatment trials have been conducted in the Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Clin ical Trials Network (BMT CTN). The first, BMT CTN 0302, was a 
multicenter, randomized, four -arm phase II trial that was designed to identify the agent most 
promising for use in addition to CS  for the front -line therapy of acute GVHD8. Patients with a 
new diagnosis of acute GVHD were randomized to receive either etanercept, mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), denileukin diftitox, or pentostatin in additional to high dose CS . The proportion 
of Day 28 CR/PR was highest in the MMF arm at 60%. Thus, MMF was selected for a randomized 
phase III trial of MMF versus placebo in addition to CS for first -line therapy of acute GVHD  in 
the subsequent study, BMT CTN 080213. In BMT CTN 0802, MMF did not meet the primary 
endpoint of extending GVHD -free survival at D ay 56 at a planned interim analysis of 235 patients, 
and the trial  was terminated for futility.  
It has been suggested that the enrollment of all newly diagnosed cases without regard to the likelihood of response to steroids alone or GVHD severity diminished the ability of these trials to 
show improvement beyond standard therapy. Neither BMT CTN 0302 nor 0802 was risk-
stratified according to clinical or biomarker -based strategies (nor any such trial published to date).  
To that end, application of risk- adaptive approaches targeting patients who have a lower 
likelihood of responding to steroids alone and; accordingly, a high-risk for non- relapse mortality 
(NRM), may identify cohorts capable of benefiting from intensification of immune suppression. 
1.3 Risk Stratification of Acute GVHD  
Identifying which patients are at increased risk of becoming steroid- refractory may help to better 
test novel agents in combination with CS or perhaps even alone. Different approaches to risk 
stratify patients with acute GVHD  have been recently developed a nd refined. These strategies 
include models built upon initial clinical staging of acute GVHD  target organs (e .g., skin, 
intestinal tract, and liver) and ser um biomarker -based approaches. Both of these strategies hold 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-2 value in identifying patients who a re likely to respond well ( i.e., demonstrate a complete response 
[CR] or partial response [PR]) to CS and thus less likely to die due to complications of the 
transplant (NRM)14-16. 
1.3.1 Risk Stratification by Clinical Grading using Onset Organ Severity  
In 1990, Weisdorf et al. identified in multivariate analyses that 
overall stage score (sum of each acute GVHD  organ stage 0 -4, plus 
1 point for upper GI, for a maximum score of 13) was strongly 
associated with likelihood of CR17. Based upon this initial 
observation that single organ involvement was more likely to 
achieve a CR than multi -organ involvement, the GVHD Risk 
Score was subsequently developed by the Minnesota group18. 
Multivar iate analysis of the outcomes of 864 consecutive patients 
from 1990- 2007 yielded the following high- risk organ stages:  skin 
stage 4, lower gastrointestinal stage 3/4, liver stage 3/4, or skin 
stage 3 plus lower gastrointestinal or liver stage > 2 GVHD.  
The GVHD Risk Score has recently been refined using data from multiple centers with a total of 1,723 patients used in modeling – 
the largest acute GVHD  cohort analyzed for their characteristics 
and outcomes to date
19. Developed using clinical grouping and 
recursive partitioning, this new Risk Score  
(http://z.umn.edu/MNAcuteGVHDRiskScore ) [referred to as 
Minnesota (MN) Risk Scores] can classify patients into high- risk 
(HR) or standard risk at the o nset of acute GVHD  symptoms. In 
this model, 84% of patients are classified as standard risk, defined as single organ involvement (stage 1- 3 skin or stage 1- 2 GI) or two 
organ involvement (stage 1- 3 skin plus stage 1 GI; or stage 1- 3 
skin plus stage 1- 4 liv er), with a Day 2 8 CR/PR rate of 69% 
(Figure 1-1).  All others are considered HR, wi th a Day 28 CR/PR 
rate of 43%. This model can be used in real time at the time of acute GVHD  diagnosis, making it practical for stra tification in 
clinical trials. Similarly, this model predi cted for 6 -month NRM 
(Standard risk 22% vs High risk 44%, p-0.001).  
1.3.2 Risk Stratification by Blood Biomarkers 
Development of risk profiles for patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD  that are predictive 
of outcomes independent of clinical staging have been a major advancement in acute GVHD  
research. Serum proteomic patterns associated with acute GVHD  were first published 
approximately a decade ago
20, 21. The University of Michigan group has significantly expanded 
the proteomic profiling of patients with acute GVHD  in recent years by developing a 3- level risk 
stratification system, Ann Arbor 1 (AA1) low -risk acute GVHD, Ann Arbor 2 (AA2) 
intermediate -risk acute GVHD , and Ann Arbor 3 (AA3) high- risk acute GVHD . The Ann Arbor 
score is based upon serum or plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor -1 (TNFR1), 
regenerating islet -derived 3 -alpha (REG3α), and suppres sion of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) measured 
at diagnosis of GVHD, regardless of clinical severity (grades I -IV). Each Ann Arbor score 
corresponds to a distinct risk of six- month NRM, such that AA1 GVHD has <  10% NRM, AA2 
GVHD ~25% NRM, and AA3 GVHD has >  40% N RM. The scoring algorithm was validated in  Figure 1-1 Comparison of 
Day 28 CR/PR in MN Standard vs  
High Risk aGVHD patients

Day 28 CR/PR in AA1, AA2, and

 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-3 an independent test set of patients with acute GVHD  from the University of Michigan and the 
University of Regensberg, and in a separate validation set from the BMT CTN acute GVHD  
treatment trials 0302 and 08027. Relapse rates do not differ between Ann Arbor scores and thus 
the differences in NRM translate into significant differences in survival. Differences in response 
to treatment account for the vast majority of differences in NRM. Patients with AA1 demonstrate 81% CR/PR at D ay 28 and AA2 patients demonstra te 68% CR/PR at D ay 28 ( Figure 1-1 and 
Figure 1-2). In contrast, high risk AA3 pat ients demonstrate 46% CR/PR at D ay 28. Furthermore, 
treatment responses for patients with AA3 GVHD are significantly less likely to be durable compared to AA1 and AA2 patients with only 21% of AA3 patients remaining in a CR without a flare at six months from diagnosis compared to 47% of AA1/2 patients (p  < 0.001). Importantly, 
similar proportions of patients are assigned to each Ann Arbor score in each of the three standard groupings of Glucksberg grades (I vs II vs III/IV). Thus, approximately 20% of all newly diagnosed GVHD cases have a high- risk biomarker profile and have lower likelihood of response 
to primary treatment and experience high NRM even when the clinical presentation is not severe, such as a < 50% skin rash (grade 1 acute GVHD ). Further, patients who present with a limited 
skin rash yet have a high -risk biomarker panel (AA3) have been shown to have high NRM due to 
subsequent development of ste roid-refractory lower GI GVHD. As such, the biomarker panel 
appears to identify patients who have or will develop high risk lower GI GVHD. More recently, 
the same group has validated these results using two of the original three biomarkers (ST2 and REG3α)
22. While promisin g to date, biomarker -based risk stratification has heretofore not been 
prospectively validated for determining eligibility in the context of a large multi- center GVHD 
treatment trial.  
1.3.3 Impact of Lower GI GVHD on NRM: Further R efinement of the R evised Minnes ota 
Prognostic 
As confirmed by the Minnesota grading system, isolated acute GVHD  of the skin is generally not 
life-threatening with the majority of patients responding to topical and/or systemic steroids. 
On the other end of the spectrum, patients who19, 23 experience advanced stage 3 -4 acute GVHD  
of liver (peak total serum bilirubin > 6 mg/dL) have poor outcomes but represent only 2% of the current transplant population
19, 24. While the incidence of severe gastro intestinal GVHD 
(stage 3- 4, or peak diarrheal volumes over 1.5 liters per day) has also decreased during the past 
decade, treatment remains unsuccessful in most cases, and the gastrointestinal tract is involved in virtually all fatal cases of acute GVHD
24. Accordingly, reducing acute GVHD mortality is 
contingent upon improving responses in patients with lower GI GVHD.  
Two distinct phenotypes of gut GVHD can be identified—upper gut (limited to stage 1) and mid-lower gut —that differ in presentation, natural history, response to therapy, and risk of 
mortality. The upper gut phenotype generally does not  progress to the mid -lower gut phenotype 
and has been shown not to impact NRM
25, 26. In contrast, the mid -lower gut phenotype of GVHD 
presents with se cretory, protein- rich diarrhea27, 28. In severe cases, the entire small intestine and 
colon are edematous and inflamed, with diarrheal volumes in excess of 1.5 liters per day often associated with mucosal ulceration, sloughing and bleeding and severe abdominal pain. Most  patients with severe mid -lower gut GVHD require prolonged hospitalization for supportive 
care including total parenteral nutrition and pain control. Although outcomes are typically poor, the standard initial therapy remains prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day, with addition of other immune suppressive therapies only when treatment with prednisone  fails to control the disease. Despite 
this approach, outcomes are poor in the approximately 50% of patients who do not  respond to 
high dose CS due to a high likelihood for treatment resistanc e to additional lines of immune 
suppression, infection, and considerable NRM. While de novo development of stage 3- 4 lower 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-4 GI GVHD clearly represents high risk acute GVHD , only a small percent (8%) of patients present 
with this stage, with the vast majority developing advanced organ stage later in their disease 
course while already on primary treatment (termed steroid -refractory)19. Taking this into 
consideration, targeting any patient who presents with diarrhea (regardless of volume) for clinical 
trials wou ld be one strategy to reduce GI GVHD -related mortality. Unfortunately, amongst 
patients who present with any lower GI tract involvement, a sizable fraction may do well with a steroid -alone approach, thereby diminishing the ability to det ect a meaningful effect  of 
investigational therapy.  
Recently, a database of 309 consecutive patients with GI GVHD was analyzed from The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center between the years of 2009-2012
29. 
Roughly half of the patients presented with isolated upper GI GVHD with minimal (<  500 cc in 
24 hours) stool output. An analysis of all the remaining patients with stage 1 or higher lower GI GVHD (either isolated or combined with another organ) is shown in Table 1 -1. From this analysis, 
patients with isolated lower GI stage  1 GVHD appear to have a higher D ay 28 response rate with 
roughly 3/4 of the patients resp onding to first -line therapy. Similar results were seen for patients 
enrolled onto two  consecutive acute GVHD trials within the Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN 0302 and 0802 trials) with a 75% Day 28 response rate  to 
first-line therapy for those presenting with i solated stage 1 lower GI GVHD ( Table 1 -1). 
However,  from these datasets, patients with isolated lower GI stage 2 or sta ge 1 lower GI plus 
skin have a Day 28 response rate of 50- 57% and despite being othe rwise “standard risk” per the 
Minnesota Clinical Staging system define a population at risk for treatment resistanc e who may 
potentially benefit f rom a high- risk treatment protocol.  Importantly, combining these subsets of 
GI GVHD with the Minnesota HR groups would increase study eligible patients from roughly 15% to 25-30%.

1.4 Study Hypothesis and Design 
Identification and novel treatment strategies for patients at risk for steroid resistance remains a 
major unmet clinical need. In this context it is hypothesized that administration of additional 
immune suppression capable of increasing response rates without toxicity will limit further progression of GVHD and improve outcomes. Reflective of the above advancements in risk 
stratification for patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD, we propose enrolling patients with newly -diagnosed Minnesota HR, isolated lower GI Stage 2 or Lower GI stage 1 plus any skin 
onto a prospective, double -blind, randomized, phase III trial of prednisone at a dose of 
2 mg/kg/day (or methylprednisolone- equivalent) plus α
1- Antitrypsin (AAT) or placebo. 
Our hypothesis is that the addition of the AAT, Zemaira®, a therapy with a demonstrated safety 
record as well as pre -clinical and clinical data in the setting of acute GVHD , will improve Day 28 
acute GVHD  response when added to CS in patients with newly diagnosed, HR acute GVHD . 
Patients who achieve a CR or PR to GVHD treatment at Day 28 have improved long- term 
outcomes (survival and NRM) when compared to non- responders and serves as a validated 
primary endpoint for acute GVHD  trials.

 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-6 1.5 Alpha  1-Antitrypsin (AAT) 
Alpha 1-A ntitrypsin (AAT) is a naturally occurring 52- kDa circulating protease inhibitor 
produced by the liver that inactivates several serine proteases from neutrophils and macrophages 
and protects tissues  from proteolytic degradation. Serum AAT concentrations in healthy 
individuals range from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/ml and can increase twofold during inflammation, coinciding with AAT’s role as an acute phase reactant
30. Congenital deficiency in AAT results in emphysema 
and cirrhosis of the liver31, 32. In addition, AAT deficiency has been associated with the 
development of various autoimmune diseases including necrotizing panniculitis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and glomerulonephritis
33. AAT is licensed for long- term 
augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with severe hereditary deficiency of AAT with clinically evident emphysema. Consistent safety of the investigational product when administered intravenously ( IV) for AAT deficiency has been observed in more than 14 years of use, with 
833,197.22 standard doses sold worldwide for the period between 01 July 2003 and 20 August 2017, corresponding to 16,023 patient -years. Post -marketing surveillance has shown that AAT is 
safe and well tolerated when used at the recommended dosage with no ass ociation with increased 
risk of infection. Recent research has elucidated immune regulatory roles of AAT , independent 
of protease inhibition, leading to growing interest in this therapy across various inflammatory and immune -mediated conditions. 
1.5.1 Alpha  1-Antitrypsin (AAT) as an I mmunomodulatory  
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated AAT to not only possess the ability to inhibit serine proteases, such as elastase and proteinase- 3, but also exert anti -inflammatory and tissue 
protective effects independen t of protease inhibition. AAT appears to effectively interfere with 
inflammatory responses and protect from cell death in a large number of in vivo  and in vitro  
experimental models reviewed in Table 1 -2 and Table 1-3. A noteworthy example includes the 
blockade of inflammatory cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
34. 
Specifically, AAT decreases the production of important inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF -α) and IL -1β, two prototypical upstr eam mediators of inflammation. 
AAT also lowers the levels of chemokines IL -8 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) -1, two 
major cytokines important in the traf ficking of inflammatory cells. While the activity of 
proinflammatory cytokines appears to consistently diminish in the presence of AAT, the release of anti -inflammatory mediators increases. For example, the endogenous inhibitor of IL -1 activity, 
IL-1 receptor antagonist, is upregulated by AAT in human blood cells
35. Similarly, IL -10 levels 
have been shown to increase by AAT in various experimental conditions34, 36 -39. An examination 
of the cellular targets of AAT, demonstrates it to be spec ific for members of the innate immune 
system, such as macrophages and neutrophils, as well as B -lymphocytes and dendritic cells. 
In contrast, responses of purified T -lymphocytes are consistently unaffected37, 38, 40- 43, allowing 
for a variety of responses to concanavalin A and anti -CD3/CD28 stimulation to persist. 
This cell-specific discretion, together with the ability to protect tissues from injury, sets AAT in 
a unique niche among modulators of the immune system and distinguishes it fr om classic 
immunosuppressants.

1.5.2 Alpha -1 Antitrypsin in Pre-Clinical M odels of GVHD  
It is believed that AAT acts as an immunomodulator59, allowing for expression of regulatory 
T-cell repertoires that support chimerism, immune tolerance, and protection of allografts. AAT 
was shown to inhibit cytokine release in a mouse model  and is likely to have an important 
protective role against inflammatory responses in GVHD due to its function as an acute -phase 
reactant.  

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-9 Studies suggest that inflammatory cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of GVHD60-62. 
Inflammatory cytokines promote end organ damage and so their suppression should be beneficial 
to patients at GVHD symptom onset.  In multiple experimental models of allogeneic HCT, the 
administration of AAT appears to have a number of effects: induction of anti -inflammatory 
cytokines and suppression of anti -inflammatory cytokines; indirectly altering the in vivo ratios of 
donor effector T -cells (Teff) to donor regulatory T -cells (Tregs); interference with activation of 
dendritic cells; and suppression of the development of GVHD42, 63, 64. In three independent 
laboratories using several different murine models of GVHD, administration of AAT improved 
survival and GVHD -severity scores when compared to mice treated with control, human albumin. 
Despite altering these ratios, AAT exposure did not impact T -cell function ( either Tcon or Treg) 
in vitro and in minimal residual disease (leukemia) models, AAT exposure did not appear to 
inhibit the graft -versus- leukemic effect. The impact of AAT on T -cell ratios was determined to 
result from the suppression of pro- inflammatory c ytokine secretion, namely, TNF -α, IL-1β and 
IL-6 and increased secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines I L-10 and IL -6 via inhibition of 
NF-κβ in dendritic cells.  
More recently, the mechanisms through which excessive inflammatory responses contribute to the pathophysiology of GVHD have been studied and suggest that AAT may be able to attenuate 
immune responses amplified by tissue injury. Detection of tissue damage by innate immune cells using pattern- recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense noninfectious mol ecular signatures [called 
danger- associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)] is known to augment adaptive immunity
65. 
Murine models have demonstrated that one such DAMP, heparan sulfate (HS), an extracellular matrix component, activates Toll -like receptor 4 on dendritic cells in vitro , leading to the 
enhancement of dendritic cell maturation and  alloreactive T -cell responses. In additio n, it was 
demonstrated that serum HS levels were acutely elevated at the onset of clinical GVHD in mice after allo -HSCT and treatment of mice with AAT decreased serum levels of HS, leading to a 
reduction in alloreactive T- cell responses and GVHD severity
63. Conversely, an HS mimetic that 
increased serum HS levels accelerated GVHD. Further, in patients undergoing allo- HSCT for 
hematologic malignancies, serum HS levels were found to be elevated and correlated with the severity of GVHD. These results identify a critical role for HS, and more broadly DAMPs, in promoting a cute GVHD after allo geneic HSCT and suggest that modulation of these 
inflammatory stimuli may have therapeutic potential for the control of clinical GVHD.   
1.5.3 Safety and Efficacy of AAT in Patients with Steroid -Refractory  Acute GVHD  
An investigator -initiated phase 2 open- label study with Zemaira® was conducted in 
40 steroid -refractory acute GVHD  patients (median age 50 years, range 18- 70) at a dose of 
60 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks
66. One third of the patients had lower GI GVHD; all stage 
3 or 4, while a quarter had live r-involvement (all stage 3/4). The overall response rate and 
complete response rate by Day 28 was 65% and 35%, respectively, and included responses in all GVHD target organs. At Day 60, responses were sustained in 73% of patients without intervening immunosuppression. Organ -specific responses w ere seen in skin, GI and liver. Importantly, 50% 
of patients with steroid -resistant lowe r GI GVHD achieved a D ay 28 CR. The treatment was well 
tolerated, with no infusion reactions or drug -related Grade 3/4 adverse even ts. A total of 7 patients 
died within 30 days of the last infusion of AAT with 5/7 of these patients having progressive acute GVHD , 1 patient dying from gram negative sepsis and 1 patient from interstitial pneumonia 
syndrome. 6-month overall survival was 45% [95% confidence interval (CI), 32 -63%]. 
In a second study, an open- label phase 1/2 clinical trial of Glassia® (Baxalta/Kamada) for 
steroid -refractory acute GVHD  was undertaken in 12 patients following HCT
67. Patients received

 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-10 AAT over a 15- day course: In Cohort 1, the  loading dose of AAT was 90 mg/kg IV on Day 1, 
followed by maintenance doses of 30 mg/kg/day IV on Days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. In Cohort 
2, the loading dose was 90 mg/kg IV on Day 1, followed by 7 maintenance doses of 60 mg/kg/day IV on the same sched ule (total weekly dosage of 270 mg/kg) . Eight of the 12 subjects included in 
the study, who had received allogeneic HCT, showed improvement in GVHD manifestations, with four showing complete improvement. Treatment response was particularly apparent in terms of sigmoidoscopic appearance of the GI tract and GI -related symptoms. Survival at the last 
follow- up (> 104 to > 820 days) was 50%. In this study, no clinically relevant signs of toxicity 
attributable to treatment with AAT were reported.

1.6 Dose Rationale for Plann ed Study  
In this trial we propose administration of AAT at a dose of 120 mg/kg twice weekly through 
Day 28. Responding patients (CR/PR) will continue to receive a once weekly dose of 120 mg/kg 
through D ay 56.  As is detailed below, there is a strong rationale for studying this dose in adults 
and adolescents for this disease population. 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-12 1.6.1 Acute Phase Reactant Properties of AAT  
AAT  is the most abundant, endogenous serine protease inhibitor in the circulation 30, 68, 69. 
Serum  AAT concentrations in healthy individuals range from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/mL and levels have 
been shown to further increase in inflammatory states 30, 70. Similar to C -react ive protein (CRP), 
AAT is a known acute -phase reactant whose serum levels rise in response to injury, inflammation, 
or infection71. High levels of AAT are commonly seen in various physiologic or disease states 
including: patients with colorectal cancer (mean 206 mg/dL, range 459 mg/dL), pregnancy (mean 
427 mg/dL; range 316–582 mg/dL), and pregnancy in diabetic women (mean, 786 mg/dL; range 523-1255 mg/dL) 
72-74. 
1.6.2 Pre-C linical Experience  with AAT  
Multiple  experimental models of allogeneic HCT  have shown that administration of AAT both 
reduces the development of, as well, as provides effective  therapy for established GVHD. 
These models implicate a reduction of inflammatory cytokines and an induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines as being integral to AAT’s efficacy
42, 63, 64. Addit ional models 
suggest that AAT’s effect on cytokines may occur in a dose -response fashion. For example, in a 
human pulmonary cell culture model simulating ischemia - reperfusion processes in lung 
transplantation, AAT significantly inhibited cell death and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose- dependent fashion in vitro , with maximal cell viability observed at concentration of 
5mg/ml
75. In addition, ex vivo assays performed on fresh whole blood from adult subjects with 
new-onset type 1 diabetes, AAT suppressed expression of IL -6 and IL -1β dose -dependently, with 
> 50% inhibition achieved in the range of 2.5 -5 mg/mL AAT76. Based on the totality of the 
evidence available, it is hypothesized that targeting AAT peak levels above the normal range or ≥ 2.5 mg/mL should down- regulate inflammatory cytokines and therefore provide pr otection 
against cytokine- mediated damage.  
1.6.3 Clinical Experience with AAT in HCT Setting  
Clearance of AAT as a result of stool losses has been used as a diagnostic tool in patients with protein- losing enteropathies including inflammatory bowel disease and GI  malignancies
77. 
Not surprisingly, patients with lower GI GVHD (also a protein- losing enteropathy) have been 
found to have increased clearance (via stool losses) of AAT. The first report detailing the measurement of levels of AAT in stool in allogeneic HCT recipients was by Weisdorf and colleagues in 1983 where it was demonstrated that patients receiving conditioning chemotherapy for transplant experience increased clearance of AAT as a result of higher (than normal) stool concentrations of AAT
78. Serial measurements of stool AAT showed that patients who did not go 
on to develop GI GVHD had a return to baseline levels whereas those who developed lower GI GVHD had a marked and persistent increased clearance of AAT. These finds were subsequently reproduced in two additional reports with one demonstrating that stool AAT levels at the time of GI GVHD onset could serve as an independent - predictor of GVHD response to therapy
79, 80. 
Based on these reports, accounting for increased stool losses of AAT in patients with lower GI GVHD requires consideration when dosing this agent for this study population. 
In additional support for a higher dosing regimen of AAT, a  prospective analysis by Marcondes 
and colleagues showed an inverse relationship between donor AAT levels and the occurrence of 
GVHD in matched sibling allogeneic HCT recipients, with average donor endogenous AAT levels of approximately 4 mg/mL reported to result in no incidence of GVHD
64. Further, in an 
open- label, single -center, phase 1/2 study of AAT in 12 heavily- treated patients with 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-13 steroid -refractory acute GVHD of the GI tract, an overall response rate of 66%, and complete 
response rate of 33% w as seen67. In this study, a cumulative weekly dose of 270 mg /kg/week was 
shown to be safe. Based on PK measurements, t he authors concluded that higher plasma levels 
for AAT via more extended/repeated courses of AAT and a longer maintenance regimen (beyond 
15 days as was used in this study) may be necessary to allow for  complete suppression of GVHD. 
In contrast, a second study of AAT for patients with newly diagnosed, steroid- refractory acute 
GVHD, AAT dosed at 60  mg/kg twice weekly resulted in a 65% overall response  rate at Day  2866. 
In this study, although AAT trough levels increased relative to study entry AAT levels, these trough levels were still with in the normal range at 4 weeks (2.15 mg/mL) suggesting that 
60 mg/kg twice weekly (120 mg total weekly dose) did not reach the optimal levels reflected in 
the above cited pre- clinical models.  
1.6.4 Clinical Experience with AAT in Adolescents  
Similar to adults, adolescent children are at signifi cant risk for mortality from GVHD and thus 
may derive potential benefit from equal  access to promising investigational therapies. 
Efficacy  and safety of AAT  in pediatric populations have been explored in several published 
studies of its use in type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ), where doses of either 180 mg/kg/week  or up to 
90 mg/kg/week were administered with no concerning adverse events (AEs) reported (Gottlieb et al
81 (AAT  product not specified), 2014; Rachmiel et al82 (Glassia®), 2016; Brener et al83 
(Glassia®), 2018; Weir et al84 (Aralast NP®), 2018). In these studies, AAT  therapy was report ed 
to be safe and well tolerated in children (Rachmiel et al82, 2016), including out to 5 years of 
surveillance (Brener et al83, 2018), and no safety differences were reported between adult and 
pediatric patients (Gottlieb et al81, 2014; Weir et al84, 2018).  Presently , there is no data on the use 
of AAT  treatment in acute GVH D or emphysema conditions in pediatri c populations. A s an 
endogenous protein with proposed weight- based  dosing and without evidence of differential 
pharmacokinetics between adults and children where studied, no differential safety profile is anticipated with its use in treatment of aGVHD.  Due to these co nsiderations, a stepwise plan was 
developed by the sponsor and protocol team (approved by FDA)  whereby  adolescent patients 
would be enrolled only after first observing no adverse safety signals after enrolling the first 
40 patients.  
1.6.5 AAT Target Level for Proposed Dose in Treatment of GVHD  
It is hypothesized that during acute GVHD, AAT may attenuate inflammation, inhibit 
development of T -memory cells and enhance Tregs and protect against damage and 
down- regulate inflammatory cytokines. The target level of AA T, based on both in vitro  and 
clinical data suggest that targeting a level above the upper limit of normal values  may provide the 
optimal regulation of T cells and cytokines to ameliorate GVHD symptoms. This target level of AAT is likely to provide sustain ed AAT levels, thereby enhancing Tregs and reducing the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines.  
A PK model of 1000 subjects has been used to simulate a variety of AAT doses and dose regimens, with the intent to identify those which result in mean AAT peak level estimates around or above the upper limit of normal, i .e., ≥ 2.5 mg/mL . The simulated concentration –time profiles 
generated using AATD PK estimates was validated with data in GVHD patients from the literature an d multiple doses were modeled. 
Based on this simulation, the dose of 120 mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks achieved median trough levels above the upper limit of normal ( ULN) and provided sufficient separation in median AAT 
levels when compared with a dose 60 mg/kg twice weekly. In addition, this dosing regimen shows 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version 5.0, August 14 , 2023  
  1-14 that >  50% of the simulated GVHD subjects at this dose regimen achieve serum AAT levels above 
normal physiologic levels  almost immediately after initiation of treatment, and levels are 
maintained  throughout the 28-day treatment  period. The cumulative weekly dose 
(240 mg/kg/week) is similar to the dose regimen of 270 mg/kg/week shown to be safe in 
Marcondes et al trial67.  
1.6.6 Ruxolitinib for the T reatment of S teroid -Refractory Acute GVHD  
The Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways play an important role in immune -cell activation and tissue inflammation during acute 
GVHD.  Ruxolitinib is an oral selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that reduces the incidence 
and severity of GVHD in vivo while preserving graft -versus -leukemia effects in preclinical 
models.  Recently, ruxolitinib was granted FDA approval in the United States for patients 12 years and older who develop steroid- refracto ry or  dependent acute GVHD grade II -IV based on the 
results of a prospective phase 2 trial (REACH1).  At a protocol -specified dose of 10mg twice 
daily, 54.9% of the 36 enrolled patients achieved a response on Day 28 without additional therapy. 
Simultaneous ly, an open- label, phase 3 trial (based on the same study criteria) was performed 
outside of the United States with patients randomized to ruxolit inib 10mg twice daily versus best 
available therapy (BAT).  The results on this study were recently published and showed a higher Day 28 and D ay 56 response rate in the ruxolitinib arm when compared to BAT (62% vs. 39%; 
odds ratio, 2.64; 95% C.I. 1.43 to 3.94; P< 0.001) and (40% vs. 22%; odds ratio 2.38; 95% C.I. 1.43 to 3.94; P< 0.001) , respectively .  Adverse events were not significantly different between 
the study arms with thrombocytopenia, anemia and  CMV infection being most common.   
The availability of an  FDA -approved agent for patients enrolled onto this trial may affect  the 
frequency and timing of use of next -line therapy.  Importantly, while the results of the RE ACH 1 
and 2 trials are encouraging, a majority of patients will not achieve or maintain a response through Day 56 of treatment with ruxolitinib and outcomes remain poor for patients with 
steroid -refractory acute GVHD.   In an effort to improve upon the outcomes seen thus  far with 
ruxolitinib  in a steroid -refractory setting, patients that progress or are non- responders on the 
current trial will have the option to stay on AAT/PTM when next- line therapy with ruxolitinib is 
initiated. These patients will be followed for secondary endpoints (while being considered a failure for the primary endpoint).  Importantly, the wealth of experience with AAT outside of the study indication would suggest that AAT is unlikely to have drug interaction with ruxolitinib nor contribute additional safety concerns.

2.5.1.6 Reconstitution/Preparation of AAT (Zemaira
®)/PTM  
Details with regard to preparation and distribution of the study drug can be found within the IMP  
Handling Instructions . AAT/P TM should be administered within 24 hours of preparation. 
2.5.1.7 Dose and Administration 
The first dose of study drug (AAT /PTM)  must  be initiated as soon as possible after enrollment 
and must be within 12 hours of enrollment . Each dose of study drug will be  120 mg/ kg (actual 
weight) based on the patient’s weight recorded at enrollment. Subsequent doses should be given 
on Days 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 ( Table 2 -1). The pat ient’s weight recorded at enrollment will 
be used to determine the dose for all infusions  (i.e., dose adjustments for changes in weight 
during the treatment period will not be made). 
Patients that are non -responders or progress will be considered to be steroid- refractory (SR) and 
may start next -line therapy as described in section 2.5.3.3. Ruxolitinib  is recommended for next-
line therapy as it is an FDA -approved treatment for SR -GVHD.   
Responding patients (CR/PR) at Day 28, compared to maximum GVHD organ staging within 
72 hours prior to enrollment, that are receiving study drug alone , or study drug plus ruxolitinib, 
should continue to receive treatment at a dose of 120 mg/kg (actual weight) on Days 35, 42, 49, and 56 ( Table 2 -1). Patients who are not  in CR/PR at Day 28 will not continue to receive study 
drug. Responding patients  at Day 28  who progress after Day 28 may continue to receive weekly 
doses through Day 56. 
Patients that receive next -line therapy other than ruxolitinib may not continue receiving study 
drug unless approval is granted by the BMT CTN 1705 Protocol Chairs.

or Day 1 . 
Patients can receive study drug (AAT /PTM ) as either an inpatient or outpatient. All subsequent 
treatments will have a window of ± 3 days to allow for efficient scheduling of patients  for 
holidays/weekends/e tc. Following administration of the first or second dose, adjusting future 
infusions to accommodate a Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday schedule is encouraged. 
Infusion Rate: AAT/ PTM  should be administered at a rate not exceeding 0.08 mL/kg body 
weight/minute.  If adverse events occur, the rate should be reduced,  or the infusion interrupt ed 
until the symptoms subside. The infusion may then be resumed at a rate tolerated by the subject. 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2 -7 Monitoring: Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) should be 
recorded at a minimum: pre -infusion, approximately 10 minutes into the infusion and 
approximately 20 minutes after completion of the infusion. It should be noted that infusion 
reactions during and following AAT administration ha ve been rep orted but are rare. 
These include: 
• Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100): hypersensitivity reactions (including tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, syncope, oxygen consumption decreased and pharyngeal oedema), flushing, infusion-site reactions (including infusi on site hematoma)  
• Very rare (< 1/10,000): anaphylactic reactions 
If anaphylactic or severe anaphylactoid reactions occur, the infusion should be discontinued immediately.  Epinephrine and other supportive therapy should be available for the treatment of 
any acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction.  
2.5.1.8 Dose Interruptions  
Study drug (AAT or PTM) may be held at the discretion of the treating physician and resumed at their discretion . Rationale for missed doses should be recorded. Patients that do not receive study 
medication for 3 consecutive doses or miss 4 doses in total will be removed from  further study 
treatment.  
Infections  
Patients with severe infections resulting in hemodynamic instability requiring use of vasopressor medication may have study drug held at the discretion of the treating physician. 
2.5.1.9 Adverse Events Related to Study Drug (AAT or PTM)  
Adverse Events  of
  Study Drug (AAT or PTM) 
Patients with a non-hematol ogic grade 3 or higher adverse event which is not attributable to an 
anticipated post- transplant event may have their study drug held at the attending physician’s 
discretion. Anticipated post- transplant events include GVHD and chemotherapy toxicities 
(see Appendix E and Section 2.5.2.2 respectively .). Study drug should be restarted after recovery 
of related toxicities to grade 2 or lower or identification of an alternative ca use for these toxicities.  
Observed adverse reactions as identified from clinical studies in AAT -deficient subjects and 
during post marketing use of AAT can be found in the Investigator Brochure AAT CSL964. 
Adverse Events related to PTM (Alburex) 
Adverse reactions to albumin 5% are rare, although nausea, fever, chills or urticaria may 
occasionally occur. 
 
2.5.1.10 Study Drug Discontinuation Criteria  
Patients that progress or are non- responders and receive ruxolitinib as next -line therapy are 
encouraged to continue study drug (AAT/PTM).   
Study drug shall be discontinued and not re- instituted if any one of the following criteria is met:  

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2 -8 • Patient does not receive study medication for 3 consecutive doses or 4 doses in total for 
any reason , including toxicity . 
• Patients that receive next -line therapy other than ruxolitinib not approved  by the BMT 
CTN 1705 Protocol Chairs. 
• Relapse or progressio n of underlying malignancy. 
• Pregnancy or initiation of breastfeeding during the study; refer to Section  4.4.5. 
• Withdrawal of consent from study and/or study drug 
The reason for discontinuation of study drug must be documented by the study team. 
All randomized patients, including those that did not receive any study drug, discontinued 
study drug and/or failed treatment, are evaluable for all endpoints of the study and should continue with protocol -specific follow -up and data collection unless the patient has 
specifically withdrawn consent to provide  data. 
2.5.2 Corticosteroids (CS)  
2.5.2.1 CS Dosing and Taper  
All patients enrolled on this trial must  receive CS at a minimum dose of prednisone 
2 mg/kg/day PO (or methylprednisolone 1.6 mg/kg/day IV) divided into 1 -2 daily doses as 
therapy for  acute GVHD  for at least 72 hours post enrollment . For patients that weigh over 
100 kg, maximal starting dose of prednisone will be 200 mg (or methylprednisolone -equivalent ). 
For calculation of subsequent CS  doses/kg on subsequent measures, the modified starting weight 
of 100 kg will be used. For patients less than 100 kg, dosing of steroids may follow institutional 
practices (with respect to actual versus adjusted weight). Daily dose per kg is based on the weight of the patient at time of enrollment. 
For responding patients with evidence of improvement  in signs and symptoms of acute GVHD  
after treatment initiation, a suggested CS  taper is provided below or may follow institutional 
practice. However, taper must not start sooner than 72 hours  after enrollment and the CS  dose 
must not be tapered to less than 0.25 mg/kg/day prednisone- equivalent  (or 0.2 mg/kg/day 
methylprednisolone) before Day 29. A suggested taper schedule is provided below.

 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2-9 2.5.2.2 Adverse Events Related to CS 
The side effects of prednisone are broad and well recognized.  They  include: 
• Cardiac and vascular: hypertension  
• Cutaneous: impaired wound healing, skin fragility, erythema, acne 
• Endocrine: cushingoid state, growth suppression (pediatric), secondary adrenocortical and 
HPA (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal) -axis suppression, diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia, 
body fluid retention, weight gain 
• Gastrointestinal: peptic ulcers, esophagitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal perforation 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
• General: edema, increased appetite  
• Hematologic: leukocytosis (transient) , lymphopenia  
• Musculoskeletal: myopathy, osteoporosis, tendon rupture, bone fractures, avascular necrosis of bones 
• Neurologic: Increased intracranial pressure, convulsions, headache, increased intraocular 
pressure, glaucoma, mood swings, restlessness, insomnia, personality changes, seizure, severe depression , or frank psychotic manifestations 
• Miscellaneous: increased risk of infection  
2.5.3 Supportive Care  
2.5.3.1 GVHD Prophylaxis Medications 
Non-investigational medications such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, m ycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF ), sirolimu s (if used as GVHD prophylaxis prior to the development of acute GVHD ) may 
be continued, resumed , or increased to  therapeutic doses per provider discretion, and 
adjusted /discontinued as necessary for renal, central nervous system (CNS) or other toxicity using 
institutional management guidelines . Resumption of a GVHD prophylaxis agent is not considered 
the addition of a next- line agent. Changing prophylactic agents within a drug class or to similar 
agents due to toxicity would not represent new therapy or treatment failure. 
2.5.3.2 Topical and Ancillary GVHD Therapies  
Topical therapy for acute GVHD is allowed and should be used according to institutional 
practices. Topical therapy including cor ticosteroid creams, topical tacrolimus, oral 
beclomethasone or budesonide, topical azathioprine , and ophthalmic glucocorticoids, is not 
considered as secondary systemic therapy.  
Ancillary/supportive care measures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti -motility agents for 
diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging or prevent hepatic transplant complications is 
also allowed according to institutional guideline s. 
2.5.3.3 Acute GVHD Progression or Non -response 
Acute GVHD Progression  (see Section 3.1.1 Response Definition for Progression ): 
A patient can not be declared as having progression  in acute GVHD  before 72 hours from the 
time of study randomization. Patients should receive at least 2 doses of AAT/PTM before  being 
declared as having acute GVHD progression (and starting next- line therapy).  Patients  receiving 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2 -10 ruxolitinib are encouraged to continue study drug (AAT/PTM), however, study treatment may be 
discontinued at the discretion of the treat ing physician.  
Acute GVHD No Response  (see Sect ion 3.1.1 Response Definitions for No Response ): 
An additional line of therapy (for non-response) must not be started before Day 7. A patient should 
receive at least 3 doses of study drug ( AAT/PTM ) before starting next line therapy for 
non- response.  
Ruxolitinib is recommended for next -line therapy as it is an FDA -approved treatment for 
SR-GVHD. Patients receiving ruxolitinib  are encouraged to continue study drug (AAT/PTM) to 
determine if the continuation of AAT can improve outcomes. Patients that are non -responders 
and receive next -line therapy other than ruxolitinib may not continue study drug (AAT or PTM) 
unless approval is granted by the BMT CTN 1705 Protocol Chairs.   
Patients who receive a non -protocol approved therapy for treatment of acute GVHD will be 
considered as treatment failure and study drug must be discontinued. Table 2-3 Timeline for Declaring Patient as having Acute GVHD  Progression or No

2.5.3.4 Acute GVHD Flare  
A flare is defined as any progression of acute GVHD after an initial r esponse ( i.e., earlier CR or 
PR) that requires re -escalation of steroid dosing, or initiation of additional topical or systemic 
therapy. 
If acute GVHD flares  during taper of CS , the dose of steroids may be increased at the discretion 
of the treating physician as long as this increase is to less than 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
(or methylprednis olone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day). Doses  otherwise above these parameters  will 
be considered as  a “new agent” and the patient will be scored as a failure. Other Supportive Care 
Guidelines 
In addition to prescribed study drug plus CS, all patients should receive the following per 
institutional practice : 
• Transfusion support  
• Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes viruses, Pneumocystis jiroveci, ba cterial and 
fungal infections. 
• Routine CMV antigenemia /viral load testing by hybrid capture or PCR -based  methods 
(with preemptive therapy in patien ts who develop a positive assay). CMV testing is 
recommended weekly through at least Day 100 post -transplant. Prophylaxis against CMV 
is allowed.  

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
  2-11 • Co-enrollment onto supportive care and infectious disease protocols will be allowed on 
case-by-case basis and requires approval by study chairs and sponsor.  
2.6 Study Unblinding  
Subjects and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study will be 
blinded to the study treatment  except for  the investigational pharmacy staff involved in study drug 
preparation . In addition, CSL’s Clinical Trial Supply team, CSL’s IRT team, and the Suvoda IRT 
team and system  are unblinded. Unblinding of the study drug should only be considered for 
participant safety contingent upon knowing the blinded study drug assignment. In situations that satisfy these criteria, the Investigator may break the blind per the processes laid out in the BMT CTN 1705 Unblinding Procedures.  The reason for unblinding must be fully documented. 
Any unblinding by the investigational staff must be reported immediately as outlined in the BMT 
CTN 1705 Unblinding Procedures and must include an explanation of why the study medication was unblinded. If possible, CSL Behring should be consulted prior to unblinding of the study 
drug. The Sponsor may break the treatment code for participants who experience a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), to  determine if the individual case or a group of 
cases requires expedited regulatory reporting. 
2.7 Study Conduct  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol , the IMP Manual, the Suvoda IRT 
system, the BMT CTN Administrative MOP, and the following: 
• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki  
• Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines  
• Applicable laws and regulations 
 
The National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) single Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of 
Record  will oversee this study and conduct the study- specific reviews as required by federal 
regulations and per the NMDP IRB Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 
Site personnel will enter enrollment data and post randomization data in the electronic case report 
form s (eCRF s) in Advantage eClinical as described in the BMT CTN 1705 Forms Guide . 
Randomization will be conducted in the Suvoda IRT system  after enrollment has been completed 
in Advantage eClinical . Source documentation should be made available for monitoring visits , 
audits, and regulatory inspections as described in the BMT CTN Administrative MOP.   
Participating Principal Investigators bear ultimate responsibility for training of site staff as well  
as the scientific, technical, and administrative aspects of conduct of the protocol, even when 
certain tasks have been delegated to coinvestigators, sub -investigators, or staff.  The PIs have a 
responsibility to protect the rights and welfare of participants and comply with all requirements regarding the clinical obligations and all other pertinent requirements in 21 CFR part 312. In addition to following applicable federal, state, and local regulations, investigators are expected 
to follow ethical principles and standards and receive training in GCP every three years and human subjects training within the past 3 years and thereafter as per institutional requirements.

  3-1 CHAPTER 3  
3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an overall (complete or partial) 
response to acute GVHD treatment at D ay 28 post -randomization, compared to maximum GVHD 
organ staging within 72 hours prior to enrollment. Patients without a Day 28 response assessment will be considered failures. Acute GVHD will be graded and assessed for response based on Harris 
(Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium [ MAGIC ]) Criteria  (refer to  APPENDIX C ). 
3.1.1 Response D efinitions  
Response definitions are listed below:  
1. Complete Response (CR) is defined as a score of 0 for the GVHD staging in all evaluable 
organs.  
2. Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with GVHD symptoms without progression in others. 
a. Very good partial response (VGPR) is defined as a quantitative and functional response that closely approximates CR. Patients must have all of the  following 
clinical features. i.e. , (1) no rash or rash involving <  25% of body surface area 
(BSA ) without bullae (residual faint erythema and hyperpigmentation do not 
count), (2) serum bilirubin <  2mg/dl or <  25% of baseline at enrollment and 
(3) ability to tolerate food or enteral feedings with predominantly formed stool 
(no overt GI bleeding or cramping and no more than occasional nausea or vomiting). 
3. Mixed response (MR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs with deterioration 
in another organ manifesting symptoms of GVHD or development of symptoms of GVHD 
in a new organ. 
4. No Response (NR) is defined as absence of any improvement or progression as defined.  
5. Progression is defined as deterioration in at least one organ without any improvement in others.  
Patients who receive next- line systemic GVHD therapy  (or escalation of steroids to 
≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) before Day 28 
will be classified as NR. Responses categorized as  NR, MR and progression will be treated as  
a failure for the primary endpoint.  
3.2 Secondary Endpoints   
3.2.1 Duration of Response (DOR)  
The duration of response (DOR) is defined as time from the Day 28 response (CR or PR) to any of the following events: re currence/progression of acute GVHD, new systemic salvage therapy for 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3-2 acute GVHD, re- escalation of steroids to greater or equal to 2.5 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent, 
or death from any cause. Patient s without any of these events will censored at last follow up. DOR 
will be evaluated at 6- and 12-months post-randomization. 
3.2.2 Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)  
An event for non- relapse mortality (NRM) is death without prior evidence of relapse/progression 
of the primary disease, where relapse/progression is treated as a competing risk. The  cumulative 
incidence of NRM at 6 months and 12 months post-randomization w ill be evaluated .  
3.2.3 Overall Survival (OS) and Progression -Free S urvival (P FS)  
Overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival ( PFS) will be evaluated at 6 months and 
12 months post -randomization. An e vent for OS is death from any cause , while an event for PFS 
is death from any cause or relapse/progression of the primary disease. 3.2.4 GVHD -Free S urvival 
Patients alive, free of active acute or chronic GVHD , and without other systemic agents 
(or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or met hylprednisolone equivalent of 
2 mg/kg/day]) added for treatment of GVHD  will be considered successes for this endpoint. 
The proportion of participants with GVHD -free survival at Day 56 post- randomization will be 
evaluated .  
3.2.5 Proportion of R esponse  
The proportion of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF)  
will be described at D ays 7, 14, 21, 28, 56 and 86 post- randomization. The Day 86 response will 
be assessed in patients remaining on maintenance treatment after D ay 28. T he designation of TF  
will consist of patients with NR, MR, progression or initiation of additional systemic ( next- line) 
GVHD therapies  (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone 
[or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) . Death from any cause will also be considered 
a TF.  
3.2.6 Proportion of Response ( Next -Line Therapy)  
The proportions of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure (TF) 
at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 86 post -randomization for patients  who receive ruxolitinib or other 
next- line therapies approved by the protocol Chairs as next -line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM. 
3.2.7 Systemic Infections  
The incidence of G rade 2 to 3 systemic infections , as defined in Appendix G, occurring from 
randomization until 30 days after last dose of study drug (AAT or PTM ) will be described . 
Infections developing after randomization will be recorded by site of disease, date of onset, and 
severity.  

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3-3 3.2.8 Adverse Events  
The incidence of  Grade 3 -5 treatment- emergent adverse events  (per Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE ] Version 5.0)  that occur from randomization until 30 days  
after last dose of study drug (AAT or PTM ) will be described .  
3.2.9 Chronic GVHD  
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be evaluated at 6- and 12-months 
post-randomization, where death is treated as a competing risk. Chronic GVHD is defined per 
National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Consensus Criteria (see APPENDIX C ). Diagnosis of chronic 
GVHD of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe) is considered an event for this endpoint.  
Organ  involvement and maximum severity  will also be described at 6 and 12 months. 
3.2.10 Disease Relapse  
The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression of the primary disease will be evaluated at 6- and 
12-months post-randomization, with death prior to relapse/progression treated as a competing risk.  
Malignancy relapse is defined as follows :  
Relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of acute leukemia  or 
myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) consistent with pre -transplant features, or radiologic evidence 
of lymphoma, documented or not by biopsy.  Progression of disease applies to patients with 
lymphoproliferative diseases (lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) not in remission prior 
to transplantation. The event is defined as increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of 
new sites of disease, documented or not by biopsy.  
Acute leukemia – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is:  
- Reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the peripheral blood; or,  
- > 5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to another cause ( e.g., bone marrow 
regeneration) 
- The development of extra medullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid  
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Satisfying criteria for evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (blasts greater than 20%), OR  
- Reappearance of pre -transplant morphological abnormalities detected in bone marrow 
specimens combined with a decrease in PB chimerism; OR  
- Reappearance of pre -transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least one metaphase by 
routine metaphase cytogenetics or a positive test by FISH on each of two separate 
consecutive examinations at least one month apart, regardless of the number of metaphases 
analyzed  
- For patients with:  
o Less than 5% blasts: greater or equal to 50% increase in blasts to greater or equal to 5% blasts confirmed by flow cytometry  
o 5%-10% blasts:   greater or equal to 50% increase to greater or equal to 10% blasts 
confirmed by flow cytometry

 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3 -4 Lymphoproliferativ e Diseases  – Relapse or progression will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, 
even if other l esions are decreasing in size.  Increased fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG) uptake in 
a previously unaffected site will only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic confirmation.  
- A
t least a 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the product diameters of any previously 
involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions ( e.g., splenic or 
hepatic nodules). To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by > 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or 
more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
- L esions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG -avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (<  1.5 cm in its long axis by CT). 
- In addition to the criteria above, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) who 
present in complete remission prior to transplantation may fulfill the relapse definition if 
there is reappearance of circulating malignant cells that are phenotypically characteristic of CLL.  
For other diseases not listed probable or definitive evidence of progression must be documented by biopsy, imaging, or peripheral blood findings that are diagnostic or otherwise consistent with that disease state.  
*Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapsed malignancy, including the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy , or donor lymphocyte infusion, will be 
considered evidence of relapse/progression regardless of whether the criteria described above were met.  
Non-malignant Diseases:   
Non-malignant diseases will be considered to have a transplant status of persistent/active disease. 
Graft failures will be considered recurrence.  
3.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
3.3.1 AAT Levels  
AAT levels will be assessed using  measurement s of serum  antigen concentration and functional 
activity just prior to infusion and 30 min (+ /- 15 min) post -end of  infusion on Day 0, and on 
Days  16, 28, and 56 post- initiation  of treatment . Post- infusion measurements are limited to 
subjects receiving a dose of AAT/PTM . AAT  levels  will be measured only prior to infusion on 
Days 8 and 24 post- initiation of treatment .  
3.3.2 Stool AAT,  Microbiome, and Metabo lome 
Stool concentrations of AAT  at baseline and at D ays 8 and 28 post- initiation of treatment (or at 
treatment discontinuation  (TD) if prior to Day 28)  at a subset of centers for a  limited cohort of 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT  
 Version  5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  3-5 patients . Samples will be stored for future analysis of the stool microbiome, metabolome , and 
biomarkers.  
3.3.3 Immune Subset s  
The changes in peripheral blood ratios of T regulatory to T effector (Treg/Teff) cells  and Natural 
Killer (NK) cells and other relevant immune subsets at baseline and at D ays 16, 28, and 
56 post- initiation of treatment (or at  treatment discontinuation (TD)  if prior to Day 56).  
3.3.4 Inflammatory Cytokines and GVHD Biomarkers  
Serum  levels of IL -1β, IL -6, IL -10, TNFα, amphiregulin ( AREG) , HS, ST2 , and REG3α will be 
evaluated at baseline and at Day s 8, 28, and 56 post -initiation  of treatment  (or at treatment 
discontinuation (TD)  if prior to Day 56) . Remaining samples will be retained for analysis of 
additional relevant cytokines, DAMPs and GVHD biomarkers. 3.3.5 Overall and Organ -Specific Response Rates by Refined Minnesota Risk and 
Biomarker-B ased Risk Classifications  
The proportions of patients with an overall response (complete or partial) at Day 28 
post- randomization will be described by Refined Minnesota risk category (high or standard risk) 
and by Ann Arbor biomarker risk score (1, 2, or 3). Additionally, the response rate of each GVHD target organ will be described at Day 28 by Refined Minnesota risk and Ann Arbor biomarker risk. An organ response is defined as a decrease in staging of that organ from baseline. The organ- specific response rate will be evaluated only using patients with a staging greater than 
0 in the corresponding organ at baseline. 
3.3.6 Systemic Corticosteroid Dose 
The systemic corticosteroid  dose will be evaluated at baseline and on Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 86, 
6 months and 12 months post-randomization.  3.3.7 CMV -Reactivation 
The p roportion of patients requiring new systemic treatment for an increasing CMV PCR level per 
institutional practice for CMV -reactivation will be evaluated at  Day 56 post -randomization. 
Patients receiving only standard of care viral prophylaxis will not be included in this assessment 3.3.8 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Patient -reported outcomes for both adolescents and adults will be assessed at baseline, Days 28, 
56 and 180 post-randomization by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory
85 (MDASI), and selected 
Patient -Reported Outcome Measurements Information System ( PROMIS ) subscales for 
gastrointestinal symptoms, physical function and satisfaction with participation in social roles. 
Adolescent versions should be completed by patients who are less than 18 years of age at the time 
of enrollment. The instruments will be scored according to the recommendations of the developers. Patient -reported outcomes ( PRO ) data wil l be collected electronically.  The MDASI instrument 
will only be offered to English- and Spanish- speaking patients. The PROMIS instrument will only 
be offered to English-speaking patients. The instruments cannot be completed by surrogates.

  4-1 CHAPTER 4 
4 PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION 
4.1 Approaching Patients, Eligibility Screening and Obtaining Consent  
Patients with previously untreated, acute GVHD meeting eligibility criteria will be approached as 
soon as possible after diagnosis. Patients willing to participate in the trial will sign a NMDP 
IRB-approved consent or assent form , and eligibility for enrol lment will be further evaluated.  
4.2 Enrollment  and Randomization 
Patients will be  (1) enrolled  using the BMT CTN Advantage eClinical system and then 
(2) randomized in the Suvoda Inte ractive  Response Technology ( IRT) system . The IRT system 
will also provide the study drug supply management. Patients will be randomized to AAT  versus 
PTM  in a 1:1 ratio. The following procedures shall be followed: 
Patients must be enrolled in Advantage eClinical prior to randomization in the Suv oda IRT 
System.  
1. An authorized user at the clinical center completes the initial screening by entering patient demographics, eligibility  information (consent date, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and 
patient’s weight on the Enrollment Form  in Advantage eClini cal. 
2. If the patient is eligible, “successful enrollment’ is displayed along with a patient study 
ID# number and patient’s weight.  Information regarding participant’s log- in information 
for the ePRO system is  also included. The coordinator should print two copies of the 
screen:  one for the patient’s chart and one for the study participant. 
3. Immediately after  the patient is succes sfully enrolled / deemed  eligible in Advantage 
eClinical, the authorized user must  register the pat ient in the Suvoda  IRT system  for 
randomization to occur . The user enters the Patient ID# assigned in eClinical, 
demographics (year of birth, age, and sex) and  weight at time of enrollment.  
4. The Suvoda  IRT system will determine the patient’s randomization assignment and 
automatically email the site’s investigational pharmacist on record with the following information: Patient ID #, Visit # and the specific kits to be used to prepare the patient’s assign ed treatment.  
5. A visit schedule based on enrollment date is displayed in Advantage eClinical for printing. 
If a connection is interrupted during an enrollment session  in Advantage eClinical , the process is 
completely canceled and logged. A backup manual enr ollment system will also be available to 
provide for short -term system failure or unavailability.  If the  Suvoda IRT system is interrupted or 
down, the Suvoda Help Desk must be notified.  
A patient is considered on the study once randomization in the IRT system is complete .  
Patient must begin study drug (AAT or PTM) within 12 hours of enrollment  in Advantage 
eClinical.

  4 -2 4.3 Study Monitoring 
4.3.1 Follow-U p Schedule  
The Follow -up Schedule for scheduled study visits is outlined in Table 4 -1. The timing of 
follow- up visits is based on the date of enrollment. A detailed description of each of the forms 
and the procedures required for forms completion and submission can be found in the Data 
Management Handbook and User’s Guide. 
Criteria for Forms Submission : Criteria for timeliness of submission for all study forms are 
detailed in the BMT CTN 1705 Forms Guide. Forms that are not entered in Advantage eClinical 
within the specified time will be considered delinquent. Transplant Centers can view past due 
forms via Advantage eClinical. A missing form will continue to appear until the form is entered into Advantage eClinical, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Forms  Guide. 
Reporting Patient Deaths:  T
 he Recipient Death Information must be entered into the web -based 
data entry system within 24 hours  of knowledge of a patient’s death even if the cause of death is 
unknown at that time. Once the cause of death is determined, the form must be updated.  
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Data R
eporting:  Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must r egister pre - and post -transplant 
outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their institution during their time of participation to the CIBMTR.  Registration is done using procedures and forms of 
the Stem Cell Transpl ant Outcome s Database (SCTOD). (Note: Federal legislation requires 
submission of these forms for all US allotransplant recipients.) CIBMTR post - transplant Report 
Forms must continue to be submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial.  Additionally, CIBMTR 
pre- and post - transplant Report Forms must also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this 
trial according to the randomization assigned to the patient at the time of initial registration with the C IBMTR. Long- term follow -up of patients on this study will continue through routine 
CIBMTR mechanisms.

  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-7 4.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse event (AE) reporting is  summarized below  with the specific requirements described 
under Section 4.4.4.  
4.4.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical in vestigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An adverse event ( AE) therefore is  any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether related or not related to the IMP/PTM 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
An adverse event can be Anticipated or Unanticipated 
• Anticipated adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting 
from the underlying disease, the HCT, or acute GVHD and not related to study drug. 
Investigator should refer to the anticipated event list (see Appendix E) to assess whether or not an event  is anticipated. Anticipated events will be collected in the data capture 
system through calendar -driven forms (Toxicity, GVHD, etc.) and event -driven forms 
(Death, Infection, etc.).  Events that meet serious criteria should be reported as detailed in 
Secti on 4.4.4.2. 
• Unanticipated adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity, or frequency from 
information in the current anticipated event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unanticipated events would also include those that have not been previously described as a result of the underlying disease requiring HCT, the HCT or acute GVHD. 
The following are anticipated adverse events  and do NOT require reporting as an AE/SAE : 
• Disease progression of primary malignancy 
• GVHD and symptoms of  GVHD (these are recorded in acute and chronic GVHD eCRFs)  
• Infections 
• Graft failure  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example: 
o Plann ed hospitalizations due to pr e-existing conditions, which have not  worsene d 
(e.g., HCT)  
o Hospitalizations that occur for procedures not due to an AE (e.g., cosmetic surger y) 
o Hospitalizations for a diagnostic procedure where the hospital stay is less than 
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (e.g., chemotherapy) 
o Overdose of  AAT or any concomitant thera py that does not result in any adverse signs 
or symptoms.  (An overdose is a dose higher than the dose established in the 
protocol.  For this study, the protocol dose is 120 mg/kg.  There is a 5% variance that 
is allowed due to the rounding permitted in the preparation of the IMP. Therefore, an 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-8 AAT dose ≥1.06% of 120 mg/kg (i.e., 126 mg/kg) that does not result in any adverse 
signs or symptoms would not require reporting as an AE/SAE.) 
 
Laboratory findings do NOT need to be reported as  AEs in the following case s: 
• Laboratory parameters already  beyond the reference range at  screenin g, unless a further 
increase / decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pr e-existing conditio n. 
• Abnormal hematological laboratory parameters considered anticipated due to 
myelo ablative conditioning regimen or other permitted chemotherapy trea tments are not 
considered AEs.  
• An abnormal laboratory  value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analys is, preferab ly 
in the same laboratory  (i.e., the previous result could be marked as not valid and should 
not necessarily  be reported as an AE).  
Serious Adverse Event:  A serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by per 21 CFR 312.32, is any 
adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes, regardless of causality, anticipation,  
and/or expectedness:  
• Results in death 
• Is life -threatening.  Life-threatening means t hat the person was at immediate risk of death 
from t he reaction as it occurred, i.e. , it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay). 
Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  or 
• Is an important medical event  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is also 
appropriate in situations other than those listed above. For example, important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above (e.g., suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product is considered a 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-9 Serious Adverse Event). Any event is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it is associated with 
clinical signs or sy mptoms judged by the I nvestigator to have a significant clinical impact.  
4.4.2 Classification of Adverse Events by Severity  
The severity refers to the intensity of the reported event. The Investigator must categorize the severity of each SAE according to the Na tional Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE Version 5.0. 
CTCAE guidelines can be referenced at the following website: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.pdf. For any term that is not specifically listed in the CTCAE scale, intensity will 
be assigned a grade of one through five using the following CTCAE guidelines: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; min imal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated;  disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
4.4.3 Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Investigational Product 
The relationship of each reported event to the study therapy will be assessed by the Investigator; after careful consideration of all relevant factors such as (but not limited to) the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the SAE, temporal relationship to any study therapy interventions and dechallenge or rechallenge according to the following guidelines: 
• P
ossibly, Probably, or Definitely Related:  there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
therapy caused the event. A relationship of possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational product is considered related  for the purposes of regulatory authority 
reporting. 
• Unlikely, or Not Related:  T here is no reasonable possibility that the investigational 
product caused the event. An unlikely or not related relationship to the investigational product is considered not related  for the purposes of regulatory authority reporting.  
4.4.4 Required Adverse Event Reporting  
4.4.4.1 Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All non- serious adverse events will be reported from randomization until 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug (AAT/PTM). Some anticipated non -serious events will be collected on 
calendar -driven forms or event -driven forms (Infection, GVHD, Graft Failure, Readmission/ 
Hospitalization,  and Progression/Relapse).  

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-10 4.4.4.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
All SAEs will be reported from randomization until 30 days after the last dose of study drug 
(AAT/PTM). In  addition, any SAE assessed as related to the investigational product that occurs 
after the 30 -day foll ow-up period must be reported. Any unanticipated SAE from 31 days after 
the last dose of study drug through the study defined follow up (1 -year post enrollment) are 
required to be reported  through the expedited AE reporting system in Advantage 
eClinical . Additionally, any grade 4 anticipated event not collected on the calendar -driven 
toxicity or specified event -driven form must  also be reported through the expedited AE 
reporting system in Advantage eClinical. For this study, the reporting will be based on unanticipated in place of the MOP definition of unexpected.  
All reported SAEs are to be f ollowed up until resolved, the Investigator judges an event as no 
longer clinically significant, or until the event stabilize s/becomes chronic to the extent that the 
event can be fully characterized.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting syste m via 
electronic data c apture. L ife-threatening and fatal SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event. All other SAEs must be reported within 1 business day of knowledge of the event. Events entered in the EDC will be reported using NCI’s CTCAE Version 5.0. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive reports of all unanticipated/ unexpected SAEs 
upon review by the BMT CTN Medical Monitor  and CSLB. Summary reports for all reported 
SAEs will be reviewed by the DSMB on at least an annual basis. 
4.4.4.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
The Sponsor has a list of events classified as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). 
These include ‘anaphylactic infusional  reaction ’ and ‘ suspected transmission of a viral agent via 
a medicinal product. ’ Both events must be reported through the expedited AE reporting system 
via Advantage eClinical and must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event even if it does not meet serious criter ia. 
4.4.4.4 Toxicity Reporting 
Toxicities are a subset of anticipated adverse events determined to be from the underlying disease pr
ocess, HCT, GVHD prophylaxis, or corticosteroid use, and generally are not considered to be 
related to the study product. The  toxicities listed in  APPENDIX E  w ere pre-determined by the 
Protocol Team.  
Once the participant has reached 31 days from last dose of study drug, toxicities listed in APPENDIX E  should be reported at the specified time points on the Toxicity CRF. If an event 
listed is determined to be serious and related to AAT, it  should be reported via the expedited 
reporting process on the AE/SAE case report form (CRF).  
4.4.5 Pregnancy  
A female subject or female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant from randomization up to and including 30 days after the last dose of study drug , must notify  the In vestigator 
immediately. CSLB must be notified within 5 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
  4-11 If a female subject becomes pregnant, she must discontinue treatment with the study drug  but may 
continue other study procedures at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Whenever possible, a pregnancy in a subject or in a female partner of a male subject exposed to 
study drug should be followed to term to assess any potential occurrence of congenital anomalies or birth defects. Any follow -up information, including premature termination and the status of the 
mother and child after deliv ery, should be reported by the Investigator through the expedited AE 
reporting system in Advantage eClinical .  All abnormal pregnancies and neonatal outcomes 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,  or congenital anomaly) will meet the criter ia 
for SAE classification. The I nvestigator should follow the procedure for reporting these events as 
SAEs.

   5-1 CHAPTER 5  
5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1 Study Design  
This study is a phase III, multicenter, double -blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled trial 
designed to compare AAT and corticosteroids ( CS) to placebo -to-match ( PTM ) and CS as 
first-line therapy for patients with high- risk acute GVHD.  
The study consists of an interim analysis for futility and a 12-month analysis at the end of the 
study. An additional analysis  will be conduc ted after  all randomized patients  in the study complete 
6 months of follow -up. Multiplicity adjustment is not needed for this analysis  as all the patients 
would have completed the Day  28 primary endpoint visit by the time of analysis .   
The target enrollment is 136 patients from approximately 25 centers with 68  patients assigned to 
each arm.  
5.1.1 Accrual  
It is estimated that an accrual period of 36 months ( assuming a steady state of 4 patients per month  
after ramp up) will be necessary to enroll the target sample size. Accrual wi ll be reported by race, 
ethnicity, gender, and age.  
5.1.2 Randomization 
Following enrollment, patients will be stratified by centers and randomized within each center in 
a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of random sizes for the two treatment arms.  
Treatment practices differ considerably by centers. This includes the time to declare a patient refractory to steroids and potentially initiate next- line therapy. The variability by center may 
produce greater differences in treatment groups compared with age (adolescent  vs adult), GHVD 
risk or disease. Additionally, the pathobiology of GVHD in both adolescent and adult and in malignant and non- malignant disease patient populations are similar. Therefore, since the 
presentation of GVHD and the anticipated response to trea tment are expected to be similar, center 
was prioritized as the primary stratification variable.  
5.1.3 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with an overall (complete or partial) 
response to acute GVHD treatment at Day 28 post -randomization. Patients without a Day 28 
response assessment will be considered failures. Acute GVHD will be graded and assessed for response based on Harris  Criteria (refer to  APPENDIX C ). Patients who receive  next-line 
systemic GVHD therapy (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day]) before Day 28 will be classified as NR. Responses categorized as NR, MR and progression will be treated as a failure for the primary endpoint. The primary analysis will be performed using the intent -to-treat principle. Therefore, 
all randomized patients will be in cluded in the primary analyses. 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-2 5.1.4 Primary Hypothesis 
The primary null hypothesis is that the odds ratio for response (CR/PR) at Day 28 between the 
treatment groups, adjusted for center, is equal to 1 versus the alternative hypothesis that the odds 
ratio is greater than 1  (AAT+CS versus PTM +CS). Therefore, an odds ratio greater than one 
means the response rate is higher in the AAT+CS group compared with the PTM+CS group. This null hypothesis will be tested using a one-sided significance level of 2.5%.  
5.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The primary analysis will be based on a Wald test from a mixed effects logistic regression to test 
the odds ratio for response between the groups, adjusted for center and GVHD risk (Group A vs Group B; see Section 2.4.1, #3) as describ ed in Section 5.6. We approximate the sample size and 
power requirem ents for this study based on a two -sample Z test of response rates. H istorical 
control data indicates  that the overall response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 for high risk acute GVHD 
is approximately 50%. We further anticipate that the treatment will increase res ponse rate to 75%. 
We planned a single boundary (nonbinding futility) design for testing a one -sided hypothesis with 
one interim analysis for futility, when 56% of the information is evaluable (76 patients or 38 per arm) , and a 12-month analysis using a design based on the Gamma  family spending function with 
parameter  γ = -8. Therefore, a sample size of 136 patients ( 68 per arm) is required to sufficiently 
maintain a one -sided type I error of 2.5% while providing 86% statistical power for a one -sided 
test to detect an effect size of 25%. All statistical a nalyses will be done using SAS Version 9.4 or 
higher or R V ersion 3.4.4 or higher. 
5.3 Study  Analysis Schedule and Safety Stopping Guidelines  
The study will consist of an interim analysis for futility after 56% of the patients  (n=76)  are 
evaluable, at a time coincident with a regularly scheduled meeting of the NHLBI -appointed 
DSMB , and a 12-month analysis after accrual and follow up for the primary endpoint is complete. 
An additional  analysis  will be conducted after all the randomized patien ts in the study complete 
6 months of follow -up post-randomization. This analysis is conduct ed to expedite the pr imary 
endpoint evaluation  for potential regulatory submission . Multiplicity adjustment is not needed for 
this analysis as all the patients would have completed the Day  28 primary endpoint visit by the 
time of analysis . The details for this  6-month analys is, including the data to be included, will be 
specified in the statistical analysis plan .   
Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN’s Manual of Procedures. The stopping guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stopping rules” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment. Toxicity, adverse events, and other safety endpoints will be monitored regularly and reported to the DSMB at each meeting.  
5.3.1 Interim Analysis for Futility  
Analyses will be performed as described below in Section 5.6 for the primary endpoint. At the 
interim analysis time point, a Wald  test for testing wh ether the odds ratio is equal to 1 in a mixed 
effect s logistic regression model  will be compared to the critical values shown in Table 5 -1. 
All patients with at least 28 days of follow-up post randomization prior to the time of the interim 
analyses will be u sed to compute this statistic. Therefore, if the response rate in the placebo group 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-3 is at least 0.034 or higher than the AAT group, the DSMB will make a recommendation regarding 
termination or  continuation of the trial. 
Non-binding futility stopping rules —maintaining type I error control even if not followed 
exactly —we re obtained from the Gamma family spending function with shape par ameters γ = -
8. This boundary corresponds to a conditional power of 8.9% under the alternative. This would 
also correspond approximately to an effect size (on a difference in response rates scale) less than 
-0.034 ( Figure 5-1) or a Z statistic less than -0.31 . In other words, if we were to observe a test 
statistic of -0.31 or smaller at the interim analysis, there is only an  8.9% chance that the study 
would be statistically significant at the 12-month analysis , under the alternative hypothesis.

5.3.2 Operating Characteristics of the Design  
The statistical power to reject the null hypothesis under various treatment effect sizes using the Z test for comparing binomial proportions is shown in Table 5 -2 as an approximation to the power 
using the primary analysis of mixed effects logistic regression. Kahan and Morris (2012) showed 
that a stratified analysis improves statistical power. Therefor e, the unadjusted power analysis is a 
conservative estimate of the actual power . Also shown are the stopping probabilities for futility

   5-4 at each effect size for t he interim and 12-month analysis. This table shows that the target sample 
size of 136 patients has 86% power to detect a 25% difference in the response rate and is based 
on a simulation study with 10,000 simulated datasets.

5.3.2.1 Stratified Mixed Effects Logistic Simulation  
We simulated a stratified randomized block design using blocks of size 6, based on the distribution of patients observed in each center of the BMT CTN 1501 study. Centers with fewer than 10 patients were combined resulting in a total of 6 centers of size 23, 19, 17, 15, 14 and 48. 
We assumed these centers are a random sample from a larger population with standard deviations 0.05, 0.6 and 1.0. Additionally, we estimated that 35% of the patients will be classified as “high risk”; a covariate that we adjust for in all the simulations done  
Simulation results indicate that in the absence of a  random effect (i .e., when the standard deviation 
of the random effect is close to zero) our statistical power is at least 94.2 % to detect an odds ratio 
of 3. Further, when the random effect is present (std. dev. of 0.6 and 1.0) statistical power is at least 92.9% and 90.1% to  detect an odds ratio of 3  as shown in Table 5 -3. We also obtain statistical 
power ranging from 20.8% to 25.5% when the odds ratio is 1.5 regardless of t he variability 
between centers.

 5.3.3 6 Month Analysis for Clinical Study Report  
A clinical study  report for potential regulatory submission will be prepared after all randomized 
subject s have complet ed at least  6 months of follow -up post -randomization. The d atabase will be 
locked to support this clinical study report . Data transfer and unblinding will follow  the study’s 
Blinding Management Plan. This report will include descriptive statistics based on available data 
at time of the analysis  as well as formal hypothesis testing / treatment comparisons for the primary 
Day 28 overall response rate (CR/PR) endpoint and secondary endpoints including GVHD- free

   5-5 survival, proportion of response, proportion of response allowing for next -line therapy, and 
systemic infections.  
The BMT CTN 1705 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will elaborate further on the contents of the 
6-month report. 5.3.4 Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed 
pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order  that the DSMB can be advised. 
Policies  and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  
The stopping guideline serves as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review. 
Safety monitoring will be based on Day 56 NRM. The proportion of NRM based on historical 
controls is estimated to be 20% versus an alternative hypothesis of 40%. This outcome will be 
monitored up to 56 days post -randomization, separately in each treatment arm , using a truncated 
Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for binary data resulting in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.293 and an upper intercept of 2.679 with nominal type I and type II error  rates 
of, 0.065 and 0.10, respectively.  
This sequential testing procedure conserv es type I error at 5% across all the monthly 
examinations . The SPRT c an be represented graphically. At each monthly examination, the 
number of evaluable patients is plotted against the cumulative sum of the endpoint of interest . 
The continuation region of the SPRT is defined  by two parallel lines. Only the upper boundary 
will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive Day 56 NRM. If the cumulative sum of 
the endpoint falls above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and conclude s 
that there are more events than predicted by the observed number of patients evaluable . 
Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment reaches the target sample size of 68 patients per 
arm. Table 5 -4 and Figure 5-2 gives the rejection boundaries for the number of events for Day 56 
NRM corresponding to the  number of evaluable patients. As an example, if there are 15 evaluable 
patients with the number of Day 56 NRM being 8 or more , then this would trigger a review by 
the DSMB. Note that, at least four events must be observed to trigger review.

For example, the testing procedure rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5.1% % 
of the time when the true Day 56 rate is 20% and 93.5% of the time when the rate is 40% . 
When  the true Day 56 NRM rate is 40%, a review will be triggered when 10.5 events have been 
observed in 26 patients over a 15-month period. 
5.3.5 Safety Analysis 
The reporting of serious adverse events  is described in detail in S ectio n 4.4.4.2. All reported 
serious adverse events potentially associated with study drug will be carefully examined with 
respect to the severity and relationship to study drug. The type  and severity of adverse events will 
be described.  
5.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease, time from steroid initiation to randomization, acute GVHD grade at enrollment , MN classification, graft 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-7 source, GVHD prophylaxis, conditioning regimen, time from disease diagnosis to transplant, time 
from GVHD onset to randomization. 
5.5 Analy sis Populations 
5.5.1 Primary Analysis Population  
The intention- to-treat population will serve as the population for the primary analysis. 
All randomized subjects will be included in this population. Subjects will be included in the 
treatment group to which they are randomized. Intention- to-treat population consists of all 
randomized subjects whether or not treatment was administered. Any subject who receives a 
treatment randomization assignment will be considered to have been randomized. Analyses for 
the primary and secondary endpoints will use the primary analysis population. 
5.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations 
The safety analysis population in this study will comprise of all patients “as treated” in the study. 
This population will be used for the analysis of safety data. The “as treated” population consists of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they received for the analysis of safety data using the “as treated” population. For most subjects this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Subjects who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment received. Any subject who receives the incorrect study medication for one cycle but receives the correct 
treatment for all other cycles will be analyzed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the subject is incorrectly dosed. 
5.5.3 General Analysis Guidelines  
Primary analyses for the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will use the primary 
analysis population except when otherwise spec ified.  Analyses of each endpoint in each 
population will follow the analysis plans as described below in Sections 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8. 
We expect minimal missing data (<  5%) for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints based 
on the past experience with a large phase III aGVHD treatment trial (BMT CTN protocol #0802 . 
All secondary and exploratory analyses will use a two-sided significance level of 5%. 
5.6 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 , compared to maximum GVHD organ staging within 
72 hours prior to enrollment, is expected to be different by centers and GVHD risk (Group A vs 
Group B ; see Section 2.4.1, #3) . Therefore, we will fit a generalized linear mixed model with the 
response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 as the outcome, treatment group as the main effect , and adjust ed 
for GVHD risk fixed effect and cente r-specific random effects. A one- sided significance level of 
2.5% will be used. T he response rate (CR/PR) at Day 28 will be estimated using frequencies in 
each group along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
We plan on conducting two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. 
First,  using the above generalized linear mixed model we will adjust for GVHD risk, age 
(adolescent vs adults) and disease (malignant vs non- malignant)  all as main effects, in addition to 

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network    BMT CTN 1705 – HR aGVHD AAT
  Version 5.0; August 14, 2023  
 
   5-8 center specific random effects . The second analysis will include all the covariates from the first 
analysis in addition to the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) 
biomarker score. These two models will be compared to the primary analysis model in order to assess the impact on the main effect estimate.  
5.7 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
5.7.1 Duration of Response 
Duration of response will be evaluated at 6- and 12-months post-randomization in the cohort of 
patients who achieve a Day  28 response. There will be a primary and secondary analyses of DOR. 
In the primary analysis, DOR is defined as the time from Day 28 response to progression, new salvage therapy for acute GVHD, death from any cause, or re -escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg 
prednisone or equivalent. Patients without any of these events will censored at last follow up. For the secondary analysis, DOR will be defined as time from Day 28 response to death from any 
cause or new salvage therapy. Otherwise , patients are censored. For each definition, the 
probabilities of DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and compared between 
treatment arms using the log -rank test.  
5.7.2 Non-relapse Mortality  
Non-relapse mortality at 6 months and 12 months post-randomization will be estimated using the 
cumulative incidence function, treating relapse as a competing risk. The cumulative incidence 
curves for non- relapse mortality will be compared between the treatment groups using Gray’s 
test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model with mixed effects will be used to compare the 
cause specific hazards of NRM between treatment groups adjusting for GVHD risk with 
center -specific log -normal frailties.  
5.7.3 Overall Survival and Progression -Free Survival 
Progression- free survival (P FS) at 6- and 12-months post-randomization will be estimated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method, treating death or relapse of malignancy as events in patients with 
malignancies. Overall Survival (OS) at 6 and 12 months will also be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method. These endpoints will be compared between the treatment groups using the 
log-rank test.  A Cox proportional hazards regression model with mixed effects will be used to 
compare PFS and OS between treatment groups adjusting for GVHD risk with center -specific 
log-normal frailties.  
5.7.4 GVH D-Free Survival  
The proportion of patients surviving at Day 56 after randomization without acute or chronic GVHD and without other systemic agents (or escalation of steroids to ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone [or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day] ) added for treatment of GVHD  
will be evaluated . Provided there is no censoring prior to 56 days, this endpoint we will be 
computed as a binary outcome and summarized using frequencies/proportions. GVHD- Free 
survival will be compared by treatment adjusting  for GVHD risk and center -specific random 
effects using a generalized linear mixed model. Additionally, treatment groups will be compared using difference in proportions, relative risk and an odds ratio estimate along with corresponding

   5-9 confidence interval s. Censoring before 56 days is highly unlikely; and should this occur we 
anticipate this will be minimal.  
5.7.5 Proportion of Response  
The proportions of patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) (including 
subset with “Very Good Partial Response” [VGPR]), and Treatment Failure (TF)  at Days 7, 14, 
21, 28, 56 and 86 post- randomization will be described and compared between the treatment 
groups using the chi- square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  
5.7.6 Proportion of Response ( Next -Line Therapy)  
The proportions of patients with CR, PR (including subset with VGPR), and treatment failure 
(TF) at Day s 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 86 post -randomization who receive ruxolitinib or other 
next- line therapies approved by the protocol Chairs as next -line therapy and remain on AAT/PTM 
will be described and compared between the treatment groups, to evaluate any differences in safety and efficacy, using the chi- square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The proportion 
of AE/SAE will be described in these patient populations. 
5.7.7 Systemic Infections  
Frequencies of grade 2 or 3 infections occurring from randomization until 30 days after last study 
drug or placebo treatment  will be tabulated by site  of disease, d ate of onset, and severity. The  time 
to first serious (grade 2 or 3) infection will be described using the cumulative incidence function 
and compared between treatment groups using Gray’s test, with death treated as a competing risk. 
5.7.8 Adverse Events  
Frequencies of grade 3-5 adverse events (per CTCAE V ersion 5.0) that occur from randomization 
through 30 days  after completing study drug or placebo treatment  will be tabulated  using the 
Safety Population. The proportion of patients experiencing gra de 3-5 adverse events will be 
compared between the treatment groups using an odds ratio estimate with confidence interval. 5.7.9 Chronic GVHD  
The incidence of chronic GVHD will be computed at 6- and 12-months post- randomization using 
the cumulative incidence m ethod, treating death prior to chronic GVHD as a competing risk. 
Diagnosis of chronic GVHD of any severity ( mild, moderate, or severe) per NIH Consensus 
Criteria (see APPENDIX C ) is considered an event for this endpoint. Cumulative incidence will 
be compared between treatment groups using Gray’s test. Cause specific hazard for chronic 
GVHD will be compared by treatmen t adjusting for GVHD risk and center -specific random 
effects using a generalized linear mixed model. 5.7.10 Disease Relapse  
Disease relapse will be summarized at 6- and 12-months post- randomization using the cumulative 
incidence function with death as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence will be compared 
between treatment groups using Gray’s test. Cause specific hazards for disease relapse will be 
compared by treatment adjusting for GVHD risk and center -specific random effects using a Cox 
proportional hazards mo del with center specific log -normal random effects.

mole cular patterns (e.g., heparan sulfate) and select GVHD biomarkers (eg,  ST2, REG3α) at 
baseline and at D ays 8, 28, and 56 post -treatment initiation  will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics at each time point and compared between treatment groups using Mann- Whitney 
nonparametric tests. Select measurements may also be analyzed using a linear mixed model adjusting for baseline value, time, and treatment, as well as a treatment by time interaction term.  
5.8.5 Overall and Organ -Specific Response Rates by Refined Minnesota Risk and 
Biomarker-B ased Risk Classifications  
The proportions of patients with an overall response (complete or partial) and response rate of 
each GVHD target organ  at Day 28 post- randomization will be described by Refined Minnesota 
risk category (A vs B ; see Section 2.4.1, #3) and by Ann Arbor biomarker risk score (1, 2, or 3) 
using sample proportions and confidence intervals and compared on each factor using the 
chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.

   5-11 5.8.7 CMV -Reactivation 
The p roportions of patients requiring new systemic treatment for CMV -reactivation by Day 56 
post- randomization will be compared between the treatment groups using a chi -square test or 
Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. 
5.8.8 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Participant self -reported measures for both adolescents and adults will be assessed at baseline, 
Days 28, 56 and 180 post -randomization by MDASI, and selected PROMIS subscales for 
gastrointes tinal symptoms, physical function and satisfaction with participation in social roles. 
These instruments will be scored according to the recommendations of the developers. The scores 
will be examined using the medians, means , ranges,  and standard deviations.  Linear regression 
models for the Day 28, Day 56 and 6 -month score  adjusting for baseline score  and other  covariates 
will be used to explore differences between treatment arms  and changes in outcomes over time . 
Provided there is sufficient data, separate analyses will be conducted for adolescent and adult 
patients. Otherwise, their data will be combined/aggregated.

HUMAN SUBJECTS  
1. Subject Consent  
 
Candidates for the study will be identified as described  in Chapter 4 of the protocol. The Principal  
Investigator or his/her designee at each transplant center will contact the candidates, provide the patient with information about the purpose of the study, and obtain consent or assent . The BMT 
CTN DCC  will provide a template of the consent and assent form s to each center.  Each center 
will customize the templates according to their local requirements and submit for review by the DCC for adequacy prior to submitting to the NMDP IRB of Recor d. Each center must provide 
evidence of IRB approval to the DCC. 
2. Confidentiality  
Confidentiality will be maintained by individual names being masked and assi gned a patient 
identifier code.  The code relaying the patient’s identity with the ID code will b e kept separately 
at the center.  The ID code will be generated by and kept on file at the BMT CTN Data and 
Coordinating Center upon enrollment. 3. Participation of Adolescents  
The protocol was  amended  (v4.0), after  DSMB review and approval, to include a dolescents ages 
12 - 17.99 after 40 adult patients were enrolled onto the trial and completed the D ay 56 follow -up 
assessment for safety . 
4. Participation of Women and Minorities Women, ethnic minorities, and other populations will be included in this study. Accrual of women 
and minorities at each center will be monitored to determine whether their rates of enrollment are reflective of the distribution of potentially eligible women  and minorities expected from data 
reported to the CIBMTR and from published data on incidence of high risk acute GVHD  in these 
groups. Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those expected and asked 
to develop appropriate recrui tment reports.  
5. GCP  
This study will be conducted in accordance with standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Council for Harmonization ) and all applicable national and local regulations.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES  
Research Samples for Protocol -Defined and Ancillary Correlative Laboratory Studies  
This protocol involves collection of required and optional research samples for patients 
consenting to the BMT CTN 1705 study. The objectives are based on the current understanding of AAT biology informed by preclinical and clinical studies available at the time of protocol development. These studies will explore the impact of AAT administration on serum levels of AAT, key cellular immune subsets, inflammatory markers and GVHD biomarkers.  
Required peripheral blood samples will be collected at calendar driven time points that are 
required to support study- specific secondary and exploratory endpoints that are summarized in 
the table below.  Additionally, stool losses of AAT and changes in gut microbiome are known to 
occur during the development of GVHD.  Stool samples, which are optional for patients at selected 
centers associated with active microbiome laboratories, will be collected for planned exploratory analysis of stool AAT levels and correlation with serum cytokines and/or validated proteomic GVHD related  biomarkers.  Remaining stool and serum biospecimens will be made available for 
future research of microbiome, microbial metabolome and  correlative laboratory studies with 
potential to advance findings of the current trial . Sample collection, processing and shipping 
procedures are detailed in the BMT CTN 1705 Research Sample Information Guide. 
Enrollment is Day 0 and the first dose of study drug must occur within 12 hours after enrollment . 
Therefore , the first dose may fall on Day 0 or Day 1 in the tables be low.

DIAGNOSIS AND SEVERITY SCORING FOR ACUTE AND CHRONIC GVHD 
1. (2014 NIH Consensus Criteria87) 
 
 
Organ scoring of chronic GVHD. ECOG indicates Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; KPS, Karnofsky 
Performance Status, Lansky Performance Status; BSA, body surface area; ADL, activities of daily living; LFTs, liver function tests; AP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ULN, normal upper limit. *Weight loss within 3 months. Skin scoring should use both percentage of BSA involved by disease signs and the cutaneous features scales. When a discrepancy exists between the percentage of total body surface (BSA) score and the skin 
feature score, OR if superficial sclerotic features are present (Score 2), but there is impaired mobility or ulceration 
(Score 3), the higher level should be used for the final skin scoring. To be completed by speci alist or trained medical 
providers. **Lung scoring should be performed using both the symptoms and FEV1 scores whenever possible. FEV1 should be used in the final lung scoring where there is discrepancy between symptoms and FEV1 scores.

LIFESTYLE RESTRICTIONS  
Female subjects of childbearing potential and all male subjects must use medically reliable 
methods of contraception from the first dose of investigational product until 1 month after the last dose of investigational product. 
Childbearing potential is assumed in all female subjects except:  
• Female subjects aged > 60 years.  
• Female subjects aged 45 to 60 years (inclusive) with amenorrhea for ≥ 1 year.  
• Female subjects who are surgically sterile for at least 3 months before providing informed 
consent. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are:  
• Abstinence, where abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, including 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the 
investigational product. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea meth od are not acceptable definitions of abstinence. 
• Hormonal methods: acceptable hormonal methods include oral contraceptives, contraceptive 
medication patch, contraceptive medication injection, estrogen/progestin vaginal ring, or contraceptive medication implant.  
• 2 barrier methods; acceptable barrier methods include: female or male condoms, with spermicidal foam or spermicidal jelly, or diaphragm, with spermicidal foam or spermicidal jelly. The female condom and male condom should not be used together. 
• Use of  intrauterine device (placed more than 3 months before providing informed consent). 
• Surgical sterilization (more than 3 months before providing informed consent) of subject or subject's partner.

ANTICIPATED TOXICITIES  
The purpose of this appendix is to outline those AEs that commonly occur in the study population. 
The following is a list of events that the Sponsor considers to be common toxicities for agents used in HCT conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens. The events listed below require reporting via  the Toxicity CRF in  Advantage eClinical and  do NOT change the reporting 
obligations, timelines or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE.  
 If aggregate analysis of these events indicates  they occur more frequently with study drug, an 
expedited safety report  may be submitted to regulatory agencies. 
 Lack of relationship to the investigational product is not automatically assumed; therefore, an assessm ent is required by the Investigator for any events specified below. The Sponsor will also 
perform the causality assessment on  a case-by- case basis and expedite reporting to regulatory 
agencies when applicable.

1 1.RCT Details
This section provides a high -level overview of a n ongoing  RCT that the described real -world evidence study is trying to replicate
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title
A Comparative Effectiveness Study of Major Glycemia -lowering Medications for Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (GRADE) 
(GRADE  Trial) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
1.2 Intended aim(s)  
To compare glycemia -lowering effectiveness and patient -centered outcomes  when commonly used diabetes medications, 
are combined with metformin . We focus on the glimepiride versus sitagliptin contra st. 
1.3 Primary endpoint in the trial   
The m aintenance of metabolic control  is defined as time to primary failure with an HbA1C>=7.0%(53mmol/mol), confirme d 
at the next quarterly visit,  while receiving maximally tolerated doses of both metformin up to 2,000 mg/day and the 
assigned me dication  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
The trial is to  enroll 5000 patients over 3 years where  40% are to be enrolled over the first 18 months and 60% are to be 
enrolled over the final 18 months using the method of Lachin and Foulkes (1986). The trial is expected to have 7 years of 
total duration with 4% follow -up loss per year which would yield 90% power to detect a 25% difference (hazard ratio of 
0.75)  among any  two of the four study exposures  
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding  
To assess : 
1) time to severe hypoglycemic episode in the follow -up period
2) mean HbA1C change from baseline approximately  6 months after cohort entry date
1.6 Trial estimate  
The trial is ongoing and scheduled to complete in July 2021.

4 5.Cohort Identification
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, propensity score -matched  cohort design comparing glimepiride  to sitagliptin. Treatments in both 
arms are administered in combination with metformin. Patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baselin e 
period of 180 days before initiation of glimepiride  or sit agliptin . The analyses will be restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus who have been previously treated with metformin .  
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
New use of glimepiride (exposure)  is defined as no use of the exposure drug within 180 days prior to index date. New use of 
sitagliptin  (comparator) is defined as no use of the comparator drug within 180 days prior to index date. Eligible patients are 
required to be new users with respect  to both exposure and comparator groups (i.e., no use of both exposure and comparator 
drugs) within 180 days prior to meeting all eligibility criteria and initiation of exposure.  
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates  
Liraglutide indication as an adjunct to diet an d exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus was 
approved by FDA on Jan 25, 2010 (the approval of glimepiride for the same indication was antecedent to 2010  and sitagliptin  was 
2006 ). Thus, the initial eligible cohort entr y date is the first date after  the FDA approval available in the data . The database used is 
Optum CDM because lab results/values are available in this database for a subset of laboratory tests, including the A1C tests . The 
following eligible cohort entry d ates were included:  
§Optum CDM: Jan 25 , 2010 – Sept  30, 2020 (end of available data)
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are 
provided in (Appendix A)  and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6.Variables
6.1 Exposure -related variables: 
Study drug s:  
1.New initiation of glimepiride  (a sulfonylurea ) is defined as no use of glimepiride  within 180 days before treatment initiation
(washout period). New users of glimepiride  are not allowed to receive any other antidiabetic drug other than metformin
within 180 days prior to treatment initiation.
Comparator agent : 
New initiation of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase -4 inhibitor, defined as no use of sitagliptin  within 180 da ys before treatment 
initiation (washout period). New users of sitagliptin  are not allowed to receive any other antidiabetic drug other than metformin 
within 180 days prior to treatment initiation.  
6.2 Preliminary Covariates:  
•Age
•Gender
•Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to
and including index date.
The covariate  listed above represent s only a small subset of the covariate vector that will ultimately be controlled for in the 
design and analysis. We use the covariate above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be suf ficient 
overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passe d 
the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ).

9 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up: 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A):  
§Primary outcome: Time to primary metabolic failure is defined by time to event (2 nd consecutive HbA1C value >=7%)
occurring at least 135 days after cohort entry date . Similar to the quarterly assessments used in the trial, time during
follow up will be discretized into 90-day blocks.
Note: In the trial, HbA1C is measured every quarter and time to metabolic failure is defined as time to an initial HbA1c >= 7%, 
subsequently confirmed at the next  quarterly visit . So, the outcome can be reached only after 6  months of treatment, unless 
at 3 months the HbA1C is >9% and is confirmed with HbA1C after 3 -6 weeks is also >9% then the outcome is considered as 
reached.  
§Secondary outcomes:
To assess –
1)Time to severe hypoglycemic episode in the follow -up period
2)Mean HbA1C a pproximately  6 months after cohort entry date  (based on hbA1c values assessed 180 days +/ - 45 days
after cohort entry)
6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on day of 
cohort entry. An allowable gap of 60 days  between records indicating  each  treatment will qualify  as “continuous therapy ” with 
respect to follow -up in the as -treated analysis . 
The follow -up will start 1 day after  drug initiation for secondary outcomes. For the primary outcome of HbA1C value , follow up will 
begin 135 days after cohort entry date , and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
•The first occurrence of the outcome of interest
•The date of end of continuous registration in the database  (disenrollment or end of data),
•End of the study period  (Sept 30th, 2020) ,
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to sup port FDA’s regulatory decision making  
10 •Measured death event occurs,
•765 days  after CED ,
•Switch ,
•Discontinuation  of exposure/comparator/metformin  (60 days allowable grace period and risk window) ,
•Addition of another antidiabetic drug,
•Nursing home admission : Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized
typically provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an
exclusion reason for cohorts for the same reason.
In the secondary IT T analysis, we will not censor for discontinuation or switching among study drugs  
Note:  To decrease the incidence of missing values of the outcome (specifically, missing of HbA1c value s), we required that the 
eligible patients had at least 2 HbA1c measurements recorded within 365 days before a nd including cohort entry  date . This will 
increase the probability of including in the final cohort patients who are adherent to a routinely HbA1c testing and, consequ ently, 
will decrease the frequency of missing values of the outcome.

In order to complete the initial power analysis, a dummy outcome will be used. This outcome is used to ensure that no information 
on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. A 1:1 PS -matched comparative analysis  was 
performed, and PS should include only 3 covariates: age, gender and combined comorbidity index.  Power calculations are based on 
the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).  
•Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators  and FDA.  Reviewers evaluate the results of the
analyses descr ibed above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow -up time, and reasons
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re -evaluated and
reported in th e subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.

GRADE trial definitions Implementation in routine care
The primary outcome is the time to primary metabolic failure of the randomly assigned treatment, which is defined as the time 
to an initial A1C ≥7% (53 mmol/mol),  subsequently confirmed at the next quarterly visit,  while to assigned medications,  
according to the principles of intention-to-treat analysis.Implemented as having 2 consecutive HbA1C values >=7% assessed 135 days after cohort entry date. Follow up time will be 
discretized into 90 day blocks
1. Glycemic control measured as the mean HbA1c, the mean body weight and the rate per year of moderate (or more severe)
hypoglycemia since randomization over time, such as up to 4 years of follow-up. We will compute a mean HbA1c value and 
mean weight for each participant, and an overall rate of hypoglycemia events, i.e., one value each per subject.
2. The time to either an episode of severe hypoglycemia or the time of the primary outcome, whichever occurs first.1. Mean HbA1C value measured approximately 6 months after cohort entry (180 days +/- 45)
2. Hypoglycemia measured any time after 1 day after cohort entry date

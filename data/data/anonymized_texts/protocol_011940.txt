PROTOCOL AMENDMENT (GLOBAL ) VERSION 2.0 (18 DEC 2020)  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to make the following changes to the original 
protocol (Version  1.0 dated 08  Apr 2019):  
• The total sample size has been increased from 130 subjects (65 subjects per 
treatment group) to 1 56 subjects (78 subjects per treatment group). This increase 
was made to account for higher variability in the primary endpoint than originally 
assumed, and to maintain the power of the study.  
• An unblinded interim analysis has been added to be performed afte r the final 
subject has completed the Week 12 visit, or after the final subject has prematurely 
discontinued prior to reaching Week 12. The purpose of this interim analysis is to 
perform a comprehensive evaluation of all available double -blind data to prep are 
regulatory submissions for approval of the MG target indication.  
• Changes made in earlier country -specific protocol amendments (France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom) have been consolidated into a 
single global protocol.  
• The objectives a nd endpoints were revised to reflect current UCB practices for the 
categorization and description of study objectives, estimands, and endpoints.  
• The protocol was updated to include provisions for the COVID -19 pandemic.  
• Additional administrative updates wer e made in the protocol.

Protocol Title  A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled Study to Confirm the Efficacy, Safety, 
and Tolerability of Zilucoplan in Subjects with Generalized 
Myasthenia Gravis  
Protocol Number  RA101495 -02.301 (RAISE) (UCB study MG0010)  
Phase of Clinical Development  Phase 3  
Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP)  Zilucoplan (RA101495) administered by daily subcutaneous 
(SC) injection (0.3 mg/kg)  
Study Population  Male or female ≥18  years and <75 years with generalized 
myasthenia gravis (gMG)  
Investigativ e Sites  Approximately 100 centers are planned worldwide  
Planned Number of Subjects  Approximately 156 subjects (78  per treatment arm)  
Study Objectives  
• To confirm the efficacy of zilucoplan in subjects with gMG  
• To confirm the safety and tolerability of zilucoplan in subjects with gMG  
Study Design  
Study RA101495 -02.301 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to 
confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of zilucoplan in subjects with gMG.  
The planned enrollment is approximately 156 subjects. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive daily SC doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo. Randomization will be stratified 
based on the baseline MG -Activities of Daily Living ( MG-ADL) Score (≤9 versus ≥10), 
Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score (≤17 versus ≥18), and geographical region.  
In order to ensure a gradual initiation of the study in Japan, each Japanese site will be capped to 
an enrollment rate of no more than one subject per site per week).  
The study includes a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and a 12 -week Treatment Period. During 
the Treatment Period, subjects will return to the clinic at Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and 
Week 12 to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Additional assessments will include 
questionnaires, biomarker samples, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and optional 
pharmacogenomics. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), clinica l laboratory tests, adverse event (AE) monitoring, 
immunogenicity, and Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
Randomized subjects will receive 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or matching placebo administered SC at 
the Day  1 visit. Following in -clinic educat ion and training, all subjects will self -inject daily SC 
doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized treatment allocation, for the subsequent 
12 weeks. Single -use pre -filled syringes in injection devices will be provided for use during the 
study.  
In Japan, following their Day 1 dose, subjects will be hospitalized overnight for observation to 
ensure safety of study drug administration. Prior to discharge, subjects will be asked to self -
administer their Day 2 dose under supervision to ensure that the ir technique for self -injection is 
adequate and appropriate, and to answer any additional questions. These pre -scheduled overnight

Zilucoplan  Version 2.0  
Protocol RA101495 -02.301  18.Dec.2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 12 of 79 observational hospitalizations will not be considered SAEs in this study (even if hospital stay is 
extended, provided that th e sole purpose of the extension is improvement of the injection 
technique). Subjects will continue to self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according 
to randomized treatment allocation, for the subsequent 12 weeks.  
Subjects are expected to rema in on stable doses of all medications unless medically indicated 
changes become necessary. All standard of care (SOC) therapy medications for gMG should be 
kept at the same dose throughout the 12 -week study, including corticosteroids and 
immunosuppressant therapy (IST) drugs. If escalation of gMG therapy (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) 
becomes necessary due to major deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, or risk of myasthenia 
gravis (MG) crisis as per the investigator’s judgment, the subject may receive int ravenous 
immunoglobulin G (IVIG) or plasma exchange (PLEX) treatment as ‘rescue therapy’.  In 
Germany, the choice of eculizumab as ‘rescue therapy’ will not be withheld, if the investigator 
considers this to be the best course of action.  
To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection (Neisseria meningitidis), all subjects must be 
vaccinated against meningococcal infections (with a quadrivalent vaccine and, where available 
and in accordance with local SOC, serogroup B vaccine) within 3 years prior to, or at th e time of, 
initiating study drug. Subjects who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving 
a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., 
Penicillin V 500mg twice daily, third generation cephalosporin, etc.) until at least 2 weeks after 
the initial dose of vaccine(s). The use of fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics is not 
recommended due to the potential for exacerbation of MG. Booster vaccinations should be 
administered in accordance with SOC.   
During the Treatment Period, to mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled and 
reminded of the early signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis  infection. A patient safety 
card detailing the signs and symptoms of infection, wi th instructions to seek immediate medical 
attention if any such symptoms occur, will be provided to each subject.  
The safety of subjects will be monitored in a blinded manner on an ongoing basis. If an unblinded 
data review should become necessary to ensur e subject safety, a Safety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) will convene and evaluate study data as appropriate.  
At the end of the Treatment Period, all subjects will have the option to receive zilucoplan in a 
separate Extension Study, provided they meet the Ex tension Study inclusion criteria.  
If a subject discontinues study drug treatment prior to the Week 12 visit for any reason, he/she 
will not be eligible for the Extension Study. For subjects who permanently discontinue study 
drug, a Safety Follow -up Visit will be performed at 40 days after the last dose of study drug, to 
collect information on any ongoing AEs or new serious adverse events (SAE) since the last 
study visit.  
Duration of Study Participation  
The duration of study participation will include a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and a 12 -
week Treatment Period for a total of approximately 16 weeks.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
To be eligible for this study, subjects must meet ALL  the following inclusion criteria:  
1. Male or female 18 years and <75 y ears 
2. Able to provide informed consent, including signing and dating the informed consent form

10. Vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and, where available, meningococcal 
serotype B vaccine at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug at the Day 1 visit. A 
booster vaccination should also be administered as clinically indicated, according to the local 
SOC, for subjects who have been previously vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis  
11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at 
Screening and a negative urine pregnanc y test within 24  hours prior to the first dose of study 
drug 
12. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are not 
postmenopausal or who have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
tubal ligation) and all male subjects (who have not been surgically sterilized by vasectomy) 
must agree to use effective contraception during the study and during the safety follow -up 
period of 40 days after the last dose of study drug. Postmenopausal women are, for the 
purposes of this protocol, defined as women who have not had menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using 
horm onal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.

Study Objectives and Endpoints  
Objectives  Estimands/Endpoints  
Primary Efficacy Objective:  
To confirm the efficacy of 
zilucoplan in subjects with gMG  Primary Estimand:  
Treatment:  Zilucoplan administered by daily subcutaneous (SC) 
injection (0.3 mg/kg) vs Placebo  
Target Population:  Adults with generalized myasthenia gravis 
(gMG) with inclusion/exclusion criteria provided in Section  8.1 and 
Section  8.2 of the protocol.  
Endpoint:  Change from Baseline (CFB) in Week 12 in Myasthenia 
Gravis -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) Score  
Intercurrent event handling:  
If a subject experie nces any of the following intercurrent events, 
then data at and after the point of the intercurrent event will be 
treated as missing using a hypothetical strategy:  
A participant receiving rescue therapy:  The study is interested in 
the treatment effect assu ming that the treatment effect is null, and 
no rescue effect occurs after a subject receives rescue medication.  
A subject discontinuing the study:  For subjects that discontinue due 
to AEs related to study drug, it is assumed that the treatment effect 
is null. For subjects that discontinue for other reasons (i.e., 
unrelated to study drug) it is assumed that the subject had remained 
on their treatment throughout the study (i.e., a "Hypothetical 
strategy" assuming subjects did not discontinue the study and 
remained on treatment).

Statistical Considerations  
Study Populations : The following study populations are defined:  
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects  
• Per Protocol Population: All subjects in the ITT Population who completed the 12 -week 
Treatment Period and have no major protocol deviations  
• Safety Population: All subjects who received at leas t 1 dose of study drug with subjects to be 
analyzed based on the actual study treatment received  
General Considerations : A disposition of subjects will be provided and will include a 
breakdown of subjects who were randomized, were treated, discontinued tr eatment, were lost to 
follow -up, or withdrew consent.  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized 
using frequency counts and  percentages.  
Randomization: Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily SC doses of 
0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo. Randomization will be stratified on the baseline MG -ADL 
Score (≤9 versus 10), baseline QMG Score (≤17 versus 18), and geographical region.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 17 of 79 Efficacy Analyses:  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, CFB to Week  12 in MG -ADL Score, treatment group 
differences will be assessed using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, baseline MG -ADL Score, baseline QMG Score, 
geographical region, treatment visit (interaction term), and baseline MG -ADL Score visit 
(interaction term)  as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. The MMRM ANCOVA will 
include Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan dose group 
versus placebo in CFB to Week  12 in MG -ADL Score at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level based 
on the ITT population.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints: Week 12 CFB in QMG, MGC, and MG -QOL15r 
Survey will be analyzed by an MMRM ANCOVA model similar to the primary endpoint 
analysis.  
The dichotomous secondary efficacy endpoints: receiv ed rescue therapy over the 12 -week 
Treatment Period, achieving MSE, defined as an MG -ADL of 0 or 1, at Week 12 without rescue 
therapy, a ≥3 -point reduction in MG -ADL Score at Week 12 without rescue therapy, and a ≥5 -
point reduction in QMG Score at Week 12 without rescue therapy will be analyzed by a logistic 
regression with treatment as a factor and baseline MG -ADL Score, baseline QMG Score, and 
geographical region as covariates.  
For each of the secondary endpoints, the analysis will be the Week 12 compari son of the 
0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan dose group versus placebo at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level based on the 
ITT population.  
Multiplicity:  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. The secondary 
endpoints will be tested using a fixed -sequential testing procedure in the following order:  
• CFB to Week 12 in the QMG Score  
• CFB to Week 12 in the MGC  
• CFB to Week 12 in the MG -QOL15r Survey  
• Received rescue therapy over the 12 -week Treatment Period  
• Achieving MSE, defined a s an MG -ADL of 0 or 1, at Week 12 without rescue therapy  
• Achieving a ≥3 -point reduction in MG -ADL Score at Week 12 without rescue therapy  
• Achieving a ≥5 -point reduction in QMG Score at Week 12 without rescue therapy  
Each secondary endpoint will be tested at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. A secondary 
endpoint analysis will be considered statistically significant if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤0.05 for the 
endpoint analysis and the primary efficacy endpoint analysis and all the secondary endpoint 
analyses occurring earlier in the fixed -sequence are also statistically significant (i.e., have a 
2-sided p -value ≤0.05).  
Safety: AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory (MedDRA). Incidence 
rates for treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be sum marized overall, by maximum severity,

treatment group.  
Quantitative laboratory endpoints will be summarized by treatment group at each scheduled 
assessment time po int using descriptive statistics.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters [i.e., heart rate (HR), PR interval, RR interval, QRS 
interval, and QT interval] at each assessment time point will be presented by treatment group.  
Descriptive statistics for vita l signs (HR, body temperature, and blood pressure) will be presented 
by treatment group.  
Clinically significant physical examination abnormalities will be reported as AEs, when 
appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetics: Individual PK results will be presented in listings and summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
Pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamic endpoints will be summarized by treatment group.  
Determination of Sample Size : For the primary efficacy endpoint, CFB to Week 12 in MG -
ADL Score, assuming a difference in treatment group least squares means of 2.3, a SD of 3.7, 
and 78  subjects per group, the study has approximately 94% power to detect a difference between 
an active and placebo treatment group based on a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05. This assumes rates of 
rescue  and dropout of up to 10% and 5%, respectively.

a. If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug prior to completion of the Week 12 Visit, the subject should return to clini c for an End of Study Visit.  
b. Subjects who choose not to enter the Extension Study or who terminate the study prior to Week 12 will  be required to return to the clinic 40 ±7 days after their last dose to gather 
information on ongoing AEs and report any new SAEs since the last study visit.  
c. For subjects who require rescue therapy (see Section 10.1.3.1 ), a Rescue Therapy Visit should be conducted prior to the initiation of rescue therapy. If the Rescue Therapy Visit 
coincides with a regularly scheduled study visit, then overlapping study procedures do not need to be duplicated.  
d. Procedures performed as SOC during the Screening Period may be used to determine eligibility. Informed consent must be obtain ed prior to performing any study -specific procedures 
that are not SOC.  
e. Eligibility  must be confirmed prior to randomization on Day 1.  
f. Screening includes disease history with diagnosis of gMG by the MGFA criteria (Class II -IV) and serology for AChR autoantibodies.  
g. Height will be measured only at Screening.  
h. All prescriptions and over -the-counter medications taken during the 30 days prior to Screening through the last study visit will be documented.  
NOTE: A complete history of medications taken for the treatment of gMG will be collected . 
i. The vital signs assessment will include measurement of HR, body temperature, and blood pressure in the sitting position.  
j. To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection (Neisseria meningitidis), all subjects must be vaccinated against meningococcal  infectio ns (with a quadrivalent vaccine and, where 
available and in accordance with local SOC, serogroup B vaccine) within 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study  drug. Subjects who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 
weeks after receiving a me ningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Penicillin V 500mg twice daily, t hird generation cephalosporin, 
etc.) until at least 2 weeks after the initial dose of vaccine(s). The use of fluoroquinolone or mac rolide antibiotics is not recommended due to the potential for exacerbation of MG. 
Booster vaccinations should be administered in accordance with SOC.  
k. All laboratory samples should be obtained prior to administration of study drug at applicable visits.  
l. Coagulation tests should be performed only in subjects who are receiving anticoagulant therapy.  
m. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test must be documented at Screening. All other  pregnancy tests will be performed v ia urine.  
n. All AEs and SAEs should be monitored until resolution or stabilization. SAEs that occur within 40 days after the last dose of  study drug should be reported using the procedures 
outlined in the protocol.  
o. In accordance with the draft FDA Suicidal  Ideation and Behavior: Prospective Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry ( FDA 2012 ) subjects will be asked to 
complete the C -SSRS at study visits as specified.  
p. The MG -ADL, QMG, MG -QOL15r, and MGC should be performed at approxim ately the same time of day (preferably in the morning) and administered by the same well -trained 
evaluator (e.g., neurologist, physical therapist, or other study staff) in the same order at each visit throughout the study.   
NOTE: If a subject is receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor, the dose must be withheld for at least 10 hours prior to the QMG test.  
q. Blood samples for PK and PD analysis will be obtained prior to administration of study drug (within 1 hour of dosing). If Res cue Therapy is administered at a location separate from the 
clinical site, then there is no need to collect blood samples for PK/PD. For local Rescue Therapy visits, PK and PD samples w ill be collected at the following time points:  
During Rescue Therapy  
ONLY at sites where rescue therapy is administered locally  
Within 1 hour before administration of each round of rescue therapy  
For PLEX only: PK will be measured in the exchanged plasma  
Within 1 hour after administration of each round of rescue therapy  
r. Blood samples for the additional tests will be obtained prior to administration of study drug (within 1 hour of dosing).  
s. The pharmacogenomic sample is noted at Screening, however it may be collected at any study visit.  
t. Dosing on study visit days should be  held until all assessments (e.g., MG -ADL, QMG, MG -QOL15r, MGC, questionnaires, sample collection, etc.) have been completed. On days when 
rescue therapy is concurrently administered, study drug dosing should be held until after administration of rescue th erapy and PK/PD sampling.  
u. In circumstances where COVID -19 disruptions lead to subject being unable to return for Day 1 within 28 days of screening, additional days may be included in the screening period.  
Contact with the medical monitor is requested in such situations.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 27 of 79 5 INTRODUCTION  
Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing zilucoplan, a SC self -administered 15 -amino acid 
cyclic peptide that binds to, and inhibits, the cleavage of C5.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information on the 
chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, safety, and benefit/risk analysis of zilucoplan.  
5.1  Overview of Generalized Myasthenia Gravis  
MG is a rare complement -mediated autoimmune  disease characterized by the production 
of autoantibodies targeting proteins that are critical for the normal transmission of 
neurotransmitter signals from nerves to muscles. The prevalence of MG in the United 
States and European Union is estimated at app roximately 60,000 and 191,000 cases, 
respectively. In 15% of patients with MG, symptoms remain confined to the ocular 
muscles. In approximately 85% of patients MG progresses beyond the ocular muscles to 
affect multiple muscle groups throughout the body, a condition that is typically referred 
to as generalized MG ( Gilhus 2016 ).  
Patients with gMG present with muscle weakness that characteristically becomes more 
severe with repeated use and recovers with rest. Symptoms are typically at their mildest 
in the mo rning, when overnight inactivity enables replenishment of acetylcholine levels 
in presynaptic motor nerve terminals and worsen during the course of the day. Muscle 
weakness can be localized to specific muscles, but often progresses to more diffuse 
muscle w eakness ( Chamanza et al. 2010; Gilhus & Verschuuren 2015; Gilhus 2016 ). 
gMG symptoms can become life -threatening when muscle weakness involves the 
diaphragm and intercostal muscles in the chest wall that are responsible for breathing. 
The most dangerous co mplication of gMG, known as myasthenic crisis, requires 
hospitalization, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 15% to 20% of 
patients with gMG will experience a myasthenic crisis within two years of diagnosis 
(Ramizuddin 2014 ). 
The most com mon target of autoantibodies in gMG is the nicotinic AChR, located at the 
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the point at which a motor neuron transmits chemical 
signals to a skeletal muscle fiber. Most therapies for gMG focus on either augmenting the 
AChR sign al or nonspecifically suppressing the autoimmune response. First -line therapy 
for symptomatic gMG is treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as 
pyridostigmine. Although sometimes adequate for control of mild ocular symptoms, 
pyridostigmine mono therapy is usually insufficient for the treatment of generalized 
weakness, and dosing is often limited by cholinergic side effects. Therefore, in patients 
who remain symptomatic despite pyridostigmine therapy, corticosteroids with or without 
systemic ISTs are used off -label ( Riedemann et al. 2002; Sanders et al. 2016 ). ISTs used 
frequently in gMG include azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are also used occasionally. 
Well -controlled , randomized, efficacy data for these agents are sparse and no steroidal or 
IST has been approved for the treatment of gMG, with the exception of Japan where 
tacrolimus and cyclosporine are approved for gMG ( Farmakidis et al. 2018 ). Moreover, 
all of these agents are associated with well -documented short -term as well as long -term 
toxicities. Surgical removal of the thymus may be recommended in patients with non -

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 79 thymomatous gMG and moderate to severe symptoms, in an effort to reduce the 
production of AChR aut oantibodies ( Wachtman 2012; Wolfe et al. 2016 ). IVIG and 
PLEX are invasive therapies, typically used short -term to manage worsening MG 
symptoms and in patients with myasthenic crisis or life -threatening signs such as 
respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia (Riedemann et al. 2002; Sanders et al. 2016 ). 
However, some patients with severe disease and multiple exacerbations may eventually 
require chronic IVIG or PLEX.  
5.2 Etiology of Generalized Myasthenia Gravis and the Role of Complement  
MG is caused by the failu re of signal transmission from nerve terminals to muscle fibers. 
The structures that mediate this neuromuscular signal transmission are NMJs, sometimes 
also called neuromuscular synapses. NMJs are specialized regions of contact between 
nerve cells and musc le fibers that consist of the nerve terminal, the synaptic cleft and the 
post-synaptic membrane with the latter being a highly specialized region of the muscle 
fiber membrane itself. The postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ is characterized by deep 
folds and d ensely packed AChR at the top of the folds.  
When an action potential originating from a motor neuron arrives at the nerve terminal of 
the NMJ, it triggers release of the acetylcholine. Only once a sufficiently high 
concentration of acetylcholine is reached  in the synaptic cleft, are enough AChRs bound 
and activated to surpass the excitability threshold required for successful propagation of a 
muscle action potential and ensuing contraction of the muscle fiber.  
In patients with MG, the process of signal tran smission at the NMJ is inhibited by 
antibodies directed against proteins of the postsynaptic membrane. Most frequently (in 
approximately 80% of MG patients) such antibodies are specific for AChR.  
There is substantial pre -clinical and clinical evidence supp orting a role for the terminal 
complement cascade in the pathogenesis of gMG ( Howard 2017; Kusner et al. 2018 ). The 
most common target of autoantibodies in gMG is the AChR. Among AChR 
autoantibodies, there is a predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 immunoglobulin subclasses 
which efficiently activate the classical pathway of complement. Therefore, binding of 
anti-AChR autoantibodies to AChR results in uncontrolled and inappropriate activation 
of the classical complement cascade at the NMJ. The immune complex formed  by the 
autoantibody -antigen interaction is recognized by the initiating component of the 
classical complement pathway, the C1 complex. Binding of the C1 complex leads to a 
series of enzymatic cleavage steps culminating in the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C 5b 
and deposition of membrane attack complex (MAC) onto the post -synaptic membrane of 
the NMJ with subsequent injury and electrochemical disruption of the neuromuscular 
endplate. As a result, NMJs in MG patients show complement -mediated tissue damage 
chara cterized by a marked disruption of cytoarchitecture and loss of membrane folds (i.e., 
decrease in overall area of the postsynaptic membrane) and a decrease in AChR density. 
The net effect of this complement -mediated attack is to make it less likely that a 
sufficient number of AChRs can be simultaneously activated to trigger a muscle action 
potential. Deposition of the terminal complement complex in the NMJ is a universal 
finding in gMG patients ( Nakan & Engel 1993; Engel et al. 1977 ) and in rodent models 
of disease ( Solyts et al. 2009 ).

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 29 of 79 5.3 Rationale for Complement Inhibition in Myasthenia Gravis  
Terminal complement pathway inhibition is expected to rapidly restore the membrane 
potential at NMJs by eliminating the large hydrophilic pores that are formed when MAC  
is deposited in excitable membranes ( Jackson et al. 1981 ). The reduced electrical leakage 
is expected to rapidly improve the safety factor of NMJs ( Conti -Fine et al. 2006 ) and 
improve neuromuscular signal transmission. Sustained complement inhibition is e xpected 
to lead to restoration of the microanatomy of NMJs including normalization of the 
cytoarchitecture and restoration of the postsynaptic membrane folds, as has been 
observed in animal models of experimental autoimmune MG that were depleted of 
complem ent C5 with cobra venom ( Lennon et al. 1978 ). From a clinical perspective, the 
persistent clinical benefit over several weeks after treatment discontinuation seen with the 
complement C5 inhibitor eculizumab in a Phase 2 crossover study ( Howard et al. 2013 ) is 
consistent with, although not conclusive of, structural improvement in the NMJ rather 
than a rapidly reversible symptomatic treatment effect as is seen with 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine).  
Inhibition of C5 for the treatment of g MG has already been shown to be effective in two 
clinical studies with the C5 -blocking antibody, eculizumab ( Howard et al. 2013; Howard 
2017 ), which established that inhibition of the terminal complement cascade by blocking 
cleavage of C5 is a clinically v alidated approach for treating gMG. These data are 
consistent with the beneficial clinical effect observed with zilucoplan in patients with 
gMG in Phase 2 (see Section 5.5.2.1 ). 
5.4  Mechanism of Action of Zilucoplan  
Zilucoplan targets C5, a component of the terminal complement activation pathway. 
Zilucoplan binds to C5 with high affinity and prevents its cleavage by C5 convertases 
into the cleavage products  C5a and C5b. Inhibition of C5 cleavage prevents the 
downstream assembly and cytolytic activity of the MAC.  
Using surface plasmon resonance and analysis of a high -resolution co -crystal structure, 
zilucoplan has been shown to bind to a specific site on C5 a nd to exhibit a strong and 
rapid association with C5, coupled with a slow dissociation rate. Zilucoplan binds to the 
portion of C5 which corresponds to C5b. In binding to this region of C5, should any C5b 
be formed, it will be blocked from binding to C6 by  zilucoplan, which further prevents 
the subsequent assembly of the MAC (C5b -9). 
Thus, zilucoplan inhibits MAC formation by a dual mechanism ( Figure 1): 
1. Prevention of downstream complement activation by allosterically inhibiting C5 
cleavage.  
2. Direct inhibition of the first step in MAC assembly: C5b -C6-binding.

Complement components are shown using their stan dard abbreviations.  
The binding site of zilucoplan on the C5 protein is distinct from that of the complement 
C5 inhibitory monoclonal antibody eculizumab. Nishimura and colleagues have 
described 11 patients in Japan (≈3.2% of the PNH population) who carry mutations in the 
C5 gene that prevent the binding of eculizumab to C5 and who are resistant to treatment 
with the antibody ( Nishimura et al. 2014 ). Zilucoplan has been shown to effectively bind 
to C5 from blood samples from patients with this mutation, and  to inhibit complement 
activation in vitro . 
Pharmacologically, zilucoplan has demonstrated dose -dependent inhibition of C5a and 
C5b formation following activation of classical or alternative complement pathways, as 
well as inhibition of red blood cell (RBC ) lysis in the serum/plasma from various species. 
Zilucoplan is a potent complement inhibitor in humans and primates and a poor inhibitor 
in most other laboratory animal species.  
5.5  Clinical Trial Experience with Zilucoplan  
Zilucoplan is currently under clinical development by Ra Pharmacueticals, Inc. for the 
treatment of patients with gMG and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).  
5.5.1 Zilucoplan Phase 1 Experience  
RA101495 -1001 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -contro lled, single -ascending 
dose (SAD) and multiple -dose (MD) study in healthy volunteers. The study was 
conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single -ascending doses of 
zilucoplan at dose levels of  admini stered by SC 
injection, and multiple -doses of  administered SC once daily for 7 days. 
Zilucoplan displayed a dose -proportional and predictable pharmacokinetic profile that 
was tightly correlated with the intended pharmacodynamic effect, suppressi on of the 
terminal complement pathway.  
Study RA101495 -03.101 was an open -label, single dose Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study 
of zilucoplan in subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) and healthy controls who rec eived a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg

renal impairment and 8 healthy controls. Based on the data from this study, there is no 
significant impact of reduced creatinine cl earance on the elimination of zilucoplan, and 
therefore no dose adjustment is needed for the use of zilucoplan in patients with renal 
impairment.  
Study RA101495 -01.102 was a double -blind, single - and multiple -dose Phase 1 study 
evaluating safety and tolera bility of zilucoplan in healthy Japanese subjects in 
comparison to healthy Caucasian subjects. A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in this 
study: 18 Japanese subjects and 18 Caucasian subjects. There were two single dose 
cohorts (0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg z ilucoplan SC) and one multiple dose cohort (0.3 
mg/kg zilucoplan SC for 14 days). Dose proportionality and metabolite profile were 
similar between the Caucasian and Japanese subjects. Based on the data from this study, 
there is no significant difference be tween Caucasian and Japanese subjects with respect to 
the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profiles of zilucoplan.  
A complete overview of results from these Phase 1 studies, including details of PK and 
PD measurements, is provided in the zilucop lan IB.  
5.5.2 Zilucoplan Experience in gMG  
5.5.2.1  Completed Phase 2 Study in gMG  
The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan was evaluated in gMG subjects in the Phase 2 study 
RA101495 -02.201. A total of 44 subjects were enrolled in Study RA101495 -02.201 and 
randomized to r eceive placebo, 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan SC daily for 12 weeks. 
Thereafter, subjects randomized to active zilucoplan continue receiving their assigned 
dose, while subjects randomized to placebo were re -randomized to receive active 
zilucoplan at ei ther the 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg dose level.  
The following clinical assessments were performed in Study RA101495 -02.201 to 
evaluate efficacy: The QMG scale was the primary outcome measure, and the secondary 
outcome measures included the MG -ADL, the MGC, and  the MG -QOL15r. The study 
met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
difference on the QMG between the 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan and placebo groups, favoring 
zilucoplan.  Additional analyses supported the primary anal ysis and showed a consistent 
clinical benefit of zilucoplan over placebo. The results for the primary and secondary 
analyses are presented in Table 2.

5.6 Rationale for the Current Study  
Zilucoplan is being developed to treat patients with gMG. Based on the data in Study 
RA101495 -02.201, zilucoplan has the potential to provide several advantages over the 
currently approved therapy for gMG, eculizumab.  
As detailed in Section 5.5.2.1  in Study RA101495 -02.201, 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan showed 
a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit as measured by improvement 
on the primary endpoint, the QMG, compared t o placebo over 12 weeks as well as on the 
MG-ADL, MG -QOL15r, and MGC.  
The clinical benefit of zilucoplan seen in the Phase 2 study compares favorably with 
published data on unapproved SOC therapies such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofe til, cyclosporine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, 
PLEX, and IVIG for which only small investigator -initiated trials with positive data 
(cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, IVIG), circumstantial evidence (azathioprine, PLEX), 
or negative clinical tr ial data (mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, rituximab) are 
available to support efficacy ( Farmakidis et al. 2018 ). 
Moreover, the placebo -corrected clinical efficacy of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan daily SC as 
measured by the QMG and MG -ADL at Week 12 is similar  to the efficacy observed in 
Phase 3 ( Howard et al. 2017 ) with the approved complement C5 inhibitor eculizumab at 
Week 26 after treatment initiation. Unlike eculizumab, zilucoplan provides patients with 
the advantages of SC self -administration at home and is being evaluated in a broad gMG 
population rather than being restricted to patients who are refractory to all other therapies.  
Given the positive results of the Phase 2 gMG study with zilucoplan, confirmation of 
these findings in a pivotal Phase 3 trial is warranted.

Protocol RA101495 -02.301  18.Dec.2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 33 of 79 5.6.1 Rationale for Blinding and Placebo Control  
The primary objective of Study RA101495 -02.301 is the evaluation of efficacy based on 
functional assessment of weakness measured by the MG -ADL Score, as well as 
additional clinical endpoints. Such c linical assessments are prone to placebo effects and 
may be influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment by the clinical evaluator and/or 
subject. Moreover, the evaluation of potential adverse effects may also be influenced by 
knowledge of treatment ass ignment. To enable rigorous efficacy and safety evaluation 
without the potential bias caused by knowledge of treatment assignment, this study was 
designed as a double -blind placebo -controlled study.  
Subjects entering the study will be allowed to continue their SOC therapy, including 
escalation of treatment as medically necessary (see Section 10.1.3.1 ). Therefore, subjects 
receiving placebo will not be subject to increased risk due to withholding of medically 
necessary interventions. In addition, the placebo study drug contains substances that are 
known to be well -tolerated (phosphate buffered saline) and are delivered in a small 
volume < 1  mL; theref ore, placebo administration by daily SC injection over the 12 -week 
study period is expected to be well -tolerated. Consequently, administration of a placebo 
in Study RA101495 -02.301 is not anticipated to cause undue burden or risk for study 
subjects.  
Follow ing the completion of the 12 -week Treatment Period, all subjects will have the 
option to receive zilucoplan in a separate Extension Study, provided they meet the 
Extension Study inclusion criteria. Therefore, subjects originally randomized to placebo 
will eventually have the opportunity to receive active study drug.

Myasthenia Gravis -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) 
Score  
Intercurrent event handling:  
If a subject experiences any of the following intercurrent 
events, then data at and after the point of the intercurrent 
event will be treated as missing using a hypothetical 
strategy:  
A participant receiving rescue therapy:  The study is 
interested in the treatment effe ct assuming that the treatment 
effect is null, and no rescue effect occurs after a subject 
receives rescue medication.  
A subject discontinuing the study:  For subjects that 
discontinue due to AEs related to study drug, it is assumed 
that the treatment effe ct is null. For subjects that discontinue 
for other reasons (i.e., unrelated to study drug) it is assumed 
that the subject had remained on their treatment throughout 
the study (i.e., a "Hypothetical strategy" assuming subjects 
did not discontinue the study  and remained on treatment).  
Population level summary:  The difference between the 
zilucoplan and placebo treatment groups in the mean CFB in 
the Week 12 MG -ADL.  
As described in Section 10.3.1 , the MG -ADL is a brief

7 STUDY DESIGN  
7.1 Overview of Study Design  
Study RA101495 -02.301 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of zilucoplan in subjects with gMG. 
The planned enrollment is approximately 156 subjects.  
Subjects will be randomi zed in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily SC doses of 0.3 mg/kg 
zilucoplan or placebo. Randomization will be stratified based on the baseline MG -ADL 
Score (≤9 versus ≥10), QMG Score (≤17 versus ≥18), and geographical region.  
In order to ensure a gradual initiati on of the study in Japan, each Japanese site will be 
capped to an enrollment rate of no more than one subject per site per week).  
The study includes a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and a 12 -week Treatment Period. 
During the Treatment Period, subjects w ill return to the clinic at Week 1, Week 2, and 
monthly visits at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 to evaluate efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. Additional assessments will include questionnaires, biomarker samples, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and opt ional pharmacogenomics. Safety

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 37 of 79 assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory 
tests, AE monitoring, immunogenicity, and C -SSRS.  
Randomized subjects will receive 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo administered SC at the 
Day 1 visit. Following in -clinic education and training, all subjects will self -inject daily 
SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized treatment allocation, for the 
subsequent 12 weeks. Single use pre -filled syringes in injection devices will be provided 
for use during the study.  
In Japan, following their Day 1 dose, subjects will be hospitalized overnight for 
observation to ensure safety of study drug administration. Prior to discharge, subjects will 
be asked to self -administer their Day 2 dos e under supervision to ensure that their 
technique for self -injection is adequate and appropriate, and to answer any additional 
questions. These pre -scheduled overnight observational hospitalizations will not be 
considered SAEs in this study (even if hospi tal stay is extended, provided that the sole 
purpose of the extension is improvement of the injection technique). Subjects will 
continue to self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized 
treatment allocation, for the subsequent 1 2 weeks.  
Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of all medications unless medically 
indicated changes become necessary. All SOC therapy medications for gMG should be 
kept at the same dose throughout the study, including corticosteroids and IST dru gs. If 
escalation of gMG therapy (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) becomes necessary due to major 
deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, or risk of MG crisis as per the investigator’s 
judgment, the subject may receive IVIG or PLEX treatment as ‘rescue therap y’. In 
Germany, the choice of eculizumab as ‘rescue therapy’ will not be withheld, if the 
investigator considers this to be the best course of action.  
The safety of subjects will be monitored in a blinded manner on an ongoing basis. If an 
unblinded data re view should become necessary to ensure subject safety, a SMC will 
convene and evaluate study data as appropriate (see Section 11.4.2.1 ).  
To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection (Neisseria meningitidis), all subjects must 
be vaccinated against meningococcal infections (with a quadrivalent vaccine and, where 
available and in accordance with local SOC, serogroup B vaccine) within 3 years  prior to, 
or at the time of, initiating study drug. Subjects who initiate study drug treatment less 
than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with 
appropriate prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Penicillin V 500mg twice daily , third 
generation cephalosporin, etc.) until at least 2 weeks after the initial dose of vaccine(s). 
The use of fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics is not recommended due to the 
potential for exacerbation of MG. Booster vaccinations should be administ ered in 
accordance with SOC.   
During the Treatment Period, to mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled 
and reminded of the early signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis  infection. A 
patient safety card detailing the signs and sympto ms of infection, with instructions to 
seek immediate medical attention if any such symptoms occur, will be provided to each 
subject.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 38 of 79 At the conclusion of the Treatment Period, all subjects will have the option to receive 
zilucoplan in a separate Extension Study, provided they meet the Extension Study 
inclusion criteria.  
If a subject discontinues study drug treatment prior to the Week 12 visit for any reason, 
he/she will not be eligible for the Extension Study. For subjects who permanently 
discontinue study  drug, a Safety Follow -up Visit will be performed at 40 days after the 
last dose of study drug, to collect information on any ongoing AEs or new SAEs since the 
last study visit.  
7.2 Study Periods  
The total duration of study participation for all subjects will be up to approximately 
16 weeks, including a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and a 12 -week Treatment 
Period. For subjects who permanently discontinue study drug at any time, a Safety 
Follow -up Visit will be performed at 40 days after the last dose of stu dy drug, to collect 
information on any ongoing AEs or new SAEs since the last study visit.  
At the conclusion of the Treatment Period of the study, all subjects will have the option 
to receive zilucoplan in a separate Extension Study,  provided they meet the  Extension 
Study inclusion criteria . In the Extension Study, zilucoplan will be provided by the 
Sponsor until zilucoplan is approved and available in the territory, or the Sponsor 
terminates development of zilucoplan for gMG. In countries where zilucoplan is not 
approved or marketed, but in which sponsored clinical studies have been conducted, 
subjects may continue to receive zilucoplan through a compassionate use pathway.  
7.2.1 Screening Period  
The Screening visit(s) will occur no more than 28 days prior to the  first dose of study 
drug on Day 1.  
Subjects that do not meet the entry criteria for the study may rescreen after 8 weeks. 
Subjects may be rescreened no more than 2 times.  
7.2.1.1  Screening and Enrollment  
Procedures performed as SOC during the Screening Period m ay be used to determine 
eligibility. Informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any study -specific 
procedures that are not SOC.  
At the Screening visit, subjects will be assigned a unique subject number. The following 
assessments will be performe d during Screening:  
• Informed consent

7.2.1.2  Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects who meet all entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily SC 
doses of 0.3  mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo. Subjects will be assigned to study arms in a 
blinded fashion using a computerized randomization algorithm. Randomization will be 
stratified based on the baseline MG -ADL Score (≤9 versus ≥10), and Q MG Score (≤17 
versus ≥18), and geographical region.  
This is a double -blind study. Subjects and study staff will remain blinded to treatment 
assignments until after the data have been cleaned, locked, and unblinded.  
To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of all available double -blind data to prepare 
regulatory submissions for approval of the MG target indication, two database locks are 
planned for this study. The first interim lock will occur once the last subject has 
completed Week  12, or after the last s ubject has prematurely discontinued prior to

statistician after the first database lock. Only study staff involved in data analysis and 
review will have access to unbli nded results. Investigators and site personnel will not be 
unblinded to treatment assignments after the first database lock. A final database lock 
will occur after all data (through to the SFU visit) have been collected. If all the subjects 
have completed the study at the interim look (the last participants entered the extension 
study), then the interim database lock will be the final lock.  
Instructions for emergency unblinding, if warranted, for safety reasons are provided in 
Section 11.4.3 . 
7.2.2 Treatment Period  
Subjects will receive treatment with 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo, according to 
randomization, from Day 1 to Week 12 during the Treatment Per iod. 
In Japan, following their Day 1 dose, subjects will be hospitalized overnight for 
observation to ensure safety of study drug administration. Prior to discharge, subjects will 
be asked to self -administer their Day 2 dose under supervision to ensure tha t their 
technique for self -injection is adequate and appropriate, and to answer any additional 
questions. These pre -scheduled overnight observational hospitalizations will not be 
considered SAEs in this study (even if hospital stay is extended, provided th at the sole 
purpose of the extension is improvement of the injection technique). Subjects will 
continue to self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized 
treatment allocation, for the subsequent 12 weeks.  
In consultation with the  treating physician, subjects who complete the Week 12 Visit 
(including those randomized to the placebo arm) will have the option to continue 
treatment with zilucoplan in a separate Extension Study.  
If a subject chooses not to participate in the Extension Study, the subject will complete an 
End of Study Visit (see Section 7.2.2.1 ) and receive standa rd-of-care treatment off -study, 
as recommended by the treating physician. For subjects who permanently discontinue 
study drug at any time, a Safety Follow -up Visit will be performed at 40 days after the 
last dose of study drug, to collect information on an y ongoing AEs or new SAEs since the 
last study visit.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 79 If the Sponsor terminates or suspends the study, all applicable Competent Regulatory 
Authorities will be informed as per applicable legislation.  
The end of study, or study termination, is defined as the time at which the last subject ha s 
performed their last visit (LSLV). Following LSLV, all remaining data will be collected 
in the appropriate case report forms (see Section 14.3.1 ) and the study results will be 
summarized in the clinical study report (see Section 14.5). 
7.4 Study Conduct During COVID -19 
The protocol -mandated visit s chedule should be followed to the extent possible, based on 
the judgment of the investigator. However, during the COVID -19 outbreak or under other 
exceptional circumstances, remote follow -up will be conducted and the subjects will be 
contacted by telephone /video contact to assess as many details as possible, according to 
the protocol scheduling, to verify that the subject is suitable for continuing study 
treatment. Some procedures may be collected by other remote means if feasible. Study 
sites should make e fforts to inform the sponsor or the CRO in the event that procotol 
procedures cannot be completed due to COVID -19. 
In those situations when the subject cannot return to the study site, the investigators will 
assess the subject’s safety by telephone/video c ontact. Based on information gathered 
from the telephone/video contact, investigators will confirm whether the subject could 
continue the current IMP treatment after the assessment. If the subject is suitable for 
study treatment continuation, the investiga tor or designee will assess if the subject agrees 
to provide name, address, telephone number and email to the appointed courier. The 
subject will confirm his/her consent by email or verbally in order to receive IMP via 
courier. If the email option is not p ossible, the site must obtain consent via phone and 
document it in the medical record.  
If the shipment is agreed, the investigator or designee will clearly explain to the subject 
everything needed regarding the handling (in case of inconsistencies at deliv ery) and 
administration of the study drug and how to return all unused IMP to the study site at the 
next on -site visit. Only after approval by the study staff for the correct shipment, the 
subject will start taking the treatment. The whole process and comm unication with 
subject will be documented in the subject’s medical source record. Changes in the study 
treatment supply in this situation are described in Section 9.2.1.1 . 
Ad hoc subject contact may be warranted to understand the current health status of the 
subjects, to follow up on AEs, and inform them of any protective measures taken by the 
clinical site as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (eg, any  measures that may limit 
access to the site or may require additional actions by the subject prior to entry to the 
site).  
If a subject needs to be discontinued and cannot come into the clinic, a visit will be 
scheduled to perform final safety assessments a s soon as possible.  
If a subject visits another facility for a medical issue, the investigator should request 
contact with the physician providing care to provide a detailed explanation of the

10. Vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and, where available, 
meningococcal serotype B vaccine at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study 
drug at the Day 1 visit. A booster vaccination should also be administered as 
clinically  indicated, according to the local SOC, for subjects who have been 
previously vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis  
11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 
at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test wit hin 24  hours prior to the first 
dose of study drug  
12. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are not 
postmenopausal or who have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
bilateral tubal ligation) and all male subje cts (who have not been surgically sterilized 
by vasectomy) must agree to use effective contraception during the study and during 
the safety follow -up period of 40 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Postmenopausal women are, for the purposes of this pr otocol, defined as women who 
have not had menses for 12  months without an alternative medical cause. A high 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contr aception or 
hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 
a single FSH measurement is insufficient.

8.3.1 Withdrawal of Consent  
A subject may withdraw consent to participate in this study at any time without penalty 
or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled to. When a subject wishes to 
withdraw consent, it is important to distinguish between withdrawing his/her consent for 
a particul ar study procedure or visit versus withdrawing his/her consent from the study 
entirely (i.e., premature discontinuation).  
When a subject withdraws consent from the study (or study procedure), the reason(s) for 
withdrawal will be recorded by the investigato r or designee on the relevant page of the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  
8.3.2 Premature Discontinuation  
Every reasonable effort should be made to encourage retention of subjects in the study, 
maximize compliance with study drug, and facilitate attendance a t all scheduled study 
visits/assessments.  
All subjects have the right to refuse further participation in the study at any time and for 
any reason. A subject’s participation must, therefore, be terminated immediately upon 
his/her request.  
The investigator will make every attempt to ascertain the reason(s) for discontinuation 
and to document this in detail in the source documentation and the appropriate sections of 
the eCRF. A subject must be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdr awal by subject  
• Protocol Violation/Noncompliance (defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the 
study procedures)  
• Pregnancy while receiving study drug  
• At the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agencies, or IRB/IEC  
• Physician decision  
• Loss to follow -up 
• Death  
• Safety/best interest of the subject as determined by the investigator or Sponsor  
• Intolerability of study medication  
Dosing of a subjects may be interrupted or permanently discontinued if, in the opinion of 
the investigator and / or Sponsor, it is uns afe for the subject to continue dosing with study 
medication. Subjects diagnosed with meningococcal disease will be discontinued 
immediately and permanently.  
All subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment (i.e., prior to Week 12 visit) for 
any re ason will not be eligible to participate in the Extension Study.

9.1.2 Dosing Schedule  
All eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo 
administered SC at the Day 1 visit, which will be performed by the subject while 
observed by the site staff at the study visit. Following in -clinic education and training, all 
subjects will self -inject daily SC doses of study drug at approximately the same time each 
day for the remainder of the Treatment Period.  
Dosing on study visit days should be held until all assessments (e.g., MG -ADL, QMG,  
MG-QOL15r, MGC, questionnaires, sample collection, etc.) have been completed. On 
days when rescue therapy is concurrently administered, study drug dosing should be held 
until after administration of rescue therapy and PK/PD sampling.  
At each study visit,  dosing should be supervised to ensure correct injection technique.

Subjects who present with a higher body weight (≥150 kg) or a lower body weight 
(<43  kg) will be accommodated on a case -by-case basis, in consultation with the medical 
monitor.  
9.1.3.1  Missed Doses  
In Japan, subjects will be instructed to self -inject SC doses daily at approximately the 
same  time each day. A missed dose will be defined as a dose missed 36 hours from the 
previous dose.  
Study personnel will assess study drug compliance at every visit to record whether any 
doses were missed. If a subject misses 1 dose (i.e., 1 day) of study drug , he/she should 
take the next planned dose as scheduled and the investigator should be contacted as soon 
as possible. If a subject misses 2 or more doses, he/she must notify the investigator 
immediately and the medical monitor should be consulted.  
If a su bject misses 10 or more consecutive doses, he/she must notify the investigator 
immediately, the medical monitor should be consulted, and this will be considered a 
major protocol deviation.  
9.2 Study Treatment Management  
9.2.1 Preparation and Dispensing  
Prefilled syr inges will be dispensed to each subject at each study visit, beginning on 
Day 1 of the Treatment Period.  
Subjects will be provided with training and detailed instructions on the administration of 
study drug using the single use pre -filled syringes in inje ction devices.  
9.2.1.1  Alternative Study Treatment Supply Due to COVID -19 Pandemic  
In circumstances where the subject is not allowed to visit the site, the IMP may be 
delivered directly to the subject via qualified courier that will act as a liaison between 
sites and subjects to deliver the drug during the outbreak.  
If the shipment of the drug directly to the subject is agreed, the investigator or designee 
will clearly explain proper handling and administration of the study drug. Subjects will be 
instructed to retu rn all unused IMP at the next on -site visit.

upper arm.  
All subjects will receive study drug kits, each of which will include 7 single -dose, 
prefilled syringes (pre -loaded into self -injection devices) containing study drug, alcohol 
wipes, and adhesive dressings, as well as a syringe disposal container.  
9.2.3 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
Subjects will receive secure containers to disp ose of used syringes while at home. At 
each visit, the subject should return the container containing all used syringes to the site. 
The unused study drug (i.e., unused syringes) and containers should be returned by the 
subject at each study visit.  
All un used study drug syringes and disposal containers containing used syringes must be 
returned to the site at the last study visit (i.e., End of Study Visit).  
9.2.4 Drug Accountability  
It is the responsibility of the pharmacist to ensure that a current record of inv entory/drug 
accountability is maintained. Inventory records must be readily available for inspection 
by the study monitor and are open to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time. For 
further details, please consult the Pharmacy Manual.  
10 STUDY ASSE SSMENTS  
Please refer to Table 1 for the timing of study assessments. All assessments are to be

Height (cm) will be collected at the Screening visit only. Weight (kg) will be measured at 
the study visits indicated in Table 1. 
10.1.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescriptions and over -the-counter medications taken during the 30 days prior to 
Screening through the last study visit will be documented. NOTE: A complete history of 
medications taken for the treatment of gMG will be collected.  
Concomitant medicatio ns include any prescription or over -the-counter medication that is 
ongoing on Day 1 or that is initiated following the first dose of study drug on Day 1.  
Medications, including over the counter therapeutics, natural products, and vitamins, 
should not be c hanged during the Screening or Treatment Periods, unless medically 
necessary. Please refer to Appendix 2: Prohibited Concomitant Medications for a list of 
prohibited concomitant medications.  
Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of SOC therapy fo r gMG throughout the 
study, including corticosteroids and IST drugs. The pyridostigmine dose may be reduced 
if the investigator identifies intolerable side effects clearly related to pyridostigmine. 
Prior to altering the dose of pyridostigmine, the investi gator should contact the medical 
monitor. Any pyridostigmine, regardless of the dosing regimen, is to be withheld for a 
minimum of 10 hours prior to clinical evaluation.  
Dose of SOC treatment should not be increased during the study. Instead, rescue therap y 
as described in Section 10.1.3.1  should be administered.  
Medications will be recorded on the subject’s source documents and entered on the 
approp riate eCRF. Any changes to concomitant medications will be recorded in the 
eCRF. Physical therapy interventions and medical devices are considered concomitant 
interventions and will be captured in the procedures eCRF.  
10.1.3.1  Rescue Therapy  
Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of all medications unless medically 
indicated changes become necessary. All SOC therapy medications for gMG should be 
kept at the same dose throughout the study, including corticosteroids and IST drugs. If 
escalation of gMG therap y (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) becomes necessary due to major 
deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, or risk of MG crisis as per the investigator’s 
judgment, the subject may receive IVIG or PLEX treatment as ‘rescue therapy’.  
In Germany,  the choice of eculizumab as ‘rescue therapy’ will not be withheld, if the 
investigator considers this to be the best course of action. In subjects with refractory 
gMG, the use of eculizumab (according to its marketing authorization) may only be

initiation of eculizumab, subjects will discontinue study drug, but will otherwise 
complete the study as planned. Initiation of eculizumab is considered ‘rescue therapy’ as 
per protocol.  
If suc h rescue therapy becomes necessary, the choice of IVIG vs. PLEX vs eculizumab, 
as well as the frequency and duration of such therapy, will be determined by the 
investigator. Escalation of doses of corticosteroids or IST drugs (other than initiation of 
eculizumab) for rescue is not permitted. The Sponsor should be notified immediately 
upon determination that rescue therapy is necessary in any given subject.  
A Rescue Therapy Visit should be performed prior to initiation of rescue therapy (see 
Table 1 for a list of applicable study procedures).  
Unblinding of treatment assignment prior to initiation of rescue therapy will not be 
allowed, unless critical for reasons of subject safety. The subject will continue their 
blinded treatment and complete all study -specified assessments while undergoing rescue 
therapy and through the end of the study if the investigator, in consultation with the 
medical monitor, consid ers this course of action in the best interest of the subject. Details 
on the rescue therapy, as well as reasons for initiation of rescue therapy, will be collected.  
10.2 Safety Assessments  
10.2.1  Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed on all s ubjects at the visits listed in Table 1 
and will include the following assessments:  
• Abdomen  
• Cardiac  
• Eyes, Ears, Nose & Throat  
• General appearance  
• Head & Neck  • Musculoskeletal  
• Neurological  
• Respiratory  
• Skin/Mucosal  
Clinically significant physical examination abnormalities will be reported as AEs, when 
appropriate.  
Physical examinations should also include an examination of the injection site(s). If an 
injection site reaction (ISR) is observed or reported by the subj ect, it should be recorded 
as an AE in the eCRF.  
10.2.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (HR, body temperature, and blood pressure) will be measured in the sitting 
position. If blood samples are scheduled at the same time, vital signs should be measured 
before the blood draw. Blood pressure may be measured manually or by automated 
device, preferably using the non -dominant arm. The same measurement technique should 
be used throughout the study for the same subjects.

blood, hemoglobin, and cells. A microscopic examination will be performed, if  
necessary.  
10.2.4.3  Pregnancy Testing and Contraception  
A serum pregnancy test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed on female 
subjects of childbearing potential at Screening.  
A urine dipstick pregnancy test (human chorionic gonadotropin) will be pe rformed on 
female subjects of childbearing potential at all other study visits as specified in Table 1. 
Negative pregnancy tests must be documented fo r all female subjects of childbearing 
potential prior to dosing at applicable study visits.  
Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are not 
postmenopausal or who have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bi lateral 
tubal ligation) and all male subjects (who have not been surgically sterilized by 
vasectomy) must agree to use effective contraception during the study and during the 
safety follow -up period of 40 days after the last dose of study drug. Postmenopau sal 
women are, for the purposes of this protocol, defined as women who have not had 
menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopaus al state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient. Effective contraception is defined as:  
• Hormonal contraception (e.g., oral cont raceptive, transdermal contraceptive, 
contraceptive implant, or injectable hormonal contraceptive) for at least 3 months 
prior to study drug administration, throughout the study, and for 40  days after the 
last dose of study drug.  
• In countries other than Ge rmany and Norway, double -barrier birth control (e.g., a 
combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge together with 
spermicide) starting at the Screening visit, throughout the study, and for at least 
40 days after the last dose of study drug.  
NOTE: Use of a male and female condom simultaneously is NOT an acceptable 
method of double -barrier birth control.  
• Intrauterine contraception/device starting at the Screening visit, throughout the 
study, and for 40  days after the last dose of study d rug. 
• Total abstinence from sexual intercourse (only acceptable if it is the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject) for at least 1 complete menstrual cycle prior to the 
Screening visit, throughout the study, and for 40  days after the last dose of stu dy 
drug.  
• Maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been 
surgically sterilized by vasectomy.

10.2.7  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
In accordance with the draft FDA Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Prospective 
Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry  (FDA 2012 ) subjects 
will be asked to c omplete the C -SSRS at study visits as specified in Table 1. 
10.2.8  Overnight Observational Hospitalization in Japan  
In Japan, following their Day 1 dose, sub jects will be hospitalized overnight for 
observation to ensure safety of study drug administration. Prior to discharge, subjects will 
be asked to self -administer their Day 2 dose under supervision to ensure that their 
technique for self -injection is adequa te and appropriate, and to answer any additional 
questions. These pre -scheduled overnight observational hospitalizations will not be 
considered SAEs in this study (even if hospital stay is extended, provided that the sole 
purpose of the extension is improv ement of the injection technique). Subjects will 
continue to self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized 
treatment allocation, for the subsequent 12 weeks.  
10.3 Efficacy Assessments  
10.3.1  Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the CFB to Week 12 in MG -ADL Score.  
The MG -ADL is a brief 8 -item survey designed to evaluate MG symptom severity. 
Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms of MG. A 2 -point change in 
MG-ADL Score is considered clinically m eaningful ( Wolfe et al. 1999; Muppidi et al. 
2011 ). 
Clinical Evaluators must be adequately trained prior to conducting any efficacy 
assessments. The MG -ADL assessment will be performed at Screening to assess subject

performed at approximately the same time of day (preferably in the morning) and 
administered by the sa me well -trained evaluator (e.g., neurologist, physical therapist, or 
other study staff experienced in clinical assessments) at each visit throughout the study. If 
a subject is receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor, the dose must be withheld for at least 10 
hours prior to the assessment. Detailed instructions regarding the administration of the 
MG-ADL test will be provided to sites.  
10.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Detailed instructions regarding the administration of the secondary efficacy assessments 
will be  provided to sites.  
10.3.2.1  Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis  
The QMG is a standardized and validated quantitative strength scoring system that was 
developed specifically for MG. If a subject is receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor, the 
dose must be withheld for at l east 10 hours prior to the assessment. Higher scores are 
representative of more severe impairment. A change in the QMG Score of 3 points or 
more may be considered clinically meaningful, in a typical clinical trial population of 
MG patients ( Barohn et al. 1 998; Katzberg et al. 2014 ).  
10.3.2.2  MG Composite  
The MGC is a 10 -item scale that has been used to measure the clinical status of patients 
with MG, both in the practice setting and in clinical trials, in order to evaluate treatment 
response. Higher scores in the MGC indicate more severe impairment due to the disease. 
A 3-point change in this assessment is considered clinically meaningful ( Benatar et al. 
2012; Sadjadi 2012 ).  
10.3.2.3  MG-QOL15r  
The MG -QOL15r is a 15 -item survey that was designed to assess quality of life in  
patients with MG. Higher scores indicate more severe impact of the disease on aspects of 
the patient’s life ( Burns et al. 2010; Burns et al. 2016 ). 
10.3.2.4  Minimal Symptom Expression  
MSE is designed to assess how many subjects become free or virtually free of MG  
symptoms as measured by achieving an MG -ADL total score of 0 or 1 on therapy 
(Vissing et al. 2018 ). 
10.4 Pharmacokinetic Assessments/Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for PK/PD assessments will be collected from all subjects and include 
measurements of : 
• Plasma concentration of zilucoplan and its major metabolites  
• sRBC lysis assay for evaluation of classical complement pathway activation  
• C5 levels

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 of 79  
Blood samples for PK and PD analysis will be obtained prior to administration of study 
drug (within 1 hour of dosing). If Rescue Therapy is administered at a location separate 
from the clinical site, then there is no need to collect blood samples for PK/PD. For local 
Rescue Therapy visits, PK and PD samples will be collected at the following time points:  
 
During Rescue Therapy  
ONLY at sites where rescue therapy is administered locally  
Within 1 hour before administration of each round of rescue therapy  
For PLEX only: PK will be measured in the exchanged plasma  
Within 1 hour after administration of each round of rescue therapy  
All samples will be sent to an accredited laboratory for analysis, and results will remain 
blinded until after database lock. Detailed instructions regarding PK/PD sample 
collection, processing, and shipping will be provided to sit es. 
10.5 Additional Assessments  
10.5.1  MGFA Post -Intervention Status  
The MGFA -PIS is a physician -determined assessment of a clinical symptoms of MG 
after initiation of MG specific therapy. Minimal Manifestation is defined as follows:  
‘The patient has no symptoms of f unctional limitations from MG but has some weakness 
on examination of some muscles. This class recognizes that some patients who otherwise 
meet the definition of Complete Stable Remission (CSR) or Pharmacologic Remission 
(PR) do have weakness that is only detectable by careful examination.’  
For the purpose of the current study, Minimal Manifestation will be determined at each 
timepoint after treatment initiation (rather than after 1 year). Change in status (improved, 
unchanged, worse, exacerbation, or died of MG) will also be determined.  
10.5.2  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire  
The WPAI:SHP is a standardized 6 -item questionnaire for assessing the amount of both 
absenteeism (work time missed) and presenteeism (reduced on -the-job effectiveness)  due 
to health problems ( Reilly et al. 1993 ). All subjects will be asked to complete the 
WPAI:SHP questionnaire in accordance with Table 1. 
10.5.3  EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The EQ -
5D which consists of the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The EQ -5D 
descriptive system is comprised of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression; each dimension has 5 levels: no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems 
(EuroQOL Group 1990 ). Subjects answer questions based on symptoms and health status 
on the day t he questionnaire is completed. All subjects will be asked to complete the EQ -
5D-5L in accordance with Table 1.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 56 of 79 10.5.4  Neuro -QOL Fatigue Short Form  
The Neuro -QOL Fatigue Short Form is part of the Neuro -QOL battery of measures that 
quantify the physical, mental, and social effects experienced by patients with 
neurological conditions. The Neuro -QOL Scales were developed with National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) fun ding to standardize assessments of these evaluations across patients 
with neurological diseases. Fatigue is a frequent complaint in subjects with MG but has 
rarely been formally assessed to date. The Neuro -QOL Short Form will be used to 
explore any potenti al effect of treatment of zilucoplan on fatigue. All subjects will be 
asked to complete the Neuro -QOL Fatigue Short Form in accordance with Table 1. 
10.5.5  Biomarkers  
Blood samples for mechanistic biomarker testing [e.g., complement fixation, complement 
function, complement pathway proteins, autoantibody characterization (titer and 
immunoglobulin class), and inflammatory markers] will be obtained prior to 
admin istration of study drug (within 1 hour of dosing) in accordance with Table 1. 
Detailed instructions regarding sample collection, processing, and shipp ing will be 
provided to sites.  
The analysis of biomarkers pertaining to the pathophysiology of MG [e.g., complement 
fixation, complement function, complement pathway proteins, autoantibody 
characterization (titer and immunoglobulin class), and inflammatory  markers] may 
provide further insight into the clinical efficacy and safety of zilucoplan in subjects with 
gMG. Complement protein levels and complement activity will be tested to evaluate 
response to zilucoplan and to understand subject characteristics re lated to variations in 
response to drug. Markers of inflammation may be tested to assess correlation with 
complement function and clinical response to zilucoplan. A list of analytes will be 
created through review of the literature, ongoing clinical studies , and ongoing exploratory 
work and may be finalized after completion of the study.  
The completion of these investigations may be conditional based on the results of this or 
other clinical studies, and samples may be selected for analysis on the basis of clinical 
outcome. The results of the biomarker analysis may be reported separately from the main 
clinical study report.  
10.5.6  Pharmacogenomic Assessments  
Participation in the pharmacogenomic assessment is optional, and subjects must provide 
additional consent fo r the pharmacogenomic analysis.  
For subjects who choose to participate in pharmacogenomic studies, a blood sample will 
be obtained. All genomic analyses will be performed at an accredited laboratory. Detailed 
instructions regarding sample collection, proce ssing, and shipping will be provided to 
sites.  
Genomic studies (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing) including exploration 
of whether specific genomic features correlate with response or resistance to study drug, 
may be performed.

11 SAFETY REPORTING  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicina l product.  
The following are not considered to be AEs despite requiring hospitalization:  
• Pre-existing conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, did not worsen or 
progress during study participation  
• Routinely scheduled procedures or treatment  
• Elective procedures that were scheduled prior to study participation (i.e., signing of 
the ICF)  
All AEs should be appropriately recorded according to the instructions in Section 11.4. 
11.1.1.1  Occurrence of COVID -19 
Occurrence of COVID -19 in subjects should be reported as either “suspected 
COVID -19” or “confirmed COVID -19” along with all available relevant data, including 
diagnostic and laboratory data. For subj ects where COVID -19 is still suspected despite a 
negative viral test, please report as “suspected COVID -19” and provide relevant data to 
support the diagnosis as well as the test results.  
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (note that this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation  of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 58 of 79 require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e 
for bronchospasm, hyperkalemia, or convulsions that do not result in a formal 
hospitalization.  
Elective hospitalizations that were scheduled prior to study participation (i.e., signing of 
the ICF) are not considered to be SAEs and should not be reported.   
Also, in Japan, overnight observational hospitalizations to ensure to ensure safety of 
study drug administration will not be considered SAEs in this study (even if extended, 
provided that the sole purpose of the extension is improvement of the injection 
technique).  
11.2 Monitoring of Infection  
All subjects will be monitored at every study visit for signs and symptoms of Neisseria 
meningitidis infection.  
To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection (Neisseria meningitidis), all subjects must 
be vaccinated agai nst meningococcal infections (with a quadrivalent vaccine and, where 
available and in accordance with local SOC, serogroup B vaccine) within 3 years prior to, 
or at the time of, initiating study drug. Subjects who initiate study drug treatment less 
than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with 
appropriate prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Penicillin V 500mg twice daily, third 
generation cephalosporin, etc.) until at least 2 weeks after the initial dose of vaccine(s). 
The use  of fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics is not recommended due to the 
potential for exacerbation of MG. Booster vaccinations should be administered in 
accordance with SOC.  
To mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled and reminded of the early 
signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis  infection. A patient safety card detailing 
the signs and symptoms of infection, with instructions to seek immediate medical 
attention if any such symptoms occur, will be provided to each subject.  
11.3 Evalu ation and Classifications  
11.3.1  Severity  
The investigator should determine the severity of the reported AE by using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  
For any reported AE not described in the CTCAE, the following guidelines must be 
considered for severity evaluation:  
Adverse Event Severity  
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does 
not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for 
relief of symptom(s) .

application and any extensions or variations thereof.
Zilucoplan  Version 2.0  
Protocol RA101495 -02.301  18.Dec.2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 59 of 79 Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily 
activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may 
be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant 
impact on subject’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with study 
treatment; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospitalized.  
11.3.2  Causality  
The causal relationship of the AE to study dru g will be assessed by both the investigator 
and the Sponsor. The assessment of causal relationship to study drug should be evidence -
based, and not based on the premise that all AEs are causally related to study drug until 
proven otherwise. Default categori zation of ‘related’ without supportive evidence for a 
causal relationship to study drug is generally uninformative and does not contribute to 
understanding of the safety profile of the drug with respect to the intended population.  
Examples of evidence that  would suggest a causal relationship between the study drug 
and the AE include the occurrence of an AE that is known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure (e.g., ISRs) or an AE that is otherwise uncommon in the study population. 
Lack of efficacy of study drug, in isolation, leading to unmasking of underlying 
symptoms and signs of disease, should NOT  be considered evidence of relatedness.  
The causal relationship of each AE is assessed using a binary system, with all AEs 
classified as either ‘related’ or ‘not related’.  
Related: There is ‘reasonable possibility’ that the study drug caused the AE. The AE 
follows a reasonable temporal association from the time of study drug administration. 
There is supportive evidence to suggest a possible causal relations hip, irrespective of the 
degree of certainty, between the observed AE and the study drug. There is no alternative 
more likely explanation for the AE. Lack of study drug efficacy is not considered, by 
itself, to be evidence of relatedness.  
Not Related: Lack of a reasonable temporal or causal association from the administration 
of the study drug and the occurrence of the AE. There is evidence of an alternative 
explanation that is more likely the cause of the AE.  
11.4 Recording, Reporting, and Monitoring  
11.4.1  Recording  and Reporting  
The investigator must make every effort to properly evaluate all information relevant to 
the reported AE in such a way that a diagnosis can be confidently made and reported. For 
example, it is preferable to report ‘pneumonia’ as the AE rathe r than its symptoms (e.g., 
‘rales’ or ‘fever’) as separate AEs.

Protocol RA101495 -02.301  18.Dec.2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 60 of 79 When recording and/or reporting AEs or SAEs, the following elements must be included:  
• The fulfilled criteria for seriousness as presented in Section 11.1.2  
• The severity of the event as defined in Section 11.3.1  
• The relationship of the event to study treatment as defined in Section 11.3.2  
Actio ns taken in relation to the AE will be recorded as drug discontinued, drug 
interrupted, concomitant medication, other action (e.g.,  diagnostic testing), or no action. 
Any medication given to treat the AE will be recorded separately in the concomitant 
medic ation list of the eCRF.  
The outcome of the AE will be recorded as date ended, ongoing, or resulting in death 
with date of death.  
11.4.1.1  Adverse Events  
Pre-existing conditions that are detected prior to administration of the first dose of study 
drug will be recorded as part of the medical history. For all subjects, the AE reporting 
period will start with the first administration of study drug on Day 1 and will end with the 
last study visit (i.e., End of Study Visit, Week 12 Visit), after which no new non -serious 
AEs are to be reported. The subjects will be monitored throughout the study for any AEs, 
including clinically significant findings at vital signs measurements, spontaneous reports 
by study subjects, and observations by the study personnel.  
When possibl e, ongoing AEs assessed as related to the study drug will be followed until 
resolved or stabilized. Sites will call subjects 40 days after their last dose to gather 
information on ongoing AEs and report any new SAEs since the last study visit (see 
Section 11.4.1.2  for SAE reporting instructions).  
All AEs will be recorded in the eCRF. The investigator will assess and record any AE in 
detail including the date and time of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, 
severity, time course (end date or ongoing), relationship of the AE to study drug, and 
action(s) taken. All AEs should be reported separately (i.e., 1 record per event). 
Reporting of A Es is event -based (i.e., an ongoing event will not be closed until resolved 
or at the end of study). For the AE description, a diagnosis is preferred over symptoms. If 
no diagnosis can be made, each symptom will be reported as a separate AE. 
Abbreviations should be avoided. Descriptive words should be used for ongoing 
conditions as applicable (e.g., worsening of eczema).  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) after 
the eCRFs have been monitored and signed by the inves tigator.  
11.4.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE experienced by the subject from signing the ICF through to 40 days after the 
last dose of study drug, regardless of severity or causality, must be recorded on the eCRF 
and SAE forms. Sites will call subjects 40 days after their last dose to gather information 
on ongoing AEs and report any new SAEs since the last study visit.

from the time the study site becomes aware of the SAE. A formal notification must be 
submitted to the Sponsor regardless of the following:  
• Severity  
• Causality  
• Whether or not the subject received study treatment or underwent study related 
procedures  
The IRB/IEC will be notified as required by local regulations.  The investigator will be 
responsible for submitting the required safety information to the appropriate IRB/IEC, 
including any safety reports received from the Sponsor as well as any SAEs occurring at 
his/her site.  
The Sponsor, or designee, will prepare a ny required safety reports for Competent 
Regulatory Authorities and all active investigators. These reports will be provided as 
addenda to the IB, and the investigator will place these with the IB. All Competent 
Regulatory Authorities will be informed as p er applicable legislation. Reporting of 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be in accordance with 
Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating 
countries.  
11.4.1.3  Death  
Any event with an outcome of death should be appropriately recorded in the eCRF. All 
identified causes of death, including an assessment of the possible relationship of each to 
study treatment, must be reported as SAEs as outlined in Section  11.4.1.2 . Any autopsy 
or other postmortem findings (including a coroner’s report) should be provided if 
available.  
11.4.1.4  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
All central laborato ry data generated during the study will be included in standard 
Statistical Analysis System (SAS) datasets. Throughout this study, subjects will have 
samples sent to local laboratories and to the central laboratory. Only the values from the 
central laborat ory will be captured in the database and used for the safety analysis. 
Investigators may report AEs based upon local laboratory values, if clinically relevant. In 
this event, the actual value and the normal range for the local laboratory should be 
recorded  on the AE eCRF.  
11.4.2  Safety Monitoring  
All AEs should be monitored by the investigator until resolution or stabilization.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 62 of 79 11.4.2.1  Safety Monitoring Committee  
The safety of study subjects will be monitored throughout the study on an ongoing basis. 
Given the double bli nd, placebo -controlled design of Study RA101495.02.301, this 
standard safety data review will be performed while blinded to treatment assignment.  
If an unblinded data review should become necessary to ensure subject safety, a separate 
SMC will convene and  evaluate study data as appropriate. To ensure the scientific 
integrity of the study, members of the SMC will not be directly involved in management 
of the study. The composition, duties, and purview of the SMC will be outlined in a 
separate SMC Charter.  
11.4.2.2  Post-study Events  
Any SAE that was continuing at the time of subject discontinuation or study completion 
should be monitored by the investigator until resolution or stabilization.  
SAEs that occur within 40 days after the subject discontinues from or comple tes the study 
should be reported using the same procedures outlined in Section  11.4.1.2 . These SAEs 
should be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects will v isit the clinic 40 days after their last dose 
of study drug to gather information on ongoing AEs and report any new SAEs since the 
last study visit (see Section 11.4.1.2  for SAE reporting instructions). All SAEs will be 
followed to resolution or stabilization.  
11.4.3  Emergency Unblinding  
The study drug treatment assignment may be unblinded only in emergency situations 
when knowledge of the treatment assignment is considered absolutely necessary for 
medical management of the subject or for clinical decision -making (i.e., when knowledge 
of the treatment assignment would impact a treatment decision). The investigator will 
have unrestricted and immediate access to unblind the treatment code in the IXRS. The 
instructions for unblinding a subject in the IXRS can be found in the IXRS User Guide.  
In the event unblinding is necessary, the investigator is strongly encouraged, but not 
required, to contact the app ropriate medical monitor to discuss the situation and the 
subject’s medical status prior to unblinding.  
When a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, a comprehensive source note must 
be completed by the unblinding investigator that includes the date and time and the 
reason(s) the subject’s treatment code was unblinded. In the event the investigator 
chooses to discuss the unblinding with the medical monitor, the source note must also 
include a record of the discussion.  
It is mandatory that all personn el who are involved in the unblinding and who have 
access to the unblinded treatment assignment information maintain the confidentiality of 
the information by not divulging the treatment assignment.

follow -up as required by non -unblinded study subjects.  
11.5 Special Circumstances  
11.5.1  Pregnancy  
Subjects and their partners should avoid pregnancy throughout the course of the study. 
Pregnancy in a study subject or partner must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of the study site becoming aware of the pregnancy. Subjects with a positive pregnancy 
test before study drug dosing must not be dose d. 
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject or partner and the 
outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  
Pregnancy in a study subject or partner is not, in itself, considered an AE. However, the 
medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly 
is considered an SAE and must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the event. The procedure of elective abortion should not be reported 
as an AE.  
11.5.2  Other  
Certain safety events, called ‘Special Situations’, that occur in association with study 
drug(s) may require reporting. These Special Situation s include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
• Overdose of the medicinal product, where ‘overdose’ is defined as a subject receiving 
≥ 2 times the intended dose for any given SC injection  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product  
• Inadvertent or ac cidental exposure to the medicinal product  
• Medication error involving study drug (with or without subject exposure to the 
Sponsor’s medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)  
Special situations should be reported on the Special Situations form whether they r esult 
in an AE/SAE or not. Special Situations associated with an AE/SAE should also be 
reported on the corresponding AE/SAE forms.

12.2.4  Estimands  
The estimand corresponding to the primary objective and efficacy endpoint analysis for 
this study is described below.  
A. Population : The population is characterized by the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
provi ded in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2. 
B. Endpoint : The endpoint is the CFB in the Week 12 MG -ADL Score.  
C. Intercurr ent Events : The intercurrent events considered in this trial are:  
1. A subject receiving rescue therapy : The study is interested in the treatment effect 
assuming that the treatment effect is null, and no rescue effect occurs after a 
subject receives rescue me dication.  
2. A subject discontinuing the study : For subjects that discontinue due to AEs 
related to study drug, it is assumed that the treatment effect is null.  For subjects 
that discontinue for other reasons (i.e., unrelated to study drug) it is assumed tha t 
the subject had remained on their treatment throughout the study (i.e., a 
“Hypothetical -strategy” assuming subjects did not discontinue the study and 
remained on treatment).  
D. Population -level summary : The population summary is the difference between the 
zilucoplan and placebo treatment groups in the mean CFB in the Week 12 MG -ADL.  
12.2.5  Efficacy Analysis  
12.2.5.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, CFB to Week  12 in MG -ADL Score, treatment group 
differences will be assessed using a MMRM  ANCOVA with treatment, baseline 
MG-ADL Score, baseline QMG Score, geographical region, treatment visit (interaction 
term), and baseline MG -ADL Score visit (interaction term ) as fixed effects and subject 
as a random effect. The MMRM ANCOVA will include Wee ks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The visit, treatment, and geographical region terms in the MMRM model will be treated 
as categorical, and the baseline MG -ADL and QMG Scores will be treated as continuous.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan dose 
group versus placebo in CFB to Week  12 in MG -ADL Score at a 2 -sided 0.05 
significance level based on the ITT population using least squares means.  
Sensitivity analyses fo r the primary efficacy endpoint analysis will be provided in the 
SAP.  
12.2.5.2  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints: Week 12 CFB in QMG, MGC, and MG -
QOL15r survey will be analyzed by an MMRM ANCOVA model similar to the primary 
endpoint analysis . More details will be provided in the SAP.

Protocol RA101495 -02.301  18.Dec.2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 66 of 79 The dichotomous secondary efficacy endpoints: received rescue therapy over the 12 -
week Treatment Period, achieving MSE, defined as an MG -ADL of 0 or 1, at Week 12 
without rescue therapy, a ≥3 -point  reduction in MG -ADL Score at Week 12 without 
rescue therapy, and a ≥5 -point reduction in QMG Score at Week 12 without rescue 
therapy will be analyzed by a logistic regression with treatment as a factor and baseline 
MG-ADL Score, baseline QMG Score, and ge ographical region as covariates.  
For each of the secondary endpoints, the analysis will be the Week 12 comparison of the 
0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan dose group versus placebo at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level based 
on the ITT population.  
12.2.6  Handling of Missing a nd Censored Data  
It is anticipated that:  
• Approximately 5% of subjects will be missing MG -ADL data during the 12 -week 
treatment period.  
 This is based on the results of the zilucoplan Phase 2 study (RA101495 -02.201) 
where 2.3% of subjects (n=1 out of 44) w ere missing their Week 12 visit MG -ADL 
Score, and, from the eculizumab Phase 3 study, where 5.5% (7/126) of subjects did 
not complete the 26 -week treatment period  (Howard et al. 2017 ). 
• Approximately 10% o f subjects will receive rescue therapy during the 12 -week 
treatment period.  
 This is based on the results of the zilucoplan Phase 2 study (see Section 5.5.2.1 ) 
where 9.1% of subjects (n=4 out of 44, n=0  subjects on the 0.3 mg/kg dose) received 
rescue therapy during the 12 -week treatment period and, from the eculizumab Phase 3 
study where 14.3% (18/126) of subjects received rescue therapy during the 26 -week 
treatment period (6 subjects in the eculizumab g roup and 12 subjects in the placebo 
group).  
• The amount of non -monotonic missing data will be minimal  
 This is based on the results of the zilucoplan Phase 2 study (RA101495 -02.201) 
where, across the scheduled treatment visits during the 12 -Week treatment period, 
there was no non -monotonic missing data for MG -ADL (i.e., the one subject who was 
missing MG -ADL at the Week 8 visit also had a missing value MG -ADL value at the 
Week 12 visit).  
• The impact  of the COVID -19 pandemic  on MG -ADL will be minimal because this 
assessment can be conducted remotely.  
Based on these estimates from the zilucoplan Phase 2 study (RA101495 -02.201) and the 
eculizumab Phase 3 study, it is anticipated that the percentage of subjects with 
missing/censored data during the 12 -week treatm ent period will be approximately 15%. 
The missing data pattern for the secondary endpoints is anticipated to be similar to the 
primary endpoint.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, multiple imputation (MI) methods will be 
used to handle missing dat a and data after rescue therapy use (i.e., data collected after a 
subject has used rescue therapy will be censored and treated as missing data for the 
primary efficacy analysis). The following is a summary of the imputation method.  
For the primary efficacy  analysis, 100 imputed datasets will be created using monotone 
linear regression imputation methods which will impute the subjects’ missing

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 67 of 79 post-baseline scores at each of the scheduled visits in the study (i.e., Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 
12). If the missing d ata does not follow a monotonic pattern, a sequential approach to 
imputing the data to produce a monotone missing data pattern will be applied, (i.e., then 
the monotone linear regression imputation methods will be applied.).  
Imputation will be performed by  treatment group, with the underlying imputation 
distribution based on the reason for the missing data.  
Data will be imputed based on the placebo group distribution, irrespective of individual 
treatment assignment, under the following scenarios:  
• Discontinuation from the study due to AE(s) related to study drug  
• Received rescue therapy for MG worsening with IVIG or PLEX or eculizumab (i.e., 
treatment failure)  
Missing data will be imputed based on the subject’s assigned treatment group distribution 
under the following scenarios:  
• Discontinuation from the study for reasons unrelated to study drug  
• Any other reason for missing data  
This MI method allows for a pattern -mixture model approach assuming the data are 
missing not at random (MNAR) under the scenarios where a subject’s discontinuation 
from the study is related to study drug or the subject received rescue medications.  
For eac h of the 100 imputed datasets, the endpoint will be analyzed using the specified 
MMRM ANCOVA model and the results combined across the imputed datasets to 
produce an overall p -value (e.g., using SAS Proc MIANALYZE).  
Similar MI methods for handling missing  data will be applied to the secondary efficacy 
analyses.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, considering other 
methods of handling missing and censored data will be provided in the SAP.  
Protocol deviations (eg, missing assess ments or visits) related to COVID -19 will be 
documented.  
12.2.6.1  Multiplicity  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. The 
secondary endpoints will be tested using a fixed -sequential testing procedure in the 
following or der:  
• CFB to Week 12 in the QMG Score  
• CFB to Week 12 in the MGC  
• CFB to Week 12 in the MG -QOL15r Survey  
• Received rescue therapy over the 12 -week Treatment Period  
• Achieving MSE, defined as an MG -ADL of 0 or 1, at Week 12 without rescue 
therapy

therapy  
• Achieving a ≥5 -point reduction in QMG Score at Week 12 without rescue therapy  
Each secondary endpoint will be tested at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. A 
secondary endpoint analysis will be considered statistically significant if the 2 -sided p -
value is ≤ 0.05 for the endpoint analysis and the primary efficacy endpoint analysis and 
all the secondary endpoint analyses occurring earlier in the fixed -sequence are also 
statistically significant (i.e., have a 2 -sided p -value ≤ 0.05).  
This method provides strong control of the family -wise error rate at the two -sided 0.05 
level.  
12.2.7  Safety  Analysis  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population.  
12.2.7.1  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA. Incidence rates for TEAEs will be summarized 
overall, by maximum severity, and by relationship to study drug for each treatment 
group. SAEs will also be summarized by treatment group.

12.2.8.1  Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by treatment and nominal time po int. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments in subjects undergoing rescue 
therapy will be analyzed separately, as appropriate.  
Plasma concentration data of zilucoplan may be subjected to population PK analysis to 
derive population estimates of PK parameters and test the effect of various covariates 
such as anti -drug antibodies, age, weight, gender. Details of the analysis will be described 
in a separate Data Analysis Plan (DAP). This analysis may be performed by combining 
the data from the current study with data from other zilucoplan studies if deemed 
appropriate. The results of the population PK analysis will not be reported in the clinical 
study report (CSR) but in a separate modelling report  
Population PD or population PK/PD analyses may be cond ucted for the PD variables of 
interest. Details of such PD or PK/PD analyses will be described in a separate DAP. The 
results of the analyses will not be reported in the CSR but in a separate report.  
12.2.9  Interim Analysis  
After the last subject has completed th e Week  12 visit, or after the last subject has 
prematurely discontinued prior to reaching Week  12, an unblinded interim analysis will 
be performed and a corresponding interim CSR may be written. The purpose of this 
interim analysis is to perform a comprehe nsive evaluation of all available double -blind 
data to prepare regulatory submissions for approval of the MG target indication. If 
necessary, a  final analysis and updated final CSR will be prepared once all data (through 
to the SFU visit) have been collect ed. If all the subjects have completed the study at the 
interim database lock (the last participants entered the extension study), then the interim 
database lock will be the final lock.  
12.3 Sample Size Determination  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, CFB to Week 12 in MG -ADL Score, assuming a 
difference in treatment group least squares means of 2.3, a SD of 3.7, and 78  subjects per 
group (156 subjects in total), the study has approximately 94% power to detect a 
difference between an active and placebo treatme nt group based on a 2 -sided alpha of 
0.05. This assumes rates of rescue and dropout of up to 10% and 5%, respectively.

14.3.1  Case Report Forms  
eCRFs must be completed for each subject enrolled in this study. These forms will be 
used to transmit information collected during the study to the Sponsor and regulatory 
authorities, as applicable. The eCRF data for this study is being coll ected with an eCRF. 
The documentation related to the validation of the eCRFs will be maintained in the Trial 
Master File (TMF). The TMF will be maintained by the CRO and the Sponsor.  
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study (see  Section 14.3.2 ). All eCRF data required 
by this protocol will be recorded by investiga tive site personnel.  
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator’s staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF. All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit tr ail, which will be part of the 
electronic data capture system. For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be 
provided. The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness and acceptability by 
Sponsor personnel (or their representatives). The  Sponsor (or their representatives) will 
also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify 
eCRF entries. The investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and 
provide his or her electronic signature  and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.  
Access to the electronic data capture system will be password -protected and will be 
removed from the study site at the end of the site’s participation in the study. Data from 
the eCRF will be archived on appropriate data media and provided to the investigator at 
that time as a durable record of the site’s eCRF data. It will be possible for the 
investigator to make paper printouts from that media.  
14.3.2  Source Documents  
Source documents are defined as original documents, dat a, and records. These may 
include hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data 
from automated instruments, microfiches, photograp hic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, ECGs, X -rays, ultrasounds, angiograms, venograms, computed tomography scans, 
and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Data collected during this study must be 
recorded on the appropriate source documents.  
In some  instances, the initial entry of data will be made by subjects and site personnel 
onto a hand -held device at the site and will be considered the source, e.g. eSource. This 
system is fully compliant with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 11 regulati ons.

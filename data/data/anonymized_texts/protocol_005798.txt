MEDLINE NE PAD ADHESION TESTING  
 
Protocol #:   F2P27778  
 
Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to verify the performance of the neutral electrode (NE) adhesives in 
accordance with the testing specified in IEC 60601 -2-2:2017, section 201.15.101.7, pull test.  
 
Background  
Testing the NE in accordance with IEC 60601 -2-2:2017, section 201.15.101.7, is required to confirm the 
shelf life.  
 
Participant Screening  
After informed consent has been obtained, participants will be screened for the following inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  
 
 Inclusion Criteria:  
• Participants must be willing to comply with all study procedures  
• Participants must be willing to shave, or to have shaved, the sites where the neutral electrodes will be placed.  
Exclusion Criteria  
• The participant has any skin conditions (e.g. eczema, sensitivities, allergies t o adhesives, 
sunburn, etc.) at the application sites that might be adversely affected by the application of an adhesive pad . 
• The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
Possible risks associated with these tests could be an unknown sensitivity to the adhesive components. There may also be discomfort fro m the pulling of the pads during the Pull Test.  Participants will be 
monitored during the testing for any adverse events.  
 
There are no benefits to participants participating in this study.

Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
Participant confidentiality and privacy will be kept confidential per HIPAA requirements. T he study 
protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No 
information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party. All study data will be identified with an anonymous participant number, and all CRFs and other documents containing data will have the part icipant number and no identifiable information.
 One master list linking 
participant numbers to participant name and other contact information will be maintained  by the staff in 
the event identification of a participant is necessary . This is the only docume ntation that will link 
participant name and participant number.  
 
Study staff will ensure all source documents for data collection are completed in accordance with Good 
Documentation Practices (GDP) in order to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
 
All study records will be maintained for a minimum of two years following study closeout; records will be 
maintained for a longer period of time as required by IRB or other regulations.  
 
 
 
Deviations  
It is the responsibility of the PI and study staff to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations on a routine basis. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents, and reported 
to Medline Industries, LP.  Protocol deviations must be sent to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB 
requirements.

Medline’s Split Universal Grounding Pads  are intended for use in monopolar electrosurgery  to 
complete the electrosurgical circuit between the generator, the active electrode, and the patient. 
The pads are single use, non- sterile, dispersive electrodes with or without a pre- attached cord. The 
surface of the conductive area is covered with a soft, conformable hydro -gel conductive adhesive. 
The pad also has a nonwoven backing and a non-conductive border adhesive surrounding the entire conductive surface area to isolate the conductive area from surgical fluid.  The Universal 
Pads are designed for use in  duty cycles of 50% or less (e.g. 20 sec on followed by 20 sec off).   
 
 Instructions for Use  
 
Select an Appropriate Site  
To reduce the risk of burns and pressure necrosis:   
 Select a smooth, well -vascularized, muscular area close to surgical site that allows full 
Universal Pad -to-skin contact.   
 Site must be clean, dry, and free of hair. Remove hair at application site.   
 Locate Universal Pad closer to the surgical site than to the ECG electrodes.  
 Remove metal jewelry.   
 Avoid placement over bony prominences, metal prostheses, or scar tissue.   
 Avoid placement such that current flows through a metal prosthesis or 
conductive implant. For patients with    
implanted electronic devices, contact device manufacturer for precautions to a void 
interference.   
 Do not apply Universal Pad where fluids may pool.   
 Do not apply Universal Pad over injection site.   
 Select a suitable site remote from any warming device.   
4. Pad Application   
To reduce the risk of burns and pressure necrosis:   
 Inspect Universal Pad, cord, and cable. Do not use if cut, modified, or damaged.  
 Remove clear liner from Universal Pad before applying to patient.   
 Apply one end of Universal Pad and smoothly press to  the other  end. The entire 
surface of the pad should be in contact with the patient.  Avoid air entrapment.    
 Avoid stretching or folding either Universal Pad or patient’s skin.   
 Do not  wrap Universal Pad completely around a limb. Do not overlap.   
 Do not attempt to relocate Universal Pad after initial application. If patient is 
repositioned, confirm full pad -to-skin contact and integrity of all connections.  
 Do not use electrode gel.   
 Do not place cable clamp under patient.   
 Do not coil or wrap cord or cable around limb or metal object.   
 Do not place compression stocking or device over grounding  pad.

IEC 60601 -2-2 Clause 201.15.101.7 NE Adhesion – Pull Test  
Test Method:  At least two samples of the NE under test are applied to convenient locations on at least 10 male 
and 10 female human subjects, according to instructions for use. After applic ation, NEs are allowed to remain 
undisturbed for 5 min  to 10 min. For NEs intended for use on adult PATIENTS, the attached NE cord is subjected for 
10 min to a 10 N force directed along each of two orthogonal axes in a plane  parallel to the skin surface at  the NE 
cord connection point. One of the axes shall consist of the minor dimension of the NE at that point. No more than 
5 % of the NE adhesive area shall separate from the skin surface in at least 90 % of the tests.

Preparation for testing  
Sanitize participant area at least ½ hour before the arrival of any study participant.  
Ensure all equipment to be used is calibrated or verified before using.   
For NE placement, remove all hair from these locations if not already d one. Then clean and dry the sites 
thoroughly.  
Cut the cables of the neutral electrodes (NEs) at a point a t least  20cm from the NE. Then tie a loop in the cables for 
connection to the cords.  
Apply two NEs on the ventral surfaces of the upper leg of the participant, in a sitting position, such that the edge of 
the NE with the cable exit is aligned along the midline o f the upper leg and parallel to the floor (with the upper leg 
approximately parallel to the floor). When applying NEs apply one end and smoothly press to other end. The entire 
surface of the NE should be in contact with the participant. Avoid air entrapment under NE.  
Have the participant sit still, with the NE undisturbed, between  9 to 10 minutes .  
 
Pull test  instructions , see Figure 1 and Figure 2  
Record Participant number . 
Record Sample number.  
At Point A  where the NE connects to the pad, connect a cord to pull on the cable as indicated in figure 2 below. Pull 
for 10 to 10.25 minutes, in a plane parallel to the NE pad and in a direction away from the center of the pad, with 
10 to 11N (1.02 to 1.12kg) of fo rce in the direction along the minor dimension of the pad. Set the height of the 
pulley so that the direction of pull shall be approximately co -planer with the plane of the connection point of the 
NE. The pull shall be performed by a cord connected to the NE at the cable connection point. See Figure 2 for the 
pull set up. The weights provide the required pull force.  
Start timer. 
At 10 mins, change direction of pull to y direction  by rotating the pulley system 90 degrees  as shown in Figure 2  – 
apply 10  to 11 N force at Point A in direction of y ray  which is in a plane par allel to the pad.  
Start timer.  
At 10 mins:  
photograph NE pad  
 record the % of the NE adhesive area that has separated.  
 
Repeat the above steps on a second NE pad for each Participant  (these tests  could be done in parallel if desired 
with duplicate setup).

Company name Boehringer Ingelheim  
Protocol date 24 Feb 2021 
Revision date 16 Sep 2021 
BI study number 352.2154 
Title of study  Proof of concept (proof of intervention principles) study assessing 
effects of Technology -Assisted Res piratory Adherence prototype 
version 3 (a Digital Behaviour Change Intervention, DBCI) on 
proximal clinical outcomes and mediators (psychological mediators, 
self-management behaviours) in individuals with COPD (IwCOPD) 
Principal Investigator NA 
Study site NA 
Clinical phase ORBIT: Phase IIa 
Study rationale On the basis of accumulated knowledge during Phase I development, 
the TARA development team concluded that the TARA prototype version 3 may be defined as a putative Minimum Functional Product (MFP) for the target clinical use case. As such, the development team determined that it was appropriate to move into Phase IIa of development and conduct a 
proof-of-concept study to determine if 
TARA prot otype version 3 can achieve benefit on a clinically 
relevant  target in a small, select sample. In this way, an impo rtant 
goal of this proof -of-concept study is to determine whether or not 
TARA version 3 demonstrates enou gh of a clinical signal to merit 
moving forward to conducting  more rigorous testing using a 
randomized design in larger, more representative study population. 
Study objectives Primary Research Questions  
Is there a clinically significant reduction in breathlessness in 
symptomatic IwCOPD following engagement with TARA after 12 
weeks?  
 
Secondary Research Questions 
 
Activity Levels:  
Is there an associated maintenance or increase in activities of daily 
living to support a positive benefit of TARA on breathlessness?  
 
Physical Activity Experience:  
Is there an improvement in the physical activity experience of the 
patient?  
Study assessments Primary Assessments  
• Percentage of participants who experience a clinically significant 
decrease in breathlessness as measured by the Chronic 
Respiratory Questionnaire – Self Administered Individualized 
(CRQ-SAI) dyspnea domain at week 12. DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  • Mean change in CRQ-SAI dyspnea domain from baseline to 12 
weeks.  The CRQ- SAI dyspnea score ranges from 1 to 7 with 
higher values indicating an improvement of breathlessness.   
Secondary assessments  
Activity Levels:  
• Change from baseline in average number of steps measured by 
the activity tracker at week 12.   
• Change from baseline in average cadence (steps/min) measured 
by the activity tracker at week 12.   
 
Physical Activity Experience:  
• Change from baseline in the difficulty domain of the Clinical 
Visits PROactive Physical Activity in COPD instrument (C-
PPAC) at week 12. The domain score ranges from 0 to 40 with a 
higher value representing a lesser degree of difficulty.

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): medical/scientific and patient 
perspectives  
 
COPD is a common, preventable and treatable di sease that is characterized by expiratory 
flow limitation (EFL) due to airway and / or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases ( P19-00675). The chronic EFL 
characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture  of small airways disease (e.g., obstructive 
bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person. These changes do not always occur together but evolve at different rates over time. Chronic inflammation causes structural changes, narrowing of the 
small airways, and destruction of the lung parenchyma that leads to a loss of alveolar attachments to the small airways and decrease s lung elastic recoil. In turn, these changes 
diminish the ability of the airways to remain open during expiration. A loss of small airways may also contribute to EFL, and mucociliary dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the disease. EFL is usually measured by post-bronchodilator spirometry because this is the most widely available and reproducible test of lung function (P19-00675).  The lung function impairment that characterizes  COPD has significant impact on how the 
patient feels and functions during performance of tasks during everyday life. Patients with 
COPD have a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath (breathlessness), chest 
tightness, wheezing, and cough with or without sputum as well as systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weakness ( R19-2157). Breathlessness is a ubiquitous symptom in COPD and a 
key indicator used in the diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (P 19-00675); it is persistent and progressive 
over time and identified as a major concern by pati ents due to its impact on daily life and 
emotional well-being (R19-2157).   COPD guidelines recommend that the management of stable COPD should be based on an individualised assessment, with the main treatment goals being reduction of symptoms (relieve symptoms, improve exercise toleran ce, improve health status) and future risk 
(prevent disease progression, prevent and treat exacerbations, reduce mortality). Management 
strategies include pharmacological treatments complemented by appropriate non-
pharmacological interventions (P19-00675).    
Self-management in COPD: recent focus on adoption of healthy behaviours 
 
Self-management is now considered a major component of the “chronic care model” for 
COPD.  In general, self-management training aims to help patients acquire and practise the 
skills they need to carry out disease-specific medical regimens, to guide changes in health behaviour and to provide emotional support to enable patients to adjust their roles for optimal function and control of their disease (R19-2163, R19-2168). In addition to addressing 
behavioural risk factors (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise), self-management should involve patients in monitoring and managing the signs and symptoms of their disease, being adherent DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  to treatment (including to medications and ot her medical advice), maintaining regular contact 
with healthcare providers, and managing the psychosocial consequences of their condition 
(P19-00675). 
 
Implicit in the description of self- management is the “provision of self -management 
support/coaching”, which refers to the strategies, techniques and skills required to sel f-
manage their disease effectively. Patients are not always motivated to adopt healthier behaviours or engage in recommended disease management strategies, even when there are clear benefits; t his is often referred to as the “knowledge– behaviour” gap, and is a major 
challenge for chronic disease management. Patient support needs to go beyond pure 
education/advice-giving (didactic) approaches to help patients learn and adopt sustainable 
self-management skills; a motivational communication (MC) style is recommended as a 
means to empower patients to take greater responsibility for their health and well-being (P19-00675) and to support patients towards increased confidence (self-efficacy) that they can effectively manage their health ( R19-2162 ; R19-2153; R19-2185 ).  
 
Use of digital technology to enhance accessib ility and effectiveness of self-management 
 Recent research has focused on development of enabling and assistive technologies that are 
accessible at all times to provide patients with relevant, individualised, motivational, and educational material that encourages, support s, and facilitates self-management; these 
interventions provide information and instructi on, and facilitate goal setting and self-
monitoring, relying on one or more approaches, such as video, audio, digital images, and hard 
or digital copies, to deliver educational and mo tivational content related to issues such as 
smoking cessation, exercise, diet, and symptom management ( R19-2223; R19-2224; R19-
2219; R19-2221; R19-2179; R19-2181). While a recent systematic review ( R19-2220 ) was 
not able to come to a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of smart technology as a 
means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaini ng self-management in COPD, preliminary 
evidence of benefits in terms of outcomes such  as quality of life and physical activity up to 
six months warranted a recommendation for further high-quality research in this area. Key 
focus areas for future research include explorati on of strategies that will promote long-term 
engagement with smart technology and inclusion of qualitative data collection to inform issues relevant to the digital divide and to reveal what influences uptake and sustained use of technology among people with COPD.   
Given the central position of behaviour change  support in COPD self-management training 
and the opportunities afforded by advances in digital technology, recommendations for 
designing, evaluating, and implementing digital behaviour change interventions (DBCIs) in health care may support future efforts in self-management research by identifying the scientific principles relevant to developing ef fective DBCIs, and supporting multidisciplinary 
teams of digital technologists, user experience researchers, behaviour scientists, health care professionals and patients to work together more  effectively to advance research methods and 
advance the understanding and techniques of be haviour change through digital technology 
(R19-2150).

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  1.2 DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION 
Background 
 
Engaging in appropriate self-management involve s a complex series of behavioural changes:  
addressing behavioural risk factors including smoking cessation, maintaining or increasing 
physical activity, and ensuring adequate sleep and a healthy diet; learning to self-manage 
breathlessness, energy conservation techniques, and stress/anxiety management strategies; avoiding aggravating factors, monitoring and managing worsening symptoms, having a written action plan and maintaining regular contact/communication with a healthcare 
professional. The patient’s needs, preferences, and personal goals should inform the 
personalized design of the self-management training plan ( P19-00675 ).  
 Within a holistic vision of a technology-enabled self-management program in COPD that supports all relevant treatment goals (P19- 00675) and associated behaviours, our initial 
discussions prior to development of a working  protype for a self-management DBCI focussed 
on (i) identifying one specific, relevant, patient-centric treatment goal (“clinical target”), and 
(ii) selecting one relevant treatment recomme ndation (and associated behaviour) known to be 
efficacious with respect to the achievement of this treatment goal (P19-00675). Activity 
limitation due to breathlessness is a ubiquitous burden for patients with COPD; as such, the initial DBCI development has focussed atte ntion on treatment recommendations for 
breathlessness management in COPD: 
- adhering to prescribe d symptomatic medicines 
- learning to self-manage breathlessness 
- maintaining or increasing physical activity 
- energy conservation techniques 
- avoiding aggravating factors  
- stress/anxiety management strategies 
 Treatment guidelines (P19-00675) place bronchod ilators as the foundation of pharmacologic 
management of COPD and are considered ce ntral to symptom management and commonly 
given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms. In patients with moderate to very severe pulmonary impairment (i.e., GOLD Stage II to IV) whose symptoms are not adequately controlled with as-needed short- acting bronchodilators, adding regular treatment 
with one or more long-acting inhale d bronchodilators is recommended (long- acting β-
agonists, LABAs; long-acting muscarinic antagonists, LAMAs). LABAs and LAMAs significantly improve lung function, dyspnea, he alth status and reduce exacerbation rates; 
combination treatment with a LABA and a LAMA increases lung function and reduces symptoms compared to monotherapy.  Therefore, based on a review of GOLD guidelines, we decided to focus our attention on the following treatment goal and associated pharmacological and non-pharmacological recommendations for management of stable COPD:  
 Treatment goal:  Reduction of symptoms in patients with COPD 
[with initial focus on breathlessness]

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  Pharmacological treatment recommendation (GOLD 2020) (P20-00875 ): regular 
(daily, as-prescribed) treatment with long-acting bronchodilators in patients whose 
symptoms are not adequately controlled with as-needed short-acting bronchodilators   Non-pharmacological management  recommendation (GOLD 2020) (P20-00875) : 
“…patients  should be offered guidance on self-management of breathlessness, energy 
conservation and stress management, (and they should be given a written action 
plan). ” 
 With this GOLD-specified treatment goal / reco mmendation as a focus, we then identified the 
following target behaviours to be addressed with the initial TARA
1 DBCI solution 
development: 
 Target behaviour:  (sustained)  adherence to: 
- prescribed maintenance long-act ing bronchodilator medication 
(“pharmacological self-management support ”) 
- pursed lip breathing (“non-pharmacological self-management support ”) 
- pacing / energy conservation (“non-pharmacological self-management 
support ”) 
 
With regards to adherence to prescribed maintenance long-acting bronchodilator medication, for the purposes of the initial solution developmen t and research evaluation, it was necessary 
to restrict our focus to a limited number of once daily inhaled medications in order to reduce 
the content requirements within the educational component of the DBCI working prototype 
(e.g. education on appropriate inhaler technique); our operational focus was on patients prescribed either Spiriva Respimat (once daily) or Stiolto Respimat (once daily) as inhaled maintenance pharmacological treatm ent as well as short-acting β-agonist for as-needed 
symptom relief.  To provide additional development guidance, we focused on the following target clinical use 
case for TARA version 3 (“intended use”):  
 
TARA offers patients remote breathlessnes s self-management support during daily 
life. TARA is a digital behavior change in tervention intended to support patients with 
COPD in adopting and sustaining clinically recommended (evidence-based) self-
management behaviours. TARA is intended to be used independently at home by 
patients using an internet-enabled device.   Access to TARA will be achieved via a recommendation from a prescribing physician at the same time as provision of a prescription for a once daily maintenance bronchodilator (Spiriva/Stiolto Respimat)   Appropriate patients as per GOLD recommendations (vis a vis maintenance bronchodilator treatment in combination with self-management).

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  The initial duration of patient engagement with TARA will be between an initial 
contact with an HCP and a follow-up contact with an HCP.   Summary reports from TARA c an be delivered by the patient to the HCP at the follow-
up clinical visit by print-out or screen-share to update the HCP on the patient’s 
progress in symptom self-management, which may be an enabler for a robust discussion with the HCP during the follow-up visit.  
Further details regarding the science behind the TARA development and a more detailed description of the TARA solution is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY 
The early development phase of TARA has been informed by the ORBIT model for developing behavioural treatments to prevent and/or manage chronic disease ( R19-2270 ). 
The ORBIT model was considered to be appropria te for a number of reasons: (i) it focuses on 
the early, pre-efficacy phases of behavioural tr eatment development; (ii) it was developed for 
use with a broad array of chronic diseases, (iii) it intentionally uses terminology from the drug development model . 
 
In accordance with the ORBIT model, the goal of Phase I was to develop an intervention or  
‘treatment package ’ that is considered to contain essential components offered in an efficient 
way, is acceptable to the population of interest, and is likely to have  a clinically significant 
benefit on the behavioural risk factor.  
 In the early stages of Phase I, the scientific foundation and the basic elements of the behavioural treatment were defined: (i) deve lopment of a hypothesized pathway by which a 
behavioural treatment could solve the clinical problem, (ii) specification of clinically significant milestones on the behavioural risk factor(s) being targeted, (iii) identification of 
appropriate target population, (iv) definition of potential treatment components, and (v) elucidation of basic behavioural and social sciences support for potential treatment components and their respective treatment targets.  Phase I focussed on the design of the essential f eatures of the (digital) behavioural treatment: 
taxonomies and “mapping” strategies that characterize behavio ural interventions and their 
components were used to select treatment ele ments; experimental and observational studies 
in the laboratory and field enabled the iden tification of potential treatment components and 
the respective biological, psychophysiological,  social, environmental, and behavioural targets 
needed to accomplish change in them and, in turn, in the behavioural risk factor; qualitative research was conducted to develop a rich understanding of the problem from the perspective of IwCOPD; several UXR activities were conduct ed to inform development of components of 
the solution; an initial clinical research stud y was conducted to evaluate engagement with an 
early working prototype.   On the basis of accumulated knowledge during Phase I development, the TARA development team concluded that the TARA prototype versio n 3 may be defined as a putative Minimum 
Functional Product (MFP) for the target clinical use case. As such, the development team DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  determined that it was appropriate to move into Phase IIa of development and conduct a 
proof-of-concept study to determi ne if TARA prototype version 3 can achieve benefit on a 
relevant clinical target in a small, select sample. In this way, an important goal of this proof-of-concept study is to determine whether or not  TARA version 3 merits more rigorous testing 
using a randomized design in larger, more representative study population.  TARA may be described as a complex intervention ( R20-4211). An important task in 
describing a complex intervention is to iden tify the individual components that are being 
integrated into the holistic solution. TARA is being developed within the overarching framework of the GOLD clinical management guid elines, with specific attention paid to the 
GOLD classification schema of pharmacological and non-pharmacological disease management. Within this development framework, there is value in evaluating the extent to which the components contribute to the effectiv eness of the holistic solution, similar to the 
evaluation of the contribution of the individual components of a combination drug product (P15-03349, P19-01878 ) drugs. As a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
individual components of TARA [ within the spirit of “proof of intervention principles”( R20-
4212)], the present study will adopt a cohort approach within the study design: the first cohort 
will engage with TARA version 3.1, which includes non-pharmacological self-management 
support (i.e. self-monitoring, pursed lip breathing, pacing and energy conservation); the second cohort will engage with TARA version 3.2, which includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological self-management support (i .e. additional inclusion of the medication 
support component).  
1.4 BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
 
While benefit-risk assessment is standard pr actice within the clinical drug development 
paradigm, it is also increasingly recognised as an important consideration for non-pharmacological interventions in healthcare ( P14-02978; R19-2769 ).  
1.4.1 Benefits 
Potential benefits of the fully developed TA RA DBCI include improving knowledge of 
COPD and its treatments and how treatment can improve symptoms and outcomes, verifying inhaler technique, and learning new skills  that may improve self-management of COPD; 
these same potential benefits are applicable to study participants engaging with the TARA 
DBCI working prototype (version 3).  
1.4.2 Risks 
No adverse effects have been identifie d during the user experience testing rounds of 
components of the intervention or in the first clinical study (CRT1; 352.2133).  
 Study 352.2154 will be the second study that IwCOPD will engage with TARA in a real-world setting. There is a potential for (disea se-related) behaviour change and consequent 
risks associated with changes in behaviour; in light of the fact that (i) study participants will only be allowed to log-on to TARA after reco mmendation by their primary physician, (ii) the DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  medical oversight of the participant is by their primary physician and (iii) no therapeutic 
recommendations are being provided by the soft ware, risks associated with engagement with 
TARA in this study are considered low. The time required to engage with TARA is a potential inconvenience and is mitigated by the option for study participants to disengage from TARA / study at any time.   
1.4.2.1 Covid-19 related risks 
Potential risks for participants due to the CO VID-19 pandemic have been evaluated and the 
following measures have been put in place in this study to mitigate any risk: 
x Participants will be under the medical oversight of their primary physician 
x Participants with active or recovered SA RS CoV-2 infection will be excluded from 
the study ( Section 3.3.3 .).   
x The majority of study activities will be conducted remotely and the number of on-site 
visits has been limited in this study.  Ho wever, in case of an increased risk of SARS-
CoV-2 infection due to physical visits to the sites, the visits should be conducted 
remotely (by phone or video call) if the Investigator judges that this is the safest 
course of action.  
1.4.3 Discussion 
Study 352.2154 is designed to learn about how IwCOPD engage with TARA to allow for 
refinements during further solution development.  If some of the underlying assumptions for 
the TARA development hold true, there is a potential for study participants to develop a 
stronger capacity to adhere to clinically recommended COPD self-management behaviours.  As such, it is acceptable to conduct this proof-of-concept study.  DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

2.1 MAIN OBJECTIVE (RESEARCH QUESTIONS), PRIMARY 
ASSESSMENTS 
2.1.1 Main objective (research question) 
The main research question focusses on the follo wing, relevant proximal clinical outcome in 
the context of the primary, patient-centric clinical problem addressed by TARA working prototype version 3 in consideration of the defined clinical use case (as described in Section 
1.2):  
 
Is there a clinically significant reduction in breathlessness in symptomatic IwCOPD following engagement with TARA after 12 weeks? 
 
2.1.2 Primary assessments 
The primary measurement instrument (Clinical Outcome Assessment) that will be used to 
measure breathlessness is the dyspnea domain of the CRQ-SAI, a patient-reported outcome 
(PRO) with a two-week recall. The intention of TARA version 3 is to support the patient in developing skills to self-manage the breathle ssness that is experienced during activities of 
daily life.  
 
Primary Assessments:  
x Percentage of participants who experience a clinically significant decrease in 
breathlessness as measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire – Self 
Administered Individualized (CRQ-SAI) dyspnea domain at week 12. 
x Mean change in CRQ-SAI dyspnea domain from baseline to 12 weeks.  The CRQ-SAI dyspnea score ranges from 1 to 7 with hi gher values indicating an improvement of 
breathlessness.    
2.2 SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION S, SECONDARY ASSESSMENTS 
2.2.1 Secondary research questions 
The secondary research question focusses on activities of daily living (amount and intensity) as well as the perceived difficulties associated wi th performing physical activity in daily life.   
 
Activity Levels: 
Is there an associated maintenance or increase in activities of daily living to support a 
positive benefit of TARA on breathlessness?  
 
Physical Activity Experience: 
Is there an improvement in the physical activity experience of the patient?  DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION  
3.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
The study will follow a within-subject pre-post study design and will be conducted as a 
hybrid (clinic visit/remote) study.  Participants will have clinic / tele medicine (phone or video 
calls) visit(s) with the clinical site and the co mpletion of survey activities and engagement 
with the digital intervention TARA will take place remotely / on-line. The survey activities will be completed online via the study we bsite at the time points outlined in the  flow chart .  
As the TARA intervention is fully online and digita l, participants in the study are free to use 
the intervention as much as they like for th e 12-week study duration from their enrolment 
date.  Potentially eligible IwCOPD will be recruited from  clinical sites.  For participants who are 
receiving a new prescription for a once da ily maintenance bronchodilator (Spiriva/Stiolto 
Respimat), the prescribing physician will recommend use of TARA to the participants at the same time as provision of the prescription.  For participants who are currently on a once daily 
maintenance bronchodilator (Spiriva/Stiolto Respimat) but who could benefit from additional support, the physician will recommend the use of TARA for self-management alongside their existing prescription.    The study will have 2 cohorts of participants in order to support the evaluation of the extent that pharmacological support adds value on top of non-pharmacological support: 
x The first cohort will engage with a version of TARA that includes the non-pharmacological self-management support (self-monitoring, pursed lip breathing, pacing) 
x The second cohort will engage with a version of TARA that includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological self-management support (i.e. additional inclusion of medication support component). 
 Recruitment into the cohorts will be conducted sequentially. The study will begin recruiting 
into the first cohort and once the first cohort is  closed for recruitment, the second cohort will 
open for recruitment. This cohort strategy will support an iterative approach in the development of the digital intervention.      
The study consists of three broad phases:  
(1) Pre-TARA:  study recruitment by clinic site, consent, screening, receipt of 
activity tracker, run-in period, and pre-TARA survey;  
(2) Intervention period (TARA delivery):  up to 12-weeks of intervention 
depending on the length of time of each participant’s individual journey;  
i. Interim survey measures will be collected during this period via the 
study website at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. 
ii. End of study survey measures will be collected at 12 weeks. 
(3) Post-TARA:  follow-up visit with the clinic si te (in-person or telemedicine), 
post-TARA survey, post-TARA inter view conducted in a sub-set of 
participants and HCP interviews.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP 
Study design  
 
According to the ORBIT model, quasi-experimental, within-subjects designs where subjects act as their own controls in a pre-post treatmen t comparison are appropriate in Phase IIa. The 
sample size can be small since clinical, not s tatistical, benefit is sought, and sample size 
calculations are unnecessary. The sample can be selected from accessible subjects, rather than 
be representative, because this initial test will determine only whether the treatment merits more rigorous testing. The focus of Phase IIa studies is deliberately placed on the treatment and its ability to produce clinically significant change on a behavioural risk factor to indicate that the intervention is likely to be efficacious. This is in contrast to Phase IIb studies which focus on determining the source of a treatment ef fect (e.g., separation of treatment effects 
from effects due to the passage of time) and with choosing the appropriate control group, in itself a complex undertaking. 
 
A cohort approach has been included in the study based on the CEEBIT (Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioural Intervention Technologies) methodologic framework (R20-4210) which was developed to support the evaluation of evolving versions of 
Behavioural Intervention Technologies (BITs).   
3.3 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
A sufficient number of individuals will be enrolled (sign informed consent) to ensure that 
approximately 50 participants with a diagnosis  of COPD are entered into the intervention 
(TARA log-in).  
 
Participants will be administered the Readine ss to Change questionnaire at screening with the 
aim to enroll a higher number of participants who are not currently taking action to manage their COPD (patients who score a 1, 2 or 3 on the scale) vs. those participants who are currently taking actions to manage their COPD (participants who score a 4 or 5 on the scale).  It is anticipated that these participants may need more support with managing their condition and therefore we could see a greater impact of us ing TARA in these participants with respect 
to their intention to self-manage their COPD.  An IwCOPD can only log-in to TARA (intervention entry) if they meet all eligibility criteria. A log of all participants enrolled into the study (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be maintained irrespective of whether or not they engage with TARA (TARA log-in).

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  5. FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING ASSESSMENTS  
5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
5.1.1 Primary Assessment 
Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire – Self Administered Individualized (CRQ-SAI) 
The CRQ-SAI, a derivate of the origin al CRQ tool, is used to assess the patients’ perception 
of their COPD and measures the impact of COPD on their life. The CRQ-SAI has 20 items 
over 4 domains: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery. For dyspnea, participants are asked to select 5 activities associated with  breathlessness (from a list of 26 or custom 
response), that they have performed in the past two weeks and that are most important to them and indicate how much breathlessness th ey have experienced while performing each. 
 The CRQ-SAI should be completed by the participants at the time points outlined in the flow 
chart.  Details of the CRQ-SAI are provided in Appendix 10.2.1. 
 
5.1.2 Secondary Assessments 
Activity Tracker (  device)  
A physical activity tracker is an accelerometer that is used to measure the overall movement 
of a patient. Activity trackers provide valuable information on physical activity directly from 
the patient’s body.    The  device 
will be the activity tracker used in the study to measure the                                                  
amount (steps) and intensity (cadence) of daily ambulatory activities in support of the main research objective.  Participants will wear the activity tracker throughout the study and the data obtained from the activity tracker will be transferred to the study database.  Instructions will be given to the participants on how to use the activity tracker.  
Clinical Visit PROactive Physical Activity in COPD instrument (C-PPAC) 
A secondary measure of efficacy is the C-PPAC, a hybrid measurement tool incorporating a 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) and an activity  tracker.  The tool couples the difficulties 
associated with performing physical activity and the amount and intensity of the activities 
and the final instrument incorporates both a diff iculty domain consisting of 10 questions and 
an amount domain consisting of 4 questions and 2 of these questions are based on data from 
the activity tracker.  
 The difficulty domain includes questions related to breathlessness, but also includes questions related to other aspects of the difficulty asso ciated with performing daily activities in 
IwCOPD.   The C-PPAC should be completed by the participants at the time points outlined in the flow chart. Details of the C-PPAC are provided in Appendix 10.2.2.

Adverse event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not  necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as  a response to a medicinal product which is 
noxious and unintended. Response in this contex t means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Adverse reactions 
may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of us e outside the marketing authorization include 
off-label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.  Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is defined as any AE which 
- results in death,  
- is life-threatening,  
- requires in-patient hospitalization, or 
- prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Life-threatening in this context refers to a react ion in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.  Medical and scientific judgement should be ex ercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization but might jeopardize the 
patient or might require interve ntion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such events are intensive trea tment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convul sions that do not result in hospitalization or 
development of dependency or abuse. Any su spected transmission via a medicinal product of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. 
 Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) 
The term Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particul ar concern for prospective safety monitoring 
and safety assessment within this study, e. g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class.   
No AESIs have been defined for this study. 
 
5.3.7 Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files. 
 
5.3.7.1 Collection of AEs 
The investigator carefully assesses whether an AE constitutes an ADR using the information 
below.  DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03   
Causal relationship of adverse event 
 The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is ch aracterized by the fact that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected.  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal  relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history.  
 Arguments that may suggest a reasonable causal relationship could be: 
• The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug  
• The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class  
• A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure 
• Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced 
• No medically sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications). 
• The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population  not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
• An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater ef fect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished). 
 Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:  
• No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days/weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) 
• Continuation of the event despite the wi thdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives). Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger. 
• Additional arguments amongst those stated be fore, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned). 
• Disappearance of the event even though the study drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged. 
 
Intensity of adverse event 
 The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom( s) which is/are easily tolerated 
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

Pregnancy: 
In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a study.  Once a patient has been enrolled in the study 
and has taken study Spiriva Respimat or Stio lto Respimat, the investigator must report any 
drug exposure during pregnancy in a study participant within 7 days by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point. See table below. 
 Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnanc y must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requi res a written consent of the pregnant partner. 
The ISF will contain the trial specific infor mation and consent for the pregnant partner. 
 The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form (Part B).   The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form (Part A and B). As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying serious ADR, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form and not the AE form is to be completed. If there is a serious ADR associated with the pregnancy a AE form must be completed in addition.  
 The study design is of non-interventional nature and the study is conducted within the conditions of the approved marketing authorization. Sufficient data from controlled interventional trials are available to support the evidence on the safety and efficacy of the 
studied BI drug.  
 The following AE collection and reporting requirements have been defined:   All AEs and other safety relevant information identified via all sources used in the study have to be reported [via the study website (i.e. questionnaires), interviews, TARA platform] to the investigator for causality assessment (Section 5.3.7) and reporting to sponsor regardless of causal relationship.     
5.3.7.2 Expedited Reporting of AE s and Drug Exposure during Pregnancy to BI 
Pharmacovigilance 
 
Any AE or SAE must be reported to the sponsor within the timelines listed regardless of causality.  The following must be reported by the investigator on the NIS AE form and/or Pregnancy Monitoring Form from signing the informed consent onwards until the end of the study and provided to BI unique entry point:

obtained.   The same timelines apply if follow-up informa tion becomes available for the respective 
events. In specific occasions the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. 
This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the AE form.

Modified Medication Research Council Dyspnea Scale 
The mMRC Dyspnea Scale uses a simple grading system to assess a patient’s level of 
dyspnea.  All questions relate to everyday activities and are generally easily understood by patients.  Score range from 0 (none) to 4 (ver y severe) and are usually obtained in a few 
seconds.  Participants will be asked to sc ore their dyspnea as part of the screener. 
Details of the mMRC are provided in Appendix 10.2.11.

The CRQ-SAI, D-PPAC, CAT, HADS are well established and validated questionnaires 
(R17-2573, R16-5353 ). 
 
The Readiness to Change, TSRQ, PCS, HCCQ qu estionnaires are widely used in the study of

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  The VCCQ is a recently validated questionnair e specific for virtual care settings ( R20-3985). 
 
The SUS is a robust and valid tool ( R19-2266). 
 Activity Tracker 
The  device will be used as an activity tracker in this study.  This is an electronic 
device used to measure physical activity levels of the participant.  The device will be used 
according to manufacturer’s guidance .   
 Medication Adherence 
Self-reports of daily medication adherence are commonly thought to have issues with 
reliability, but Stirrat et al ( R19-2202) reports that “evidence indicates that self-report 
adherence measures show moderate corresponde nce to other adherence measures and can 
significantly predict clinical outcomes ” and conclude that “self -report medication adherence 
measures can provide actionable infor mation despite their limitations”.  
 
Stirrat et al suggest that the quality of self- report adherence measures “may be enhanced 
through efforts to use validated scales, a ssess the proper construct, improve estimation, 
facilitate recall, reduce social desirability  bias, and employ technologic delivery” . In keeping 
with this recommendation, in the current study: 
- Comparisons are conducted within-subject to reduce the effect of social desirability 
bias  
- A technological delivery of the self-report is employed to provide an always-available 
way to record medication taking via a smart phone device, thus helping avoid issues 
with recall. 
- All measures are administered remotely and can be completed in privacy and without 
research staff being present to reduce social desirability bias

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
This study is a hybrid study where participants will interact with the site via clinic /  
telemedicine visits as indicated in the  flow chart .  It is preferable that any telemedicine visits 
are conducted via a video call, however if this is not possible then they can be done via a phone call.  The survey activities and engagement with the digital intervention TARA will take place 
remotely / on-line.  The survey activities will be completed online via the study website at the 
time points outlined in the flow chart.  As the TARA intervention is fully online and digital, 
participants in the study are free to use the intervention as much as they like during the 12-week study duration from their enrolment date.   The majority of study activities will be conducted  remotely, and the number of on-site visits 
has been limited in this study.  However, in case of an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to physical visits to the sites, th e visits should be conducted remotely (by video 
or phone call) if the Investigator judges that this is the safest course of action.   Study-specific reminder algorithms will be developed for situations where the study participant has not completed tasks within a certain timeframe. Additional details regarding this follow-up are outlined in the 352-2154 Study Operational Document. 
 
6.2 DETAILS OF STUDY PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS 
6.2.1 Screening period 
Screening Period 
The clinical site will identify potential participants for the study. Participants will be 
approached by the clinical site for participation in the study at one of their regular clinical visits as per the clinical sites’ normal  practice (e.g. in-person or via telemedicine).  The 
prescribing physician will recommend use of TARA  to patients who could benefit from self-
management strategies at the same time as provision of a prescription for a once daily maintenance bronchodilator (Spiriva/Stiolto Respimat). 
 
The clinical site will inform the participant about the trial and obtain informed consent in accordance with GCP (ISO 14155) and the local legislation.  Once consented, participants 
will be given a unique ID and a link to the stud y website where they will log-in to complete a 
screening survey to ensure all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.   Once the participant completes the screening s urvey, they will get a message describing 
whether or not they are eligible for the study.   Rescreening will be allowed on a case by case basis after discussion between the site and the 
sponsor.  DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  Activity tracker shipment 
Once the participant has signed consent and is determined to be eligible for the study, the 
activity tracker will be shipped to the study participant. Participants will be requested to wear the activity tracker during the run-in period, for the duration of the study and until the 12-week survey is completed.   Run-in Period 
Once participants receive and activate the acti vity tracker, they will enter a 2-week run-in 
period.  During this time, participants will wear the activity tracker and should take their medication as prescribed.  
 
Pre-TARA Survey 1  
Following the run-in period, participants will  receive an email asking them to complete the 
pre-TARA survey. The email will have a link to  the survey which will be completed on the 
study website. Refer to the  flow chart  for details of which questionnaires will be administered 
as part of this survey.    Login Instructions  
After completion of pre-TARA survey 1, par ticipants will receive their TARA login 
instructions via email along with expectations around use. The participant will then be able to login to the TARA web application.     
6.2.2 Study and TARA Intervention period  
TARA DBCI 
Once the login is provided, participants will be able to engage with the TARA DBCI as much 
as they like during the 12-week intervention period. When they click on the “get help” buttons in the COPD program, they will receive an outreach by e-mail to explore what sort of help they are looking for and to resolve any issues, if possible. If the participant is interested in speaking with an MCP coach, they will re ceive an email to follow-up, and they will be 
asked to participate in the post-study IDI to give feedback on what they might want from a coach.  Activity Tracking 
During the program use, participants will be  asked to wear the activity tracker for the 
duration of the study.   Surveys 
Also, during this period, participants will be requested to complete surveys at interim 
timepoints throughout the 12-week duration.  Specifically, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the start of the intervention period, partic ipants will receive an email asking them to 
complete surveys 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The em ail will have a link to the survey which will 
be completed on the study website and consist of the CRQ-SAI, Readiness to Change and PCS questionnaires via the study website.  DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

Participants will receive an email at the end of their intervention period at 12 weeks asking 
them to complete the 12-week survey 5. The email will have a link to the survey which will 
be completed on the study website. Refer to the flow chart  for details of which questionnaires 
will be administered as part of this survey.   
6.2.3 Follow-up period (study completion) 
Follow-up visit (Clinic visit or Telemedicine) 
After completion of the post-TARA survey 5, participants will have a follow-up with the 
clinical site.  This visit should be performed within 7 days of the clinical site receiving the 
email notification to schedule the visit.  The visit  can be performed in clinic, however if there 
are issues with scheduling, the visit can be accommodated as a telemedicine visit preferably 
via video call.  At this visit, a summary report from TARA will be shared by the participant with the HCP to update the HCP on their progress in symptom self-management.  The site should ask the participant about any AEs at this visit.  Once the participant has completed the follow-up visit, they will be requested to return the activity tracker.  Post-Study Survey 6 
After the follow-up visit, participants will re ceive an email asking them to complete the post-
TARA survey 6. The email will have a link to  the survey which will be completed on the 
study website. This survey will assess participants’ impression of TARA, their willingness to 
recommend it in future and the interactions with their HCPs regarding TARA.     For participants not selected for the interview, this will mark the end their participation in the study.  Post-TARA In-depth Interview (IDI) 
When participants receive their end-of-study e mails, a sub-set of 8 to 15 participants will be 
asked to schedule an in-depth interview las ting approximately 60 minutes to be conducted 
remotely with a member of the digi tal technology research team (see Appendix 10.1.2  and the 
interview guide for more details). The final number of participants will be decided based on the sample set at which saturation of qualitative insight is achieved (no further new information is obtainable through interviews). Priority for invitations to the IDI will be given

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE  
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 
According to established standards for evalu ating behavioural treatments for chronic disease 
(R19-2270), in Phase IIa proof-of-concept studies: (i) a quasi-experimental pre-post study is 
considered an appropriate study design, and (ii) since clinical, not statistical benefit is sought, 
identification of formal null and alternative hy potheses, as well as power calculations and 
sample size estimates are considered unnecessary. 
 
The hypothesis for this study states that compar ed to baseline, IwCOPD will experience a 
clinically significant reduction in breathlessness after 12 weeks of receiving a digital behaviour change intervention for COPD self-management (TARA version 3).   
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES 
7.2.1 General considerations 
In order to conclude that engagement with TARA leads to a patient benefit with regards to 
changes in breathlessness, it is important to confirm that any reduction in breathlessness at follow-up compared to baseline is not a cons equence of a reduction in physical activity. 
Therefore, a preliminary analysis will be conducted to evaluate if changes in breathlessness vary with changes in physical acti vity from baseline to follow-up. 
 Analysis will be performed separately for each cohort (Cohort 1: non-pharmacological self-management support; Cohort 2: non-pharmacological + pharmacological self-management support).  Pooled analysis between the cohorts will not be performed.  All patients enrolled will be included in analys is.  Additional explorative analysis will be 
described in statistical analysis plan.   Preliminary Analysis: 
 Study participants will be divided into three categories based on the level of change in their 
physical activity from baseline to 12-week follow-up using steps as a standard measure of 
activity. Each participant’s activity (steps) data will be  descriptively analysed and 
standardized. Based on the distribution of observed data, participants will then be categorized into groups using an appropriate criterion of change such as: 
x Decreased activity: Activity level has decreased 1 SD or more at follow-up 
x Increased activity: Activity level has increased 1 SD or more at follow-up 
x No change: All other participants  
 Following this categorization, differences in breathlessness scores (using the CRQ-SAI dyspnea domain) will be computed for each group between baseline and 12-week follow up DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  and comparisons conducted between groups. This  analysis will evaluate if changes in 
breathlessness continue to be seen rega rdless of changes in physical activity.  
 
7.2.2  Primary assessment analyses 
For the primary assessment, the CRQ-SAI dyspnea domain will be used to calculate 
breathlessness measures at baseline and week  12. Analyses to be conducted include the 
following: 
x The percentage of the study population who experience a clinically significant decrease in breathlessness (minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5) 
will be calculated. 
x The difference between week 12 and baseline will be calculated and compared against 
the criterion of minimal clinically im portant difference (MCID) of 0.5. 
 
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses 
Descriptive statistics of additional secondary endpoint variables will be explored for selection 
of best-fit analysis techniques. Pre-post differences in the physical activity experience will also be explored to see if TARA v3 has had a positive effect on the perceived difficulty during activities.    DocuSi gn Envelope ID: 1A370D01-5AB0-4FDB-B548-EDF40B739819

001-MCS-40-106_RD-03  7.2.5 Safety analyses 
Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset 
between informed consent signature and end of the post-TARA IDI will be assigned to the 
study period for evaluation.  All study participants will be included in the safe ty analysis. In general, safety analyses will 
be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. 
No hypothesis testing is planned.  
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term after coding acc ording to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock.  
7.2.6 Other Analyses 
NA 7.2.7 Interim Analyses 
NA 7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
Every effort will be made to collect complete data at all visits. However, missing data will 
still occur and approaches to handle this are proposed below.   
For the primary endpoint analysis, imputat ion of missing values will not be 
performed.  Patterns of missing data will be an alyzed descriptively and summarized.  Further 
sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results on the primary endpoint may be performed and will be described in the TSAP.  For further endpoints, rules for handling of missing data will be specified in the TSAP if necessary. With respect to safety evaluations, it is not planned to impute missing values.  
7.4 RANDOMISATION 
NA 
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
As per section 7.1, sample size power calculations are not required for ORBIT Phase IIa 
studies. Based on a literature review of simila r ORBIT Phase IIa proof of concept studies, as 
well as consultation with behavioural science experts, a sample size of 25 subjects per cohort (50 subjects overall) was deemed appropriate for an initial evaluation of whether engagement with TARA results in a clinically significant change in breathlessness at 12-week follow-up compared with baseline. This study will be further used to generate the data needed to perform sample size power calculations in future studies.

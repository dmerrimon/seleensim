2) Platinum -naïve  and cisplatin ineligible  (Cohort 2) : Patients who have not received  prior platinum -
containing  or other chemotherapy  in the locally advanced or metastatic setting and are ineligible for 
treatment with cisplatin at time of enrollment . Patients who received platinum in the 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting and did not progress within 12 months of completion  will be considered 
platinum -naïve.  
Patients must have PD during or following their most recent therapy . Eligible patients mus t be ≥18  years of age, 
and legally an adult according to local regulation . Patients must h ave an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status score of ≤1 for Cohort 1, or ECOG ≤2 for Cohort 2.  Patients must have an  
anticipated life expectancy of ≥3 months as assessed by the investigat or. Patients must have adequate baseline 
hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.  
Patients must not have ongoing  sensory or motor neuropathy (Grade 2 or higher), or active central nervous 
system  metastases . Patients must not have been previously enrolled in an  enfortumab vedot in study  or 
previously treated with other monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) -based antibody -drug conjugates  (ADCs) . There 
are no limits for prior lines of therapy, including taxanes . Patients must not have a history of another 
malignancy within 3 years, or any  evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy . 
Patients are also excluded if they are currently receiving systemic antimicrobial treatment for active infection or 
high dose steroid s. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes  are excluded . Uncontrolled diabetes is defined as 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c 7 –<8% with associated diabetes symptoms (polyuria or polydipsia) 
that are not otherwise explained.  Patients must not have uncontrolled tumor -related bone pain or impending 
spinal cord compression. Patients requiring pain medication must be on a stable regimen at the time of 
enrollment  (a minimum of 2 weeks ). 
Number of Planned Patients   
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in this study , including  approximately 100  or more  platinum -
treated patients ( Cohort 1 ), and up to approximately 100 platinum -naïve and cisplatin -ineligible  patients 
(Cohort  2).  
Study Design   
This is a single -arm, open -label, multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of enfortumab 
vedotin as a single agent in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have previously 
received systemic therapy with a CPI . For the purpose of this study a  CPI is defined as a programmed cell death 
protein 1  (PD-1) inhibitor or programmed death -ligand 1 ( PD-L1) inhibitor (including, but not limited to: 
atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and nivolumab) .  Patients must either have received prior 
treatment with platinum -containing chemotherapy (Cohort 1) or received no prior treatment with platinum -
containing or other che motherapy and are ineligible for treatment with cisplatin at time of enrollment  
(Cohort  2). 
Enfortumab vedotin at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 
approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cy cle. Patients will continue to receive study 
treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, start of a 
subsequent anticancer therapy, pregnancy, or study termination by the sponsor . After discontinuat ion of study 
treatment, patients will be followed every 8 weeks (±1 week) for response assessments, ECOG performance 
status, and physical exams . After 1 year  of on study , the frequency of follow -up exams including response 
assessments will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week) . Patients that have progressed or begun subsequent 
anticancer therapy  will be contacted every 8 weeks (±1 week)  up to 1 year on study , and every 12 weeks 
(±1 week) thereafter  to obtain  information on subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival status  until death, 
study closure, or withdrawal of consent , whichever occurs first . The study will be closed 5 years after 
enrollment of the last patient, or when no patients remain in long -term follow -up, whichever occurs first . 
Additionally , the sponsor may terminate the study at any time.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 4 of 102 On a periodic basis, an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the safety of patients 
participating in this trial . The IDMC will be responsible for evaluating the results of safety analy ses and will 
make recommendations to the sponsor.  
An ongoing real -time review of patient safety and serious adverse events (SAEs) will also be conducted by the 
sponsor’s Drug Safety Department.   
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration   
Enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately  30 minutes on 
Day 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.   
Duration of Treatment   
Patients may continue on study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, 
consent withdrawal, start of a subsequent anticancer therapy, pregnancy, or study termination by the sponsor.  
Efficacy Assessments   
Measures of anticancer activity will be assessed by computed tomography  (CT) scans  with contrast  
approximately every 8 weeks  (±1 week) . After 1 year on study , response assessments will be reduced to every 
12 weeks (±1 week) . The schedule of response assessments should not be adjusted for d ose delays/inter ruptions 
or other reasons for changes in the timing of a patient’s study activities; timepoints for response assessments 
should be calculated from Cycle 1 Day 1  during treatment . For patients who cannot receive CT scans with 
contrast, other protocol -specified  imaging methods  may be used. Patients must be evaluated using the sam e 
imaging method throughout the study for efficacy assessments . CT scans with contrast  at the minimum will 
include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis . Other regions should be scanned if the patient has known or suspected 
disease in that region . Responses (comp lete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) will be confirmed with 
repeat scans 4 weeks (+ 1 week window) after first documentation of response . The determination of antitumor 
activity will be based on confirmed objective response assessments as defined by  RECIST Version 1.1. 
Response and progression will be assessed by an independent review facility (IRF).  The investigator  will make 
treatment decisions  based on site assessments of scans by RECIST.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than objective disease progression by RECIST will 
continue to receive scans 8 weeks (±1 week) after the previous response assessment scan  and every 8 weeks 
(±1 week) following the previous scan thereafter . After 1 year  on study  the frequency of response assessments 
will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week) . The tumor assessments  will continue until the patient has 
radiologically -confirmed progression  per the investigator , initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies , withdraws 
consent, or the study closes , whichever comes first .  
Pharmacokinetic and ATA Assessments   
Blood samples for PK and ATA will be collected throughout the study . Qualified or v alidated  assays will be 
used to measure the concentrations of enfortumab vedotin ADC , total antibody (TAb),  and MMAE in serum or 
plasma and assess ATA.  
Biomarker Assessments   
Samples for exploratory biomarkers will be collected at protocol -specified timepoints . Biomarker assessments 
will not be used for patient selection . Biomarker assessments in tumor tissue may include, but will not be 
limited to, tumor expression of Nectin -4 protein , messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression, markers of 
disease subtype, and markers of the immune microenvironment in tumor . Assessments in blood samples may 
include, but will not be limited to, markers of immune function, including abundance and phenotype  of immune 
cell subsets , circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) , and abundance of cytokines . Methods of analysis may include 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC) , next generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mutation and gene 
expression profiling, T -cell rece ptor beta chain sequencing, flow cytometry, and  immunoassays . 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 5 of 102 Safety Assessments   
Safety assessments will be based on the information collected through the safety surveillance pro cess and will 
include the data from recorded adverse events ( AEs) including SAEs , recording of concomitant medication, 
physical examination findings, cardiac monitoring, and laboratory tests.  
Quality of Life Assessments   
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) assessments will be used to obtain QoL information at protocol -specified 
timepoints . The following validated tools will be used: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire ( QLQ -C30) and EuroQol 5 -dimensions ( EQ-5D). 
Statistical Methods   
Analysis for primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of this study is the confirmed ORR per IRF. The ORR is defined as the proportion of 
patients with confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1.1 . The ORR per IRF and its exact 2 -sided 
95% confidence interval ( CI) using the Clopp er-Pearson method (Clopper 1934 ) will be calculated.  
There are 2 cohorts of CPI-treated patients  in the study : Cohort 1) platinum -treated patients  as defined in the 
study population above , and Cohort  2) platinum -naïve and cisplatin -ineligible  patients  also defined in the study 
population above . The primary endpoint will be analyzed  separately for each cohort and may be analyzed for all 
patients, combining both Cohorts 1 and 2 . 
The primary analysis on Cohort  1 (platinum -treated  patients ) will be conduct ed when enrollment is completed 
in Cohort  1, and  all patients in the cohort  have been followed for at least 6 months, or have discontinued from 
study, or had 30 days safety follow -up after PD, whichever comes first. Analysis  for C ohort 2  will occur at 
4 timepoints: 1)  at the time of analysis of Cohort  1, 2) when approximately 50 patients in Cohort 2 have had the 
opportunity to be followed for approximately 8  months  from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin , 3) when 
approximately 70 patients in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be followed for approximately 8 months  
from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin , and 4) when all patients in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be 
followed for  approximately 8  months from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin . All patients may also be 
analyzed at the time of analysis of Cohort 1 and/or Cohort 2.  
The primary analysis of efficacy endpoints  will be based on the full analysis set, including all patients  who 
enrolled and  receive d any amount of enfortumab vedotin. At the time of the interim analys es for Cohort 2, 
additional analys es of efficacy endpoints  will be performed based on the efficacy evaluable set, including all 
patients  in the full analysis set  who started treat ment  with enfortumab vedotin  at least 8 months before the 
analysis data cutoff . 
Sample size:  
The study is designed to estimate the confirmed ORR in patients receiving enfortumab vedotin and to detect an 
improvement in the ORR compared with a historical res ponse rate of 1 0%. Approximately 200 patients will be 
enrolled in this study to ensure collection of sufficient efficacy and safety data, including approximately 100 or 
more platinum -treated patients ( Cohort 1 ), and up to approximately 100 platinum -naïve a nd cisplatin -ineligible  
patients ( Cohort 2 ). Using the estimate of approximately 100 patients  Cohort  1, the study will have 98% power 
to detect a 15% increase in ORR from 10% to 25% and 81% power to detect a 10% increase in ORR from 10% 
to 20%, at one -sided significant level of 0.025, based on exact methods using E AST®, Version 6.0, by 
Cytel  Inc.  
The confirmed ORR and 95% exact CI in Cohort 2 will be summarized at 4 timepoints: 1) at the time of 
analysis of Cohort 1, 2) when approximately 50 patients in Co hort 2 have had the opportunity to be followed for 
approximately 8  months  from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin , 3) when approximately 70 patients in 
Cohort  2 have had the opportunity to be followed for approximately 8 months  from the first dose of enfortumab 
vedotin , and 4) when all patients treated in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be  followed for  approximately 
8 months  from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin .

1.1 Urothelial Cancer   
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer urothelial cancer kills more 
than 165,000 patients annually and is the ninth most common cancer ove rall worldwide . 
Approximately 151,000 new cases of urothelial cancer are diagnosed annually in Europe, 
with 52,000 deaths per year . Over 22,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in Japan, with 
7,600 deaths per year (Cancer Today,  http:// gco.iarc.fr/today/ . Accessed Jan 31, 2017) . 
According to National Cancer Institute estimates, approximately 77,000 new cases of 
urothelial cancer were diagnosed in 2016, and more than 16,000 people died from the disease 
in the United States (US) alone (National Cancer Institute 2016 ). Metastatic urothelial cancer 
has a 5 -year mortality rate exceeding 85% . 
First-line therapy for metastatic urothelial cancer in patients with sufficient renal function 
consists of cisplatin -based combinations, like methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin , and 
cisplatin  (MVAC) and gemcitabine with cisplatin, which demonstrate an overall res ponse 
rate up to 50%, including approximately 10 %–15% complete responses (CRs) (Bellmunt 
2011 ). Despite initial chemosensitivity, patients are not cured and the outcome of metastatic 
urothelial cancer after these regimens is poor: median time to progression is only 7 months 
and median overall survival (OS) is 14 months . Approxim ately 15% of patients experience 
5-year survival and the prognosis is particularly poor among patients with visceral metastases 
for whom the 5 -year OS rate is 7%  (von der Maase 2005 ). 
Almost half of urothelial cancer patients are  unfit for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy due 
to impaired renal function, poor per formance status or comorbidity (Dash 2006 ). In this 
setting, long term survival is even lower (De Santis 2009 ). In April 2017, the Food and Dr ug 
Administration (FDA) approved the anti -programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) immune 
checkpoint inhibitor  (CPI) atezolizumab  (TECENTRIQ®) as first line treatment for patients 
ineligible for cisplatin . The accelerated approval was based on a n open -label single arm study 
that showed long durations of response, indicating activity in this difficult -to-treat 
population, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 23% that was similar across  varying 
levels of target expression . The median OS for these patients w as 15.9 months, although this 
is a single arm study and any OS benefit will need to be confi rmed in a randomized 
experience (Balar 2017 ). 
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) received accelerated approval from the FDA in May 2017 as 
first line treatment for patients ineligible for cisplatin . The approval was based on an open 
label single arm study in 370 patients showing an ORR of 29% (Keytruda Prescribing 
Information, Merck , May 2017).  
Other options for first line cisplatin -ineligible patients typically include carboplatin -based 
regimens or single -agent taxane or gemcitabine (Cathomas 2015 ). 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 13 of 102 1.2 Second -Line Therapy Options for Metastatic Urothelial Cancer   
Few options are available for second -line treatment of metastatic disease. In the European 
Union, the small -molecule tubulin inhibitor vinflunine (Javlor®) was authorized in 2009 
based on modest activity (overall response rate 9%), moderate survival benefit of 2 months 
(6.9 months for vinflunine + best supportive care [BSC] vs 4.6 months for BSC alone, hazard 
ratio 0.88), and a favorable safety profile (Bellmunt 2009 ). In May 2016, the FDA provided 
accelerated approval of atezolizumab as  the first salvage therapy following platinum agents 
for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the US, followed by EU approval 
in September 2017 . In February 2017, nivolumab (Opdivo®) became the second 
immunotherapy granted accelerated approval by the FDA, which was followed by EU 
approval in June 2017 . In March and May 2017, the FDA granted accelerated approval for 
avelumab (Bavencio®) and durvalumab (ImfinziTM), respectively, both P D-L1 blocking 
antibodies indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing 
chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoa djuvant or adjuvant 
treatment with platinum -containing chemotherapy . Pembrolizumab received regular approval 
from the FDA in May 2017 as second -line treatment (Keytruda Prescribing Information, 
Merck, May 2017). The approval was based on the first randomiz ed experience reported for a 
CPI in the locally advanced or metastatic post -platinum urothelial cancer setting , a phase 3 
study in 542 patients showing an OS of 10.3  months as compared to 7.4  months with taxane 
chemotherapy or vinflunine. Additionally, ORR  was 21% for pembrolizumab and 11% for 
chemotherapy. No statistically significant difference in progression -free survival (PFS) 
between the two arms was observed  (Bellmunt 2017 ). EU approval  for the same indication 
was granted  in September 2017 and Japanese approval in January 2018 . Other programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and PD -L1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical 
trials for urothelial cancer, as first and second -line therapy (Mullane 2016 ). 
While CPIs offer a new approach to treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer,  tumor 
responses have occurred in a minority of patients and the improvement in long -term survival 
is only a few months. For example, in May 2017, Roche announced that a confirmatory 
phase 3 trial of second -line atezolizumab had failed to meet its primary endpoint of OS 
(Roche, press release “Roche provides update on phase III study of Tecentriq [atezolizumab] 
in people with previously treated advanced bladder cancer,” 10 -May-2017). Most patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer do not respond to CPIs and many who 
do respond ultimately develop disease progression  (Rosenberg 2016 ). Novel treatments are 
still needed, particularly for patients who have not responded to CPIs or who have progressed 
following CPI therapy.  
Currently, no therapies are approved for patients previously treated with a CPI. Although 
taxanes are not approved in this setting, they are a common choice for third line treatme nt 
(and were a standard second -line treatment before atezolizumab was approved). Taxanes 
have response rates of approximately 10% as second -line therapy, with progression -free 
survival  (PFS) and OS of only 3.3 months and 7.4 months, respectively (Bellmunt 2017 ). No 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 14 of 102 data are currently available regarding the clinical acti vity of taxanes in the third line setting 
after CPI therapy.  
The lack of approved therapies for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer after treatment 
with a CPI and the limited activity observed with second -line chemotherapy adequately 
demonstrate tha t this population has significant unmet medical need. This patient population 
appears appropriate for this phase 2 study . 
1.3 Nectin -4  
Nectin -4 is a 66 kDa type I transmembrane prote in that belongs to the nectin family of 
adhesion molecules . It is composed of an extracellular domain (ECD) containing 3 
immunoglobulin  (Ig)-like subdomains, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular region 
(Takai 2008a ). Nectins are thought to mediate Ca2+-independent cell -cell adhesion via both 
homophilic and heterophilic trans -interactions  at adherens junctions where they can recruit 
cadherins and modulate cytoskeletal rearrangements (Rikitake 2008 ). Sequence identity of 
Nectin -4 to other Nectin family members is low and ranges between 25 %–30% in the ECD  
(Reymond 2001 ). 
The 3 Ig-like subdomains in the ECD of Nectin -4 are designated  V, C1 and C2 . The C1 
domain is responsible for cis -interaction (homodimerization), while V domains of most 
Nectin molecules contribute to trans -interaction and cell -cell adhesion (Mandai 2015 ; Takai 
2008b ). 
Nectin -4 was originally identified by bioinformatics and clon ed from human trachea 
(Reymond 2001 ). Nectin -4 was identified as markedly upregulated in urothelial cancer using 
suppression subtractive hybridization on a pool of urothelial cancer specimens . 
Characterization of expression in m ultiple tumor specimens, both at the ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) level and by immunohistochemistry (IHC), also demonstrated high levels of Nectin -4 
in breast, pancreatic, lung, and other cancers (Challita -Eid 2016 ). 
1.4 Nectin -4 as a Target in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer   
Nectin -4 has been found to be expressed in multiple  cancers, particularly urothelial, breast, 
lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers . Higher levels of expression are associated with disease 
progression and/or poor prognosis (Fabre -Lafay 2007 ). 
Although no longer required for metastatic urothelial cancer patients prior to enrollment, in 
an ongoing phase 1 study of enfortumab vedotin in multiple cancer types including 
metastatic urothelial cancer (Study ASG -22CE -13-2), patients were initi ally prescreened for 
Nectin -4 expression . Nectin -4 expression is still assessed in archival tissue, though metastatic 
urothelial cancer patients may enroll regardless of Nectin -4 expression . An H -score, derived 
from the inten sity of staining with anti -Nect in-4 antibody and the percentage of cells 
expressing Nectin -4 in the tumor tissue, was determined for each screened patient . H-score  
values range between 0 (no expression) and 300 (maximal expression) . 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 15 of 102 Of 186 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer whose tumor tissue was screened using a 
central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments  laboratory -validated test, more than 
97% had detectable Nectin -4 expression . Ninety -three percent of these patients  met the initial 
criterion for enrollment in the phase 1 study (H -score ≥150) . The median H -score was 280.  
Based upon the prevalence of high Nectin -4 expression in this population of metastatic 
urothelial cancer patients, this phase 2 study does not includ e an eligibility requirement for a 
minimum level of Nectin -4 expression . However, Nectin -4 expression will be assessed with 
tumor tissue collected at screening.  
1.5 Enfortumab Vedotin   
Enfortumab vedotin is a Nectin -4 targeted monoclonal antibody (AGS -22C3) covalently 
linked to the microtubule -disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Enfortumab 
vedotin consists of three functional subunits:  
● A fully human IgG1Κ antibody (AGS -22C3)  
● The microtubule -disrupting agent MMAE  
● A protease -cleavable maleimidocaproyl -valine -citrulline (vc) linker that covalently 
attaches MMAE to AGS -22C3  
Enfortumab vedotin binds the V domain of Nectin -4 (Challita -Eid 2016 ). In the presumed 
mechanism of action, the drug binds Nectin -4 protein on the cell surface and is internalized, 
causing proteolytic cleavage of the vc linker and intracellu lar release of MMAE . Free 
MMAE subsequently disrupts tubulin polymerization and leads to mitotic arrest.  
1.6 Rationale for Enfortumab Vedotin in Metastatic Urothelial Cancer, Clinical 
Safety and Efficacy   
A phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study with enfortumab vedotin monotherapy in 
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and other malignant solid tumors is ongoing 
(Study ASG -22CE -13-2). In this study, patients received doses of enfortumab vedotin 
ranging from 0.5 to 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  
As of the data cut -off date of 02 October 2017 , 140 metastatic urothelial cancer patients had 
been enrolled in the phase 1 study . Interim data  suggest that enfortumab vedotin is generally 
well tolerated at doses up to 1.25 mg/kg, and induces multiple objective responses in this 
patient population.  
Among metastatic urothelial cancer patients, 137 (98%) experienced a treatment -emergent 
adverse event ( TEAE ), and 122 (87%) of these patients’ TEAEs were deemed possibly or 
probably related to study drug by the investigator . The most common TEAE s among 
metastatic urothelial cancer patients were  fatigue (4 9%), n ausea (4 5%), decreased appetite 
(39%), alopecia (37%), diarrhea (36%), dysgeusia (31%), pruritus (29%), anemia (26%), 
abdominal pain (24%), constipation (24%), vomiting (24%), and weight decrease d (20%) . 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 16 of 102 Drug doses were reduced in 18 out of 140 metastatic urothelial cancer patients (13%) due to 
adverse events (AEs), including 16 out of 97 patients (17%) in the 1.25 mg/kg dose group. 
Drug was withdrawn in 26 out of 140 (19%) metastatic urothelial cancer pat ients due to AEs, 
including 13 out of 97 (13%) from the 1.25 mg/kg dose group. Across all dose levels, drug 
was withdrawn from 12 out of 140 (9%) metastatic urothelial cancer patients due to AEs 
deemed possibly or probably related to enfortumab vedotin. In  the 1.25 mg/kg dose group, 
drug was withdrawn from 6 out of 97 (6%) metastatic urothelial cancer patients due to AEs 
deemed as possibly or probably related to enfortumab vedotin. TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation among urothelial cancer patients  included peripheral neuropathy, urosepsis, 
increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), acute kidney injury, and increased blood 
creatinine in 2 patients each.  
Fifty -five metastatic urothelial cancer patients (39%) experienced at least one treatment 
emerge nt serious adverse event (SAE). Sixteen patients (11%) had SAEs that were deemed 
by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to treatment. At the 1.25 mg/kg dose 
level, 31 out of 97 patients (32%) had at least one treatment emergent SAE. Nine pa tients 
(9%) had SAEs that were deemed by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to 
treatment. As of the 02 October 2017 data cut -off date, t here were  6 fatal TEAEs in the 
metastatic urothelial cancer patients during this study, and 2 were deem ed to be  drug-related . 
As of the 02 October 2017 data cut -off date, 1 of the re lated fatal events in Study 
ASG -22CE -13-2 was reported in conjunction with serious hyperglycemia. Following the data 
cut-off date, 2 additional treatment -related fatal events as sociated with serious hyperglycemia 
were reported in October 2017. All active enfortumab vedotin study protocols were 
immediately amended to address this new safety information (See  Appendix  H 
Amendment  1). No additional treatment -related fatal events have be en reported as of 
15 March 2018 . 
A summary of the clinical and nonclinical safety data relevant to the investigational product 
and its study in human subjects are provide d in the Investigator’s Brochure . Based upon the 
totality of the safety data available the observed safety profile supports further clinical 
development of enfortumab vedotin in metastatic urothelial cancer patients.  
Enfortumab vedotin shows encouraging an titumor activity in patients with metastatic 
urothelial cancer with either post -baseline imaging or who had discontinued treatment before 
imaging. As of the data cut -off date of 02 October 2017, there were 5 CRs and 50 partial 
responses (PRs) (ORR=45%, 55 of 121 patients) across dose levels. The ORR at 1.25 mg/kg 
(the dose level for the present study) was 54% (42 out of 78 p atients). Disease control 
(CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) was reached in 69% of metastatic urothelial cancer patients 
(84 of 121 patients), including 71% in the 1.25 mg/kg dose group (55 of 78 patients).  
Enfortumab vedotin also shows promising antitumor activity in metastatic urothelial cancer 
patients previously treated with CPIs who had either post -baseline imaging or had 
disconti nued treatment before imaging. Across dose levels, the ORR was 50% (35 out of 
70 patients), and at 1.25 mg/kg the ORR was 53% (29 out of 55 patients). Disease control 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 17 of 102 was reached in 73% (51 of 70 patients), including 75% (41 of 55 patients) of the 1.25 mg/ kg 
dose group . 
Confirmed ORR was 27% across all dose levels (33 of 121 patients) and 32% at 1.25 mg/kg 
(25 of 78 patients). In patients previously treated with a CPI, the confirmed ORR was 31% 
(17 ou t of 55 patients) at 1.25 mg/kg . 
This phase 2 study is designed to further investigate the encouraging clinical safety and 
efficacy  data observed in the ongoing phase 1 trial of enfortumab vedotin in metastatic 
urothelial cancer patients, including patients previously treated with CPIs . 
Clinical data to date sup port a favorable benefit -risk ratio for enfortumab vedotin in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who previously received CPI 
therapy. To assure an ongoing favorable benefit -risk assessment for subjects enrolled into the 
study , an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be utilized to monitor safety 
data and may request interim efficacy data, if needed.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
3.1 Summary of Study Design   
This is a single -arm, open -label, multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
enfortumab vedotin as a single agent in locally advanced or metastatic urotheli al cancer 
patients who have previously received systemic therapy with a CPI . Patients must also either  
have received prior treatment with platinum -containing chemotherapy  (Cohort 1)  or received 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 19 of 102 no prior platinum -containing or other chemotherapy  and are ineligible for treatment with 
cisplatin at time of enrollment . (Cohort 2) . Patients must have progressive disease  (PD)  
during or following their most recent therapy . There are no limits for prior lines of therapy, 
including taxanes . 
Enfortumab vedotin at a do se of 1.25 mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion over approximately 30 minutes  on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle . Measures 
of anticancer activity will be assessed by computed tomography (CT scans with contrast , 
unless contraind icated ) every 8 weeks (±1 week)  timed from Cycle 1 Day 1  during treatment . 
After 1 year on study the frequency of response assessme nts will be reduced to every 
12 weeks (± 1 week) . Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, start of 
subsequent  anticancer therapy , pregnancy, or study termination by the sponsor . After 
discontinuation of study treatment, patients will be followed every 8 weeks (±1 week)  for 
response assessments, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status, 
and physical exams . After 1 year  on study  the frequency of follow up visits including 
response assess ments will b e reduced to every 12 weeks (±1  week) . Patients that have 
radiologically -confirmed disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the 
investigator) or have begu n subsequent anticancer therapy  will be contacted every 8  weeks 
(±1 week)  up to 1 year  on study , and every 12 weeks ( ±1 week) thereafter  to obtain  
information on subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival status  until death, study closure, 
withdrawal of consent , or patient is lost to follow -up, whichever occurs first  (see Figure  1). 
The study will be closed 5 years after enrollment of the last patient, or when no patients 
remain in long -term follow -up, whichever occurs first . Additiona lly, the sponsor may 
terminate the study at any time.  
On a periodic basis, an IDMC will monitor the safety of patients participating in this trial . 
The IDMC will be responsible for evaluating the results of safety analyses and will make 
recommendations to the sponsor . The IDMC may also request efficacy data , if needed, to 
evaluate risk/benefit before making recommendati ons. The IDMC will make 
recommendations to either continue the study un changed, to modify the study, or to 
discontinue the study . If corneal AEs are observed in <15% of the first 60 enrolled patients  
(from Cohorts 1 and/or 2)  and if the events are generally low grade or asymptomatic, t he 
IDMC may make a recommendation to cease Cycle 2 Day 22  and/or Cycle 6 Day 22  slit 
lamp exams for the  remaining patients  if warranted based on review of the cumulative ocular

3.2 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design   
This study will enroll patients who have previously received CPI therapy. Based on prior 
treatment patterns, taxanes or vinflunine  are anticipated to be the next line of therapy to 
address post -CPI relapsed disease, but response rates are expected to be only 9%–13% 
(Bellmunt 2017 ; Bellmunt 2009 ; Choueiri 2012 ; McCaffrey 1997 ). Data presented from a 
recent study  of patients treated with docetaxel after platinum and CPI therapy showed a 
10.5% ORR  (n=2/19)  (Drakaki 2018 ). Recently, 10% has been used as the historical response 
rate expected for both platinum pre -treated second -line and cisplatin ineligible first -line 
patients (Balar 2017 ; Rosenberg 2016 ). Given that patients enrolled in the current study have 
a poor prognosis and represent an area of unmet medical need, the lower bound of the exact 
95% confidence interval ( CI) for ORR that excludes a historical response rate of 10%  is 
considered to be a mea ningful improvement over currently available therapies  with the 
proposed enrollment of approximately 100 patients . 
The primary endpoint of this study, confirmed ORR, is a direct measure of antitumor activity 
and is an acceptable  surrogate endpoint (FDA Gui dance for Industry “Clinical Trial 
Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics”) . To further assess the 
significance of ORR in this study, the durability of response will be evaluated as a secondary 
endpoint . Furthermore, standardized RECIST ( Version 1.1, see Appendix  D) criteria 
(Eisenhauer 2009 ) will be employed by investigators and the IRF to evaluate responses . 
Responses will be confirmed per IRF with repeat scans 4 weeks (+1 week) after initial 
documentation of response.  
ORR may be evaluated in a single -arm study when it is defined as the sum of PR plus CR 
(FDA Guidance for Industry “Clinical Trial Endpoints for  the Approval of Cancer Drugs and 
Biologics”) . Moreover, to ensure consistent unbiased application of the RECIST criteria in 
this open -label study, all imaging assessments performed to confirm disease status at study

3.2.1  Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups   
This is a single -arm study in which all patients  will receive 1.25 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin 
administered as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1, 8 , and 15 of each 
28-day treatment cycle.  
3.2.2  Rationale for Selection of Doses   
Enfortumab vedotin will be administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 
approximately 30 minutes on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle . This dose and regimen 
has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity in the phase 
1 study  (Study ASG -22CE -13-2). 
In the phase 1 study, enfortumab vedotin was administered on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of every 
28-day treatment cycle . The study tested escalating dose levels of 0.5, 0.75, 1 , and 
1.25 mg/kg, with exp ansion cohorts at the 0.75, 1, and 1.25 mg/kg dose levels . A maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached in this study.  
As of the 02 October 2017 data cut -off date, at the 1 mg/kg dose level, increased alanine 
aminotransferase levels was the only dose -limiting toxicity observed (1 out of 14) . No DLT 
was observed at 1.25 mg/kg  and doses above 1.25 mg/kg were not tested . Incidence of some 
of the most frequent drug -related AEs, such as decreased appetite, alopecia, diarrhea and 
rash, although primarily Grades 1 –2 and clinically manageable, increased with increasing 
dose levels  among patients with urothelial cancer. The most common study drug -related AE, 
fatigue, occurred in 21%, 33%, and 43% of urothelial cancer pa tients in the 0.75, 1, and 
1.25 mg/kg dose groups, r espectively. Similarly, study -drug related nausea, alopecia, 
decreased appetite, and diarrhea were all more common in the 1.25 mg/kg dose group than 
the 0.75 mg/kg dose group . Moreover, dose reductions due to AEs were more frequent for 
the 1.25 mg/kg vs lo wer dose levels . Safety assessments of metastatic urothelial cancer 
patients (N= 140) showed that frequency of all TEAEs were comparable across all dose 
levels . AEs leading to withdrawal and Grade 3 –4 TEAEs  were less frequent in the 
1.25 mg/kg dose level th an at lower dose levels . 
While all doses of enfortumab vedotin demonstrated activity, the 1.25 mg/kg dose was 
associated with the highest activity and had an acceptable safety profile . The confirmed ORR 
in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer treated at the 1.25 mg/kg  dose was 32% (25 out 
of 78 patients) versus 19% (8 out of 43) for patients treated with doses less than 1.25 mg/kg . 
Based on PK data  from the phase 1 study (Study ASG -22CE -13-2), the half -life of 
enfortumab vedotin is ~1 –2 days . No notable ( <30%) intra-cycle accumulation of 
antibody -drug conjugate ( ADC ) was observed with the current dosing regimen (on Days 1, 8 , 
and 15 of every 28 -day cycle) at any dose level . Minimal (<50%) intra -cycle accumulation of 
MMAE was observed . It is anti cipated that the dosing schedule in the study will maintain 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 22 of 102 ADC exposure s over each 28 -day cycle , contributing to a favorable balance of activity and 
safety, as observed in the phase 1 trial  (Study ASG -22CE -13-2). 
In summary, the dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg  on Days 1, 8 , and 15 of each 28 -day cycle 
proposed for the phase 2 study has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and 
encouraging clinical activity that was higher than at lower dose levels.

5 TREATMENTS   
5.1 Treatments Administered   
Patients in this study will receive enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg administered as an IV 
infusion over approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 -day cycle.  
5.2 Investigational Study Drug   
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of enfortumab 
vedotin is located in the Pharmacy Binder.  
5.2.1  Description   
Enfortumab vedotin is generated by conjugation of a chemical intermediate that contains 
both the MMAE and linker subunits, to cysteine residues of the antibody . The resulting ADC 
contains an average of 3.8 drug molecules per antibody . The enfortumab vedotin drug 
product is a sterile, preservative free, white to off -white lyophilized powder to be 
reconstituted for IV administration . Enfortumab vedotin is supplied in 30 mg single -dose 
vials . Please refer to the Pharmacy Binder  for further information.  
5.2.2  Dose and Administration   
Enfortumab vedotin at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg will be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, an d 15 of every 28 -day cycle . In the absence of 
infusion -related reactions  (IRRs) , the infusion rate for all patients should be calculated in 
order to achieve an approximate 30 -minute infusion period . Enfortumab vedotin must not be 
administered as an IV push  or bolus . Enfortumab vedotin should not be mixed with other 
medications . At least 1 week must elapse between doses of enfortumab vedotin . 
Weight -based dosing is calculated using  the patient’s actual body weight . An exception to 
weight -based dosing is made  for patients weighing greater than 100 kg; doses will be 
based on 100 kg for these individuals . The maximum dose  permitted on this study is 
125 mg. 
Doses must be adjusted for patients who experience a ≥10% change in weight from baseline, 
or previous cycle . Patient weight must be measured during all relevant assessment windows 
as described in the schedule of events . Other dose adjustments for changes in body weight 
<10% are permitted per institutional standard.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 28 of 102 The injection site should be m onitor ed closely for redness, swelling, pain, and infection 
during and at any time after administration. Patients should be a dvise d to report redness or 
discomfort promptly at the time of administration or after infusion. Institutional guidelines 
will be followed for the administration of chemotherapy agents and precautions taken to 
prevent extravasation per institutional standards and as described in  “Chemotherapy and 
Biotherapy Guidelines and Recommendations for P ractice ” (Polovich 2014 ) and 
“Management of Chemotherapy Extravasation:  ESMO -EONS Clinical Practice G uidelines ” 
(Perez Fidalgo 2012 ). 
The patient should be observed during administration of enfortumab vedotin and for at least 
60 minutes following the infusi on during the first 3 cycles. All supportive measures 
consistent with optimal subject care should be given throughout the study according to 
institutional standards.  
5.2.3  Dose Modifications   
Intrapatient dose reduction to 1 mg/kg (dose level –1), and to 0.75 mg/kg (dose level –2) will 
be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity . Patients requiring a dose reduction 
may be re -escalated by 1 dose level ( e.g., patients  reduc ed to 0.75 mg/kg may only be 
re-escalated to 1 mg/kg) provided the toxicity does not require study drug discontinuation 
and has returned to baseline or ≤ Grade 1. If the toxicity recurs, re -escalation will not be 
permitted. Patients with ≥ Grade 2 corneal AE s will not be permitted to dose re -escalate.  
Enfortumab vedotin  should not be administered to patients  with known  CrCl < 30 mL/min. 
Dose modification recommendations for enfortumab vedotin -associated toxicity are 
presented in Table  1 and Table  2. 
If toxicities occur on Day 1 of any cycle and require the enfortumab vedotin dose to be held, 
then the start of the cycle may be delayed. If toxicities occur on Days 8 or 15 of any cycle 
and require the dose to be held > 2 days, then the dose(s) must be eliminated, rather than 
delayed. If a patient only receives enfor tumab vedotin on D ay 1 and needs to skip Days 8 and 
15, the patient could resume the next cycle as early as Day 22 (new Day 1) if the toxicity has 
resolved by that time . 
Intrapatient dose reduction or delay for other enfortumab vedotin -associated toxicity is 
permitted at the discretion of the site investigator . Dose d elays may last up to 8 weeks 
(2 cycles) . Dose delays for patients who are responding to treatment may be extended  beyond 
8 weeks , if the patient’s toxicity does not otherwise require permanent discontinuation . 
Patients may not receive other investigational drugs, radiotherapy  (except palliative 
radiotherapy as described in Section 5.3.2 ), or systemic ant ineoplastic therapy during dose 
delays . If there is a dose delay , the schedule for response assessments will not be adjusted  
and will continue to be timed from Cycle 1 Day 1  during treatment .

5.2.3.1  Treatment Discontinuation Recommendations Related to Liver Safety   
In the absence of an explanation for increased liver function tests (LFTs ), such as viral 
hepatitis, preexisting or acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver 
injury, the patient may be discontinued from the study treatment . The investigator may 
determine that it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue study treatment . 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
● ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
● ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio ( INR) >1.5 (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of symptoms suggestive of liver injury  
(e.g., right upper quadrant pain or tenderness) and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
These treatment discontinuation recommendations are based on the FDA Guidance for 
Industry (Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009) . The 
recommendati ons are a basic guide to the investigato r based on accumulated clinical 
experience with drugs in development, and are not specific to clinical experience with 
enfortumab vedotin.

administered at a site properly equipped and  staffed to manage anaphylaxis should it occur . 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care should be given throughout the 
study according to institutional standards . Supportive measures may include administering 
medications for IRRs . 
Patients who have experienced an IRR may be premedicated for subsequent infusions . 
Premedication may include pain medication (e.g., acetaminophen or equivalent), an 
antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride) , and a corticosteroid  administered  
30–60 minutes prior to each infusion or according to institutional standards . Should a patient 
experience IRRs in the setting of premedication, continued treatment with enfortumab 
vedotin must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to the next planned dose.  
If anaphylaxis occurs, study treatment administration should be immediately and 
permanently discontinued.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 33 of 102 5.4.2  Management of Hyperglycemia   
Investigators should monitor blood glucose levels and ar e advised to perform additional 
assessments if any symptoms of hyperglycemia are observed, incl uding a thorough 
evaluation for infection. In addition, if steroids are used to treat any other condition, blood 
glucose  levels may require addition al monitoring. If elevated blood glucose levels are 
observed, patients should be treated according to local standard of care and referral to 
endocrinology may be considered.  
Patients , especially those with a history of or ongoing diabetes mellitus or hyper glycemia, 
should  be advised to immediately notify their physician if their glucose level  becomes 
difficult to control or if they experience symptoms suggestive of hyperglycemia such as  
frequent urination, increased thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, and head ache. 
Patients who enter the study with an elevated HbA1c  (≥6.5%)  at baseline should be referred 
to an appropriate provider during Cycle 1 for glucose management. Blood glucose should be 
checked prior to each dosing and dose  should  be withheld for blood gl ucose >250 mg/dL 
(Grade 3 or higher) , regardless of relatedness to enfortumab vedotin . Dosing may continue 
once the patient’s blood glucose has improved to  ≤250 mg/dL ( ≤ Grade 2 ) and the patient is 
clinically and metabolically stable . Patients with blood glucose > 500 mg/dL (Grade 4) 
considered unrelated to enfortumab vedotin may continue dosing once the patient’s blood 
glucose has improved to ≤250 mg/dL ( ≤ Grade 2 ) and the patient is clinically and 
metabolically stable. Blood glucose > 500 mg/dL (Grade 4) c onsidered related to enfortumab 
vedotin  requires treatment discontinuation. If a patient  experiences new onset diabetes 
mellitus, evaluate patients  with a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, 
and C -peptide to assess for new onset type 1  diabetes in the setting of prior CPI.  
5.4.3  Management of Rash  Related to Enfortumab Vedotin   
Enfortumab vedotin is a Nectin -4 directed antibody drug conjugate. Nectin -4 is a cell 
adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in urothelial carcinoma. Low to moderate levels 
of Nectin -4 are also expressed on normal tissues, including skin keratinocytes, sweat glands 
and hair follicles; thus, skin reactions are anticipated events. As such , skin reactions are 
adverse events of interest in all clinical studies with enfortumab vedotin.  
A cumulative review of post -marketing safety data from 18 Dec 2019 (the approval date of 
enfortumab vedotin in the US) through 22 Oct 2020 identified reports o f severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions in 15 patients receiving enfortumab vedotin, some of whom had fatal 
outcomes. These reactions occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment. 
Adverse events reported in these cases included SJS (5 cases), bl ister (3 cases), dermatitis 
bullous (3 cases), symmetrical drug -related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE; 
2 cases), and 1 case each of dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, epidermal necrosis, 
oropharyngeal blistering, stomatitis, and TEN.  
In enfortumab vedotin monotherapy studies of urothelial carcinoma, serious adverse events 
of severe cutaneous adverse reactions were reported in 11 of 749 subjects (1.5%) and 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 34 of 102 included dermatitis bullous (0.4%), drug eruption (0.4%), blister (0.1%), conjun ctivitis 
(0.1%), SJS (0.1%), stomatitis (0.1%), and toxic skin eruption (0.1%).  
Subjects should be informed that rash and severe skin reactions have occurred after 
administration of enfortumab vedotin  and advised to contact the Investigator immediately if 
they have signs and symptoms of skin reactions , oral mucosal and ocular abnormalities 
including mucositis or conjunctivitis . Starting in the first cycle and throughout treatment, 
closely monitor subjects for skin reactions. For mild to moderate skin reacti ons, consider 
appropriate treatment, such as topical corticosteroids and antihistamines as clinically 
indicated. For recommendations regarding dose modifications for skin reactions due to 
enfortumab vedotin, refer to Section 5.2.3 . 
5.4.4  Management of Pneumonitis/ILD Related to Enfortumab Vedotin  
Severe, life -threatening or fatal pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD) have occurred in 
patients receiving enfortumab vedotin. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of 
pneumonitis/ ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic 
exams. For recommendations regarding dose modifications for pneumonitis/ ILD due to 
enfortumab vedotin, refer to Section 5.2.3 . 
5.5 Treatment Compliance   
Study drug administration will be perform ed by study site staff and documented in source 
documents and the CRF.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1 Screening/Baseline Assessments   
Only patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section 4 will be 
enrolled in this study . Enrollment status and date will be recorded in CRF.  
Patient medical history includes a thorough review of significant past medical history, 
current conditions, tobacco history, any treatment for prior malignancies and response to 
prior treatment, and any concomitant medications.  
A complete eye examination, brain scan, bone scan, CT  scan with contrast  for baseline 
response efficacy assessment , INR/ PT/PTT, serology for hepatitis B  and C , urinalysis  with 
reflexive microscopic analysis , HbA1c, and pregnancy test (either urine or serum, for 
females of childbearing potential) are required for all patients at screening.  
7.2 Response/Efficacy Assessments   
Measures of anticancer activity will be assessed by CT scans with contrast  approximately 
every 8 weeks (±1 week). After 1 year on study, response assessments will be reduced to 
every 12 weeks (±1 week). The schedule of response assessments should not be adjusted for 
dose delays/inter ruptions or other reasons for changes in the timing of a patient’s study 
activities; timepoints for response assessments should be calculated from Cycle 1 Day 1  
during treatment . For patie nts who cannot receive CT scans with contrast, o ther acceptable 
imaging methods are detailed in Appendix F  (Scanning and Contrast Guidelines ). For brain 
scans, MRI with gadolinium is the preferred  method of assessment ; however, other imaging 
methods are detailed in Appendix F  if contrast is contraindicated . Patients must be evalu ated 
using the same imaging method throughout the study for efficacy assessments . CT scans with 
contrast  at the minimum will include the  chest, abdomen, and pelvis . Other regions should  be 
scanned if the patient has known or suspected disease in that regio n. Brain and/or bone scans 
should also be repeated at response assessment timepoints if bone metastases were identified 
at baseline, or if metastasis is known or suspected . Responses (CR or PR) will be confirmed 
with repeat scans 4 weeks (+1 week window) after first documentation of response . The 
schedule for response assessments should not be adjusted aft er the confirmatory scan 
(e.g.,  CR at Week 8, confirmatory scans at Week 12, next assessment due at Week 16) . 
Tumor imaging should also be performed when ever disease progression is suspected.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than objective  disease progression 
by RECIST Version 1 .1 (see Appendix  D) will continue to receive CT  scans with contrast  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 40 of 102 8 weeks (± 1 week) after the previous response assessment scan and every 8 weeks (± 1 week) 
following the previous scan thereafter . After 1 year on study  the frequency of response 
assessments wil l be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week) . The tumor assessments will 
continue until the patient has radiologically -confirmed disease progression  per RECIST  as 
determined  by the investigator , initiates a new anticancer therapy, dies or withdraws consent, 
or the study closes , whichever comes first . The determination of antitumor activity will be 
based on confirmed objective response assessments as defined by RECIST Version 1.1 (see 
Appendix  D) (Eisenhauer 2009 ). Patients who do not have at least 2 (initial response and 
confirmation scan) post -baseline response assessments will be counted as non -responders . 
The investigator  will make treatment decisions  based on site assessments o f scans by 
RECIST . Clinical response of CR, PR, SD, or PD will be determined at each assessment . 
Response and progression will also be assessed by an IRF .  
Survival status will be updated every 8 weeks  (±1 week)  after EOT (or 8 weeks from 
previous protocol visit, whichever is later) until death, study closure, or withdrawal of 
consent , whichever occurs first . After 1 year on study the frequency of survival status 
updates will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week).  
Patients ’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification . Tumor images will be 
submitted to a central imaging lab.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic and ATA Assessments   
Blood samples for PK a nd ATA will be collected throughout the study per the sample 
collection schedule provided in Table  3. Validated or qualified assays will be used to 
measure the concen trations of enfortumab vedotin ADC , TAb,  and MMAE in serum or 
plasma . PK samples will be collected and archived for possible analysis of other enfortumab 
vedotin -related species , such as circulating metabolites of MMAE . A qualified assay will be 
used to de termine the levels of ATA in serum.  
Refer to the Central Laboratory Manual for information on collection, processing, storage, 
and shipment of sample.  
7.4 Biomarker Studies   
Samples f or exploratory biomarkers will be collected at protocol -specified timepoints (see 
Table  3 and Appendix  A). Biomarker assessments will not be used for patient selection.  
Methods of analysis may include IHC, next generation sequencing, PCR, mutation and gene 
expression profiling; T -cell receptor beta  chain sequencing, flow cytometry and 
immunoassays . 
7.4.1  Biomarkers in Blood   
The primary effects of enfortumab vedotin on urothelial carcinoma tumor cells may lead to 
changes in the a ctivation state of local, tumor -associated and peripheral immune cells. 
Biomarker assessments in blood samples may include but may not be limited to: markers of 
immune function, including abundance and phenotype of immune cell subsets , circulating

Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 43 of 102 7.4.2  Biomarkers in Pre-Treatment Tumor Tissue   
To better understand relationships between pre -treatment urothelial carcinoma biological 
characteristics, and patient outcome, submission of a tumor block or freshly sectioned, 
unstained charged slides (at least 10 slides are mandatory unless prior approva l is obtained 
from  the sponsor) of pretreatment tumor tissue are required . Either archival tissue or 
pre-treatment fresh tumor tissue (obtained from a fresh biopsy ) is acceptable. See the 
Laboratory Manual for details.  
Biomarker assessments in tumor tissue  may include, but not be limited to:  
● Tumor expression of Nectin -4 protein  
● Messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression   
● Markers of disease subtype (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas [ TCGA ] subtypes)  
● Tumor mutational burden  
● Markers of the tumor immune microenvironment  
7.5 Biospecimen Repository   
In the US only, for patients who provide additional consent, remaining de -identified unused 
blood and/or tissue will be retained by the sp onsors  and used for future research, including 
but not limited to the evaluation of targets for novel therapeutic agents, the biology of ADC 
sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and the identification of biomarkers for ADCs . Blood 
and tissue samples dona ted for future research will be retained for a period of up to 25 years . 
If additional consent is not provided, any remaining biological samples will be destroyed 
following study completion  and when the samples are no longer required to be maintained 
for p otential regulatory submissions . 
7.6 Quality of Life   
Two validated tools will be used: the QLQ -C30, and the EQ -5D. 
If possible, PRO assessments should be completed before any other p rocedures at the study 
visits noted in the schedule of events ( Appendix  A). 
7.6.1  EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire, QLQ -C30  
The QLQ -C30 was developed to measure aspects of QoL pertinent to patients with a broad 
range of cancers who are participating in clinical trials (Aaronson 1993 ; Sneeuw 1998 ). The 
current version of the core instrument (QLQ -C30, Version 3) is a 30 -item questionnaire 
consisting of the following:  
● 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, so cial);  
● 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea & vomiting);  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 44 of 102 ● Single items for symptoms (shortness of breath, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, 
constipation, diarrhea) and financial impact of the disease; and  
● 2 global items (health, overall QoL). 
7.6.2  EuroQol -5 Dimensions   
The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a 
generic, preference -based measure of health outcomes . It is applicable to a wide r ange of 
health conditions and treatments and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index 
value for health status . The EQ -5D is a 5 -item self -reported measure of functioning and well -
being, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobil ity, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort , and anxiety/depression . Each dimension comprises 3 levels (no problems, 
some/moderate problems, extreme problems) . A unique EQ -5D health state is defined by 
combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions . This questionnaire also records the 
respondent’s self -rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 to 100) visual analogue scale . 
Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) 
based on values derived fr om general population samples . The EQ -5D is recommended for 
use in cost -effectiveness analyses commonly employed in health technology assessments by 
the Washington Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (Gold 1996 ). 
7.7 Safety Assessments   
The assessment of safety during the course of this study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication, and measureme nts 
of protocol -specified physical examination findings , cardiac monitoring,  and laboratory tests.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an IDMC as described in 
Section  9.3.10 . 
7.7.1  Adverse Events   
7.7.1.1  Definitions   
Adverse Event   
According to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guideline Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32, 
Investigational New Drug ( IND) Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
The f ollowing information should be considered when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or other incident on the Adverse Events and Pre -existing 
Conditions CRF:  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 45 of 102 ● From the time of informed consent through the day prior to study Day 1, only study 
protocol -related AEs should be recorded . A protocol -related AE is defined as an 
untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol mandated procedure.  
● All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study Day 1 should be 
recorded.  
● All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) sh ould be recorded from study 
Day 1 (pre-dose) through the end of the safety reporting period (see Section 7.7.1.3 ). 
Complications that occur in association with any procedure (e.g., biopsy) should be 
recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol mandated.  
● Changes in medical conditions and AEs , including changes in severity, frequency, or 
character, during the safety reporting period should be recorded.  
● In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not be recorded as an AE unless it is 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an i ntervention, results in a SAE, 
or results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment . 
When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical 
condition rather than the abnormality itself should be re corded (e.g., record “anemia” 
rather than “low hemoglobin”).  
Serious Adverse Events   
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  AE resu lted in death  
 
Life threatening:  The AEs placed the patient at immediate risk of death. This classification does not apply to 
an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
 
Hospitalization:  The AE resulted in hospitalization or prol onged an existing inpatient hospitalization. 
Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before 
the signing of informed consent in the study or routine check -ups are not SAEs by this 
criterion. Admission to a palliati ve unit or hospice care facility is not considered to be a 
hospitalization. Pre-planned h ospitalizations for therapeutic, diagnostic, or surgical 
procedures of the underlying cancer or study target disease that did not worsen during the 
clinical trial need  not be captured as SAEs.  
 
Disabling/incapacitating:  An AE that resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 
Congenital anomaly or birth 
defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the molecule or study 
treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
 
Medically significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have jeopardized the patient and 
might have  required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 46 of 102 Adverse Event Severity   
AE severity should be graded using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03. These criteria are provided in the 
study manual.  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independe ntly. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity 
of an AE . ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Trea tment   
The relationship of each AE to enfortumab vedotin should be evaluated by the investigator 
using the following criteria:  
Related:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, such as:  
● A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
● One or more occurrences of an event that  is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the popula tion exposed to the drug (e.g.,  tendon rupture)  
 
Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying disease or occurs 
commonly in the study p opulation), or a temporal sequence cannot be established with the 
onset of the AE and administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible  
 
7.7.1.2  Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events   
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during patient 
questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means 
by recording them on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate.  
Eliciting Adverse Events   
An open -ended or non -directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to 
elicit the reporting of AEs.  
Recording Adverse Events   
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre -existing 
Conditions CRF:  
● Description including onset and resolution dates  
● Whether it met SAE criteria  
● Severity  
● Relationship to study treatment or other causality  
● Outcome  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 47 of 102 Diagnosis vs Signs or Symptoms   
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual 
symptoms . Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component 
sign and/or symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by 
standard medical te xtbooks . If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic 
pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate adverse event.  
Important exceptions for this study are adverse reactions associated with the infusion of 
study dru g. For IRRs , record the NCI CTCAE term of ‘ infusion related reaction ’ with an 
overall level of severity (per NCI CTCAE) . In addition, record each sign or symptom of the 
reaction as an individual AE . If multiple signs or symptoms occur with a given infusion -
related event, each sign or symptom should be recorded separately with its level of severity.  
Recording Serious Adverse Events   
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and an SAE form.  
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:  
● Death is an outcome of an event . The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported on both an SAE form and CRF.  
● For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures , the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself . The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
response to the illness.  
Progression of the Underlying C ancer   
Do not report radiographic signs of disease progression (e.g., ‘tumor progression’ or 
‘metastases’) as an AE  (this data is captured in the efficacy assessment) . Report the 
symptoms and signs of disease progression (e.g. , “fatigue”, “dyspnea”) as AEs; do not report 
disease progression as the AE term.  
For disease progression with a fatal outcome, report the immediate cause of death as the 
event term . If the immediate cause of death cannot be determined and it is thought by the 
investigator to be related to disease  progression , report the AE using the term ‘disease 
progression’ with a fatal outcome.  
Pregnancy   
Notification to Drug Safety:  Complete a Pregnancy Report Form for all pregnancies that 
occur from the time of first study drug dose until 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) 
including any pregnancies that occur in the partner of a male s tudy patient . Only report 
pregnancies that occur in a male patient’s partner if the estimated date of conception is after 
the male patient’s first study drug dose . Email or fax to the sponsor’s Drug Safety 
Department within 48 hours of becoming aware of a pregnancy . All pregnancies will be 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 48 of 102 monitored for the full duration; all perinatal and neonatal outcomes should be reported . 
Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks.  
Collection of data on the CRF:  All pregnancies (as described above) that occur  within 
30 days of the last dose of study drug(s) will also be recorde d on the Adverse Events and 
Pre-Existing Conditions CRF.  
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should be reported as an SAE . 
Congenital anomalies or birth defects, as defined by the ‘serious’ criterion above (see 
definitions Section 7.7.1.1 ) should be reported as SAEs.  
Corneal Adverse Ev ents  
Corneal ulcer or keratitis AEs ≥ Grade 2 should be graded  within their respective categories . 
Grade 1 corneal ulcer or keratitis AEs should be graded  per “Eye disorders – Other, specify”  
criteria . Other corneal AEs should be recorded and graded per  “Eye disorders – Other, 
specify”  criteria . 
Adverse Events of Possible Hepatic Origin   
If an AE is accom panied by increases in LFT values (e.g, AST, ALT, bilirubin, etc.) or is 
suspected to be due to hepatic dysfunction, see Appendix  E for detailed information on 
recommended monitoring and assessment of liver abnormalities . See Section 5.2.3.1  for 
treatment discontinuation recommendations related to hepatic safety.  
Patients with AEs of  hepatic origin accompanied by LFT abnormalities should be carefully 
monitored.  
7.7.1.3  Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events   
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from study Day 1 (predose) through 30 
days after the last study treatment . However, all study protocol -related AEs are to be 
recorded from the time of informed consent . All SAEs that occur after the safety reporting 
period and are consi dered study treatment -related in the opinion of the investigator should 
also be reported to the sponsor.  
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically s ignificant by the investigator, or 
the patient dies or withdraws consent . All non -serious AEs will be followed through the 
safety reporting period . Certain non -serious AEs of clinical interest may be followed 
(including collection of relevant concomitant m edications) until resolution, return to baseline,  
study closure , or the event s become chronic to the extent that they are adequately 
characterized . 
7.7.1.4  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting   
Within 24 hours of observing or learning of an SAE, investigators are to report the event to 
the sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 49 of 102 For initial SAE reports, available case details are t o be recorded on an SAE form. At a 
minimum, the following should be included:  
● Patient number  
● Date of event onset  
● Description of the event  
● Study treatment, if known  
 
The completed SAE form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet are to be emailed or faxed to the study 
spon sor’s Drug Safety Department or designee within 24 hours  (see email or fax number [s] 
specified on the SAE report form).  
Relevant follow -up information is to be submitted to the  study  sponsor as soon as it becomes 
available.  
7.7.1.5  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities   
Investigators are required to report all SAEs, including anticipated SAEs, to the study 
sponsor (see Section 7.7.1.4 ). 
The study sponsor s will report all SAEs to regulatory authorities as applicable and as 
required per local regulatory reporting requirements. In the US, endpoints that assess disease -
related mortality  or major morbidity, as well as other SAEs that are not study endpoints but 
are known consequences of the underlying disease or condition that are anticipated to occur 
in the study population, should not be reported to the FDA as individual IND safety repo rts 
per the final rule amending the IND safety reporting requirements under 21 CFR 312.32 and 
the FDA’s guidance Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting Guidance for Industry 
(draft guidance December 2015).  
In this study, the SAEs that do not require in dividual IND safety reports to the FDA are 
progression of the underlying cancer . These anticipated SAEs will be reviewed periodically 
by an IDMC  and Seagen  Drug Safety Department . If upon review, an SAE is occurring at a 
higher rate than that which would b e expected for the study population, then an IND safety 
report for the SAE will be submitted to the FDA.  
7.7.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests   
Samples will be drawn for central and local lab s. 
Local laboratory testing will include institutional standard tests for study eligibility, 
evaluating safety, and making clinical decisions.  Local laboratory testing should be 
performed on all dosing days. All local laboratory results must be reviewed pr ior to study 
drug administration in order to determine whether to proceed with dosing or whether dose 
modification is required.  
The following laboratory assessments will be performed by the central lab to evaluate safety 
at scheduled timepoints (see Appendix  A) during the course of the study:  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 50 of 102 ● The serum chemistry panel is to include the following tests: albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen,  calcium, creatinine, 
chloride, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphorus, potassium, sodium, 
total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and uric acid.  
● The CBC with differential is to include the following tests:  white blood cell count 
with five -part differ ential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and 
basophils), platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit . 
The following laboratory assessment(s) will be performed by local laboratories at scheduled 
timepoints (see Appendix  A) during the course of the study:  
● CrCl  at baseline using the Cock croft-Gault criteria  or 24 -hour urine collection  
● Standard urinalysis (with reflexive microscopy)  
● INR/PT/PTT  
● A serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG ) pregnancy test for 
females of childbearing potential  
● HbA1c  
● Serology for hepatitis B surface antigen and antihepatitis B core antibody  
● Serology for antihepatitis C antibody. If positive, follow up with PCR testing  
7.7.3  Physical Examination Including Weight   
Physical examinations should include assessments of the fol lowing body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs, neck, and ne urological . Height will be collected at 
the Baseline visit . Weight will be collected at specified timepoints (see Appendix  A), but 
does not need to be collected at visits following EOT . 
7.7.4  Vital Signs   
Vital sign measurements will be performed t o include heart rate (bpm), diastolic and systolic 
blood pressure (mmHg), and temperature . Vital sign values will be recorded, and any 
diagnosis associated with clinically significant abnormal vital signs will be recorded as an 
adverse event or pre -existin g condition.  
7.7.5  ECOG Performance Status   
ECOG performance status ( Appendix  B) will be evaluated at protocol -specified timepoints.  
7.7.6  Cardiac Monitoring   
ECGs will be conducted at baseline and at the EOT visit . Additional ECGs should be 
conducted if clinically indicated . Routine 12 -lead ECGs will be performed after the patient  
has been in a supine position for at least 5 minutes . The ECG assessments should be 
performed prior to obtaining the PK and biomarker samples if possible.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 51 of 102 7.7.7  Eye Examination   
Patients will have a complete eye examination  at baseline performed by a qualified 
ophthalmologist  or optometrist , including but not limited to: uncorrected, corrected and best 
corrected visual acuity, slit lamp, tonometry examination , and dilated fundus examination . 
EOT slit lamp examinations are required for all patients who experience corneal  adverse 
events during the study. EOT slit lamp examinations must be performed ≥4 weeks from last 
dose. Additional eye examinations are to be conducted as clinically indicated.  
7.8 Post -treatment Assessments   
7.8.1  Follow -up Assessments   
Patients who discontinue study treatment will continue to receive physical exams  (no weight 
collection is required) , ECOG assessment, and respons e assessments every 8 weeks 
(±1 week) after the previous response assessment scan and every 8 weeks (±1 wee k) 
following the previous visit thereafter  until radiologically -confirmed disease progression  (per 
RECIST as determined by the investigator) , initiation of a new anticancer therapy, patient 
death, study closure, or withdrawal of consent , whichever comes fi rst. After 1 year on study 
the frequency of follow -up visits will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week).  
7.8.2  Long -term follow -up Assessments   
After radiologically -confirmed progression (per RECIST as determined by the investigator) 
or initiation of a new anticancer therapy , patients will be contacted every 8 weeks (±1 week) 
after EOT (or 8  weeks from previous protocol visit, whichever is later)  to obtain information 
on subseq uent anticancer therapy and survival status . Long -term follow -up will continue 
until patient death, study closure, withdrawal of consent , or patient is lost to follow -up, 
whichever occurs first . After 1 year on study the frequency of long -term follow -up vi sits will 
be reduced to every 12  weeks (±1 week).  
7.9 Appropriateness of Measurements   
The safety measures that will be used in this trial are considered standard procedures for 
evalu ating the potential adverse effects of study medications.  
The determination of antitumor activity will be based on confirmed objective response 
assessments as defined by RECIST Version 1.1 (see Appendix  D) (Eisenhauer 2009 ) and 
treatment decisions by the Investigator will be based on these assessments . These criteria are 
considered standard in oncological practice for this type of neoplasm, and the intervals of 
evaluation in this protocol are appropriate for disease management.  
Immunogenicity is commonly assessed for biologics; therefore, standard tests will be 
performed to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to enfortumab vedotin.  
Pharmacokinetic  assessments  are also common in clinical studies to help characterize dose -
exposure -response relationships.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 52 of 102 Exploratory biomarker measurements in peripheral blood samples enable correlation with PK 
assessments and are common in clinical studies . Assessment s conducted on pretreatment 
tumor tissue are similarly common . Both peripheral blood and tumor biomarker samples will 
be assessed using commonly employed, standard tests.  
8 DATA QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURAN CE  
8.1 Site Training and Monitoring Procedures

9 DATA ANALYSIS METHOD S  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size   
The study is designed to estimate the confirmed ORR  in patients receiving enfortumab 
vedotin and to detect an improvement in the ORR compared with a historical 1 0% response 
rate. The rationale for the historical response rate is provided in Section 3.2. 
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in this study  to ensure collection of sufficient 
efficacy and safety data , including approximately 100 or more platinum -treated patients as 
defined in the eligibility criteria in Section 4.1 (Cohort 1) , and up to approximately 
100 platinum -naïve and cisp latin-ineligible  patients also defined in the eligibility criteria in 
Section 4.1 (Cohort 2 ). Using the estimate of approximately 100 patients  in Cohort  1, the 
study will have 98% power to detect a 15% increase in ORR from 10% to 25% and 81% 
power to detect a 10% increase in ORR from 10% to 20%, at one -sided significan ce level of 
0.025, based on exact methods using EAST®, Version 6.0, by Cytel Inc.  
The confirmed ORR and 95% exact CI in Cohort 2 will be summarized at 4 timepoints: 1) at 
the time of analysis of Cohort 1, 2) when approximately 50 patients in Cohort 2 have had the 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 55 of 102 opportunity to be  followed for approximately 8  months  from the first dose o f enfortumab 
vedotin , 3) when approximately 70 patients in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be  
followed for approximately 8 months  from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin , and 4) when 
all patients in Cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be  followed f or approximately 8  months  
from the first dose of enfortumab vedotin . 
For illustration purposes, below is the summary of expected 95% CIs for Cohort 2 at various 
analysis timepoints, assuming a 30% observed ORR:  
Number of Patients  Expected 95% Confidence In terval  
N=20  12%–54% 
N=50  18%–45% 
N=70  20%–42% 
N=100  21%–40% 
 
Slit lamp examinations will be conducted on at least the first 60 enrolled patients  (from 
Cohorts 1 and/or 2)  on Cycle 2 Day 22 (±1 week)  and Cycle 6 Day 22 (±1 week). If  corneal 
AEs are observed in <15% of the first 60 enrolled patients and if the events are generally low 
grade or asymptomatic, the IDMC may make a recommendation to cease Cycle 2 Day 22 
and/or Cycle 6 Day 22 slit lamp exams for the remaining patients if wa rranted based on 
review of the cumulative ocular safety data . Based on the results from the Phase 1 study 
(Study ASG -22CE -13-2), as of the data cut -off date of  14 November 2016, there were 
3 patients who reported experiencing corneal adverse events out of 33 patients on 1.25 kg/mg 
of enfortumab vedotin . Assuming an event rate of 9% (3/33), with a sample size of 60, the 
probability of observing >3 events (5%) is 80.0% and the probability of observing <9 events 
(15%) is 91.2% . If the event rate is higher, the  probability of observing <9 events is 
decreased . For example, if the event rate is 20%, the probability of observing <9 events is 
decreased to 12.7%.  Based on the analysis described above  and the review of cumulative 
ocular safety data , the IDMC recommend ed that the Cycle 2 Day 22  and Cycle 6 Day 22 slit 
lamp exams be discontinued  in Jul 2018 and Aug 2019, respectively . 
Sample size calculations were performed using EAST®, Version 6.0, by Cytel Inc.  
9.2 Study Endpoint Definitions   
9.2.1  Objective Response Rate   
The primary endpoint of this study is the confirmed ORR per IRF . The ORR is defined as the 
proportion of patients with confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1 .1 (see 
Appendix  D) (Eisenhauer 2009 ). Patients who do not have at least  2 (initial response and 
confirmation scan) post-baseline response assessment s as described in Section 7.2 of the 
protocol will be counted as non-responders.  
In addition, ORR per investigator will be analyzed as a secondary endpoint.  
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 56 of 102 9.2.2  Duration of Response   
The DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of object ive response (CR or PR  
that is subsequently confirmed ) to the first documentation of PD (per RECIST Version 1.1) 
or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  
DOR  data will be censored as described below:  
● Patients who do not have PD and are still on  study at the time of an analysis will be 
censored at the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of PD ; 
● Patients who have started an antitumor treatment other than the study treatment (with 
the exception of palliative radiotherapy  as descr ibed in Section 5.3.2 ) prior to 
documentation of PD will be censored at the date of the last disease assessment prior 
to start of new therapy ; 
● Patients who are rem oved from the study prior to documentation of PD will be 
censored at the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of PD.  
DOR  will only be calculated for the patients achieving a confirmed CR or PR.  
9.2.3  Disease Control Rate at Week 16   
DCR 16 per IRF is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, or SD at Week 16 visit, 
based on IRF assessment . Responses do not need to be confirmed to be scored as responders 
for the purpose of determining DCR 16. Patients whose disease response cannot be assessed as 
CR, PR, or SD  at Week 16  or later  will be scored as non -responders for calculating the DCR . 
An exception is patients who have a CR, PR, or SD subsequent to Week 16, but who miss 
Week 16; these patients  will be counted as having disease control at Week 16.  
In addition, DCR 16 per investigator will be also summarized.  
9.2.4  Progression -free Survival   
PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective 
tumor progression (PD per RECIST Version 1.1), or to death due to any cause, whichever 
comes first . 
The same censoring rules outlined in Section 9.2.2  for DOR will be applied to PFS . Patients 
lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose will have their event time 
censored at Day 1.  
9.2.5  Overall Survi val  
OS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause . In 
the absence of death, OS will be censored at the last date the patient is known to be alive.  
9.3 Statistical and Analytical Plans   
The statistical and analytical plans presented below summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the statistical analysis pl an (SAP) . A change to the data analysis methods 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 57 of 102 described in the protocol will require a protocol amendment only if it alters a principal 
feature of the protocol . The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock . Any changes to the 
methods described in the  final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report.  
9.3.1  General Considerations   
In general, descriptive statistics will be presented that include the number of observations, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and the 
number and percentages (of non -missing) per category for categorical variables . 
Unless otherwise specified, CIs will be calculated at 2-sided 95% level . 
The 2-sided 95% exact CI using Clopper -Pearson method (Clopper 1934 ) will be calculated 
for the response rates where applicable (e.g., ORR).  
For time -to-event endpoints, the median survival time will be estimated using  the Kaplan -
Meier method; the associated 95% CI will be calculated based on the complementary log -log 
transformation (Collett 1994 ). 
Unless otherwise specified, summaries and analyses will be provided by cohort  
(i.e., platinum -treated and platinum -naïve and ci splatin -ineligible ). Summaries and analyses  
may also be provided  overall.  
9.3.1.1  Randomization and Blinding   
This is a single -arm, open -label study . No randomization will be utilized.  
9.3.1.2  Adjustments for Covariates   
No adjustment for covariates is planned in the analyses.  
9.3.1.3  Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data   
With the exception of time -to-event endpoints, no imputation will be conducted for missing 
data unless otherwise specified.  
9.3.1.4  Multicenter Studies   
There are mu ltiple centers in this study, however it is not anticipated that any center will 
accrue enough patients to warrant an analysis by center.  
9.3.1.5  Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity   
No multiple comparisons are planned and no alpha adjustment is needed because only one 
primary endpoint will be tested in this single arm study.  
9.3.1.6  Data Transformations and Derivations   
Time variables based on two dates, e.g., Start Date and End Date, will be calculated as (End 
Date – Start Date + 1) (in days) unless otherwise specified in the planned analysis section.  
Unless otherwise specified, baseline values used in all analyses will be the most recent non -
missing measurement prior to the first dose of study drug.

B EOT evaluations must be obtained before the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy , with the exception of slit lamp examinations . If EOT evaluations are completed before 30  days following the 
last study treatment, conduct a phone screen 30 –37 days following the patient’s last study treatment to ensure that no changes in AE profile have occurred.  
C Pretreatment  tumor tissue (from primary or metastat ic site) for biomarker studies must be available for submission to the sponsor prior to study treatment . A minimum of 10 freshly sectioned, unstained 
charged slides are required . Either archival tissue or pre -treatmen t fresh tumor tissue  (obtained from a fresh biopsy ) is acceptable . 
D Repeated as clinically indicated throughout the study.  
E Repeated at disease assessment timepoints if disease present at baseline, or as clinically indicated throughout the study.  
F Either serum or urine pregnancy test . Not required for Cycle 1 if baseline assessment performed within 7 days.  Repeat every month (±1 week) for 6 months after EOT.  
G Not required for Cycle 1 if baseline assessments performed within 1 day.  
H Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than objective disease progression by RECIST Version 1 .1 will continue to have physical exams (no weight collection is required),  ECOG, 
and response assessments 8 weeks (±1 week) after the previous  response assessment scan and every 8 weeks (±1 week) following the previous visit thereafter . After 1 year  on study  the frequency of 
follow -up visits and response assessments  will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±1 week) . The tumor assessments will continue  until the patient has radiologically -confirmed disease progression  per 
RECIST  as determined  by the investigator , initiates a new anticancer therapy, patient death, study closure, or withdrawal of consent , whichever comes first . 
I At least 1 week must elapse  between doses of enfortumab vedotin.  
J Responses will be confirmed with repeat scans at 4 weeks after first documentation of response (+1  week). Following confirmation scans, response assessments should continue with the previous scan 
schedule (i.e., the sc hedule should not be adjusted) . Tumor imaging should also be performed whenever disease progression is suspected.  
K Response assessment will be performed every 8 weeks (±1 week) . After 1 year on study , response assessments will be reduced to every 12 weeks ( ±1 week).  The schedule of response assessments 
should not be adjusted for dose delays/interupptions or other reasons for changes in the timing of a patient’s study activiti es; timepoints for response assessments should  be calculated from Cycle 1 
Day 1 during treatment . 
L Not required if conducted <4 weeks prior to EOT.  
M Contact patient for survival status and collection of subsequent anticancer treatment information every 8 weeks (±1 week) aft er EOT  (or 8 weeks from previous protocol visit, whichever is later)  until 
death, study closure, or withdrawal of consent , or patient is lost to follow -up, whichever occurs first . After 1 year on study  the frequency of follow -up contacts will b e reduced to every 12 weeks 
(±1 week) .  
N If HbA1c is elevated ( ≥6.5%), refer pati ent to appropriate provider during Cycle 1 for glucose management.  
O EOT slit lamp examination required for all patients who experience corneal adverse events during the study and must be performed ≥4 weeks from last dose.  
P May be collected or conducted up to 1 day prior to dosing.  Local laboratory results must be reviewed prior to study drug administration in order to determine whether to proceed with do sing or whether 
dose modification is required.

Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 71 of 102 APPENDIX  D: RECIST CRITERIA SUMM ARY (VERSION 1.1)  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  
Term Definition  
Complete response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions . Any pathological lymph nodes 
must have reduction in short axis to <10  mm. 
Partial response (PR)  A ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest s um on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) . In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm . The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression.  
Stable disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.  
Measurable lesion  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a 
minimum size of 10  mm by CT scan (CT slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm).  
A lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan to be considered measurable.  
From RECIST Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
A response (CR or PR) will be considered confirmed if the following disease assessment  (at least 
4 weeks after the initial response) still show s response (CR or PR) . In cases where the initial 
response is followed by SD, it will b e considered as confirmed if the SD is later followed by PR 
or CR . For example, if a patient had PR in week 8, SD in week 12, and PR in week 16, this PR 
will be considered as confirmed.

Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 72 of 102 APPENDIX  E: LIVER SAFETY MONI TORING AND ASSESSMEN T  
The following recommendations are from the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) Guidance 
for Industry titled “Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing  Clinical Evaluation” issued July 
2009 . 
Any patient  with an incre ase of serum aminotransferases to >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at least alanine 
aminotransferase [ ALT ], aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ], alkaline p hosphatase [ ALP ], and 
total bilirubin [ TBL]). To confirm the abnormality, t esting should be repeated within 72 hours of 
notification of the test results.  
Definition of Liver Abnormalities   
Confirmed liver abnormalities will be characterized as  Moderate and Severe : 
Moderate:  
●ALT or AST  >3 × ULN OR Total Bilirubin >2 × ULN
Severe:  
●ALT or AST  >3 × ULN AND  Total Bilirubin >2 × ULN (*See Hy’s Law Definition)
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST  >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST  >3 × ULN and International N ormalized Ratio (INR)  >1.5 (if INR testing is
applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of symptoms suggestive of liver injury
(e.g., right upper quadrant pain or tenderness ) and/or eosinoph ilia (> 5%)
The investigator may determine that  abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up. 
*Hy’s Law Definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by hepatocellular injury, without a signifi cant
obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 to 50% mortality (or transplant) . The
2 “requirements” for Hy’s Law are: 1) Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury, generally
shown by an increase in transaminase eleva tions higher 3 × ULN (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in
treated and untreated patients to be discriminating”) . 2) Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with
concurrent transaminase elevations at least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra - or extr a-hepatic bilirubin
obstruction (elevated ALP) or Gilbert’s syndrome (Temple 2006 ).
Follow -up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, physical 
Study SGN22E -001 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 9; 15-Feb-2023  
Enfortumab vedotin  Seagen  Inc. - Confidential  Page 73 of 102 examination and laboratory tests . Patients  with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should 
be fo llowed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal liver function tests ( LFTs ) should be repeated 2  to 3 times 
weekly then weekly or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued and 
the patient  is asymptomatic . 
Severe hepat ic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology, 
may be considered an important medical event and may be reported as a SAE . The sponsor  
should be contacted and informed of all patients  for whom severe hepatic liver func tion 
abnormalities possibly attributable to study drug are observed.  
To further assess abno rmal hepatic laboratory finding, it is recommended that the investigator : 
●Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Illnesses
and conditions such as hypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease t hat may
lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is
seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients , and may be associated with
fluctuating aminotransferase levels .
●Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication,
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and
special diets
●Obtain a history of exposure to environme ntal chemical agents .
●Based on the patien t’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:
○Acute viral hepatitis (A,  B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) ,
○Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease ,
○Other laboratory tests includ ing INR, direct bilirubin .
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations .
Conduct additional testing as determined by the investigator to further evaluate  possible etiology.

Management of Rash Related to Enfortumab Vedotin  
 
Added  text as follows:  
 
Enfortumab vedotin is a Nectin -4 directed antibody drug 
conjugate. Nectin -4 is a cell adhesion molecule that is 
highly expressed in urothelial carcinoma. Low to 
moderate levels of Nectin -4 are also expressed on normal 
tissues, including skin keratinocytes,  sweat glands and 
hair follicles; thus, skin reactions are anticipated events. 
As such, skin reactions are adverse events of interest in 
all clinical studies with enfortumab vedotin.  
 
A cumulative review of post -marketing safety data from 
18 Dec 2019 (the  approval date of enfortumab vedotin in 
the US) through 22 Oct 2020 identified reports of severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions in 15 patients receiving 
enfortumab vedotin, some of whom had fatal outcomes. 
These reactions occurred predominantly during the fir st 
cycle of treatment. Adverse events reported in these cases 
included SJS (5 cases), blister (3 cases), dermatitis 
bullous (3 cases), symmetrical drug -related intertriginous 
and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE; 2 cases), and 1 case 
each of dermatitis exfoliati ve, exfoliative rash, epidermal 
necrosis, oropharyngeal blistering, stomatitis, and TEN.

Subjects should be advised to contact the Investigator 
immediately if they have sign s and symptoms of skin 
reactions, oral mucosal and ocular abnormalities 
including mucositis or conjunctivitis. Starting in the first 
cycle and throughout treatment, closely monitor subjects 
for skin reactions. For mild to moderate skin reactions, 
consider appropriate treatment, such as topical 
corticosteroids and antihistamines as clinically indicated. 
For worsening Grade 2 rash or skin reactions, consider 
withholding enfortumab vedotin. For severe (Grade 3) 
rash or skin reactions or suspected SJS or TEN, w ithhold 
enfortumab vedotin and consider referral for specialized 
care. Permanently discontinue enfortumab vedotin in

In the phase 1 study (St udy ASG -22CE -13-2), rash and 
similar dermatologic AEs were common among patients 
treated with enfortumab vedotin, and were seen more 
frequently at the highest dose. Although the exact 
etiology of dermatologic toxicities associated with 
enfortumab vedotin i s unclear at this time, due to the 
expression of Nectin -4 in the skin, rash may be an on -
target toxicity. The most common dermatological AEs 
reported in ASG 22CE 13 -2 were drug eruption, rash, 
skin exfoliation, skin pigmentation disorder, and rash 
maculo -papular. Most occurred during Cycle 1, and some 
were associated with pruritus. Almost all were mild, with 
the exception of two events of rash reported as Grade 3 in

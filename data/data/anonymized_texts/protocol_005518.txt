Amendment 7 
Amendment Rationale 
This amendment is done to clarify the interim and final analysis that will be done  to assess the efficacy of 
IMCgp100 in the Phase 2 expansion phase.  In addi tion, the amendment clarif ies several changes that 
were made in prior amendments including the allowed prior therapies in the expansion phase, 
requirements for hospitalization, and further clar ification of imaging assessments, contraceptive 
requirements and the informed consent process.  This amendment incorporates the changes made in the 
local German amendment which updates the contraception requirement for women of child-bearing potential to be consistent across IMCgp100 clinical trials and to be consistent with Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group recommendations.  
Testing of all patients for HIV and hepatitis B and C infections if required by local regulations is added. An overall benefit-risk assessment has been added to the protocol rationale. 
Changes to the protocol 
1. Clarification of the Interim and Final anal yses for the Phase 2 expansion cohort  
(Sections 9.1 & 9.6.1): This amendment specifies the population and timing of the planned 
interim and final analyses. 
2. Clarify allowed prior treatments (Sections 3.2, 5.2, 9.1 & 9.6.1):  As defined in the prior 
amendment, the Phase 2 expansion cohort enrolls  patients who have received prior therapy 
for metastatic uveal melanoma.  This amendment seeks to clarify the allowable and required prior therapies. 
3. Clarify the requirements for hospitalization (Secti on 6.2): As defined in the protocol, patients 
are required to have an overnight, inpatient hospitalization for the first 3 doses of IMCgp100.  
The amendment clarifies that “inpatient hospit alization” refers to a facility with fully 
functional resuscitation facilities, 24 ho ur monitoring and physician availability. 
4. Clarified definition of confirmed irPD per modified irRECIST for patients who continue IMCgp100 therapy beyond initial PD per RECISTv1.1 
5. Clarify imaging assessments (Sections 4.6): Hepati c MRI in addition to abdominal CT has been 
required to compare MRI and CT scanning in the Phase 1 dose escalation cohorts.  Given the 
expansion of the study and to reduce the burden on patients, the imaging will be refined to allow either CT or MRI to be done for tu mor assessment and no longer require both 
modalities. 
6. Added exploratory objective (Sec tions 4.3, 4.6, and Table 4-1) to determine best response 
based on investigator assessment for subsequent anti-cancer therapy. 
7. Revised secondary endpoint (Protocol Synopsis, Sections 4 and 9.6.1): The secondary 
endpoint to determine the rate and duration of immune responses was added. 
8. Addition of biochemical assessments (LDH and CRP) before and after the initial 3 doses to explore pharmacodynamic changes after IMCg p100 administration and association with 
response.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 4 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
9. Optimization of ctDNA collection timepoints and objectives (Section 7.4): Additional time 
points were added for ctDNA collection to a ssess pharmacodynamic changes after treatment 
as well as to evaluate for predicto rs of resistance to treatment. 
10. Removal of screening window for HLA testing. Because HLA testing is a genetic test and does 
not change with time, the window of 120 days has been removed. 
11. Change to exclusion criterion #19 and addition of Section 6.6 on contraception requirements (Section 5.3 and Section 6): Contraception requirement for women of child-bearing potential 
was changed to be consistent across IMCgp100 clinic al trials and to be consistent with Clinical 
Trial Facilitation Group recommendations. 
12. Update of exclusion criteria #7 and #8 to add testing for HIV and Hepatitis B and C as per local 
regulations (Section 5.3):  Screening for HIV and Hepatitis B and C will be done if required by 
local regulations. 
13. Addition of Section 2.4 regarding the overall benefit-risk assessment 
14. Inclusion of Table 7-3 to clarify frequency of vital signs. 
15. Modification of Section 11.3 to harmonize the informed consent procedures with inclusion 
criterion #2 and clarify the informed consent process. 
16. Increased duration of safety follow up period (S ections 3.3, 7.2.3, 7.2.5, 8.1, 8.5, 9.1, & 9.6.2.1 
as well as Table 7.1) to provide further safety  information and be consistent across IMCgp100 
clinical trials   
17. Clerical Changes are made throughout the protocol to improve clarity.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 6 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
Amendment 6 
Amendment Rationale 
This amendment transitions the dose expansion cohort  component of the study, designed to explore the 
recommended Phase 2 dose that was defined in the Phase 1 testing of the intra-patient escalation regimen 
(RP2D-IE, 68 mcg) to more formal Phase 2 testing in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma who are 
treated in the second or third line setting in this trial (Amendment 6, Protocol version 7.0, 15 December 2017).  
Tumor responses have been observed in the preliminary dose escalation cohorts of this study and these 
responses have been associated with long duration of response as reported recently (Sato, 2017;  
Carvajal, 2017). Based on the observation of durable partial responses and minor responses (defined as a 
tumor response where the sum of the longest diameters [SLD] of target lesions is  reduced by 10%–to 29%) 
in the dose escalation cohorts of this study, the dose expansion cohort in the tria l is modified to provide 
a formal analysis of the anti-tumor efficacy in this  patient population using the objective response rate 
(ORR) by independent review as the primary efficacy endpoint in this portion of the study. Two separate 
expansion cohorts in this study are defined based on prior therapy:   
1. Cohort A:  Patients will have experienced disease progression with 1 systemic treatment 
regimen containing a checkpoint inhibitor, including either a CTLA4 inhibitor (ipilimumab or 
tremelimumab) and/or a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Any prior liver-directed therapy (LDT) is 
acceptable in this cohort.  
2. Cohort B:  Patients will have experienced disease progression with 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy, including up to 1 prior line of LDT. LDT will be considered a line of therapy for enrolling this 
cohort. Prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy is acceptable but not required in this cohort. 
Given the formal efficacy measures implemented in  this dose expansion cohort, the study will be 
designated as a Phase 1/2 to reflect this new endpoint.  
The pattern of clinical response to immunotherapeuti c agents differs from that observed with cytotoxic 
therapies. There is accumulating evidence that a proportion of patients with advanced melanoma treated 
with immunotherapy agents, including IMCgp100, may develop initial radiographic progression of the 
tumor before demonstrating meaningful clinical benefit. This delayed response to therapy or immune-
mediated tumor flare (pseudo-progression) is followed by prolonged periods of disease stabilization in 
some patients or more rarely, objective tumor responses. To allow patients to continue therapy beyond an initial assessment of pr ogressive disease according to RECISTv1. 1, this amendment provides additional 
detail delineating criteria for treatment beyond progressi on (per modified irRECIST). Patients must meet 
specific clinical criteria and provide additional in formed consent to continue therapy beyond an initial 
assessment of disease progression. If disease progression is subsequently confirmed per modified 
irRECIST, treatment must be discontinued.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 7 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
This amendment removes screening ophthalmologic and audiology assessments. Prior to initiation of the 
IMCgp100 Phase 1 investigation, the eye and ear were identified as potential target organs for toxicity, 
based on expression of the antigen in these target tissues. To date, and across the IMCgp100 development 
program, there have been no clinically significant ad verse events involving vision and/or hearing (please 
refer to the most recent IMCgp 100 Investigator’s Brochure for de tails). This amendment removes 
screening ophthalmologic and audiology assessments and retains these assessments in the setting of 
treatment-emergent toxicity.  
 
  
Changes to the Protocol 
1. Increased the sample size of the Phase 2 expans ion cohorts (from approximately 40 patients to 
approximately 150 patients) and added the primary endpoint of the single-arm Phase 2 expansion 
cohort of ORR assessed by independent central review based on RECISTv1.1  
2. Clarified the criteria for treatment beyond progression and treatment discontinuation in the 
circumstance of treatment beyond progression using modified irRECIST. The rationale for treatment beyond progression is provided 
3.  
 
4. Removed screening ophthalmologic exam and audiologic assessment 
5. A window for the infusion time is added by extending the acceptable infusion time from 15 minutes to 15–20 minutes 
6. Added additional guidance for the management  of treatment-related toxicity including 
hypotension and cytokine release events (that are generally observed 2–24 hours after the dose 
of IMCgp100), rash, and pruritus 
7. Clarified that anti-tumor response as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRECIST) is an exploratory endpoint 
8. Clarified that an Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review the safety data from the 
Phase 2 expansion cohorts on an ongoing basis and will also review both efficacy and safety after 
approximately 75 patients have been recruited to  Cohort B to monitor the benefit-risk profile 
9. Clarified tumor biopsy requirements in the Phase 1and Phase 2 cohorts 
10. Corrected typographical errors and inserted minor clarifications throughout to improve readability and content presentation

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 9 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
Amendment 5 
Amendment Rationale  
This amendment will update the nomenclature of th e dose levels and the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of IMCgp100 utilizing the intra-patient escalati on (Amendment 5, protocol version 6.0, dated 11 
April 2017). No changes are made in the dose preparatio n guidance; thus, there is no change in the actual 
doses administered in this study. Recent informatio n described below indicates that the actual doses 
administered and defined in this Phase 1 study are more accurately defined and lower than the original 
protocol-specified dose levels.  
Individual doses of IMCgp100 are prepared from a conc entrated, frozen stock solution (0.5 mg/mL) by a 
2-step dilution procedure in the drug preparation guidelines, requiring dilution of approximately 2500-
fold to accurately achieve the microgram (mcg) doses. The dilution procedure is described in the Pharmacy 
Handling Instructions, provided for each dose level administered, e.g., 20 mcg and 30 mcg. The dilution 
procedure utilizes 2 saline infusion bags; the first is th e dilution bag (a labelled 50 mL bag) and the second 
is the actual infusion bag (100 mL). 
The protocol-specified doses in this study were in tentionally determined before the study began to 
represent the maximum theoretical dose that could be  prepared and administered based on the labelled 
fill volumes of the dilution bags (range of 54–64 mL). The Pharmacy Handling Instructions are authored 
using the lowest potential dilution bag volumes as  the start volume and thus, the highest initial 
concentrations of IMCgp100 at diluti on step 1 to calculate doses. Se tting the protocol-specified dose 
based on the maximum theoretical dose ensured that no patients received actual doses with IMCgp100 
quantities above the protocol-specified dose. Howeve r, newly available empirical data demonstrate that 
although there is a labelled range of bag volumes (54–64 mL per packaging), there exists a narrow distribution of the actual fill volumes at the first dilution step (generally 57–59 mL). Thus, the doses 
actually prepared and administered in this study were accurate and represented a lower point estimate than stated in the original protocol.  
Based on the 2-step dilution procedure used to pr epare IMCgp100 doses and considering the conservative 
approach to the variance in the fill range for the primary dilution bag, the protocol-specified doses for the 
higher dose cohorts in the IMCgp100-102 trial and the final RP2D were over-estimates of the actual 
administered dose. Based on the available empirical evidence of dilution bag fill volumes (dilution step 1), it is important to correct the over-estimate of the ac tual dose administered (e.g., update to the RP2D from 
75 mcg to 68 mcg). The 68-mcg dose level is the most ac curate within the range produced by the dilution 
procedure and is the RP2D in this study. Doses of 75 mcg and 80 mcg have a differential of approximately 
7 mcg based on the actual bag volumes, and doses be low 75 mcg have an approximate 6 mcg differential. 
Based on the limited impact at the lower doses (20 mcg and 30 mcg doses) no change in these protocol-specified doses is warranted.  
As safety data are collected in this study, the mana gement guidance is updated for adverse events, based 
on the collective experience of the principal investigat ors in this study including updates of the events of 
cytokine release syndrome and hypotension.

, this trial will on ly enroll patients with expression of the HLA-A*0201 allele determined 
centrally.  
In addition, this amendment will implement several changes principally related to the recommended 
Phase 2 dose intra-patient escalation (RP2D-IE) expans ion cohort. Given the encouraging emerging clinical 
safety and efficacy data with IMCgp100 in uveal melanoma (UM) where a strong signal of disease stabilization has been observed in early dosing cohort s in this study, the size of the RP2D-IE expansion 
cohort increased from 20 to 40 patients. This increase in sample size will provide a larger safety dataset 
and more robust point estimate of overall survival in  the selected patient population. This cohort will 
enroll a second line population following disease progre ssion a checkpoint inhibitor, including inhibitors 
of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 to assess the safety and efficacy of IMCgp100 following prior immunotherapy to inform future development in this setting. An independent central review of imaging assessments will be performed in this Phase 2 dose expansion cohort. As  a substantial majority of patients with metastatic 
UM harbor hepatic metastases, and these metastatic le sions can be difficult to assess even with current 
high resolution imaging techniques, the central revi ew is designed to assess the utility of computed 
tomography versus magnetic reso nance imaging in imaging of hepatic metastases and provide cross-
validation of the investigator-reported tumor responses.  
Finally, further translational work is incorporated into the Phase 2 RP2D-IE cohort in this study. The 
landscape of somatic genetic mutations in UM differs significantly from cutaneous melanoma. Analysis of 
circulating tumor DNA is an emerging platform tech nology that detects tumor-derived somatic mutations 
from the peripheral blood on an individual patient and allows for longitudinal evaluation of these 
mutations during the course of treatment. Early response markers of mutation load in the circulation will 
be studied in the RP2D-IE expansion cohort. These mark ers will be studied to determine if either specific 
somatic mutations present at Baseline or if early changes in mutation load in the peripheral circulation is predictive of patients with favorable response to IMCgp100.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 13 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
Amendment 3  
Amendment Rationale 
This amendment will implement a change in the definition of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) with respect to 
the recent observations of transient elevations of he patic transaminases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), in patients with uveal melanoma (UM) in the 2 ongoing Phase 1 
trials with IMCgp100, the first-in-human (FIH) study (IMCgp100-01) and this UM Phase 1 study 
(Amendment dated 23 May 2016). In these 2 studies, 3 patients with UM and hepatic metastases 
experienced transient grade 2 (n=2) and grade 3 (n=1) elevations of ALT and AST at the first dose of IMCgp100 that resolved within days of dosing and did not recur with rechallenge. In each of the 3 patients with grade 2–3 elevations, the next dose was not delaye d due to the liver function test (LFT) changes. In 
addition, 1 patient with extensive hepatic metastases treated in the FIH study experienced a grade 4 
elevation of hepatic transaminases with the first dose that resolved over a longer time course than the 3 
transient grade 2 and 3 elevations discussed above. This patient with the grade 4 LFT elevations was 
rechallenged with a second dose of IMCgp100 with no recurrence of LFT elevations. Based on the 
observation of multiple patients with UM and hepa tic metastases with transient and non-dose limiting 
elevations of ALT and/or AST, the DLT criterion for elevations in ALT and AST has been modified to exclude 
patients with transient grade 3 elevations in ALT and/or AST that are associated with normal bilirubin and 
where the elevated ALT and/or AST resolves to grade 1 or lower within 72 hours. Grade 4 elevations in 
ALT and/or AST, regardless of time course, will remain as DLTs.  
In this Phase 1 study (IMCgp100-102), 1 patient wi th a history of adrenal insufficiency developed 
hypotension approximately 24 hours following the sixt h dose of IMCgp100. Base d on the observation of 
the immune-related infusion toxicity in patients with UM, combined with the increased risk for 
hypotension in patients with adrenal insufficiency due to an inability to mount a stress cortisol response 
in the setting of treatment with IMCgp100, this amendment will now ex clude all patients with adrenal 
insufficiency. Similarly, patients receiving chronic cort icosteroid therapy for any reason are also excluded 
due to the potential dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in mediating response to 
stress.  
Changes to the Protocol 
 Implemented new DLT criterion for transient grade 3 ALT and/or AST elevations to be excluded 
from DLT provided these events are not associated with change in bilirubin and resolve to grade 
1 or lower within 72 hours 
 Changed exclusion criterion number 14 to exclude any patient with a history of adrenal insufficiency or any patient requiring long-term corticosteroid treatment  
 The definition of lost to follow up is clarified in Section 7.2.6 
 Corrected typographical errors and inserted minor clarifications throughout to improve readability and content presentation

Amendment 2  
Amendment Rationale 
This amendment will implement monitoring changes for the event of hypotension in the intra-patient 
dose escalation regimen (Amendment dated 12 January 2016). These monitoring changes are in response to infusion related toxicity with associated hypotens ion that has been observed in the ongoing first-in-
human Phase 1 study of IMCgp100 in metastat ic melanoma (study number IMCgp100-01).  
Patients with the diagnosis of uveal melanoma have been treated with IMCgp100 in the recommended Phase 2 dose expansion cohort in the Phase 1 study (IMCgp100-01) and have expe rienced infusion-related 
toxicity at Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) or Cycle 1 Day 8 (C1D 8), including pyrexia, facial edema, and hypotension. 
Based on review of the clinical cases of hypotension, additional monitoring procedures are implemented here to screen all patients for risk of hypote nsion during the intra-patient dose escalation.  
Updates have been made to the monitoring for patien ts during the first weeks of dosing with IMCgp100. 
Patients will be monitored overnight as an in-patient for each of the first 3 doses of IMCgp100 during the 
intra-patient escalation at C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15. In-patient observation for C1D22 will be mandatory if 
the patient experienced infusion toxicity involving NCI CTCAE grade 2 or greater hypotension requiring 
medical intervention at the previous dose on C1D15.  
Changes to the Protocol 
1. Implemented new monitoring strategy for occurrence of hypotension in the study. Mandatory 
hospitalization for the C1D8 dose is implemented. This hospitalization is in addition to the 
previous mandatory inpatient observations for the C1D1 and C1D15 doses. (Section 6.2 and 
Section 7.3.4)  
2. Guidance for inpatient monitoring for the C1D22 dose are provided and based upon the individual 
patient’s tolerability of the first 3 dose s (C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15; Section 6.2) 
3. Revised safety data for IMCgp100-01 study to the current Investigator’s Br ochure (Ed 7, issued 17 
December 2015) and to reflect re cent infusion-related toxicity events of grade 2 or greater 
hypotension 
4. Revised exclusion criteria to reflect the approp riate methods of highly effective contraception

human Phase 1 study of IMCgp100 in metastat ic melanoma (study number IMCgp100-01).  
Patients with the diagnosis of uveal melanoma (UM) have been treated with IMCgp100 in the 
recommended Phase 2 dose expansion cohort in the Phase 1 study (I MCgp100-01) and have experienced 
infusion-related toxicity at Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) or Cycle 1 Day 8 (C1D8), including pyrexia, facial edema, 
and hypotension. Based on these observations in the Phase 1 study, and considering that (1) UM is defined 
with a higher expression of the antigen (gp100), and (2) the preclinical observation (described in the 
protocol below) of potentially enha nced sensitivity of UM cells to IMCgp100, the doses in this Phase 1 
study in the first 2 weeks will be reduced further in all patients in this study.  
The first doses administered as part of this intra-patient escalation regimen at C1D1 and C1D8 in this 
dosing regimen will be reduced from the previous dose of 40 mcg to 20 mcg (at C1D1) and 30 mcg (at 
C1D8) in all patients treated as part of this study to  mitigate the potential for infusion toxicity associated 
with hypotension. Dose escalation will  then proceed at C1D15 as planned.  
Changes to the Protocol 
1. Implemented dosing changes in the intra-patient dose escalation regimen with reduction of 
the starting dose on C1D1 to 20 mcg and C1D8 to 30 mcg 
2. Added large disease burden in the liver as an exclusion criterion in the dose escalation portion 
of the study (patients with replacement of > 60%  of the liver with disease are excluded), due 
to the possibility of hepatic toxicity 
3. Sponsor emergency contact information has been updated 
4. Added an immunogenicity sample at C1D8 
5. Corrected typographical errors and inserted minor clarifications throughout to improve 
readability and content presentation

Protocol Synopsis 
Study Number IMCgp100-102 
Title  A Phase 1/2, Open-label, Multi-center Study of the Safety and Efficacy 
of IMCgp100 using the Intra-patient Escalation Dosing Regimen in Patients with Advanced Uveal Melanoma 
Brief Title Phase 1/2 Study of the Intra-patient Escalation Dosing Regimen 
Sponsor and  
Clinical Phase Immunocore, Ltd. 
Phase 1/2 
Investigational Agents IMCgp100  
Study Type Interventional 
Study Purpose and 
Rationale  IMCgp100-102 is a Phase 1/2 study of  the weekly (QW) intra-patient 
escalation dose regimen with IMCgp100 as a single agent in patients 
with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). The Phase 1 testing of this 
regimen will aim to achieve a higher exposure and maximal plasma concentration of IMCgp100 after do ses at Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) and 
thereafter than the exposures achi evable at the recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) of the fixed QW do se of 50 mcg (RP2D-QW) without 
additional toxicity. Phase 1 testing will follow the standard 3+3 design 
with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as the endpoint and identification of the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the RP2D for the intra-patient escalation regimen (RP2D-IE). 
In the Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH ) study of IMCgp100 in advanced 
melanoma, a dose escalation was conducted with IMCgp100 
administered on a QW basis. Results of this study have been presented 
(Middleton, 2015).  In this st udy, the MTD when IMCgp100 is 
administered on a QW basis was determined to be 600 ng/kg. With a 
data cut off of 18 August 2015, it was observed that DLT of grade 3 (n=3) and 4 (n=1) hypotension in the QW do sing cohort was observed with the 
first or second dose in this trial. Based on observed safety and the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile a flat dosing regimen was implemented 
across the program and the RP2D of the weekly schedule (RP2D-QW) was identified as 50 mcg QW. This dose and regimen have been adjusted based on emerging safety in the trial and dosing adjustments were implemented in the FIH QW dosing expansion cohort (IMCgp100-01, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 28 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
In this same FIH study, several patients with mUM were treated in the 
QW dosing regimen at the MTD dose level (600 ng/kg) and at the dose 
level above MTD, 900 ng/kg (n=5, data cut off 18 August 2015). Based on review of the observed objectiv e responses in the Phase 1 trial in 
uveal melanoma (UM) as well as objective responses noted in cutaneous melanoma, it was noted that patients with larger diameters of disease burden (both cutaneous and UM) experienced objective tumor 
responses at the higher overall exposures to IMCgp100.  
The current study of the intra-patient dose escalation regimen is based 
on 2 observations in the clinic:  (1) objective partial and minor tumor responses in patients with higher tumor burdens were generally observed at the higher absolute doses in the Phase 1 trial, and (2) the occurrences of more severe toxicity leading to dose limitation were 
limited to the first 2 weeks of dosing on C1D1 and C1D8. Based on these 
2 observations, it is hypothesized that  an increased exposure to drug in 
the weeks following the occurrence of the more severe toxicity (at the first 2 doses) may lead to an enhanced  tumor response in a setting of an 
unfavorable tumor microenvironment such as UM. 
Primary Objectives Phase 1 Dose Escalation:  The primary objective is to identify the MTD and/or the RP2D of IMCgp100 in the intra-patient dose escalation regimen (RP2D-IE). 
Phase 2 Dose Expansion:  The primary objective is to estimate the 
objective response rate by independent central review (ICR) based on 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors version 1.1 (RECISTv1.1) in 
patients with advanced UM who are treated with the RP2D-IE of IMCgp100.  
Secondary Objectives  To characterize the safety and tolerability of IMCgp100 in the intra-patient dose escalation regimen 
 To characterize the PK profile of single-agent IMCgp100 in the intra-patient dose escalation regimen 
 To assess the anti-tumor efficacy of IMCgp100 with the parameters 
of objective response rate (Phase 1), overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), time to response, and the duration of response (DOR).   
 To evaluate the incidence of anti-IMCgp100 antibody formation 
following multiple infusions of IMCgp100 in the intra-patient dose escalation regimen 
 To determine the rate and duration of minor responses (defined as tumor response with a reduction in the sum of longest diameters of

10%–29%) and immune responses (as assessed by area under the 
tumor response curves [AUC]) 
Study Design This is a Phase I12 study of IMCgp 100 administered on a QW basis with 
an intra-patient escalation dosing regimen. The intra-patient escalation 
occurs at the third QW dose on C1D 15. According to this regimen, all 
patients in the trial will receive 2 QW doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level 
below the identified RP2D-QW, and then a dose escalation will 
commence at the third QW dose at C1D15 with the goal to achieve a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for the RP2D-QW. In this dosing regimen, each patient will undergo a fixed intra-patient dose escalation (fixed dosing of 20 mcg at C1D1 and 30 mcg at C1D8), followed by the dose escalation beginning at C1D15. 
Patients will continue to receive the same escalated dose from C1D15 
and thereafter. The dose escalati on will identify the RP2D-IE. 
The Phase 1 portion of the study will be a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. After the dose escalation portion is complete and the MTD or the RP2D-IE is identified, the Phase 2 expansion cohorts in mUM will be

discontinuation due to progressive disease [PD] as per 
RECISTv.1.1/modified irRECIST).  
Phase 2:  For the expansion cohorts only, an independent central review 
(ICR) will be used for the analysis of objective response rate and all other tumor-related endpoints based on RECIST v.1.1 and irRECIST. Investigator assessment data will be used for treatment decision making 
during the study. 
PFS will be assessed using RECIST v.1.1. Patients experiencing PD per 
RECIST v.1.1 criteria may consent to co ntinue to be treated according to 
irRECIST guidelines until confirmed, unequivocal progression is documented via modified irRECIST. Progression based on modified irRECIST will be assessed as  an exploratory endpoint. 
Imaging per CT or MRI will be performed at baseline and scheduled follow-up timepoints- additional details are outlined in Section 7.3.1 . 
Safety Assessments Safety will be monitored by assessing physical examination, vital signs, 
body height and weight, performance status, hematology, chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, thyroid fu nction, pregnancy, ECG, cytokine 
testing, as well as collecting of the adverse events at every visit.

1 BACKGROUND 
 Overview of Disease Setting 
Melanoma arises from pigment containing cells (m elanocytes) present in the skin, eye, and mucus 
membranes. Melanoma most frequently occurs in the skin; however, ocular melanoma arises from 
pigmented cells in the eye. The primary cause of melanoma is thought to be radiation-induced DNA 
damage from ultraviolet light exposure. Melanoma is the most deadly of skin cancers. Globally, in 2012, 
melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths (Cancer Research UK). Cutaneous 
and uveal melanoma (UM) is more common in men th an women. UM is a rare type of melanoma where 
the incidence has ranged from 5.3 to 10.9 cases pe r million (Singh, 2011). Despite its rare incidence rate 
(representing approximately 3% of melanoma cases, approximately 4,000 cases globally per year), UM is 
the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy of the adult eye (85%) (Patel, 2011; Maio, 2013). UM 
is an extremely malignant neoplasm that affects th e vascular layers of the eye (iris, ciliary body, and 
choroid) (Maio, 2013). The majority of UM cases in th e United States occur in the Caucasian population 
(Andreoli, 2015). UM is  biologically distinct from cu taneous melanoma with differences in the mutational 
landscape, where BRAF  and NRAS  mutations dominate the landscape in cutaneous melanoma and 
mutations in G protein coupled receptors, q  polypeptide ( GNAQ ) and alpha 11 ( GNA11), dominate in UM 
(Shoustari, 2014). In addition, the mo de of spread of disease is distinct between the 2 disease settings, 
with hematogenous spread of uveal versus lymphatic spread in cutaneous, leading to the different 
patterns of metastatic disease with primary liver meta stases in UM, contrasted with visceral, bone, and 
brain metastases predominant in cutaneou s melanoma (Dunavoelgyi, 2011; Yu, 2014).  
Local therapy approaches in UM generally rely on ra diation and surgical enucleation; however, despite 
adequate local therapy, UM metastases are very commo n and develop in 50% of patients with the liver 
being the predominant metastatic si te (90%) (Carvajal, 2014). UM has also  been shown to spread to the 
lungs, bones, and skin (Carvajal, 2014; Maio, 2013). The American Joint Com mittee on Cancer Tumor-
Node-Metastasis staging system is used for UM (Edg e, 2010) and represents 1 aspect of the estimated 
prognosis. Molecular markers such as monosomy 3 are used to guide prognosis and risk of metastasis in 
addition to classic histol ogy such as the presence of spindle ve rsus epithelioid (Campbell, 1998). Once 
patients have developed metastatic disease, the prognosis and outcomes are very poor with a median 
survival of less than 12 months, an d for those with liver metastases, the median survival is approximately 
6 months (Singh, 2011). Despit e much investigation of me tastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) in the clinic, to 
date, no systemic therapy has improved survival and no effective therapy has b een achieved (Maio, 2013; 
Carvajal, 2014; Luke, 2013; Zimmer, 2015). 
UM has a poor response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiotherapy and therapies for cutaneous 
melanoma have had little impact in the treatment of UM (e.g., BRAF inhibitors, due to the absence of the 
target mutation in UM; Buder, 2013). UM has been char acterized by specific driver mutations in guanine 
nucleotide binding protein (G protein), GNAQ  or GNA11  leading to the downstream activation of multiple 
signaling nodes, including mitogen-activated protein ki nase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kin ase)/protein kinase B (Akt), protein kinase C, and Yes-associated

protein (Shoustari, 2014; Yu, 2014). Treatments for mUM can be divided into (1) liver-directed treatments; 
such as surgical resection, abla tion, radiation, hepatic arterial chemoinfusion; and (2) systemic 
treatments; such as chemotherapy (anti-neoplastic dr ugs used alone or in combinations), immunotherapy 
(interferon, interleukin-2, programmed death-1 (PD- 1) inhibition and ipilimumab), anti-angiogenetic 
drugs, and recently the targeted agents such as ME K and Akt inhibitors. The targeted agents are applied 
based on the high percentage of patients’ tumors harboring GNAQ  or GNA11  mutations; however, these 
therapies have not been as effective as other targeted  agents in the BRAF muta tion subset (Buder, 2013).  
Recent evidence suggests that immunotherapy for UM is only marginally more effective than cytotoxic 
therapy, where the estimates of the response rate of dacarbazine are between 0–5%. Response rates with 
ipilimumab in this setting range from 0–8% across multiple studies (Maio, 2013; Luke, 2013; Zimmer, 
2015; Carvajal, 2014). The response to new immunotherapy approaches in th e uveal subset is significantly 
diminished compared to that for cutaneous melanoma , possibly due to the low mutational burden of UM 
compared to that of cutaneous melanoma (Furney, 2014) . The tumor microenvironment of UM is 
characterized by a uniquely suppressive environment with the presence of M2 macrophages and 
immature myeloid cells along with strong FoxP3 expr ession and CD8+ T cells (Bronkhorst, 2012). Both 
phenotypes are associated with a distinctly immune suppressive environment and this immune infiltrate is associated with monosomy 3 in UM and poor prognosis (Maat, 2008; Bronkhorst, 2011). The 
suppressive environment and lack of activity of ch eckpoint inhibition suggests that mobilization of 
activated T cells with a tumor-specific focus may have an ti-tumor activity in this disease setting. With the 
wide and strong expression of gp100 in UM, the application of a redirected T cell approach to gp100 in this setting may have e nhanced anti-tumor activity (Van Dinten, 2005). Furthermore, with the 
immunologically privileged site of UM, immunotherap y represents a promising treatment approach for 
this devastating and life- threatening condition (Buder, 2013; Woodman, 2012). 
 Overview of IMCgp100 
IMCgp100 is a 77 kDa bi-specific protein with targeting and effector moieties which is manufactured in 
Escherichia coli (E coli) . The targeting portion of IMCgp100 (the T cell receptor) functions to bind to the 
gp100 antigen as presented by major histocompatibility complex Cla ss I on the surface of melanoma cells. 
The targeted gp100 peptide is presente d by a subset of the population th at express a specific variant of 
the major histocompatibility complex Class I complex known as human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2). 
This variant is carried by approx imately 50% of the population in the Western World (Middleton, 2003). 
The effector function (anti-cluster of differentiation 3 [anti-CD3]) works by binding and activating T cells 
via cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3). These T cells can be tumor specific cells which are already resident in the tumor (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL]), bu t circulating polyclonal T cells may also be activated 
as they traffic through the tumor as part of the no rmal blood supply. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both 
activated by IMCgp100 triggering cytolytic activity associated wi th release of immune mediators 
potentially resulting in a cascade of anti-tumor immu ne effector mechanisms. T cell proliferation studies 
on CD8 T cell subtypes have shown that effector memory, central memory, and naïve cells all respond to IMCgp100 stimulation as well as CD4+ T cells. Memory T cell activation following exposure to IMCgp100

IMCgp100 is a biologic with dual effector and targeting ends. The targeting end is an affinity enhanced soluble T cell 
receptor recognizing the gp100 antigen and the effector end is an anti-CD binding domain.  
 Non-clinical Experience with IMCgp100 
 Preclinical Pharmacology Summary 
IMCgp100 has been shown to induce the full repertoire of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation events 
in a dose-dependent manner in vitro when combined with target melanoma cells. This activation is evident at concentrations as low as  1 picomolar (pM) and activity is  maximal at a concentration of 1 
nanomolar (nM) irrespective of whether isolated CD8 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are used as the effector cells. Furthermore, maximal killing effects may require up to a few days exposure with cancer cells. The activation of CD4 T cells has also been demonstrated at similar concentrations and 
with similar kinetics. Such activation would be expected to augment the CTL mediated immune response through the recruitment of other inflammatory cells.  
Using PBMCs from melanoma patients, IMCgp100 has been shown to augment an already present anti-
tumoral response. Finally, the tumor infiltrating T cells that would be the first line of attack in a clinical situation would be expected to be outnumbered by melanoma targets. Thus, it has been shown that a 
single T cell is capable of serial killing in vitro. These data demonstr ate that IMCgp100 is a potent tumor-
killing agent.

 Non-clinical Toxicology Summary 
Both the gp100-specific soluble T ce ll receptor and the CD3 targeting ends of IMCgp100 have been 
demonstrated to have high spec ificity for the human HLA-A2-gp100 peptide complex and human CD3. 
Therefore, binding and activation of IMCgp100 canno t be demonstrated in non-human primates, which 
show a relatively high degree of sequence homology to human CD3. In addition, both the T cell receptor 
targeting end and CD3 activation arm do not interact  at any level in any ot her species. Given the 
limitations in binding of IMCgp100 and activation of any T cell subsets in any standard toxicology species, 
there is no relevant toxicology spec ies in which IMCgp100 can be tested.

Tissue cross-reactivity studies with IMCgp 100 and published gp100 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
demonstrate gp100 expression in human melanocytes, and expression levels have been demonstrated 
directly in the retina, melanocytes, the substantia nigra, and the thymus (Takase, 2005; Wagner, 1997). 
Other tissues that are known to contain melanocytes, but to our knowledge have not been directly tested 
for gp100 expression, include the iris, the inner ear, and the choroid plexus of the brain. 
In the absence of a relevant toxicology species, IM Cgp100 was investigated for potential reactivity to 
normal tissues other than target melanoma tissue in  vitro. IMCgp100 could redirect T cell activity to 
normal cells that are known to express gp100; however, higher concentrat ions of IMCgp100 were 
required to elicit an effect in th ese normal tissue cells indicating that there may be a therapeutic window 
between a dose of drug required to effect melano ma cells and that which may cause potential organ 
specific toxicity. These assays were also used to de termine a minimal anticipated biological effect level, 
and the starting dose for the first IMCgp100 dose escalation study. Other assays designed to assess unexpected reactivity of both the T cell receptor and the anti-CD3 were entirely negative.  
 Clinical Program and Safety Summary 
IMCgp100 is being studied in an ongoing first-in- human (FIH), open-label, dose escalation study 
(IMCgp100-01). Patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled into 2 sepa rate dose escalation cohorts:  
(1) a weekly (QW) dosing regimen cohort (Arm 1), a nd (2) a daily (QD) dose x 4 days repeated every 3 
weeks dosing regimen cohort (Arm 2). The study is designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMCgp100 in the 2 repeat dosing re gimens:  (1) QW dosing 
(the RP2D-QW) and (2) daily dosi ng x 4 days (the RP2D-QD).  
 Weekly Dosing:  Dose Escalation Results 
The QW dosing regimen dose escalation included dose levels from 5 ng/kg up to 900 ng/kg and the MTD 
for this dosing regimen was identified at 600 ng/kg QW (Middleton, 2015). In the re view of the safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) data for the QW dosing regimen, the RP2D-QW was initially identified as a flat dose 
of 50 mcg administered intravenously (IV) on a QW basis;

 Suppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Uveal Melanoma 
In general, cutaneous melanoma is thought to be 1 of the more immunogenic tumors with significant 
activity observed with immunotherapy options and the first drug approvals in this space (e.g., ipilimumab and nivolumab [Bristol Meyers Squibb] and pembroliz umab [Merck]). In contrast, the biology of UM 
suggests potent immunosuppressive properties, unlike the cutaneous subset with a corresponding lack of 
activity with the checkpoint inhibi tors (Maio, 2013; Luke, 2013; Zimmer, 2015 ). Ironically, T cell infiltration 
in UM is predictive of poor survival. In the preclini cal setting, there are 2 main hypotheses to explain the 
immunosuppressive nature of UM and none appear s mutually exclusive:  (1) T cell extrinsic 
immunosuppression due to negative myeloid influences with high IL-10, NKT activity with M2 wound 
healing phenotype of macrophages possessing potent  immunosuppressive capabilities (Sadegh, 2015; Vu, 
2013); and (2) T lymphocyte intrinsi c immunosuppression with enhanced  regulatory T cell development 
and indoleamine 2-3 dioxygenase expression by existing  T cell responses in the setting of metastases as 
opposed to the primary lesions (Verbik, 1997; Whelchel, 1993; Mougiakokos, 2010; Lagouros, 2009). 
Preclinical studies suggest that the development of  melanoma liver metastases is associated with 
upregulation of IL-10 in the liver and an elevated expression of IL-10 receptor on liver natural killer cells.

This impairment of liver natural killer activity is natu ral killer T cell-dependent and only occurs in hosts 
with melanoma liver metastases. 
 Rationale for Study Design 
IMCgp100-102 is a Phase 1/2 study of the QW intra-patient escalation dose re gimen with IMCgp100 as a 
single agent in patients with mUM.  The Phase 1 testing of this regimen will aim to achieve a higher 
exposure and C max of IMCgp100 after doses at Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) and thereafter  than the exposures 
achievable at the RP2D of the fi xed 50 mcg RP2D-QW without additional toxicity. Phase 1 testing will 
follow the standard 3+3 design with DLT as the endpoint and identification of the MTD and/or the RP2D for the Phase 2 intra-patient escalation regimen (RP2D-IE).  
Once the appropriate dose for Phase 2 is identified (RP2D-IE), the Phase 2 expansion cohorts in UM will 
begin. Cohort A will recruit approximately 20 patients to further characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, 
and anti-tumor response of IMCgp100  in patients following therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor and any 
potential liver-directed therapy (LDT). Cohort B will recruit approximately 130 patients to further 
characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, and anti-tum or response of IMCgp100 in patients who have been 
previously treated with 1 or 2 prior lines of ther apy in the metastatic or advanced setting, including 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy and up  to a single line of local, LDT.Prior checkpoint 
inhibitor is acceptable in Cohort B but is not required.  
Additional details on Phase 2 Expansion cohorts are provided in Section 3.2  and Section 5.2 . 
These cohorts will provide homogenous populations in which to assess safety and anti-tumor efficacy with 
the goal to inform subsequent  development of IMCgp100.

 Overall Benefit-Risk Assessment 
A significant degree of unmet need exists in the setting of advanced UM. Compared to standard treatments utilized in cutaneous melanoma, no treatments have consistently demonstrated a survival 
benefit in UM clinical studies, including dacarbazine and immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition (e.g., 
ipilimumab or pembrolizumab). IMCgp 100 has an acceptable tolerabilit y profile, with generally mild-to-
moderate toxicity beyond the first 2 doses where manageable immune-based toxicities have been 
observed (Middleton, 2016). The study is designed to minimize potentia l risks through intensive patient 
monitoring and frequent safety assessments based upon available early phase clinical safety data for 
IMCgp100. The preliminary, robust clinical activity of  IMCgp100 in the setting of advanced UM, combined 
with the lack of any therapies demonstrating a survival benefit in this indication supports the further 
development of IMCgp100 in patients with advanced UM.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
 Description of Study Design and Populations 
This is a Phase 1/2 study of IMCgp100 administered on a QW basis with an intra-patient escalation dosing 
regimen. The intra-patient escalation occurs at the thir d weekly dose on C1D15. According to this regimen, 
all patients in the trial will receive 2 QW doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level below the identified RP2D-
QW, and then a dose escalation will commence at the th ird weekly dose at C1D15 with the goal to achieve 
a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for the straight QW dosing regimen 
(RP2D-QW). The dose escalation will identify the RP2D-IE. (Intra-patient dose escalation regimen 
schematic, see Figure 3-1 ). 
Phase 1:  Dose Escalation 
  
 
  
 
 
 
Phase 2:  Expansion 
 
Enrollment into the Phase 1 dose escalation portion has been completed and RP2D-IE was determined to be 
68 mcg.  
Figure 3-1 Intra-patient Escalation Regimen  
In this dosing regimen, at C1D1 and C1 D8, patients will all receiv e single-agent IMCgp100 at a dose  below the 2RP2D-
QW of 50 mcg. Patients will receive 20 mcg IMCgp100 on C1D1 and 30 mcg IMCgp100 on C1D8. The intra-patient 
escalated dose will then commence at  C1D15 and will continue at that same escalated dose level thereafter. 
The Phase 1 portion of the study will be a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Dose cohort levels are 
presented in  Table 6-2. After the dose escalation portion is complete and the MTD or the RP2D-IE is 
identified, the Phase 2 expansion cohorts in mUM will be enrolled. The Phase 2 expansion Cohort A will 
enroll patients with mUM in the second-line setting after disease progression following systemic

treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor and will recrui t approximately 20 patients.  The Phase 2 expansion 
Cohort B will enroll patients with mUM in the second/t hird-line setting with up to one prior line of LDT 
and will recruit approximately 130 patients. A total of approximately 150 patients will be enrolled into the 
Phase 2 expansion phase of the study. See Figure 3-2 .

Phase 1 testing of the intra-patient esca lation regimen to identify the RP2D-I E will implement a standard 3+3 design. 
Once the dose is identified in the Phase 1 dose escalati on, 2 Phase 2 expansion cohorts will be enrolled in 2 patient 
populations:  (1) Cohort A will enroll patients with 1 system ic treatment regimen containi ng a checkpoint inhibitor, 
including either a cytotoxic T lymphocy te associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor (ipilimumab or tremelimumab) 
and/or a PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1 inhibitor and any prior LDT, and (2) Cohort B will recruit 
approximately 130 patients to further characterize the safety , tolerability, PK, and anti-t umor response of IMCgp100 
in patients who have been previously treated with 1 or 2 pr ior lines of therapy in the me tastatic or advanced setting 
(including chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy) and up to a single line of local, LDT. Prior checkpoint inhibitor is acceptable in Cohort B but is not required.  
Additional details on Phase 2 Expansion cohorts are provided in Section 3.2  and Section 5.2.  
These expansion cohorts are designed to  further characterize the safety, tole rability, and preliminary PK and anti-
tumor activity of IMCgp100.  
 Patient Population 
The trial will enroll patients with a diagnosis of advan ced UM, defined as histologically confirmed diagnosis 
of UM and metastatic stage IV diseas e at study entry. In the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial, 
patients are eligible with any prior therapy including systemic treatments or LDT with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scor e of 0 or 1 and meeting all additional eligibility 
criteria.  
Enrollment into the Phase 1 dose escalation portion has been completed and RP2D-IE was determined to 
be 68 mcg. Two Phase 2 expansion cohorts will be enrolled in 2 patient populations based on prior 
therapy:   
Phase 2 Expansion B:  IMCgp100 at RP2D

1. Cohort A:  Patients will have experienced disease progression with 1 systemic treatment 
regimen containing a checkpoint inhibitor, including either a CTLA4 inhibitor (ipilimumab or 
tremelimumab) and/or a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.  Any prior LDT is acceptable in this cohort.  
2. Cohort B:  Patients will have experienced disease progression with 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic or advanced setting including chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted 
therapy. Only a single line of local, LDT including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radiofrequency 
ablation or embolization is allowed. A line of LD T is defined as one modality of treatment that is 
administered until completion of treatment or disease progression. For patients who have received prior LDT, this will count as a line of th erapy. Prior surgical resection of oligometastatic 
liver disease is allowed and is not counted as a line of LDT. A patient may have discontinued 
systemic therapy prior to disease progression if  the patient experienced an adverse reaction 
that required treatment discontinuation, as per Investigator’s judgment and applicable labelling. Prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy is acceptable but not required in this cohort. 
a. This means patients with the following tr eatments are eligible under Cohort B: 
 1 systemic therapy and 1 LDT 
 1 – 2 systemic therapies and 0 LDT 
 0 systemic therapy and 1 LDT 
b. Adjuvant therapies and local therapies for treatment of disease outside of the liver do 
not count towards the lines of prior therapy.  
These Phase 2 expansion cohorts are designed to fu rther characterize the safety, tolerability, and 
preliminary PK and anti-tumor activity of IMCgp100.  
Emerging preclinical data ( Section 1.3.1 ) suggest that the residence time  of IMCgp100 to the HLA-A*0201 
allele is considerably longer resulting in enhanced  effects compared to non-HLA-A*0201 alleles. This is 
borne out in the clinical data ( Section 1.4.2 ), where patients expressing non-HLA-A*0201 alleles appear 
to have fewer T cell mediated to xicities and no clinical response s have been observed. Given these 
preclinical and clinical data, enrollment is limited  to patients expressing the HLA-A*0201 allele. 
 Definition of Study Periods 
The Pre-screening Period  will begin once a patient has signed the Pre-screening Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) and concludes with the HLA-A*0201 testing results. A blood test will determine whether the patient 
is HLA-A*0201 positive (eligible) or HLA-A*0201 negative (not eligible). Patients will either be designated 
as pre-screening failure (negative test result or if po sitive and the patient chooses not to enter the study), 
or eligible for the study (HLA-A*0201 positive) and th e patient can proceed and si gn the Main Study ICF. 
Patients who re-screen for the trial need not return to  the pre-screen period once HLA results are known. 
Patients known to be HLA-A*0201 positive by prior te sting done outside the study may complete the pre-
screening and screening periods in parallel.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 55 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
The Screening Period  will begin once a patient has signed the consent form and concludes with either a 
screen failure decision or initiation of study dosing on C1D1. Patients will not sign the main study ICF until 
the HLA-A2 status is known via central laboratory te sting (see Pre-screening Period above). During the 
Screening Period, patients are evaluated against the study inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 5 ) 
and all screening procedures and ob servations are performed. The screening window for all procedures 
will be 21 days, other than imaging studies which will have a 28-day window. Patients who screen negative 
may re-screen for the trial without re -entering the pre-screen period.  
The Treatment Period  will begin with the first treatment in the first cycle with C1D1. For the purpose of 
treatment scheduling, a cycle consists of 4 weeks (28 days).  The Treatment Period consists of the time from C1D1 until the end of study treatment.  
The 90-day Safety Follow-up Period  consists of the time from the last dose of study medication for a 
period of 90 days. Safety observations during this 90-day Follow-up Period are outlined in Section 7.2.3  
and include reporting of all AEs and all serious ad verse events (SAEs) in the same manner as the Treatment 
Period. Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of  study drug will be collected during this follow-
up period. The Disease Progression Follow-up Period  is defined for all patients who discontinue for reasons other 
than death, progressive disease (PD)  per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 
v.1.1) or modified irRECIST as outlined below, lo st to follow up, withdrawal of consent, or study 
termination. 
 All patients who discontinue for reasons other than PD per RECIST v1.1 will be followed with 
imaging until evidence of PD per RECIST v.1.1 (see Section 7.2.4 and Section 7.3.1 ) 
 For patients who consent to and continue trea tment beyond progression per RECISTv.1.1, imaging 
should continue until progression per modified irRECIST (irPD) or treatment discontinuation. 
 If patients choose not to return for these visits or are unable to do so, every effort should be made to contact them or a knowledgeable informant by telephone to determine if the patient has had 
disease progression. . 
 Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons of disease progression by either RECISTv1.1 or 
modified irRECIST criteria will not enter the Disease Progression Follow-up Period. 
 Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study drug will be collected during this follow-up period. 
The Survival Follow-up Period  will initiate after either the 90-day Follow-up Period (in patients who have 
discontinued for PD) or after the Disease Progression Follow-up Period (for patients discontinuing study 
treatment for reasons other than PD) and continue until  death. As possible, all patients will be followed 
for survival until the end of the study is reached. An ti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study 
drug will be collected during this follow-up period.

 End of Treatment  
In all patients in this study, IMCgp100 will be admini stered IV according to the defined regimen. Reasons 
for discontinuation of study treatment are described in Section 6.10 . 
Patients who discontinue treatment will remain in the study and be followed for the overall survival (OS) 
endpoint.  
Each patient’s disease will be assessed for efficacy using 2 sets of criteria:  (1) RECIST v.1.1 and (2) modified 
irRECIST. The objective response rate (ORR) endpoint will be assessed as ORR per RECIST v.1.1; however, 
patients experiencing PD per RECIST v.1.1 criteria may consent to continue to be treated until meeting 
the criteria for unequivocal, confirmed PD by modified irRECIST as defined in  Section 13.2.1 . 
Please refer to Section 6.9  for details regarding imaging assessm ent of PD for purposes of treatment 
discontinuation.  
 Definition of End of Study 
The end of the study will be when a minimum of 80% of the patients have completed the follow-up for 
disease progression or discontinued the study for any reason, and all patients have completed treatment and the 90-day Follow-up Period, or if  the study is terminated early. 
An individual patient may end participation in the study for reasons described in Section 6.11 . Please refer 
to Section 9 , Statistical Methods and Data Analysis for deta ils of timing of the primary analysis and final 
reporting of data. 
 Early Study Termination 
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by the Sponsor. Should this be necessary, any 
ongoing patient should be seen as soon as possible for End of Treatm ent (EOT) visit and the assessments 
should be performed as described in Table 7-1 for the EOT visit.  
The investigator may be informed of additional pr ocedures to be followed in order to ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. Under guidance of the 
Sponsor, the investigator will be  responsible for informing the Inst itutional Review Board (IRB) and 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of  the termination of the trial.

 Dispensing, Dose Preparation and Administration  
IMCgp100 will be supplied as concentrate for soluti on for infusion and require dilution prior to 
administration. Detailed instructions for dose preparation and administration are provided in the study 
pharmacy manual and/ or on the relevant pharmacy handling instructions. Once prepared for 
administration, the final infusion bag containing IM Cgp100 must be administered within 4 hours at room 
temperature from the time of initial puncture of the supplied drug vial. 
The target duration of administration of IMCgp100 will be 15–20 minutes. The entire content of the IV 
bag will be infused using an infusion pump. The IV line should be flushed after the contents of the IV bag 
are fully administered according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered. It must be 
documented if the line was not flushed. 
 Summary of Intra-patient Dose Escalation Treatment Regimen 
Patients enrolled in this study will receive treatment with single-agent IMCgp100 on C1D1 and C1D8 at 20 
mcg and 30 mcg per week, respectively. The majority of moderate-to-severe toxicity associated with 
IMCgp100 in the FIH study was observed at these 2 dose time points and included hypotension, rash, 
pruritus, fever, and chills (please refer to Section 1.4 , Clinical Experience with IMCgp100 for a full 
discussion of the safety data with IMCgp100). After this initial dosing period, beginning at C1D15, patients 
will receive an escalated dose of IMCgp100 according to th e cohort into which they are enrolled (please 
see Table 6-2 below, for dose levels to be tested). This escalated dose administered at C1D15 will be the 
dose used for the remainder of the treatment period unless dose reduction is implemented for toxicity. See schematic for intra-patient dose escalation regimen described in  Section 3.1  and Figure 3-1 .  
In this intra-patient escalation regimen, all patients  will require overnight inpatient hospitalization and a 
minimum of pre-dose and monitoring vital signs ever y 4-hours after the first administration of IMCgp100 
(C1D1), after the second administrat ion (C1D8), and after the escalated dose of IMCgp100 on C1D15 is 
administered. For the first 3 administrations of IMCg p100, patients should be monitored for at least 16 
hours after dosing. “Inpatient hospitalization” refers  to a facility with fully functional resuscitation 
facilities, 24 hour monitoring  and physician availability.  
Inpatient monitoring at Cycle 1 Day 22 (C1D22) will be determined by the toxicity observed in the C1D1–C1D15 doses as follows:   
1. If the escalated dose at C1D15 administered as an  inpatient does not raise safety concerns (and 
the patient does not experience an adverse reacti on involving hypotension of grade 2 or greater), 
the subsequent dose at C1D22 and all subsequent doses can be administered on an outpatient 
basis 
2. If the patient experiences hypotension requiring  any medical intervention (Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Event [CTCAE] grade 2 or gr eater) at C1D15, then the C1D22 dose must be 
administered with inpatient monitoring, simila r to C1D1–C1D15. If the patient does not 
experience hypotension requiring medical intervention at the C1D22 dose administered as an 
inpatient, then all subsequent doses can be administered on an outpatient basis

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 67 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
3. Hospitalization at other days (e.g., Cycle 2 and beyond) are determined at the discretion of the 
principal investigator based on the patient’s histo ry and tolerance for the initial doses of the study 
medication with the exception of patients experiencing a treatment delay (please refer to bullet 5 below) 
4. Until Cycle 2 Day 15 (C2D15), patients who h ave experienced a prior CTCAE grade 3 or 4 
hypotension event with IMCgp100 dosing and are re ceiving a dose in the outpatient setting, must 
be observed in the clinic for a minimum of 8 hours after completion of the IMCgp100 dose.  
5. Patients experiencing a break or delay in trea tment for any reason of more than 2 weeks AND 
have a history of a grade 3 or 4 hypotension event with IMCgp100 dosing during the first weeks of treatment will be monitored as an inpatient fo r the dose subsequent to the break in dosing, 
regardless of the timing of the break in dosing. 
Due to the risk of hypotension, all patients  receiving anti-hypertensive medications must discontinue all 
anti-hypertensive therapy  for 24 hours prior to dosing and for 24 hours after dosing for the first 6 QW 
doses of IMCgp100 unless discussed and agreed with  the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. After the sixth 
weekly dose, anti-hypertensive therapy can be restarte d on a continuous basis thereafter with the dosing 
of IMCgp100 (eliminating the 24 hour hold during IMCgp100 dosing) at the discretion of the principal investigator. 
In addition, due to the risk of hypotension, IV fluids may be administered prior to IMCgp100 
administration and, if given, IV fluids will be recorded as a concomitant medication in the eCRF. The 
administration of IV fluids should be guided by clinical evaluation and the volume status of the patient. Pruritus is a common adverse event with IMCgp100, so premedication with an antihistamine may be 
considered. See Table 6-3  for further recommendations regarding treatment of skin toxicity. If a patient 
experiences an infusion reaction, he/she may receive premedication on subsequent dosing days after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Pre- medications should include, but are not limited to, 
paracetamol/acetaminophen and an antihistamine. Corticosteroid premedication should be avoided; 
corticosteroids should only be considered if the paracetamol/acetamin ophen and antihistamine 
combination is not effective and only after co nsultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
If 2 or more patients experience moderate-to-severe acute infusion re actions on C1D1 or if > 25% of 
patients experience mild infusion reactions, then mandatory primary prophylaxis regimens (i.e., before 
dosing on C1D1 or C1D15) will be instituted for subs equent patients beginning treatment after discussion 
and agreement among principal investigators a nd the Sponsor. Primary and secondary prophylaxis 
regimens will include both paracetamol/acetaminophen and an antihistamine. The decision taken to 
mandate primary prophylaxis will be communicated in wr iting to all principal investigators participating 
in the study.   
Acute allergic reactions should be treated as need ed using institutional guidelines. In the event of 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, any therapy necessary to restore normal cardiopulmonary status 
should be implemented immediately. Such acute allergic  reactions will be reported to the Sponsor in an 
expedited manner. These should be designated as reportable as a SAE regardless of hospitalization as 
medically important events. Please refer to SAE reporting section for details. The individual symptoms of

the infusion-related reaction should be captured in order to best characterize the study drug infusion 
reactions, unless the investigator co nsiders another category, such as “allergic reaction,” “anaphylaxis,” 
or “cytokine release syndrome” more a ppropriate in a specific situation.

 Dose Escalation Guidelines 
Three to 6 patients will be enrolled in sequentially enrolling dose cohorts (see Table 6-2 dose levels). In 
each cohort, patients will be treated during Cycle 1 with  IMCgp100 as a single agent (Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 
1, all patients receive the 20 and 30 mcg, retrospectivel y). At C1D15, the intra-patient dose escalation will 
begin. The study will begin with Cohort 1 (See  Table 6-2 dose levels) receiving dose level 1 (54 mcg) at 
CD15 and thereafter. Other cohorts enrolling after Coho rt 1 will follow the dose escalation guidelines. 
Cohorts will enroll to escalation by increments of 10 mcg until an MTD and/or RP2D-IE for the intra-patient 
dose escalation regimen is identified.  
An individual cohort will initially enroll 3 to 6 patients . If none of the 3 patients experiences a DLT, then 
dose escalation decision may proceed after agreement among study team members (participating 
investigators and Sponsor) within the DETC. The decisi on to escalate the dose will be determined based 
on available toxicity, PK, and pharmacodynamic data following a discussion among members of the study 
team (all participating investigators and Sponsor Medical Monitor) during DETC. The cohort will be 
expanded to 6 patients if DLT is observed during th e DLT period according to the dose escalation rules 
noted below. If toxicity is managed adequately to resume IMCgp100 dosing, patients experiencing DLT 
may continue treatmen t with IMCgp100 only after agreement with  the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Patients 
in the Phase 1 cohorts will be considered evaluable for dose escalation decisions (DLT Analysis Set) if they 
receive a minimum of 3 doses of IMCgp100 (with 2 of the 3 doses at the escalated level of C1D15 and thereafter) or have experienced DLT during the DLT observation period.  
Dose-escalation in the study will occur after the study  team (Sponsor and investigators) have jointly 
reviewed available safety data for the 3 to 6 patients at the current dose level at  a safety team DETC. The 
decision to dose-escalate will be taken by the stud y team (participating investigators and the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor). Additional cohorts may be added if  necessary to explore alternate/intermediate dose 
levels if deemed necessary by the members of the dose escalation teleconference.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 70 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
6.3.4.1 Dose Escalation Decision Making 
Dose-escalation decisions will be made based on tr eatment-emergent AE, clinical laboratory data, and 
available PK, and pharmacodynamic data after all pati ents in a cohort complete the 28-days of study 
treatment in Cycle 1. Safety data from patients on pr eceding cohorts will also be taken into consideration. 
The data will be reviewed and a decision taken whethe r or not to proceed to the next dose cohort (at the 
planned or an alternative dose level), whether more patients are required to be dosed at the dose level 
under review or whether the MTD and/or the optimal RP2D-IE has been reached.  
The following dose-escalation rules will be used: 
If none of the first 3 evaluable patients experiences a DLT by the end of the DLT observation period, the 
dose will be escalated and the next cohort of patients  can start treatment at the next highest dose level.  
 If 1 of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT in Cycle 1, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. 
If none of these additional patients experiences a DLT, then the dose will be escalated to the next higher dose level 
 If 2 or more patients in the dose level experience a DLT in the DLT observation period, then the 
MTD has been exceeded and 3 more patients will be treated at the next lower dose level, if only 
3 patients were previously treated at that dose level  
 If 0 or 1 DLT is observed at this lower dose leve l, this dose will be determined to be the MTD  
 If 2 DLTs occur at this level, the next lower dose will need to be evaluated similarly  
 A minimum of 6 patients will be evaluated at the dose level identified as the RP2D-IE in this study   
6.3.4.2 Definition of MTD and RP2D-IE 
The MTD  is defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLT in fewer than 33% of the 
patients enrolled in a cohort level. If all evaluated dose levels demonstrate an observed incidence of DLT 
in fewer than 33% of patients, the MTD has not been re ached. If this proves to be the case, then a total 
of 6 patients will be treated at the highest dose tested to gain additional safety data before proceeding to the dose-expansion part of the study.  If a DLT occurs at the MTD, a total of 6 patients must be treated at 
the MTD.  
Determination of the RP2D-IE  will be based on the sum of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and 
PK data, as well as preliminary efficacy data emergi ng over the course of the Phase 1 testing. The MTD 
and RP2D-IE may be not be the same dose level fo r implementation in the UM expansion cohort.  
The RP2D-IE  will be based on the sum of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic, and PK data, as well 
as preliminary efficacy data emerging over the course of the Phase 1 testing. The RP2D-IE will be defined 
as the dose level selected for testing in the expans ion cohort by the study team, based on all available 
safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic data. The MTD and RP2D-IE may not be the same dose level; the RP2D-IE will be the same dose or a lower dose than an identified MTD. If the MTD and RP2D are different, the RP2D-IE will be implemented in the ex pansion cohorts. A minimum of 6 patients will be

treated at the identified RP2D-IE for the DLT period be fore the expansion cohorts with this dose can begin 
enrollment. 
During the course of the UM expansion cohorts, if the rate of grade 3 and/or grade 4 toxicity is considered 
related to the study drugs and meeting the definition of DLT is higher than 30%, a safety teleconference 
will be convened with the study team (Sponsor and investigators) to determine if the cohort should 
continue enrollment.  
6.3.4.3 Replacement of Patients 
Patients will be replaced in the Phase 1 cohorts according to the guidelines for Phase 1 dose escalation. 
Patients deemed not eligible for the DLT Analysis Set in Phase 1 will be replaced.  
 Definition of Dose-limiting Toxicities 
A DLT is defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory val ue assessed as having a suspected relationship to 
study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease pr ogression, inter-current illness, or concomitant 
medications that occurs within the first cycle of treatment, and meets any of the criteria included in  Table 6-3 . NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be used for all gradin g unless otherwise specified. The investigator 
must notify the Sponsor immediately of any unexpected NCI CTCAE grade ≥ 3 AEs or laboratory 
abnormalities. Prior to enrolling patients into  a higher dose level, all NCI CTCAE grade ≥ 2 AEs will be 
reviewed for all patients at the current dose level by the study team at the DETC.

 Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy will be continuously moni tored through the 90-day safety follow up. 
 Permitted Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant medications and therapies deemed necessary for the supportive care and safety of the 
patient are allowed in general. Examples include anti-diarrheal medications, anti-emetics, or electrolyte 
supplementation.  
Patients must be told to notify the investigational site staff about any new medications, herbal remedies, 
or dietary supplements that he or she takes after the start of the study treatment, regardless of treatment 
duration. All concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy, herbal or natural medications, and blood transfusio ns) administered during the study must be listed on 
the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
IV hydration required to manage toxicity associated wi th any of the study medications (e.g., hypotension) 
and any IV hydration administered prior to study dr ug dosing should be recorded in the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.  
 Permitted Concomitant Therapy Requiring Caution 
Treatment with hematopoietic colony-stimulating growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF or 
erythroid stimulating agents) may not be initiated during the first cycle in any arm of the study, unless the 
patient has already experienced a DLT. If a patient is using erythropoiesis-stimulating agent prior to 
enrollment (beginning at least 2 weeks before start of  study treatment), they may continue at the same 
dose. 
Anti-coagulant therapy is permitted if the patients are already at stable doses of warfarin or stable doses 
of low molecular weight heparin for > 2 weeks at time  of first dose. Prophylactic use of low molecular 
weight heparin during the inpatient hospitalization is allowed. International normalized ratio should be

 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy 
During the course of the study, patients may not receive other additional investigational drugs, agents, 
devices, chemotherapy, or any other therapies that may be active against cancer. Additionally, no other systemic therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, exce pt for denosumab and tocilizumab if required for 
patient care, and no immunosuppressive medication may be administered while on this study, unless prescribed to manage toxicity. While systemic corticosteroid therapy will interfere with the mechanism of action of the study medications, its use is recommended in some settings.  
The use of systemic corticosteroid therapy is perm itted/recommended in the following settings:  (1) 
infusion reactions, (2) immune-mediated toxiciti es and toxicity management as directed in  Table 6-5 (e.g., 
hypotension not resolving with fluid support), and (3) replacement-dose steroids in the setting of adrenal 
insufficiency (patients with a pre-existing history of adrenal crisis are excluded from study participation, 
see Section 5.3  Exclusion Criteria). Any additional uses of  systemic corticostero id therapy during the 
course of the study should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
 Contraception 
Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all wo men physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, 
can be included in the study provided they are us ing highly effective methods of contraception during 
dosing and for 6 months after the last dose of IMCgp100. 
Highly effective contraception methods include the following: 
 Total abstinence from sexual relations for the duration of the treatment when applicable to the 
lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e .g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception 
 Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or wi thout hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, this applies only when the reproductive status  of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up 
hormone level assessment 
 Male sterilization (at least 6 mont hs prior to Screening). For female patients on the study the 
vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient 
 The combination of any 2 of the following methods when both are used simultaneously: 
o Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of 
hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate < 1%), for example 
hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception 
o Placement of an intrauterine de vice or intrauterine system

 Patient Numbering and Treatment Assignment 
 Patient Numbering 
Each patient is identified in the study by a number th at is assigned when the patient is first enrolled for 
Screening. The patient number is retained as the primary identifier for the patient throughout 
participation in the trial. The patient number consis ts of the center number assigned by the Sponsor and 
a sequential patient number suffix so that each pati ent is numbered uniquely across the entire database. 
Patient numbers will be assigned by  the Sponsor via the interactive re sponse technology system at the 
time of Screening.  
 Treatment Assignment and Randomization 
Patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study  will be assigned to the appropriate open Phase 1 
cohort by the Sponsor. Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort will be assigned by the Sponsor. 
Assignments will be coordinated via the intera ctive voice response system for the study. 
 Study Drug Packaging/Labelling, Preparation and Dispensation 
Further instructions for the preparation and disp ensation of IMCgp100 are described in the study 
Pharmacy Manual, relevant Pharmacy Handling Instructions and Section 6.1  Study Treatment.  
Packaging and labelling details are outlined in the study Pharmacy Manual and relevant Pharmacy 
Handling Instructions.  
All dosages prescribed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded on the 
Dosage Administration Record eCRF.  
 Study Drug Compliance and Accountability 
Study treatment will be administered to the patient by the trained study site staff at the study sites and 
as outlined in the study Pharmacy Manual and Section 6.1 . Compliance with the prescribed regimen will 
be assured by administration of the study treatmen t under the supervision of investigator or his/her 
designee. 
The investigator or designee must maintain an accurate record of the shipment  and dispensing of study 
treatment according to local institutional drug ac countability processes. Full drug accountability for 
IMCgp100 is required in accordance with the Inte rnational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. Drug accountability will be noted by the field monitor during site visits and at 
the completion of the study. At study close-out, and, as appropriate during the course of the study, the 
investigator will return all used and unused study tr eatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the

completed drug accountability logs to the site study mo nitor. Additional details including receipt of study 
products, storage and management of temperature excursions are provided in the study Pharmacy 
Manual.  
 Drug Supply, Storage, and Disposal 
Study treatments must be received by designated personnel at the study site, handled and stored safely 
and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated site personnel have access. Upon receipt, IMCgp100  supply should be recorded and stor ed according to the instructions 
specified on the drug labels. 
All IMCgp100 supply remaining at the end of the study, following appropriate drug accountability 
procedures at each site, can be destroyed per local institutional practice at the study site or at a third 
party vendor as appropriate and agreed to with Sponsor. All destruction of study medications must be 
documented appropriately.  
 Management and Follow-up of Toxicity 
Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an AE or clinically significant laboratory value, must be followed-up at least once a w eek (or more if clinically indicated) for 4 weeks, 
and subsequently at approximately 4-week intervals, until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first. Appropriate clinical experts should be consulted as deemed necessary for any AEs 
observed in the course of the trial. In the case of a toxicity suspected to be related to a cytokine release 
syndrome, the immunologic assessments outlined in Section 7.3.7.7  should be performed. In case of a 
worsening rash or other related skin  toxicity (e.g., pruritus), a skin punch biopsy, as outlined in 
Section 7.3.7.10 , should be considered.  
Guidelines for management of AE and dose modifications are presented below in Table 6-5 (below). 
Institutional protocols for management of immune-r elated AE should be implemented in cases of 
immune-related AE and will take precedence over guidance in  Table 6-5 . All patients must be followed up 
for the occurrence of AE and SAE for 90 days followi ng the last dose of IMCgp100.  If more than 3 
consecutive doses of single-agent IMCgp100 are not ad ministered due to drug-relat ed toxicities or if a 
treatment gap occurs of greater than 21 days, the default position is that then the patient must be 
discontinued from the study. However, if a patien t who misses more than 2 consecutive doses due to a 
drug-related toxicity is experiencing clinical benefit,  and in the opinion of the investigator it is in the 
patient’s best interest to remain on study, then the patient may restart treatment after discussion with the Sponsor. 
 Hypotension 
Cases of severe hypotension have been observed across the IMCgp100 clinical trials. Initial therapy for low-grade hypotension is aggressive IV fluid (crystalloid or colloid) therapy. In cases of hypotension, where 
blood pressures are not immediately responding to fluid management, IV corticosteroid therapy should 
be considered. Cases of hypotension not complicated by additional symptoms associated with cytokine

release syndrome (CRS) (e.g., nausea, vomiting, malaise, and fever) have been observed with IMCgp100. 
Retrospective analyses of peripheral cytokines in  the IMCgp100-102 study have suggested that mild-to-
moderate elevations in IL-6 after the first dose of IMCgp100 may be associated with more severe 
presentations of hypotension. Intervention with earl y IV corticosteroid in cases of hypotension without 
initial response to fluid therapy is warranted as described in  Table 6-5.  
 Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Cases of CRS have been observed ac ross the IMCgp100 clinical trials (as of 12 August 2018, CRS cases have 
been seen in 6% of patients in the current  study overall,  and 2 of these cases were ≥ Grade 3). The pattern 
of CRS generally begins 2–12 hours following the firs t 3 doses of IMCgp100 and the observed toxicities 
include hypotension (which has been severe in some pa tients), rash or general erythema, pruritus, facial 
and general edema, pyrexia and chills. Other commonl y reported symptoms, typically mild to moderate, 
include headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grading of CRS is based on the modified grading system 
(Table 6-5 ). Aggressive management in cases of su spected CRS is warranted per guidance in  Table 6-5 . 
Early intervention with immunosuppression therapy (e.g ., high-dose corticosteroid therapy) is warranted 
in cases of suspected CRS. 
Table 6-4 describes updated grading for events of CRS.

(Wolchok, 2009; Nishino, 2013; Bohnsack, 2014; refer to Section 6.10.1  and Appendix 1 ) 
 Initiation of alternative anti-cancer ther apy including another investigational agent 
 Unacceptable toxicity defined as an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or the Sponsor, 
contraindicates further dosing 
 Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with  investigational product by the patient or the 
investigator or lost to follow-up  
 Patient is determined to have met 1 or more of th e exclusion criteria or failed to meet all of the 
inclusion criteria for study participation AND continuing to receive investigational product might 
constitute a safety risk. Patients who fall into  this category and for whom continuation of 
treatment is not thought to pose a safety risk in the opinion of the investigator may continue to receive study treatment after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 85 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
At the time patients discontinue study treatment, the EOT visit should be scheduled as soon as possible 
and in the appropriate window of 14 days after the last dose was administered. At this visit, all of the 
assessments listed for the EOT visit will be performed (see Table 7-1 ). If the decision to withdraw the 
patient occurs at a regularly scheduled visit, that visit may become the EOT visit rather than having the patient return for an additional vi sit (safety follow-up will still continue for the full 90-day observation 
period, see Section 7.2  for details of assessments required at EOT). An End of Treatment Phase Disposition 
eCRF page should be completed at the EOT visit, giving the date and reason for stopping the study treatment. End of treatment/premature withdrawal visit is not considered as the end of the study. 
Patients should still be followed for survival inform ation and, if the patient does not have PD, imaging 
data should continue to be collected to  capture progression based on RECISTv.1.1. 
Patients who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study as they 
will be followed for the OS endpoint. They should return for the assessments indicated in  Section 7  and 
Table 7-1 . If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, 
email, and registered letter) should be made to contact them. If a patient discontinues study treatment, but continues study assessments, the patient remains on study until such time as he/she completes 
protocol criteria for ending  study assessments. At th at time, the reason for study completion should be 
recorded on the Study Disposition eCRF page. 
 Criteria for Treatment Beyond Initial RECIST v.1.1 Disease Progression  
For patients in the study, if PD based on RECIST v.1.1 occurs, and the patient does NOT have clinical 
symptomatic progression that would require a change  in therapy to adequately manage symptoms, the 
patient will be considered to continue in disease control (immune-related stable disease) and may consent 
to continue to be treated according to the protocol-spe cified regimens until 1 of the following criteria is 
met: 
1. Unequivocal, confirmed irPD based on modified irRECIST (guidelines based on Wolchok, 2009; 
Nishino, 2013, Bohnsack, 2014):  An initial asse ssment of PD by RECIST v.1.1 (initial PD 
assessment) will be confirmed with a repeat radiologic evaluation performed at least 4 weeks 
later as scheduled per protocol. For patients wh o continue IMCgp100 ther apy beyond initial PD 
per RECISTv1.1, unequivocal, confirmed irPD is defined as an additional 20% increase or greater in tumor burden (sum of diameters of both target and measurable new lesions) or unequivocal 
progression of NTLs and/or new non-measurable disease from the initial PD assessment per 
RECISTv1.1 
2. Meets any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria ( Section 6.10 ) 
3. Clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically si gnificant PD (not meeting radiologic PD) such as 
the benefit-risk ratio of continuing therapy is no longer justified

Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 86 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
4. Rapid PD or threat to vital organs/critical anatomic al sites (e.g., spinal co rd compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention, and/or continuation of study therapy would prevent 
institution of such intervention 
Patients continuing treatment beyond the protocol-s pecified RECIST v.1.1 progression will continue to 
follow the treatment regimen of QW IM Cgp100. Imaging data will continue  to be collected  until confirmed 
immune-related progression (irPD) based on modified irRECIST. 
 Study Discontinuation   
Reasons for individual patients discontinuing from study include: 
 Patient dies 
 Patient is lost to follow-up 
 Patient withdraws consent for any further participation including further survival follow-up 
 The end of study is reached (please refer to Section 3.5  and Section 3.6 )

7 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS 
 Screening Procedures and Assessments 
All of the assessments required as part of the study are indicated in  Table 7-1 organized by visit date, with 
assessments required indicated with an “X” at the spec ific visits when they should be performed. All 
assessments listed as “Screening” mu st be performed within 21 days before C1D1. The only exception to 
the Screening Period of 21 days are the baseline radi ological evaluations which must be performed within 
28 days of the screening visit. Asse ssments required on C1D1 that are performed as part of the screening 
evaluations and within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment, do not need to be repeated on 
C1D1. Laboratory assessments required on subsequent  dosing days may be performed 1 day prior to 
IMCgp100 administration. Laboratory and radiological assessments performed as part of standard of care prior to signing informed consent may be used if pe rformed within the screening time window (21 days 
for laboratory assessments and 28 days  for radiological assessments). 
During the course of the study visits, test and/or pr ocedures should occur on schedule whenever possible. 
A visit window of ± 7 days is allowed unless otherwise indicated in the protocol. If the study drug infusions 
are delayed, the assessments will be moved with the delayed study drug infusions. The only exception to 
moving study assessments with treatment are the ra diological assessments, wh ich must be performed ± 
7 days of the scheduled date of the assessment (unless otherwise indicated in the protocol). The protocol specified radiologic assessments sh ould be performed as scheduled every 8 or 12 weeks as indicated in 
the protocol, using as reference to C1D1 and should not follow delays incurred in the treatment period. 
Radiologic assessments should not move if delays in treatment are incurred.

g  Chemistry panel should be obtained at Screening  and before every dose of IMCgp100 and at EOT. 
   
 
j  Skin punch biopsy should be obtained in  patients with worsened rash on C1D15 or beyond as compared to the rash experienced on  IMCgp100 dosing days on C1D1 or C1D8. This 
skin biopsy is optional. 
k  Pregnancy testing is required only in a ll females with childbearing potential. At Screening, a serum pregnancy test must be p erformed within 72 hours before the first dose. During the 
study (Day 1 of each cycle starting with Cycle 2) a serum or urine pregnancy test must be performed. At EOT, a serum or urine p regnancy test must also be performed.  
    
m  Radiologic assessments should be per formed as scheduled every 8 weeks  from C1D1 to Week 40 (C11D1), then every 12 weeks until confirmed PD per RECISTv.1.1 (See 
Table 7-2 ), using as reference to C1D1 and should NOT follow delays incu rred in the treatment period. Radiologic assessments at each tim epoint are listed in Table 7-2 . Partial 
response, minor response, and complete res ponse, per both RECIST v.1.1 and modified irRECIST, should be confirmed by a new asse ssment after at least 4 weeks.  
n  Dose escalation cohorts:  Submission of an archival tumor samp le from each patient is required. In the absence of an archiva l tumor biopsy, a newly obtained tumor biopsy can be 
obtained. If the new tumor biopsy cannot be obtai ned or is not medically feasible this should be discussed with the Sponsor Med ical Monitor prior to enrollment. Dose expansion 
cohorts:  Submission of an archival tumor sample is requested, if available. 
oDose escalation cohorts:  Collection of a tumor sample at Screening is mandatory, unless the tissue sample can be obtained from an archival tumor sample (see Table 7-8 ). On-
treatment C1D2 and/or C1D16 biopsy is  optional  in all dose escalation cohorts. Dose expansion cohorts:  Fresh tumor biopsy at Screening is MANDATORY. If the new tumor 
biopsy is not medically feasible, this must  be discussed with the Sponsor Medical M onitor prior to enrollment. One on-treatment  biopsy is mandatory in the expansion cohorts unless 
medically not feasible. See Section 7.4.3 . Only non-significant risk pr ocedures should be performed for accessing tumor ti ssue in patients enrolled in the trial.

 Screening Assessments 
The study IRB/IEC-approved ICF must be signed and dated before any screening procedures are 
performed, except for laboratory an d radiological evaluations performed as part of standard of care 
within the screening window (28 days for radiological assessments, 21 days for all other assessments). 
Patients will be evaluated against study inclusio n and exclusion criteria and safety assessments 
required at Baseline will be performed. For details of all screening assessments, refer to Table 7-1 . 
Screening assessments must be repeated if performed outside of the specified screening window. 
Patients may re-screen after abnormal labs or symptoms are corrected or treated after consultation 
with the Sponsor. 
Radiologic assessments required at screening include  CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 
Brain MRI is required at Screening on ly if there is clinical suspicion of brain metastasis at Screening.  
7.1.1.1 Information to be Collected on Screening Failures 
A patient who signed the Main Study ICF, but failed to be started on treatment for any reason will be 
considered a screen failure. If patients are found no t eligible after signing the main study consent, the 
patients will be considered as screening failures , and data will be handled in the same manner. 
The demographic information, informed consent, an d screening pages (with reason for screen fail) 
must also be completed for screen failure patients. No other data will be entered into the clinical 
database for patients who are screen failures, unl ess the patient experienced a SAE during Screening, 
which would be reported in the us ual manner via eCRF AE page (See Section 8.4 ). 
7.1.1.2 Patient Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Data to be collected will include general patient demographics, relevant medical history and current 
medical conditions, diagnosis and extent of cancer, details of prior anti-cancer treatments, 
prior/concomitant medications, prior procedures, significant non-drug therapies and any other assessments that are done for determining eligibilit y for inclusion in the study. Prior anti-neoplastic 
therapies including medications, radiotherapy, and surgery are to be recorded on the separate Prior Anti-neoplastic Therapy eCRF during Screening. 
7.1.1.3 HLA-A2 Status Determination  
For all patients, HLA-A2 status will be determined during Pre-screening by central assay. Patients 
should not sign the Main Study ICF and enter Screening until the results of the central assay in Pre-
screening is known as HLA-A*0201 positive. Patients  who are known to be HLA-A*0201 positive from 
a prior assessment may complete the pre-screening and screening in parallel. A Pre-screening HLA 
sample should still be submitted fo r central analysis of HLA. Patients who re-screen for the trial need 
not return to the pre-screen peri od once HLA results are known.

Treatment, Treatment Discontin uation and Follow-up Phases 
 Treatment Period 
For the purposes of scheduling procedures and evaluations, a treatment cycle is defined as 4 weeks 
(28 days). Please refer to  Table 7-1  for details of the timing of required assessments and visit windows. 
Patients will be treated until they experience unacc eptable toxicity, PD per modified irRECIST and/or 
treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient, as described in Section 6.10.1 .  
Patients who have disease progression per RECIST v.1.1,  but have evidence of clinical benefit, such as 
disease shrinkage at other sites or symptomati c improvement, may continue treatment after 
discussion with the Sponsor. Patients who consent to continue treatment after RECIST v.1.1 disease 
progression should discontinue stud y treatment once they are no longer deriving benefit as assessed 
by the investigator and as per guidance in  Section 6.10.1 .  
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) will be assessed before dosing on C1D1 and then throughout the 
treatment period using (1) the general health status EQ-5D, 5L questionnaires, and (2) the HRQoL 
instrument EORTC QLQ-C30. Details of PRO assessments are provided in Section 7.3.9.  
Discontinuation of Study Treatment and End of Treatment Visit 
Patients may voluntarily discontinue from the study treatment for an
y reason at any time. If a patient 
decides to discontinue from the study treatment, the investigator should make every effort to 
determine the primary reason for this decision and record this information in  the patient’s chart and 
on the appropriate eCRF pages. Other reasons for discontinuation of study tr eatment are outlined in 
Section 6.10 .  
Patients will be considered withdrawn from therapy if  they state an intention to withdraw, and fail to 
return for visits or become lost to follow-up for any other reason. 
The investigator should discontinue study treatment fo r a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes 
that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being. 
At the time patients discontinue study treatment, a visit should be scheduled as soon as possible, and 
within 14 days of the last dose of study drug or  within 14 days of the decision to permanently 
discontinue study treatment, at which time all of the assessments listed for the EOT visit will be performed (Table 7-1 ). If the decision to withdraw the patien t occurs at a regularly scheduled visit, 
that visit may become the EOT visit rather than having the patient return for an additional visit. An 
End of Treatment Phase Disposition eCRF page should be completed, giving the date and reason for 
stopping the study treatment. End of treatment/premature withdrawal visit is not considered as the 
end of the study. 
Patients who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study. They 
should return for the as sessments indicated in Section 7  and  Table 7-1 . If they fail to return for these 
assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, email, postal letter) should be made 
to contact them. If a patient discontinues study treatment, but continues study assessments, the patient remains on study until such time as he/she completes protocol criteria for ending study

assessments. At that time, the reason for study completion should be recorded on the Study 
Disposition eCRF page. 
 90-day Safety Follow-up Period 
All patients must have safety evaluations 90 days after the last dose of study treatment. Information 
related to all AEs (including concomitant medication  taken for on-going AEs) will be collected for 90 
days after the last dose of study drug. All AEs suspected to be related to study treatment should be 
followed up weekly or as clinically indi cated until resolution or stabilization. 
Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study drug will be collected during this follow-up period. 
 Disease Progression Follow-up Period 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for any re ason other than death, disease progression per 
RECIST v.1.1 , lost to follow-up, withdrawal of cons ent, or study termination,  should return for tumor 
evaluation assessments every 8 weeks until 40 week s, and then every 12 weeks until progression of 
disease per RECIST v.1.1.  
 All patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD per RECISTv1.1 will be 
followed with imaging until evidence of PD per RECISTv1.1 . 
 For patients who consent to and continue tr eatment beyond progression per RECISTv1.1, 
imaging should continue unti l progression per modified irRECIST (irPD) or treatment 
discontinuation. 
 If patients choose not to return for these visits or are unable to do so, every effort should be 
made to contact them or a knowledgeable informant by telephone to determine if the patient 
has had disease progression.   
 Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons of disease progression by either RECISTv1.1 or modified irRECIST criteria will not en ter the Disease Progression Follow-up Period. 
 Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of  study drug will be collected during this 
follow-up period. 
See Table 7-2  for additional details on Disease Assessment Collection Plan. 
 Survival Follow-up Period 
Upon completion of the 90-day safe ty follow up or disease progression follow up, patients will be 
followed for survival every 12 weeks (can be done by telephone call) until death or until the end of the study is reached, unless they withdraw consent or are lost to follow-up. 
Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study drug will be collected during the Survival 
Follow-up period.

For the Phase 2 expansion cohorts, survival calls will be made in the 2 weeks following the date of the 
data cut-off for any OS reporting. Thus, patients may be contacted more frequently than every 12 
weeks at this time. If patients are confirmed to be alive, or if the death date is post the data cut-off 
date, these patients will be censored at the date of the data cut off in the OS reporting. Death dates may be found by checking publicly available death regi stries in line with local laws and regulations.  
 Lost to Follow Up 
For patients whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an 
intention to withdraw consent, the investigator should show "due diligence" by contacting the patient, 
family, or family physician as agreed in the in formed consent and by documenting in the source 
documents steps taken to contact the patient, e.g., da tes of telephone calls, registered letters, etc, a 
patient should not be considered lost to follow up until due diligence has been completed. Patients lost to follow up should be recorded as su ch on the appropriate Patient Disposition eCRF. 
 Details of All Assessment Types 
 Efficacy Assessments 
Radiologic assessments should be performed as sc heduled every 8 or 12 weeks as indicated in this 
section (See Table 7-2  below), using a reference to C1D1 and sh ould NOT follow delays incurred in the 
treatment period. 
Tumor response will be determined according to 2 sets of criteria: 
1. RECIST v.1.1 ( Appendix 1 ) 
2. Modified irRECIST for patients who continue treatment beyond RECISTv.1.1 disease 
progression ( Appendix 2 ) 
For the Phase 1 cohort, the local investigator’s assessment will be used for the analysis of response 
according to RECIST v.1.1 and modified irRECIST for efficacy endpoints of the study, and for treatment decision making (study discontinuation due to PD as per RECISTv.1.1/modified irRECIST).  
Independent Central Review:  An ICR will be used for the analysis  of ORR and all other tumor related 
endpoints based on RECIST v.1.1 and modified irRE CIST for the Phase 2 cohorts. ICR of the Phase 1 
cohort may be done on an exploratory basis for patients who have consented to central reading. 
PFS will be assessed using RECIST v.1.1. Patients ex periencing PD per RECIST v.1.1 criteria may consent 
to continue to be treated according to irRECIST guidelines until confirmed, unequivocal progression 
(irPD) is documented via modified irRECIST. Progression based on modified irRECIST will be assessed as an exploratory endpoint. 
Investigator assessment data will be used for treatment decision making during the study. 
Assessments schedule:   At Screening, all patients will undergo CT or MRI with IV contrast of the chest,

that are not adequately imaged by CT. If a patient is intolerant of iodine-based contrast agents, CT 
may be performed without contrast. Visible skin lesions and easily palpable subcutaneous tumors may 
be measured by physical examination using a ruler or calipers. Ultrasound should not be used to

throughout the study (CT or MRI). See Table 7-2  for further details. 
Tumor assessments will be performed at the following time points: 
 Screening 
 Every 8 weeks ± 1 week from C1D1 to 40 weeks (C11D1), then ev ery 12 weeks (3 cycles) until 
PD per RECIST v.1.1 or discontinuation of study treatment. Note:  For patients who continue 
treatment beyond progression per RECISTv.1.1, imaging should continue until disease 
progression per modified irRECIST.   
 Partial response, minor response (MinR), or complete response (CR), per both RECIST v.1.1 
and modified irRECIST, should be confirmed by a new assessment after at least 4 weeks. For 
patients who continue treatment beyond progress ion by RECISTv1.1, PD per modified irRECIST 
(irPD) should be confirmed after at least 4 weeks from PD by RECISTv.1.1. Further 
confirmation of irPD after its initial occurrence is not required but may be done at Investigator 
discretion.  
 At EOT, if a scan was not conducted within 30 da ys prior to EOT. Note, if a patient discontinues 
treatment, but remains in Disease Progression Follow Up, then imaging visits should continue 
as per the original study plan and schedule and will not be needed at the EOT visit.  
Disease progression follow-up should be performed as described in  Section 7.2.4 .

7.3.1.1 Independent Central Review 
All on-study images acquired for tumor and treatm ent effect assessments will be submitted to an 
imaging contract research organization (CRO) for further blinded, independent, central review for 
analysis. A central imaging manual will be provided to all investigative sites detailing the procedures 
for de-identification and submission of imaging stud ies for central review. For endpoints assessed by 
ICR, review of all radiological imaging data will be  carried out. All radiological scans for all patients 
(including those at unscheduled visits, or outside vi sit windows), will be prov ided to the ICR. Further 
details of the ICR procedures and processes wi ll be included in the study imaging manuals.  
All patient management decisions will be based upon  local assessment of imaging studies at the site 
and not on the ICR. 
 Safety and Tolerability Assessments 
Safety will be monitored by assessing physical examination, vital signs, body height and weight, 
performance status, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, thyroid function, pregnancy, ECG, 
cytokine testing. AE are collected at every visit. For details on AE collection and reporting, refer to 
Section 8 .  
 Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed according to Table 7-1 . 
At Screening and C1D1, prior to IMCgp100 infusi on, a complete physical examination will be 
performed and will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities and neurological 
system. If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will  be performed. 
From C1D8 onwards, a sh ort physical examination will be performed prior to IMCgp100 infusion. A 
short physical exam will include the examination of general appearance, vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse) and body sites as directed by symptoms. 
Significant findings that were present prior to the signature of the informed consent must be included 
in the Medical History eCRF page. Significant new fi ndings that begin or worsen after informed consent 
must be recorded on the AE eCRF page. 
 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (body temperature, pulse rate, respirat ory rate, and blood pressure) must be performed 
before dosing and after the IMCgp100 administration as indicated in Table 7-1  and  Table 7-3, and as 
per institutional standards. 
Vital signs should be assessed on the scheduled day,  even if study treatment is being withheld. More 
frequent examinations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator if medically indicated, 
and will be recorded as unscheduled assessments.  
See Section 6.2  for additional details on intra-patient dose escalation regimen.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING 
 Assessment of Safety 
All patients who receive any treatment with IMCgp100  will be considered evaluable for safety. All AE 
regardless of study drug relationship will be collected up to the 90-day follow-up. 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies are 
crucial for the protection of patients and is mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The Sponsor and CRO have established standard operating procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate repo rting of all safety information; all clinical studies conducted by 
the Sponsor or its affiliates will be condu cted in accordance with those procedures. 
Individual AEs should be evaluated by the investigat or and should be reported  to the CRO/Sponsor for 
evaluation. This includes the evaluation of the event’s seriousness and th e causality between the 
investigational medicinal product(s) and/or concomitant therapy and the AE. The CRO/Sponsor is 
required to maintain detailed records of all AEs re ported by the investigator(s) and to perform an 
evaluation with respect to seriousness, causalit y, and expectedness. On request of a competent 
authority in whose territory the clinical trial is being conducted, the sponsor should submit detailed records of all AEs which are reported to him by th e relevant investigators. Case report processing 
concerns evaluation of data in individual cases, id entification of individual cases requiring specific 
handling, recognition and processing of alerts, and any other data processing of aggregated cases. 
 Definitions 
Definitions of AEs, adverse drug reactions, SAEs and unexpected adverse drug reactions and AEs of special interest are presented below. 
AE:  An AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of pre-existing) an undesirable sign, 
symptom, or medical condition that occurs after pa tient’s signed informed co nsent has been obtained. 
Abnormal laboratory values or test  results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, require therapy (e.g., 
hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or hematological stem cell support), or require 
changes in study medication. 
Adverse drug reaction:  is an unwanted or harmful reaction wh ich occurs after administration of a 
drug or drugs and is suspected or known to be due to the drug. Adverse drug reactions have 
traditionally been categorized as pharmacologic (p redicted based on the pharmacology of the drug) 
or idiosyncratic (not predicted based on pharmacology). 
SAE:  A SAE is any AE that is defined as 1 of the following: 
1. Is fatal or life-threatening  
2. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
3. Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
4. Is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above 
 PROTOCOL NUMBER:  IMCgp100-102 
Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 111 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
5. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for: 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition  
 Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsen ed since signing the informed consent 
 Treatment on an emergency outpatient basi s for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
 Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition 
6. Death due to the progression of malignancy should not be reported as a SAE, if documented 
by use of appropriate method (e.g., as per RECIST v.1.1). Any AE that occurred as a result of 
the PD should be reported in the appropriate manner 
Unexpected adverse drug reaction:  An adverse drug reaction that is not consistent with applicable 
product information or characteristics of the study drug. 
Suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reaction (SUSAR):  A SUSAR is an adverse reaction meeting 
serious criteria (above), the nature  or severity of which is not consistent with the reference safety 
information for the investigational drug(s). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI):  An AESI (serious or non-serious) is an AE with scientific 
and/or medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the Sponso r can be appropriate. Refer to the IMCgp100 
Investigator’s Brochures for details of the AESI. 
 Criteria for Expectedness 
The concept of expectedness refers to events that may or may not have previously been observed and 
documented and not necessarily the known pharmacological properties of the medicine. An AE will 
be unexpected for purposes of regulatory reporting unless it is mentioned in the appropriate 
reference safety information within  the current Investigator’s Brochure for the investigational drug, 
even if it is a medical occurrence expected for the disease being treated. 
 Assessment of Causality 
 Causality Assessment Required  for all Adverse Events 
The investigator decides whether he or she interprets the observed AE as either related to disease, to 
the study medication, study procedure, or other conc omitant treatment or pathologies. To assess the 
relationship of the AE to the study drug , the following terms are defined:    
1. Related :  a direct cause and effect relationship between the study treatment and the AE is 
likely   
2. Possibly related :  a cause and effect relationship betw een the study treatment and the AE has 
not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not impossible   
 PROTOCOL NUMBER:  IMCgp100-102 
Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 112 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
3. Unrelated :  without question, the AE is definitely not associated with the study treatment 
All “related” and “p ossibly related” AEs and SAEs will be defined as related to study drug. 
 Adverse Event Reporting 
 Expedited Reporting 
Cases of adverse drug reactions from all sources that  are assessed as serious are subject to expedited 
reporting. Expedited reporting of cases will comply  with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC and Investigators. Additionally, any 
safety information from other observations that could change the risk benefit evaluation of the 
product will be communicated in an expedite d manner to the regulatory authorities and all 
investigators by the Sponsor.  
The CRO will be responsible for the processing and reporting of SAEs. AEs will be coded by using ICH 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Minimum criteria for a valid adverse drug reaction case have been established by ICH and individual 
regulatory agencies and are listed as the following: 
 An identifiable reporter  
 An identifiable patient  
 A reaction/event  
 A suspected medicinal product 
Other safety issues that also qualify for expedi ted reporting by the Sponsor are those that would 
materially alter the current benefit  risk assessment of the investigational product (sufficient to 
consider changes in the administrati on or in the overall conduct of the trial). Although these events 
will not be reported as SUSARs, th ey might require other action, such as putting in place urgent safety 
measures, the generation of substantial amendments , or early termination of the trial. The Sponsor 
will inform the regulatory authorities and all IEC of safety issues which might materially alter the 
benefit-risk assessment of the investigational agents. 
 Standards for Expedited Reporting 
Cases of adverse drug reactions from all sources that are assessed as SUSARs are subject to expedited reporting. Additionally, any safety information from other observations that could change the risk benefit evaluation of the product should be prom ptly communicated to the regulatory authorities. 
A n y  o t h e r  S U S A R s  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  i n v e s t i g a t i o n a l  p r o d u c t  s h o u l d  b e  r e p o r t e d  a s  s o o n  a s  t h e  
Sponsor becomes aware of them and this includes SUSARs which occur in another trial conducted by 
the same Sponsor, or which are identified by spontaneous reports or a publication, or which are 
transmitted to the Sponsor by another regulatory authority.

 Reporting of Out-of-range Laborato ry Test Results as Adverse Events 
Out-of-range laboratory test results should be repo rted as AEs (not as abno rmal laboratory values, 
i.e., report as anemia not low hemoglobin) if, in the opinion of the principal investigator, they are 
clinically significant. Abnormal laboratory results that are not considered to be clinically significant will not be reported as AEs. Significance of abnormal laboratory results should be documented in the study records.  
 Reporting Guidelines for Other Observations 
Other safety issues that also qualify for expedite d reporting where they mi ght materially alter the 
current benefit risk assessment of the investigational product (sufficient to consider changes in the 
administration or in the overall conduct of the trial), for instance include: 
 An increase in the rate of occu rrence of an expected serious ad verse reaction, which is judged 
to be clinically important  
 A post study SUSAR that occurs after the patient has completed a clinical trial and is reported 
by the investigator to the Sponsor 
Events which occur during the trial and are relevant in terms of patient safety, but which do not fall 
within the definition of SUSAR (and thus are not subject to the reporting requirements for SUSARs) 
are:   
 An SAE which could be associated with the trial procedures and which could modify the conduct of the trial 
 A significant hazard to the patient population su ch as lack of efficacy of an investigational 
medicinal product 
 A major safety finding from a newly completed animal study (such as carcinogenicity) 
 A temporary halt of a trial for safety reasons if the trial is conducted with the same 
investigational medicinal product in another country by the same Sponsor 
 Safety recommendations of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
Although these events/observations will not be reported as SUSARs, they might require other action, 
such as putting in place urgent safety measures, the generation of substantial amendments, or early 
termination of the trial. The Sponsor will inform the regulatory authorities and the IECs of safety issues 
which might materially alter the benefit-risk asse ssment of the investigational medicinal product. 
Expedited reporting is not usually required for re actions that are serious but expected, or for non-
serious adverse reactions whether expected or not. 
It is usually also inappropriate to report events that are considered unrelated to the investigational 
medicinal product.

 Pregnancy Reporting 
Pregnancy will be reported throug h the Pregnancy Reporting Form (paper) as well as in the eCRF as 
an AE. The Pregnancy form (paper) should be completed and reported as indicated to the CRO 
Pharmacovigilance Team within 24 hours of bein g made aware of the event. Pregnancy will be 
considered as an AE and also reported in the eCRF. Women who become pregnant during the study 
will be withdrawn from treatment at the earliest opportunity. The investigator shall report all pregnancies immediately to the CRO. The CRO will then notify the Sponsor within 1 business day of 
being informed of the event. Following withdrawal  from the study, every attempt will be made to 
follow the patient and any resulting offspring fo r up to 6-weeks postpartum, unless otherwise 
medically indicated. Abortion, stillbirth, or any malformation/disease in the offspring must be 
reported as an SAE.  
For men participating in the study who report the preg nancy of a partner, the investigator will ask to 
collect information about the results of the pregnancy/birth using the Pregnant Partner forms. The 
partner may be asked to sign a consent form giving permission for information to be collected. This 
health information will become part of the research study records. It will be shared with the Sponsor. 
 Investigator’s Responsibilities 
The investigator is responsible for the collection of  AE data. All AEs should be recorded in the eCRF. 
The investigator shall report all SAEs immediately within 24 hours of being made aware of the event 
to Pharmacovigilance via the clinical database by completing as much info rmation as possible and 
checking Yes when prompted whether the event is cl assified as an SAE in the AEs eCRF. The initial 
reporting can be supplemented by written reports using the SAE report form provided.  
The follow up reports (if required) shall identify the trial patients by unique code numbers assigned to 
the patient. The investigator shall supply the Sp onsor with any additional requested information, 
notably for reported deaths of a patient. All SAEs that occur between obtaining the patient’s Informed Consent and 90 days after the last dose 
of study drug must be reported promptly to the CR O not later than 24 hours after the investigators or 
co-investigators become aware of their occurre nce using the SAE eCRF in the study database. 
The SAE eCRF is accessed via the study database. The following minimum information is required for 
the report: 
 Patient identification (patient number and date of birth)  
 Trial number  
 Study therapy (dose, route, form, regime, start date, end date)  
 Concomitant medication (including dose, rout e, form, regime, start date where available)  
 Nature of SAE (overall diagnosis where available or alternatively signs and symptoms)  
 Date and time of occurrence  
 Any associated factors (concomi tant disease or medication) 
 Proposed relationship  to study therapy

 Outcome  
 Identify the reporter 
 Action in relation to study (withdrawn from treatment, suspended, none)  
The investigators or co-investigators are required to sign the SAE submission electronically in the 
clinical database within 24 hours of awareness of the event, even if the required information is incomplete or if the investigators are awaiting laboratory or diagnostic reports. Investigators may be asked for additional information for any reported SAE. An SAE follow up report with attached documents (if necessary) should be forwarded to CRO Pharmacovigilance as soon as the additional 
information is available by email. The study number IMCgp100-102 must be in the title of any email 
for study identification purposes.  
 Sponsor and Clinical Research Organization’s Responsibilities 
The Sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety eval uation of the investigational drugs being studied. 
The Sponsor and CRO are responsibl e for ensuring that expedited reports are made to all concerned 
investigators, to the IEC where required, and to all regulatory authorities of all adverse drug reactions 
that are both serious and unexpected, or findings th at could adversely affect the health of patients, 
impact on the conduct of the trial, or alter the competent authority’s authorization to continue the 
trial in accordance with local applicable regulations.

9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSES 
 General Principles 
Data from Phase 1 will be summarized after approximately 80% of patients in Phase 1 have completed 
study treatment. Data will be presented by dose cohort and overall. At the end of Phase 2, any 
additional data collected for patients remaining on treatment after the Phase 1 data cut-off will be 
included in the final clinical study report. 
For the Phase 1 escalation cohort, data will be repo rted based on all patient data up to the time when 
all patients have completed a minimum of 6 cycles of treatment or have discontinued the study. An 
updated analysis of DOR, PFS, and OS may be performed. Data will be presented by dose cohort and 
overall. 
For the Phase 2 expansion cohort, the primary an alysis of the study will be conducted after 
approximately 120 evaluable patients have been enro lled and treated/followed for at least 9 months. 
The primary analysis of Phase 2 will summarize data from the overall expansion cohort (approximately 
n=120 patients).  
In order to explore whether results are consistent across prior therapy groups, key endpoints may be 
further summarized by prior therapy groups (for exam ple:  1 systemic therapy and 1 LDT; 1-2 systemic 
therapies only; 1 LDT only, 1 checkpoint inhibitor and any LDT). Further details around the analysis plan, including any additional reporting of DOR, P FS, and OS with longer-term follow up that may be 
required will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Categorical data will be presented as frequencies 
and percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
will be presented. 
The following rules will be followed for re porting results unless stated otherwise: 
 Screen failure patients are those who signed the informed consent, but never started the 
study treatment for any reason. For these pati ents, the eCRF data collected will not be 
included in analyses, but will be reported in the clinical study report as separate listings 
 Baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first dose of treatment received (i.e., 
C1D1 pre-dose) 
 Additional analyses not described here wi ll be detailed in the SAP for the study 
 Analysis Sets 
 Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients assigned to treatment,  who received at least 1 full or 
partial dose of IMCgp100 . The FAS will be used for all demography, baseline characteristics, and 
efficacy data summaries and analyses.  
 PROTOCOL NUMBER:  IMCgp100-102 
Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 117 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
 Safety Analysis Set 
The Safety Set includes all patients who have received at least 1 full or partial dose of IMCgp100. 
Patients will be classified in this set according to initial treatment received. The safety set will be used 
for the safety summary of the study. 
 Per-protocol Analysis Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) consists of a subset of FAS patients who meet these 4 criteria:  (1) presence 
of measurable disease, (2) 1 post-baseline tumor assessment or discontinue prior to the first tumor 
assessment,  (3) received at least 1 dose of treatmen t and, (4) no violation of key inclusion or exclusion 
criteria.  
Patients in the PPS will be classified according to planned treatment. The PPS will define the patients 
used in the sensitivity analysis of the secondary endpoints. If the PPS and the FAS are identical, then 
analyses described by the PPS below will not be performed. 
 Patient Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data, baseline disease characteristics and other baseline data will be listed in detail. 
Qualitative data (e.g., performance status) and quantitative data (e.g., weight) will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics. 
 Treatment Data 
Actual dose and duration in days of treatment for IMCgp100, as well as, the dose intensity (actual dose 
received/actual duration) and relative dose intensity (the ratio of dose intensity to planned 
dose/planned duration) will be summarized by descriptive statistics by treatment group.  
Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies prior to and after the start of the study 
treatment will be listed by patient and summarized by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical term and treatment group. 
The reason for discontinuation from treatment will be  summarized and listed, along with dates of first 
and last doses, duration of exposure to each study drug, and date of discontinuation for each patient. 
 Primary Analysis 
 Variables 
The primary variable in the Phase 1 dose escalation phase of the study is the incidence of DLT. The primary variable in the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the study is ORR by RECISTv.1.1 assessed 
by ICR.

 Secondary Analyses 
 Efficacy 
Analysis of efficacy endpoints will be perf ormed using the FAS unless otherwise noted. 
For the Phase 1 escalation cohorts, tumor-based en dpoints will be assessed using local investigator 
assessment and ICR where available for both RECISTv.1.1 and modified irRECIST. For the Phase 2 
expansion cohorts, tumor-based endpoints will be assessed using ICR data for both RECIST v1.1 and modified irRECIST. ORR and other RECIST-based endpoints as assessed by the local radiologist will be 
summarized as a sensitivity analysis. 
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease with at least 1 visit response of 
CR or PR that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later, as defined in RECIST v.1.1.  
The denominator in the calculation of the ORR w ill be the number of patients in the FAS with 
measurable disease at baseline. Data obtained up until progression, or last evaluable assessment in 
the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. However, any CR or PR, which 
occurred after further anti -cancer therapy was received, will not be included in the numerator of the 
ORR calculation. Disease control rate is defined as  the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of CR or PR or SD recorded at least 24  weeks (± 1 week) after commencement of study drug 
and prior to any PD event. 
For all efficacy parameters , data will be listed, summarized, or analyzed by treatment group (dose 
cohort) for the Phase 1 dose escalation and overall for the Phase 2 expansion cohorts.  In order to explore whether the Ph ase 2 efficacy results are consistent across prior therapy groups, 
key endpoints (including ORR and DoR) may be further summarized by prior therapy groups (for 
example:  1 systemic therapy and 1 LDT; 1-2 systemic therapies only; 1 LDT only, 1 checkpoint inhibitor 
and any LDT).  
Further subset analyses of efficacy by LDH (above or below institutional ULN) and hepatic metastases 
(present or absent) may be performed if an ad equate number of patients with and without the 
prognostic factor are available for analysis (Valpione, 2015). 
ORR and DCR will be summarized with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. 
PFS, along with DOR and time to response for patients  who experience a CR or PR at any time on study 
will be listed by patient. 
PFS will be presented graphically using Kaplan Meie r plots for all patients in the Phase 2 expansion 
cohorts. Median PFS time and the proportion of pati ents who are progression-free at 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months will also be estimated. If there are a large number of patients achieving response (e.g., 
estimated ORR of 30%), the Kaplan-Meier plots for DOR will also be produced and the median DOR 
will be estimated. OS will be presented graphically using Kaplan Meier plots including all patients from 
the Phase 2 expansion. Median OS time and the proportion of patients who are alive at 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months will be estimated. 
The secondary endpoint to determine the rate and dur ation of MinR, defined as a reduction in the SLD 
of 10%–29% will be explored by:  (1) summaries of the number (%) of MinR and associated durations; 
(2) summaries of the overall ORR + MinR and associated durations; and (3) waterfall plots of SLDs.

The secondary endpoint to determine the rate and dura tion of immune responses will be detailed in 
the SAP and be largely based on methods described by Gao et al. In summary, for each patient, the 
percentage change in the target lesion sum of long est diameters will be plot ted over time and an AUC 
will be calculated over a fixed time-period (e.g.,  9 months) post initial dose of IMCgp100. The AUC 
reflects both the depth and duration of tumor size  reduction and may capture a delayed benefit of 
immunotherapy (Gao et al). Hepatic volume data will also be plotted and may be incorporated into 
the criteria for immune response.  
Exploratory tumor assessments based on modified irRECIST will also be presented summarizing the 
best response by irRECIST and this will be compared with the best response from RECISTv.1.1. 
The SAP will provide more detailed information on th e data summaries for the Phase 1 dose escalation 
and the Phase 2 dose expansion.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Safety Objectives 
9.6.2.1 Analysis Set and Grouping for the Analyses 
For all safety analyses, the safety set will be used.  
The overall observation period will be divided into 3 mutually exclusive segments: 
1. Pre-treatment period:  from day of patient’s informed consent to the day before first dose of 
study medication 
2. On-treatment period:  from day of first dose of study medication to 90 days after last dose of 
study medication 
3. Post-treatment period:  starting at Day 31 after last dose of study medication 
9.6.2.2 Adverse Events 
Summary tables for AEs include only AEs that are new or worsened during the on-treatment period 
(treatment-emergent AEs). However, all safety data (including those from the pre- and post-treatment 
periods) will be listed and thos e collected during the pre-treatment and post-treatment period are to 
be flagged. 

 PROTOCOL NUMBER:  IMCgp100-102 
Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 120 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class and/or preferred 
term, severity (based on NCI CTCAE v.4.03 grades),  type of AE, and relation to study treatment by 
treatment group. Deaths reportable as SAEs and non- fatal SAEs will be listed by patient and tabulated 
by type of AE and treatment group. 
Definitions of notably abnormal vital signs results (e.g., hypotension) will be specified in the SAP and 
a shift table baseline to worst on-treatment result will be produced by the Phase 1 dose escalation 
and Phase 2 dose expansion groups. 
9.6.2.3 Laboratory Abnormalities 
For laboratory tests covered by th e NCI CTCAE version 4.03 the study team will grade laboratory data 
accordingly. For laboratory tests covered by NCI CTCA E, a grade 0 will be assigned for all non-missing 
values not graded as 1 or higher. For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE, results 
will be graded by the low/normal/high classifications based on laboratory normal ranges. 
The following by-treatment summaries will be generated separately for hematology, biochemistry, 
and other laboratories: 
 Frequency table for newly occurring on-treatment grades 3 or 4 and all grades 
 Shift tables of laboratory and ECG data using CTCAE grades to compare Baseline to the worst 
on-treatment value 
 Listing of all clinically relevant laboratory data and relevant ECG data with values flagged to 
show the corresponding CTCAE grades and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal 
ranges 
9.6.2.4 Other Safety Variables 
 Vital signs absolute values and changes from Baseline will be summarized. Normal ranges will be 
specified in the SAP and shift tables of Baseline to worst on-treatment results will be produced 
 ECG data:  QTc interval absolute values and changes from Baseline will be summarized. Abnormalities will be classified according to NCI CTCAE grades and shift tables of Baseline to worst on-treatment results will be presented  
 Physical examination data will be listed and abnormalities will be flagged 
9.6.2.5 Tolerability 
Tolerability of study treatment will be assessed by summarizing the number of treatment dose 
interruptions and dose reductions. Reasons for dose interruptions and dose reductions will be listed 
by patient and summarized. 
9.6.2.6 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK parameters that will be assessed are presented in Table 9-1 .

(volume) 
AR Accumulation Ratio=C max (multiple dose)/C max (single dose) 
The safety set will be used in all PK data analysis and PK summary statistics. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Descriptive statistics of all PK parameters for IMCgp100 will include arithmetic and geometric mean, 
median, stable disease, and coefficient of variatio n, geometric coefficient of variation, and minimum 
and maximum. Zero concentrations will not be incl uded in the geometric mean calculation. Since T max 
is generally evaluated by a non-parametric method, median values and ranges will be given for this 
parameter. Missing concentration valu es will be reported as is in data listings. Concentration values 
below lower limit of quantitation will be handled as 0 in summary statistics, and reported as is in data 
listings. Any missing PK paramete r data will not be imputed. 
Further analyses may be conducted using populat ion PK approaches. In addition, a model based 
approach may be used to explore the potential relationship between efficacy, safety, and/or 
biomarker endpoints and IMCgp100 concentration a nd/or exposure metrics. All analyses will be 
reported either in the clinical st udy report or a stand-alone report. 
The concentration-/AE-immunogenici ty relationship will be explored graphically and tabulated to 
characterize a relationship between the changes from screening immunogenicity presence and serum 
concentration of IMCgp100. Further details will be described in the SAP.

 Interim Analysis 
For the Phase 1 cohorts, the dose-escalation design foresees that decisions based on the current data 
are taken before the end of the study. More precisely, after each cohort in the dose escalation part, 
the next dose will be chosen depending on the ob served data (based on safety, tolerability, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data, and recommenda tions from participating investigators). Details 
of this procedure and the process for communication with investigators are provided in Section 6.3.3 . 
For the Phase 2 expansion (approximately n=150), an IDMC will review the safety data on an ongoing 
basis. In addition, a benefit-risk assessment involving review of efficacy and safety data will take place 
once approximately 75 evaluable patients  have b een treated/followed for at least six months. The 
primary endpoint of ORR, as assessed by the ICR,  will be summarised with 95% confidence intervals 
(Clopper Pearson method).  ORR based on the local radiological assessment will be summarised as a sensitivity analysis.   Duration of response and ot her secondary efficacy endpoints will be described. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will be established to provide oversight of  safety and efficacy considerations in the Phase 2 
expansion portion of this study. The IDMC will act in an advisory capacity and make recommendations 
regarding steps to ensure both subject safety and the ethical integrity of the trial. The voting members of the committee are external to Immunocore, and wi ll not otherwise be involved with the trial. The 
IDMC will include 3 clinicians experienced in onco logy/melanoma and 1 statistician. Specific details 
regarding IDMC responsibilities, governance, and documentation will be described in a separate 
charter that is reviewed and appr oved by the IDMC members. Immuno core has primary responsibility 
for design and conduct of the study. 
The IDMC will monitor trial safety approximately ev ery 4 months, or at a frequency described in the 
IDMC charter. In addition, they will perform a benefit-risk assessment by reviewing both efficacy and 
safety data after approximately 75 evaluable patients in the expansion phase have been treated/followed for at least 6 months.  
Following each IDMC meeting, the IDMC will provid e recommendations to the Sponsor on any changes 
that may be needed to the future conduct of the study or if the study should continue as planned.

 Sample Size Calculation 
 Phase 1 Dose Escalation Cohorts 
Cohorts of 3 to 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation part including at least 6 
patients at the MTD or RP2D in th e RP2D-IE level, as described in Section 6.3 . Multiple cohorts may be 
sequentially enrolled to the same dose level. Additi onal cohorts of 1 to 6 patients may be enrolled at 
any dose level below the estimated MTD/RP2D-IE for further elaboration of sa fety and PK parameters 
as required.  
 Phase 2 Dose Expansion Cohorts  
The Phase 2 expansion cohorts of approximately 150 patients,including a minimum of 120 patients for RECIST evaluation, will provide a substantive dataset of safety, tolerability, and efficacy in uniform patient populations. Patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts as described in Section 3.2 : 
The primary analysis of the Phase 2 expansion will focus on the overall Phase 2 population. With 120 
patients and an observed ORR of 10% or more, the precision around the estimation of ORR as assessed by 95% confidence intervals will be 5.3% to 16.8%. Th e study will also provide an adequate number of 
patients in which to assess the safety and tolerability of the RP2D-IE. For example, for AEs of interest, 
if 0 AEs are observed in a cohort of 120 patients, there will be 95% confidence that the true event rate 
is less than 3%. For 150 patents there will be 95% confidence that the true event rate is less than 2.4%.  
In addition, the Phase 2 expansion data will provide an assessment of whether OS may exceed that 
achieved with currently available therapies,  
 
 
An IDMC will review safety data on an ongoing basis (approximately every 4 months) in conjunction 
with a review of safety data from the ongoing randomized study (IMCgp100- 202). An interim review 
of both efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 expansion will be perf ormed by the IDMC after 
approximately 75 evaluable patients have been trea ted/followed for at least 6 months to enable an 
overall assessment of risk versus benefit.

10 DATA HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT 
 Data Confidentiality 
Information about study patients will be kept conf idential and managed under the applicable laws and 
regulations. Those regulations re quire a signed patient authorization informing the patient of the 
protected health information that wi ll be collected and the use or disc losure of that information. If 
the patient revokes authorization to collect or use this information, the investigator, by regulation, 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient authorization. To 
protect the health information of study patients, access to the data collection system will be controlled by a sequence of individual user identification codes and passwords that are made available only to 
authorized trained personnel. 
 Site Monitoring 
Before study initiation at trial sites, Sponsor and/ or CRO study team members will review the protocol 
and eCRFs with the investigators and the site study st aff. During the study, the field monitor will visit 
the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol to good clinical practi ce, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that 
study treatments are being stored, dispensed, a nd accounted for according to specifications. Key 
study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. The investigator must 
assure that the site monitor is allowed access to all study files, including all site medical records, case 
and visit notes and laboratory reports.   
 Data Collection 
The investigator is required to maintain source docu ments for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (site medical records), co ntaining demographic and medical information, 
laboratory data, ECGs, and the resu lts of any other tests or assessments. All information recorded in 
the eCRF must be traceable to source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep 
the original signed ICF, with 1 signed copy given to the patient. 
This study will use an electronic data capture (EDC) system and the principal investigator and site study 
staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRF. The eCRF ha ve been built using fully 
validated secure web-enabled software that conforms  to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. The principal 
investigator and all identified site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been 
trained. The principal investigator is responsible for assuring that the data entered into eCRF is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. Field monitors will review the eCRF data entries and assist site personnel with any required corrections or additions. 
Tissue samples obtained during the study (e.g., tumor, blood for PK or other analyses) will be collected 
from the investigator sites and analyzed by Immuno core laboratories , contracted cent ral laboratories, 
or local laboratories. Radiological assessments will be reviewed retrospectively in a central repository 
as described. Field monitors will review the eCRF and laboratory paper requis ition forms for accuracy 
and completeness and instruct site personnel to make  any required corrections or additions. One copy 
of the requisition form will be forwarded to each analytical laboratory with the respective sample by the site staff and 1 copy will be retained at the investigational site.

site personnel with any required corrections or addi tions. Electronic data queries stating the nature 
of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and 
sent to the investigational site via the EDC system.  
Concomitant treatment and prior medication data in  the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Medical history, current 
medical conditions and AEs in the database will be  coded using the Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory 
Activities terminology. After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD-ROM of the patient data 
for archiving at the investigational site.

11 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES 
 Regulatory and Ethical Compliance 
This clinical study was designed, shall be implemented and reported in accordance with the ICH 
Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R2), with applicable local regulations 
(including European Directive 2001/20/EC and Unites States Code of Federal Regulations, CFR Title 
21), and with the ethical principles laid  down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Responsibilities of the Inve stigator and Institutional Review Board/Independent 
Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board 
The protocol and the proposed ICF must be reviewed  and approved by a properly constituted IRB or 
IEC or Research Ethics Board (REB) before study start.  Prior to study start, the investigator is required 
to sign a protocol signature page confirming agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these 
documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all 
relevant data and records to field monitors, auditors, IQVIA Clinical Quality Assurance representatives, 
designated agents of Sponsor, the IRB or IEC or REB and regulatory authorities as required. 
 Informed Consent Procedures 
The Investigator (according to applicable regulato ry requirements), or a person designated by the 
Investigator and under the Investigator's responsibili ty, should fully inform th e patient of all pertinent 
aspects of the Clinical Trial. All pa rticipants should be informed to th e fullest extent possible about the 
study, both verbally and in written language and term s they are able to understand. Eligible patients 
may only be included in the study after providin g written (witnessed, where required by law or 
regulation) IRB/IEC/REB-approved informed consent which documents their authorization, or if the patient is incapable of doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable/authorized representative of the patient.  In cases where the patient’s representative gives 
consent, the patient should be informed about the st udy to the extent possible given his/her level of 
understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he or she should indicate assent by personally 
signing and dating the written informed consent document. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conduct ing any study-specific procedures; the 1 exception 
to this note are radiologic assessments performe d before Screening within the specified window. A 
copy of the signed and dated written ICF will be provided to the patient and/or legal representative, 
where appropriate. The process of obtaining inform ed consent should be documented in the patient 
source documents. The date when a patient’s informed  consent was actually obtained will be captured 
in the eCRF. 
The ICF used by the Investigator for obtaining the patient's informed consent must be reviewed and 
approved by the Sponsor prior to submission to the appropriate Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for approval/favorable opinion.

 Discontinuation of the Study 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study under the co nditions specified in the clinical 
study agreement. Specific conditions fo r terminating the study are outlined in Section 3.6 . 
 Publication of Study Protocol and Results 
The Sponsor will publish the key design elements of this protocol in a publicly accessible database 
(clinicaltrials.gov). At the time of study and clinical  study report completion, the results of this study 
will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database. 
 Study Documentation, Record Keeping, and Retention of Documents 
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research reco rds for this trial, in 
compliance with Section 4. 9 of the ICH E6 (R2) Good Clinical Pr actice, and regulatory and institutional 
requirements for the protection of confidentiality of patients. Each site will permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor and regulatory ag encies to examine any clinical records for the 
purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study safety and progress. Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical tr ial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
Principal Investigator. The study eCRF is the prim ary data collection instrument for the study. The 
investigator should ensure the ac curacy, completeness, legibility, an d timeliness of the data reported 
in the CRFs and all other required reports. Data reported on the CRF, that are derived from source 
documents, should be consistent with the source do cuments or the discrepancies should be explained. 
All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  
The investigator should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essential Documents for the 
Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6 Section 8) and as required by applicable regulations and guidelines. The investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents should be retained for a period of not less than 15 years from the 
completion of the Clinical Trial unless Sponsor pr ovides written permission to dispose of them or, 
requires their retention for an addi tional period of time because of  applicable laws, regulations and 
guidelines. 
 Confidentiality of Study Documents and Patient Records 
The investigator must ensure anonymity of the patients; patients mu st not be identified by names in 
any documents submitted to Immunocore or the CRO. Signed ICFs and patient enrollment log must 
be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site. 
 Audits and Inspections 
Source data and all trial documents must be available to inspections by the Sponsor, the CRO, or designee or Health Authorities.

13 APPENDICES 
 Appendix 1:  Guidelines for Modified RECISTv.1.1 Criteria  
These guidelines are based on th e original RECIST for tumor respon ses (Therasse, 2000), and the revised 
RECIST v.1.1 guidelines (Eisenhauer, 2009). The efficacy  assessments and definition s of best response and 
PD for the purposes of the primary endpoint of ORR desc ribed in this study are based on the RECIST v.1.1 
criteria.  
 Efficacy Assessments 
Tumor evaluations for the purposes of the primary endpo int are made based on RECIST criteria (Therasse, 
2000), New Guidelines to Evaluate the Re sponse to Treatment in Solid Tumors, Journal of National Cancer 
Institute , Volume 92; pages 205–216 and revised RECIST gu idelines (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer, 2009). 
 Definitions of Measurable and Non-measurable Disease 
Measurable disease  represents the presence of at least 1 measurable nodal or non-nodal lesion. If the 
measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesi on, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
cytology/histology. 
Measurable lesions (both nodal and non-nodal):  Measurab le non-nodal — the minimum size of a 
measurable non-nodal target lesion at Baseline should  be no less than double the slice thickness or 10mm 
whichever is greater — e.g., the minimum non-nodal lesi on size for CT/MRI with 5 mm cuts will be 10 mm. 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lesions  with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by 
CT/MRI can be considered as measurable lesions, if  the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability. Measurable nodal lesions (i.e., lymph nodes) — Lymph nodes  15 mm in short axis can be 
considered for selection as target lesions. Lymph nodes measuring  10 mm and < 15 mm are considered 
non-measurable. Lymph nodes smaller than 10 mm in short axis at Baseline, regardless of the slice 
thickness, are normal and not considered indicative of disease. 
Cystic lesions  thought to represent cystic metastases can be  considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above.  Simple cysts with non-enhancing walls and low CT 
density are not considered malignant lesions unless proven by biopsy. Non-measurable lesions :  All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including small lesions (e.g., 
longest diameter < 10 mm with CT/MRI or pathological lymph nodes with   10 to < 15 mm short axis), as 
well as truly non-measurable lesions e.g., blastic bone lesions, ascites, pleura l/pericardial effusion, and 
inflammatory breast disease.

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 133 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
 Methods of Tumor Measurement  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in me tric notation (mm), using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of 
a treatment. For optimal evaluation of patients, the same methods of assessment and technique should be used to assess each reported lesion at Baseline and during Follow-up. Contrast-enhanced CT of chest, 
abdomen and pelvis should preferably be performed using a 5 mm slice thickness. If a patient is known to have a medical contraindication to CT contrast or  develops a contraindication during the trial, the 
following change in imaging modality will be accepted for follow up:  a non-contrast CT of chest (MRI not 
recommended due to respiratory artifacts) plus contrast-enhanced MRI of abdomen and pelvis. 
Other Tumor Response Considerations 
MRI for liver disease:  In some instances, liver disease in patients with UM can be imaged more effectively 
with MRI.  
Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, Endoscopy and Laparoscopy :  The utilization of PET 
imaging, endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumo r evaluation has not yet been fully and widely 
validated. The utilization of such techniques for ob jective tumor response sh ould be restricted to 
validation purposes in specialized centers; however, su ch techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when  biopsies are obtained. 
Cytology and histology :  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases (i.e., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).  
Clinical examination :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (i.e., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Clinical disease 
progression is acceptable and wherever possible should be confirmed by imaging studies.  
 Definitions of Target and Non-target Lesions 
For the evaluation of lesions at Baseline and throughout  the study, the lesions are classified at Baseline as 
either target or non-target lesions: Target Lesions :  All measurable lesions (nodal and non-nodal) up to a maximum of 5 lesions in total (and 
a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at Baseline. Target lesions should be selected based on size (lesions 
with the longest diameter) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically).

Investigational Product:  IMCgp100 
 
Version 8.0 26 November 2018 134 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
Each target lesion must be uniquely and sequentially num bered on the eCRF (even if it resides in the same 
organ). A sum of diameters (long axis for non-nodal lesi ons, short axis for nodal) for all target lesions will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used 
as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. Each target lesion identified at 
Baseline must be followed at each subsequent evaluation and documented on eCRF.  
Non-target Lesions :  All other lesions are considered non-target lesions, i.e., lesions not fulfilling the 
criteria for target lesions at Baseline. Presence or absence or worsening of non-target lesions should be 
assessed throughout the study; measurements of thes e lesions are not required. Multiple non-target 
lesions involved in the same organ can be assessed as a group and recorded as a single item (i.e., multiple 
liver metastases). Each non-target lesion identified  at Baseline must be followed at each subsequent 
evaluation and documented on eCRF. 
 Determination of Target Lesion Response 
Table 13-1 Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response Criteria Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological 
lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis 
to < 10 mm1 
Partial Response At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
Progressive Disease At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest  sum of diameter of all target lesions 
recorded at or after Baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm2 
Stable Disease Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response or complete response nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease 
1. Sum of diameters for complete response may not be 0 when nodal lesions are part of target lesions. 
2. Following an initial complete response, progressive disease cannot be assigned if all non-nodal target 
lesions are still not present and all nodal lesions are < 10 mm in size. In  this case, the target lesion 
response is complete response. 
Notes on Target Lesion Response  
 Lesions split :  In some circumstances, disease that is me asurable as a target lesion at Baseline and 
appears to be 1 mass can split to become 2 or mo re smaller sub-lesions. When this occurs, the 
diameters (long axis — non-nodal lesion, short axis - nodal lesions) of the 2 split lesions should be 
added together and the sum recorded in the diameter field on the case report form under the 
original lesion number. This value will be included in the sum of diameters when deriving target

lesion response. The individual split lesions will not be considered as new lesions, and will not 
automatically trigger a PD designation 
 Lesions coalesced :  Conversely, it is also possible that 2 or more lesions which were distinctly 
separate at Baseline become confluent at subsequent visits. When this occurs a plane between 
the original lesions may be maintained that would aid in obtaining diameter measurements of 
each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, 
the maximal diameters (long axis — non-nodal lesion, short axis - nodal lesions) of the “merged 
lesion” should be used when ca lculating the sum of diameters fo r target lesions. On the case 
report form, the diameter of the “merged lesion” should be recorded for the size of 1 of the original lesions while a size of “0”mm should be entered for the remaining lesion numbers which 
have coalesced 
 Determination of Non-target Lesion Response 
Table 13-2 Response Criteria for Non-target Lesions  
Response Criteria Evaluation of Non-target Lesions 
Complete Response Disappearance of all non-target lesions. In addition, all lymph 
nodes assigned non-target lesions must be non-pathological in 
size (< 10 mm short axis) 
Progressive Disease Unequivocal prog ression of existing non-target lesions1 
Non-complete response/  
Non-progressive disease Neither complete response nor progressive disease 
1. Although a clear progression of non-target lesions only is except ional, in such circumstances, the 
opinion of the treating physician do es prevail and the progression stat us should be confirmed later on by 
the central review. 
Non-target Lesion Response  
 The response for non-target lesions is CR only if all non-target non-nodal lesions which were 
evaluated at Baseline are now all ab sent and with all non-target nodal lesions returned to normal 
size (i.e., < 10 mm). If any of the non-target lesions are still present, or there are any abnormal 
nodal lesions (i.e.,  10 mm) the response can only be ‘Non-CR/Non-PD’  
 Unequivocal progression:  To achieve “unequivo cal progression” on the basis of non-target 
disease there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, 
even in presence of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)  in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. In order for a PD to be assigned on the 
basis of non-target lesions, the increase in the ex tent of the disease must be substantial even in 
cases where there is no measurable disease at Baseline

Version 8.0 26 November 2018 136 of 138 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
New Lesions 
The appearance of a new lesion is al ways associated with PD and has to be recorded as a new lesion in 
the eCRF. 
 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example becaus e of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents trul y new disease. If repeat  scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the first observation 
of the lesion 
 If new disease is observed in a region which wa s not scanned at Baseline or where the particular 
baseline scan is not available for some reason , then this should be considered PD  
 A lymph node is considered as a “new lesion” and, therefore, indicative of PD if the short axis 
increases in size to  10 mm for the first time in the study plus 5 mm absolute increase 
 Evaluation of Overall Lesion Response 
The evaluation of overall lesion response at each  assessment is a composite of the target lesion 
response, non-target lesion response and pr esence of new lesions as shown below in 
Table 13-3 . 
 Table 13-3 Overall Lesion Response at Each Assessment  
Target Lesions Non-target Lesions New Lesions Overall Lesion Response

CR Non-CR/Non-PD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR1 
SD Non-PD No SD1, 2 
PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR = complete response; PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease. 
1. This overall lesion response also applies when t here are no non-target lesions identified at Baseline.
2. Once confirmed PR was achieved, a ll these assessments are considered PR.

response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok, 2009; Nishino, 2013) that is based upon World Health Organization 
criteria for tumor response evaluation utilizing bi-dimensional criteria. Nishino, et al, demonstrated that 
the irRC could be imp lemented using unidimensiona l criteria (Nishino, 2013). So me further modifications 
were proposed to further align the immune-related criteria with RECISTv.1.1 and this approach has been 
named irRECIST criteria (Bohnsack, 2014).  
A further modification to the guidance is implemented in this study, such that for patients who continue 
IMCgp100 therapy beyond initial PD, unequivocal, confir med PD is defined as an additional 20% increase 
in tumor burden (sum of diameters of both targ et and measurable new lesions) or unequivocal 
progression of NTLs and/or new non-measurable disease from the initial PD assessment per RECISTv1.1 
rather than from the nadir. This modification is based on early observations of prolonged disease 
stabilization with IMCgp100 beyond pr ogression in the dose escalation cohorts of this study (Sato, 2017). 
This definition is referred to in the protocol as irPD per modified irRECIST.  
The key modifications between the RECISTv.1.1 a ssessments and modified irRECIST assessments are 
described below.  
 Key Changes from RECIST v.1.1 to Modified irRECIST Criteria  
13.2.1.1 Total Measured Tumor Burden 
Baseline-selected target lesions and new measurable  lesions should NOT be assessed separately but 
combined for the total tumor burden . Measurements of those lesions should be combined into the total 
measured tumor burden (TMTB), and 1 combined assessment provided. 
13.2.1.2 New Measurable Lesions 
According to irRC (Wolchok, 2009), a me asurable new lesion has to be at least 5 mm × 5 mm to be selected 
as an index lesion; for bi-dimensional measurements th is threshold was acceptable. In irRECIST, criteria 
for unidimensional lesion measurement apply to both target and new measurable lesions:  a minimum 10 
mm in the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions, and a minimum 15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes 
(Bohnsack, 2014). Smaller lesions co ntribute to the non-target or new non-measurable tumor burden, but 
are not measured. 
13.2.1.3 Non-target Lesions  
In alignment with RECIST v.1.1, baseline selected no n-target lesions can never convert to measurable 
lesions, not even if they increase in size at subseq uent timepoints and become measurable. Only true new 
lesions measurable at first appearance can contribute  to the TMTB for irRECIST. For example:  A patient 
has multiple lung metastases, all smaller than 10 mm a nd selected as non-target le sions at Baseline. If, at

a subsequent timepoint some of these non-target lesions increase and become > 10 mm, and 1 new lesion 
>10 mm appears, only the new measurable lesion w ill contribute to the TMTB, and not the non-target 
lesions that increased in size from baseline.  
13.2.1.4 Immune-related Progressive Disease Based on Non-target Lesions  
Unlike irRC that neglect non-target lesions for th e assessment of irPD, in irRECIST a substantial and 
unequivocal increase of non-target lesions is indicative of progression. 
13.2.1.5 Immune-related Progressive Disease Based on New Non-measurable Lesions According to irRECIST, the reviewer may assign irPD  for the patient with multiple new non-measurable 
lesions if they are considered to be a si gn of unequivocal, massive worsening.  
13.2.1.6 Immune-related Progressive Disease Confirmation per modified irRECIST In this study, confirmed irPD is defined as an additi onal 20% increase in the total tumor burden (target 
lesions and any new measurable lesions) and/or in creased/further unequivocal progression of NTLs 
and/or new non measurable lesions from the initial assessment of PD per RECISTv.1.1. Confirmation of 
irPD progression should occur at least 4 weeks afte r the initial assessment of RECISTv.1.1 PD.Further 
confirmation of irPD after its occurrence is not requi red, but may be done at Investigator discretion.

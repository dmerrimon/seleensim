Study Design  
This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and activity of SXC -2023 (50 mg, 200 mg, or 800 mg QD) when dosed for 6 
weeks  compared  to placebo  in adult  subjects  diagnosed  with moderat e to severe  TTM.  Subjects  will 
be screened  and will perform  required  assessments  for eligibility  during  a 40-day screening  period. 
During the screening period,  subjects will be trained on site on how to use an electronic Patient 
Report  Outcome  (ePRO)  handheld  device  to complete  the TSD.  After  all screening  assessments  are 
complete, the subjects will complete the TSD at home ev ery evening for 7 consecutive days 
during the screening  period.  
On Study Day 1, eligible subjects will complete protocol -specified assessments and study 
procedures,  including  neurocognitive  and other  assessments,  and will be assigned  to receive  one of 
three doses of SXC -2023 or matching plac ebo. Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups  using 
a randomization scheme including a stratification factor for whether subjects are currently taking 
concomitant selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSR Is)/serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake 
inhib itors (SNRIs).  Subjects  will be instructed  to complete  the TSD  on their ePRO  handheld  device 
every 24 hours (just prior to bedtime) during the 6 -week treatment period. Subjects will be 
instructed  to take their study medication  at approximately  the same  time each day (preferably  in the 
morning  at least  1 hour prior  to or 2 hours  after a meal).  Subjects  will return  to the site to complete 
assessments at Week 3 (±4 days) and Week 6 (±4 days). Subjects will then return for follow -up at 
Week 8 (±4  days).  
Neuroco gnitive and other behavioral measurements (in addition to daily TSD completion) will 
include the following:  
Screening (neuroc ognitive and other behavioral measurements must be performed at one visit):  
• Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) ve rsion 7.0.2 with 
Trichotillomania and Body Dysmorphic Disorder modules  (MINI -TTM)  
• Training on the Cambridge Neuropsychologica l Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) iPad 
device which will be used for the SST, CGT, RTI, and  PAL  
• Training on the TSD on the ePRO han dheld device. Once trained, subject to complete the 
TSD on their ePRO handheld device every 24 hours for 7 days at  home.  
• Training on the PGI -S, PGI -C, CGI -S, and CGI -C software using the iPad  device  
• Barratt Impulsiveness Scale  (BIS)  
• MGH -HPS 
• Columbia Suicid e Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
Day 1  (Baseline):  
• SST, CGT, RTI, and PAL (completed using the CANTAB iPad  device)  
• MGH -HPS 
• PGI-S (completed using an iPad  device)  
• CGI-S (completed using an iPad  device)  
• C-SSRS  
• MIST -A 
Week 3 (±4  days):  
• MGH -HPS 
• PGI-S and PGI -C (completed using an iPad  device)

Safety will be evaluated via reports of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, physical 
examinations, vital signs, the C -SSRS, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and co ncomitant treatments. 
Evaluation of AEs will include assessment of changes in psychiat ric symptoms, including 
changes in emotions, cognition, or behavior, to determine whether changes are clinically 
significant (e.g., onset or exacerbation of depressed moo d) and possibly related to study drug.  
Whole blood samples for glutathione measurement s will be taken at baseline (prior to dosing) and 
at Week 6 (±4 days).  
Study Duration  
Subjects will be dosed for 38 to 46 consecutive days. The maximum anticipated subje ct 
participation will be approximately 100 days (40 days for the screening period, 6 weeks of 
treatment, and a follow -up visit on Day 60 at the latest). One 10 -day extension  of the 
screening period may be permitted on a case -by-case basis with medical moni tor or designee 
approval (e.g., if needed for adequate drug washout or additional ePRO training).  
Number of Subjects (Planned)  
Approximately 120 subjects are planned to be enrolled so that 100 subjects complete the study. In 
the event that a subject leave s the study (e.g., voluntarily withdraws, discontinues due to an AE, is 
lost to follow -up) prior to completing study procedures and assessments at the Week 3 visit, an 
addit ional subject may be randomized. Subjects who leave the study after the Week 3 visi t but 
before study completion will be considered as part of the final enrollment sample of 120 subjects.

3 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
3.1 Background  
 
Trichotillomania (TTM) is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by the recurrent pulling 
out of one’s hair as well as the associated distress or functional impairment caused by this 
condition. It was not until the late 1980s that TTM was included in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as an impulse control disorder. Recent studies 
have linke d perturbations in glutamatergic neurotransmission and/or heightened levels of 
oxidative  stress  to the underlying  pathophysiology  of TTM. Imaging  studies  conducted  in TTM 
patients identified alterations in areas of the brain, particularly those implicated in the 
regulation of urge control, rewarding behaviors, motor habits, mood, and executive function 
(Chamberlain  et al., 2008;  Chamberla in et al., 2010;  Grant  and Chamberlain,  2016;  Roos  et al., 
2015 ), as key contributors to  the pathophysiology of TTM and related impulse control 
disorders (e.g., excoriation disorder). Additionally, functional deficits in glutamate signaling 
within the cortical -striatal pathway and mesolimbic system (i.e., nucleus accu mbens) have 
been proposed  to contribute to the underlying pathology and symptoms of TTM ( Grant et al., 
2009 ). 
 
SXC -2023 is a novel small molecule and new chemical entity designed to activate System  xc- 
(also known as the cysteine glutamate antiport er). By increasing cyst(e)ine levels, SXC -2023 
increases the activity of System xc - in the brain. System xc - is express ed on astrocytes and 
neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) and its primary function is to couple the 
uptake of one extracellula r molecule of cystine to the release of one intracellular molecule of 
glutamate. As alterations in glutamate neurotrans mission and/or oxidative imbalances are 
proposed to underlie the pathology of TTM, this mechanism of action is important because 
activati on of System xc - is proposed to restore imbalances in oxidative stress and modulate 
glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain.  
 
SXC -2023  is currently  in clinical  development  (Investigational  New  Drug  [IND]  No. 133689) 
and proposed as a strategy to treat  TTM in  adults.  
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6.0 ( SXC -2023, 2019 ) for detailed background 
information  on SXC -2023.  
 
3.1.1 Preclinical Trials  
 
3.1.1.1  Pharmacology  
 
In preclinical rodent models, oral treatment with SXC -2023 was found to reduce anxiety 
behaviors as measured by an increase in the time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus 
maze  (a symptom  of many  psychiatric  disorders  and a clear  indication  of CNS  penetration)  and 
ameliorate N methyl -D-aspartate receptor antagonist (MK -801)-induced def icits in pre - pulse 
inhibition, which tests sensory motor behaviors dependent on cortical glutamatergic 
transmissio n. Additionally, acute and chronic (7 -day) administration of SXC -2023 
significantly lowered the number of lever presses to reinstatement coca ine-seeking behavior. 
These  studies,  coupled  with a study  using  rats engineered  to lack a functional  cystine -glutam ate 
Phase 2 Study Protocol

CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
antiporter  (specifically  the xCT light chain  protein),  suggest  that SXC -2023,  through  activation 
of System xc -, reverses deficits assoc iated with glutamatergic dysfunction and heightened 
levels of oxidative stress implicated in the patho physiology of impulse control  disorders.  
 
3.1.1.2  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Following oral administration of SXC -2023, the absolute bioavailability in dogs, the only 
species in which this has been studied, is 17.2%.  
 
SXC -2023 is rapidly absorbed in all species following oral administration, with peak plasma 
concentrations  typicall y occurring  within  2 hours  post-dose.  In whole  blood,  most  of the SXC - 
2023 and N -acetylcystei ne (NAC) (a metabolite of SXC -2023) are present in the plasma,  with 
high protein binding (>96%) at a concentration of 10 µM (2.81 µg/mL). Compared to total 
plasma  concentrations  of drug,  concentrations  of SXC -2023  and NAC  in red blood  cells appear 
to be mi nimal when taking background levels into consideration. Metabolism of SXC -2023 
was evaluated using rat, monkey, dog, rabbit, and human hepatocytes. The primary me tabolic 
pathway appears to include thioester cleavage, resulting in the formation of NAC and  p-toluic 
acid. In rat, rabbit, monkey, and human hepatocytes, p -toluic acid undergoes subsequent 
glycine conjugation to form 4 -methylhippuric acid. Another possibl e minor pathway of SXC - 
2023 metabolism includes deamidation followed by cysteine  conjugation.  
 
The parent  drug,  NAC,  and p-toluic  acid have  relatively  short  plasma  half-lives  (<6 hours).  All 
the metabolites are polar; therefore, extensive renal clearance and urinary excretion are 
expected.  
 
Following in vitro studies to assess the potential of SXC -2023 to inhibit, induce, or be 
metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, it is anticipated that  the likelihood of drug -drug 
interactions  with SXC -2023  is minimal,  with a possible  exception  for inhibition  of cytochrome 
P450  P2C8  (showing  half-maximal  inhibit ory concentration  of enzyme  activity  of 570 μM).  In 
vitro  data indicate  that SXC -2023  may be a substrate  of organic  anion  transporting  polypeptide 
1B1 and 1B3, but not of P -glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance  protein.  
 
3.1.1.3  Toxicity  
 
The safety  and toxicity  associated  with chronic  SXC -2023  treatment  was evaluated  in 2 species 
(rats and dogs) follo wing a 28 - or 90 -day dosing period. In the 90 -day toxicity studies, the 
reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of any SXC -2023 -related effects was 
evaluated after a 28 -day recovery  phase.  
 
Once -daily oral administration of SXC -2023 for 28 days a t 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day 
was generally well tolerated in both male and female rats (please see Investigator’s Brochure, 
Version 6.0 [ SXC -2023, 2019] for detailed information and additional summary). T he Study 
Director at the nonclinical contract res earch organization (CRO) considered the no observed 
adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  to be the highest  dose tested  (2000  mg/kg/day).  However,  given 
the increase in kidney weights and greater severity of findings  in the kidney tubules at the 
highest dose in both sexes, Promentis conservatively considers the NOAEL to be 1000 
mg/kg/day.

A 90 -day rat study was performed with SXC -2023 doses of 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day. 
This study included a 28 -day recovery arm t o assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed 
occurrence of any SXC -2023 -related effects. Reversible, non -adverse clinical pathology 
findings included a higher incidenc e of ketones in the urine, mildly higher urine volume, and 
minimally to mildly low er urinary pH in males administered ≥300 mg/kg/day and females 
administered 1000 mg/kg/day. Mildly lower triiodothyronine and thyroxine serum levels 
occurred in males adminis tered 1000 mg/kg/day and were not accompanied by any thyroid 
stimulating hormone c hanges or microscopic correlates. Microscopic findings at the terminal 
and recovery sacrifices were limited to minimal to moderate basophilic tubules and minimal 
to slight de generation of tubules in animals administered 1000 mg/kg/day, which correlated 
with SXC -2023 -related increased kidney weight parameters at the terminal sacrifice. Due to 
the mild severity of findings and the lack of impact on the health and well -being of a nimals 
administered SXC -2023, the NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day.  
 
In Beagle dogs, SXC -2023 was delivered once -daily for 28 days at 250, 500 and 1200 
mg/kg/day. Based on the results of these studies (please see Investigator’s Brochure, Version  
6.0 [ SXC -2023, 2019] for detailed information and additional summary), the Stud y Director 
of the non clinical CRO defined the NOAEL as 500 mg/kg/day; however, based on the similar 
exposure levels at 500 and 1200 mg/kg/day groups, Promentis conservatively defined the 
NOAEL to be 250 mg/kg/day.  
 
A 90 -day dog study was performed with SXC -2023 doses of  30, 10 0, and 300 mg/kg/day, and 
included a 28 -day recovery arm to assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence 
of any SXC -2023 -related effects. No SXC -2023 -related findings or adverse microscopic or 
macroscopic findings were noted in this study. Similarly, no changes in measurements of 
hematology, immune system, ophthalmic or cardiovascular system were found in this 90 -day 
dog toxicity study. Therefore, the NOAEL was determined to be 300  mg/kg/day.  
 
Good Laboratory Practice (G LP) development and r eproductive toxicology studies have also 
been completed following chronic SXC -2023 treatment. Doses selected for these studieswere 
based on the results from previous non -GLP dose range finding studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits.  
 
In a GLP study to test f or effects resulting from SXC -2023 treatment to female Wistar 
Hannover rats on various fertility parameters, females were orally dosed with SXC -2023 at 
either 0, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg/day (n=22 female rats per dose group) once daily ( QD) 
beginning 15 days  before cohabitation, during cohabitation and continuing until Day 7 of 
gestation. All rats survived to scheduled euthanasia. There were no SXC -2023 -relatedclinical 
observations  or effects  on body  weight,  body  weight  gain,  food consump tion, estrous  cyclici ty, 
mating  and fertility,  ovary  weights,  ovarian  and uterine  parameters  or maternal  gross  necropsy 
findings at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day. Therefore, the NOAEL of oral SXC -2023 in rats for 
both maternal toxicity and female fertility and early embryonic dev elopment was 1000 
mg/kg/day, the highest dose  tested.  
 
In a study to detect adverse effect s of SXC -2023 on pregnant Wistar Hannover rats and 
development of the embryo and fetus, female rats were orally dosed with SXC -2023 at either 
0, 100, 300 or 1000 mg/k g/day (n=20 rats per group) QD on Days 7 through 17 of gestation

(DGs  7 through  17). All rats survived  to scheduled  euthanasia  on DG 21. There  were  no SXC - 
2023 -related  changes  in mean  maternal  body  weights,  body  weight  gains  or food consumption 
up to 10 00 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. There were no SXC -2023 -related changes  in 
ovarian, uterine, or litter parameters, including embryo -fetal survival and mean fetal body 
weights. Lastly, there were no SXC -2023 -related fetal external, visceral, or skelet al 
malformations or variations observed up to 1000 mg/kg/day, the highest dos e tested.  
 
In a GLP  study  to assess  possible  adverse  effects  of SXC -2023  on pregnant  New  Zealand  White 
rabbits and development of the embryo and fetus following daily oral exposur e from 
implantation  to closure  of the hard palate  (gestation  day 7 to 19 [DG 7 to 19]),  pregnant  rabbits 
were orally dosed with SXC -2023 at either 0, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/da y (n=20/dose group) 
QD on DG 7 to 19. One rabbit in the control group and one rabb it in the 300 mg/kg/day  group 
aborted  on DG 25. Additionally,  one rabbit  in the 300 mg/kg/day  group  was euthanized  due to 
severe  body  weight  loss and reduced  food consumption  on DG 24. Mean  maternal  body  weight 
gain was lower than controls by 23% from DG 1 0 to 13, and by 35% from DG 16 to 20 (65% 
of the control). There was a mean maternal body weight loss for the interval DG 14 to 15  of 
-9.07g.  During  the post dose period,  mean  body  weight  gains  in this group  were  higher  than the 
control (131% of the contro l from DG 20 to 29) such that overall mean body weights on DG 
29 were comparable across all groups (including  control).  
 
There were no SXC -2023 -related changes in ovarian, uterine, or litter parameters, including 
embryo -fetal survival and mean fetal body w eights up to 300 mg/kg/day. Mean male, female, 
and combined fetal weights were lower in the 300 mg/kg/day dose group comp ared to the 
control values (95%, 93%, and 94% of the control, respectively). Although these values were 
within the Testing Facility His torical Control Data, they were lower than the concurrent 
control.  There  were  no SXC -2023 -related  fetal external  or visce ral malformations  or variations 
observed up to 300 mg/kg/day. Fetal ossification site averages per fetus were comparable 
across all gro ups (including control). Based on the lower maternal body weight gain and  body 
weight loss, reduced food consumption, at 300 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL of SXC -2023 was 
determined to be 100 mg/kg/day in this  study.  
 
Based on results from a pivotal Ames mutagenici ty assay, a human peripheral blood 
lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in Wistar ra ts, 
SXC -2023 is considered not genotoxic.

3.1.2 Effects of SXC -2023 in Humans  
 
As described  below,  SXC -2023  has been  investigated  in a randomized,  double -blind, placebo - 
controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and food effect (FE) study in healthy subjects  (PRO - 
101) and a randomized, doub le-blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) 
study in healthy subjects (PRO -104). In both studies, SXC -2023 was administered as enteric 
capsule(s)  in 50-mg or 200-mg unit dose strengths  as single  doses  (up to 1600  mg) or multiple 
doses  (up to 800 mg QD).  Additionally,  an open  label  oral contraceptive/drug -drug interaction 
(OC/DDI) study (PRO -103) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of  a

single dose of SXC -2023 (800 mg) and oral contraceptives (norethindrone [NET]/ethinyl 
estradiol [EE2]) was completed.  
 
Safety and PK findings are briefly summarized herein. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure, 
Version 6.0 ( SXC -2023, 2019) for further information about the safety and PK data of SXC - 
2023.  
 
3.1.2.1  Safety  
 
To date, 96 human subjects have been  exposed to SXC -2023. O verall, SXC -2023 has been 
safe and well tolerated  in doses  ranging  from  50 mg to 1600  mg in the SAD/FE  study,  at a dose 
of 800 mg in combination with oral contraceptives, and at doses ranging from 200 mg to 800 
mg for 14 days in the MAD study. The most common adverse events (AEs) in subjects 
randomized to SXC -2023 in all Phase 1 studies include headache (frontal, gener alized, 
occipital, or temporal) in 11% of subjects, dizziness in 5%, and constipation, myalgia and 
somnolence in 3%  each. 
 
In all studies, changes from baseline  in vital sign measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
findings were also assessed. Vital signs  were normal and no evidence of ECG abnormalities 
such as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, was seen. In addition, no a bnormal laboratory 
findings reported were considered clinically significant by the  Investigator.  
 
In the PRO -103 and PRO -104 studies, safe ty laboratory results indicated that several subjects 
exhibited notable shifts in urinalysis measures of occult blood or red blood cells postdose. 
These were most likely due to several subjects with menses during the studies.  
 
PRO -101: SAD/FE Study  
 
The SA D/FE study  examined the safety, tolerability and PK of single oral doses of SXC -2023 
ranging from 50 mg to 1600 mg. A total of 48 healthy, adult male and female subjects were 
enrolled in 6 cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active and 2  placebo).  
 
SXC -2023 was safe and well tolerated. A total of 36 subjects were dosed with SXC -2023 on 
Study PRO -101 in six cohorts (50 mg, 100 m g, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg and 1600 mg). 
Overall,  AEs across  body  systems  were  mild or moderate.  In subjects  who received  SXC -2023, 
the most common AEs were headache (in 5 subjects), followed by constipation, nausea, 
vomiting, and presyncope (in 2 subjects  each).  
 
Safety  was also assessed  by the incidence  of changes  from  baseline  in clinical  laboratory,  vital 
sign measures,  and ECG  findings.  Safety  laboratory  results  and vital signs  were  normal  and no 
evidence of ECG abnormalities, such as QTc prolongation, was seen. There were no serious 
adverse events (SAEs), study discontinuations related to AEs or deaths in this  study.  
 
PRO -103: OC/DDI Study  
 
This open label OC/DDI study evaluated the effect of a single dose of SXC -2023 800 mg on 
the PK of single doses of  1 mg NET/0.035 mg EE2 (Ortho -Novum 1/35), in 28 healthy oral 
contraceptive -naïve females. A total of 4 subjects (14%) had AEs deemed possibly  related to

study drug when SXC -2023 was taken in combination with EE2/NET. Grades 1 and 2 AEs 
included  dizzines s, generalized  headache,  and nausea.  There  were  no SAEs  reported  or subject 
discontinuations in this  study.  
 
PRO -104: MAD Study  
 
The MAD  study  examined  the safety  and tolerability  of multiple  oral doses (14  days)  of SXC - 
2023 in four cohorts (200 mg QD, 40 0 mg QD, 400 mg twice daily [BID] and 800 mg QD)  of 
10 subjects  each (8 active  and 2 placebo).  Overall,  SXC -2023  was well tolerated  across  all doses 
without any SAEs. Additionally, there were no subject discontinuations due to AEs, or deaths 
reported in th is study. Adverse events were reported by 45% (18/40) of subjects regardless of 
attribution. The most common AEs in subjec ts was headache, reported by 15% (6/40) of 
subjects. All AEs were mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2) in severity in all dose groups;  of 
those considered possibly related to study treatment, the majority of Grade 2 events were 
reported in the placebo grou p. All AEs resolved by the end of study, with the exception of 
constipation in one subject, and there were no clinically important tre nds in AEs, physical 
examination  or clinical  laboratory  assessments.  However,  two subjects  treated  with SXC -2023 
with trea tment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of urinary tract infection or asymptomatic 
bacteriuria recorded notable post -baseline laboratory  results, including positive shifts in 
urinalysis measures of occult blood, leukocyte esterase, and red and white blood ce lls, as well 
as positive urine nitrites and urine culture  growth.  
 
Additionally, in cognitive safety outcome measures including Paired  Associates Learning 
(PAL) to test episodic memory and Reaction Time (RTI), there were no impairments in 
cognitive perform ance. Furthermore, there were no significant trends in impulsivity scores 
across individuals or means as related to treatment, as meas ured by the Barratt Impulsiveness 
scale (BIS)or suicidality via the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
 
3.1.2.2  Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism  
 
PRO -101: SAD/FE Study  
 
The PK of SADs of SXC -2023 was evaluated in Study PRO -101. Six cohorts of subjects 
received SADs of SXC -2023 (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg fasted, 800 mg fed, 
and 1600 mg). SXC -2023 c oncentrations were measurable in all subjects; NAC and p-toluic 
acid were measurable in a few sporadic samples across the dose levels test ed. Plasma SXC - 
2023 concentrations increased with increasing dose and were dose -proportional to 1600 mg. 
On average,  maximum  observed  concentration (C max) ranged  from  1,094  ng/mL  for the 50 mg 
dose to 35,217 ng/mL for the 1600 mg dose. Time to reach maxim um observed concentration 
(tmax) was consistent across doses and was approximately 3.0 to 3.5 hours. The elimination 
half-life for SXC -2023 was approximately 3 to 6 hours over the 50 to 1600 mg dose range 
tested.  Co-administration  of SXC -2023  800 mg with a high-fat meal  resulted  in lower  Cmax and 
a delay in t max. Exposure, as assessed by area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), was 
slightly increased following administration of SXC -2023 with a high -fat meal.

PRO -103: OC/DDI Study  
 
Concomitant SXC -2023 administration does not have an impact on the PK of NET or EE2. 
Changes in EE2 drug exposure were not seen with concomitant SXC -2023 and the 90% 
confidence intervals for EE2 were within the 80 -125% confidence limits demonstrating 
bioequivalence. For NET , the confidence intervals suggest that NET levels are slightly higher 
with concomitant SXC -2023; the test/reference ratios were 116% for C max and approximately 
124% for the AUC parameters and the upper bounds for the confidence intervals were just 
outside  the 125% upper range. These changes, however, were not considered clin ically 
relevant.  
 
PRO -104: MAD Study  
The PK of MADs of SXC -2023 was evaluated in Study PRO -104. Four cohorts of subjects 
received MADs of SXC -2023 (200mg QD, 400mg QD, 800mg QD and 400m g BID). SXC - 
2023 concentrations were measurable in all subjects; NAC ( measured as total NAC) and p - 
toluic  acid were  detected  at low concentrations  across  the dose levels  tested.  Plasma  SXC -2023 
concentrations increased with increasing dose and were dose -proportional to 800 mg. On 
average, maximum observed concentration (Cma x) following 14 days of treatment ranged 
from 7,633 ng/mL for the 200 mg dose to 30,350 ng/mL for the 800 mg dose. Median time  to 
reach maximum observed concentration (tmax) was consist ent across doses and dosing days 
and ranged from 2 -6 hours. The elimina tion half -life for SXC -2023 on day 1 was 
approximately  3.4 to 5.2 hours  over the 200 to 800 mg dose range  tested,  and approximately  
9.4 to 11.7 hours on day 14.  
 
The urinary excretion d ata demonstrated that very little of the administered dose of SXC -2023,  
<0.2%, was excreted in urine over the 200 mg to 800 mg dose range.  
 
3.2 Rationale  
 
3.2.1 Rationale for this Study and Study  Design  
 
SXC -2023 is a novel small molecule and new chemical entity des igned to activate System  xc- 
(also known as the cysteine glutamate antiporter). By increasing cyst(e)ine levels, SXC -2023 
increases the activity of System xc - in the brain. System xc - is express ed on astrocytes and 
neurons within the CNS and its primary fu nction is to couple the uptake of one extracellular 
molecule of cystine to the release of one intracellular molecule of glutamate. As alterations in 
glutamate neurotransmission and/or oxidative imbalances are proposed to underlie the 
pathology of TTM, this  mechanism of action is important because activation of System xc - is 
proposed to restore imbalances in oxidative stress and modulate glutamatergic 
neurotransmission in the  brain.  
 
This study  is being performed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and act ivity of SXC -2023 on 
TTM when dosed for a period of 6 weeks. A randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled 
design was chosen to reduce bias. Neurocognitive testing and TTM -specific assessments will 
be performed  at baseline,  Week  3, and Week  6 to assess  the effect  of SXC -2023  administration 
over the duration of the treatment  period.

CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
3.2.2 Rationale for Dose  Selection  
 
The proposed doses of SXC -2023 in this study are 50 mg, 200 mg, and 800 mg QD. These 
doses were selected based on nonclinical activity of SXC -2023 in various rat models showing 
behavioral activity at a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/kg, which, based on allometr ic scaling, is 
equivalent to approximately 100 to 300 mg in human equivalent dosing. Extrapolation to 
humans suggests a daily dose of 200 mg whic h is the mid -point dose of this study. The 
additional  doses  of 50 mg and 800 mg are included  to fully  explore  the dose response  of SXC - 
2023.  
 
The safety and tolerability profile in the SAD/FE study performed in healthy male and  female 
volunteers,  where  subjects  received  single  doses  up to 1600  mg, support  the higher  dose of 800 
mg proposed in the current study. Additionally, support for these doses comes from recent 
safety and tolerability profiles captured in a MAD study performed in healthy volunteers, 
showing that 14 -day oral administration of SXC -2023 at 200 to 800 mg/day QD and 400 
mg/day BID, is gene rally safe and well  tolerated.  
 
3.3 Risks and/or Benefits to  Subjects  
 
As mentioned in Section 3.1.2.1 , SXC -2023 w as studied in a Phase 1, double -blind, placebo - 
controlled, SAD/FE study (Study PRO -101) in healthy volunteers. SXC -2023 was safe and 
well tolerat ed at doses  of 50 mg to 1600  mg. The safety  monitoring  practices  employed  by this 
protocol  (i.e., physical  examination,  vital signs,  12-lead ECG,  clinical  laboratory  tests,  and AE 
questioning)  were  adequate  to protect  the subjects’  safety  and detected  all expected TEAEs.  
 
In the MAD study, SXC -2023 was safe and well tolerated at doses of 200 mg to 800 mg QD 
and 40 0 mg BID. The safety monitoring practices employed by this protocol (i.e., physical 
examination, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, neurocogni tive testing, clinical laboratory tests, and 
AEs) are adequate to protect the subjects’ safety and detected all expected TE AEs. 
Additionally, cognitive tests were included as part of a broader cognitive safety assessment 
along with the C -SSRS to ensure tha t there were no CNS side effects.  
 
In the current study, subjects will be monitored to detect AEs during the study and foll owed 
appropriately to ensure resolution of AEs. Further, clinical laboratory tests, physical 
examination, vital signs, ECGs, neurocog nitive assessments, and the C -SSRS will be used to 
evaluate safety.  
 
The approximate volume of blood planned for collection  from each subject over the course of 
the study presents no undue risk to the subjects.  
 
A potential health benefit for study partici pants who receive SXC -2023 as blinded study drug 
is improvement in TTM symptoms. An indirect health benefit to subjects enr olled in this 
study is the free medical tests received at screening and during the study.

responsiveness of the newly developed TSD  assessment.  
 
4.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 
• To test the activity  of SXC -2023  on neurocognitive  assessments  (e.g.,  Stop Signal  Task 
[SST], Cambridge Gambling Task [CGT] and other behavioral measures including 
Reaction Time [RTI], Paired Associates Learning [PAL],  and Milwaukee Inventoryof 
Subtypes of TTM - Adult Version  [MIST -A]).

5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This study  is a randomized,  double  blind,  placebo -controlled,  multicenter  study  to evaluate  the 
safety,  tolerability, and  activity  of SXC -2023 (50  mg, 200 mg, or 800 mg QD) when  dosed  for 
6 weeks compared to placebo in adult subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe TTM. 
Subjects  will be screened  and will perform  requir ed assessments  for eligibility  during  a 40-day 
screening period. During the screening  period, subjects will be trained on site on how to use 
an electronic Patient Report Outcome (ePRO) handheld device to complete the TSD. After all 
screening  assessments  are complete,  the subjects  will complete  the TSD  at home  every  evening 
for 7 consecutiv e days during the screening  period.  
 
On Study Day 1, eligible subjects will complete protocol -specified assessments and study 
procedures, including neurocognitive and othe r assessments, and will be assigned to receive 
one of three doses of SXC -2023 or matc hing placebo. Subjects will be assigned to treatment 
groups using a randomization scheme including a stratification factor for whether subjects are 
currently taking concom itant selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin - 
norepinephrine reup take inhibitors (SNRIs). Subjects will be instructed to complete the TSD 
on their ePRO handheld device every 24 hours (just prior to bedtime) during the 6 -week

7 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
7.1 Screening Visit (Day −40 to Day 0)  
 
A screening log documenting all assigned subject numbers must be maintained in real time  in 
the electronic databas e and at the site. A copy will be filed in the Investigator  Binder.  
 
The following  assessments /procedures  will be performed  at the Screening  Visit.  The screening 
assessments may be performed over multiple visits; however, all neurocognitive and other 
behavioral measurements must be performed at the same  visit.  
• Informed consent must be obtained befo re any other study assessments or  procedures.  
• Assessment o f inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  
• Demographics and medical and psychiatric history will be  recorded.  
• Prior/concomitant medications taken within 90 days of the first screening visit will be 
recorded.  
 
• A physical examination will be  performed.  
• Blood pressure a nd heart rate will be recorded after the study subject has been resting 
supine  for ≥5 minutes.  Respiratory  rate and temperature  may be taken  at the same  time.  
• A 12-lead ECG  will be completed  after the study  subject  has been  resting  supine  for 
≥5 minutes.  
 
• A urine sample will be collected for a urine drug  screen.  
• Safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis) will  be 
performed.  
 
• Urine pregnancy tests will be performed in fema le subjects (females with  confirmed 
sterility (e.g. oophorectomy) are  excluded).  
 
• The C-SSRS  Screening  version,  MINI -TTM,  BIS, MGH -HPS and CANTAB  (training) 
will be  completed.  
 
• Subjects  will be trained  using  the iPad device,  which  will be used for the PGI-S, PGI-C, 
CGI-S, and CGI -C assessments.  
Phase 2 Study Protocol 
Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Protocol No.: PRO -201 
US IND No.: 133689  
Page 38 
CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
 • Any AEs occurring  after informed  consent  is obtained  will be recorded.  AEs occurring 
during screening and up to pre -dose Day 1 that are not procedure related will be 
captured and reported as medical  history  
 
• Subject s will be provided with an ePRO handheld device and will receive training  on 
how to record TSD assessments daily. Su bjects will use the ePRO device daily 
(evening before bedtime) to complete the TSD for a 7 -day trial prior to the Day 1 
Visit, and these ass essments will serve as baseline  assessments.  
 
Prior to the subject’s return to the site after the 7 -day trial period , a review of the daily TSD 
assessments will be performed by site and study designee and, if not completed for all 7 days 
(or if not 100%  compliant),  site will review  reasons  for non-compliance  to determine  if further 
training and re -administration of the 7-day TSD assessment is needed. Medical monitor or 
designee  approval  is required  if re-training  and re-administration  of the 7-day trial TSD  period 
is needed.  
If repeating the 7 -day trial period requires an extension of the 40 -day screening window, the 
screening window may be extended one time for an additional 10 days if the Medical monitor 
or designee approves.  
 
If subjects have engaged in 5  or fewer days of hairpulling, they will not be included in the 
study. If the site believes that there were extenuating circumstances and the subject typically 
engages in daily hairpulling, a repeat of the 7 -day run -in period m ay occur with medical 
monitor  or designee approval.  
 
7.1.1 Screen Failures  
 
Subjects who sign an Informed Consent Form but are not randomized to the study must have 
a reason recorded as to why they were not enrolled in the study. This information will be 
recorde d in the screening log mainta ined in the Investigator Binder.  
 
7.1.2 Extension to the Screening  Window  
 
Subjects who are unable to complete required screening procedures during the 40 -day 
screening  window  may be eligible  for one 10-day extension  of the screening  period.  Sites  must 
receive a pproval from the medical monitor or designee for such an extension prior to the end 
of the initial screening period and no later than the Baseline/Day 1  visit.  
 
7.1.3 Re-screening  
 
Subjects may be re -screened 1 time if there is a cha nge in the subject’s medical or psychiatric 
status, a modification of study entry criteria, or other relevant change impacting eligibility 
(e.g., additional ePRO training requirement). Re -screening must be approved by the medical 
monitor or designee prior to the subject returning for re-entry screening visit.  
 
7.2 Day 1 
 
Subjects will arrive at the site on Day 1 and the following assessments/procedures will be 
completed:

Treatment assignment and dosin g 
 
• After the above assessments have been completed, subjects will be randomized to 
receive SXC -2023 50 mg, 200 mg, or 800 mg or  placebo.  
 
• Wallet  cards  containing  study  drug (capsules)  in blister  packs  will be distributed  on site 
by qualified personnel to c onfirm dosing requirements and initial dose will be 
administered  on site (see Section  9.2 for dosing  procedures).  Subjects will  be provided 
with 3 weeks of capsules of blinded study treatment to maintain the d aily dosage until 
the Week 3 visit, along with an extra wallet card containing one additional week of 
study drug to allow for the variance in the time windows throughout the remainder of 
the treatment period. Subjects will be instructed to bring all unused  capsules when 
returning for the Week 3 visit f or accountability.  
 
Post-dose 
 
• Subjects will be given instructions to continue to record the TSD assessments daily 
throughout the 6 -week treatment period using the ePRO device. Subjects will record 
the first assessment  in the evening  of Day 1, regardless  of what  time of day the subject’s 
visit took place. The assessments should be completed at the same time each day, in 
the evening before  bedtime.  
 
• Subjects  will be instructed  to take study  drug daily,  preferably  in the morning.  Subjects 
will also be instruc ted that each dose shou ld be taken at least 1 hour prior to a meal or 
at least 2 hours  after a meal.  Subjects  should  take study  drug with water;  however,  they 
may also take a bite of applesauce, gelatin dessert, yogurt, or other soft food to help 
swallow t he capsules (see Section 9.2  for details).

They may use the extra capsules provided at Day 1 if needed to allow for the 4 -day 
variance for the Week 6 visit.  Subjects will be instructed to return all unused capsules 
when  returning  for the Week  6 visit.  Subjects  who have  missed  more  than 5 consecutive 
doses or a total of 6 or more days of study drug administration will be dropped from 
the Per Protocol (PP) Popu lation analyses and replaced. Subjects withdrawn from PP 
Population analyses for non -compliance will be given the option of completing th e 
study, including continuing on study drug and completing  assessments.  
 
• If the subject used 4 or more days of medicati on from the additional wallet card given 
at Day 1, an additional wallet card will be provided to the  subject.  
 
• The TSD ePRO assessments w ill be reviewed prior to the completion of any Week 3 
visit procedures. Five consecutive days or a total of 6 or more d ays of  non-compliance 
with daily TSD completion will result in the subject being withdrawn from PP 
Population  analyses  and replaced.  Subjects withdrawn  from  PP Population  analyses  for 
non-compliance  will be given  the option  of completing  the study,  includi ng continuing 
on study drug and completing  assessments.  
 
• A blood sample will be collected for blood chemistry, coagulation, and hematology 
tests, and a urine sample will be collected for  urinalysis.

• Clinical outcome of event (resolved or  ongoing)  
• If resolved, provide date of  resolution  
8.1.7 Prior and Concomitant  Medications  
 
Site personnel should document any medicat ions (prescription and OTC, including herbal 
medications and vitamins) the subject received within 90 days prior to screening and 
throughout the study. Recorded details should include: medication name, start date and time, 
stop date and time, dose, route, frequency, and reason for use and/or discontinuation (if 
applicable). The concomitant medication names will be coded according to the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODD) and classified by anatomical therapeutic chemical 
categories.  
 
8.1.8 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating  Scale  
 
The C -SSRS will be used to evaluate suicidal ideation/behavior at times indicated in 
Appendix A .

Page 47 
CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
8.2 Neurocognitive and Other Behavioral  Measurements  
 
The following measures will be assessed during the study:  
 
8.2.1 Mini -Internationa l Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 7.0.2 with 
Trichotillomania and Body Dysmorphic Disorder  Modules  
 
The MINI -TTM will be used at screening.  
 
8.2.2 Barratt Impulsiveness  Scale  
 
The BIS will be employed to capture trait impulsivity at screening. The scale is p resented in 
Appendix E . 
 
8.2.3 Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated  Battery  
 
Subjects will be trained on the CANTAB iPad device with SST, CGT, PAL, and RTI at 
screening  and the tests will be repeated  as indicated  in Appendix  A. The SST and CGT  will be 
used to assess impulsivity and inhibitory control. The PAL and RTI will be used to assess 
visual memory and motor/mental response speed, respectively. These assessments are 
described in further detail in Appendix  F. 
 
8.2.4 Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling  Scale  
 
The MGH -HPS will be performed to assess TTM symptoms at times indicated in Appendix  
A. The scale is presented in Appendix G . 
 
8.2.5 Patient Global Impression of Status/Change  
 
Subjects will use the iPad device to complete the PGI -S and PGI -C at the times  indicated in 
Appendix A . 
 
Two PGI -S items will assess TTM severity from the subject’s perspective. The PGI -S items 
employ 5 -point graded response scales and are as follows:  
 
• How would you rate your trichotillomania symptoms  now? 
0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Mo derate, 3 = Severe, 4 = Ver y severe  
 
• How much control do you feel you have over your trichotillomania symptoms now? 0 
= Complete control, 1 = Quite a bit of control, 2 = A moderate amount of control, 3 = 
A little control, 4 = No control  
 
Two PGI-C items  (Lydick  and Yawn,  1998 ; Cappelleri  et al., 2014 ) will assess  change  in TTM 
severity from the subject’s perspective and a re as follows:  
 
• Compared to the start of this study, how would you rate your  trichotillomania 
symptoms now? 
Phase 2 Study Protocol 
Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Protocol No.: PRO -201 
US IND No.: 133689  
Page 48 
CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
0 = Much better, 1 = Moderat ely better, 2 = A little better, 3 = About the same, 
4 = A little worse, 5 = Moderately worse, 6 = Much worse  
 
• Compared to the start of this study, how would you rate the strength of your urges  to 
pull hair  now? 
0 = Much weaker,  1 = Moderately weaker, 2 = A little weaker, 3 = About the same, 
4 = A little stronger, 5 = Moderately stronger, 6 = Much stronger  
 
8.2.6 Clinical Global Impression of  Severity/Change  
 
The CGI -S and CGI -C will be completed by the clinician using the iPad device at times 
indicated in Append ix A. 
 
The CGI -S (Guy, 1976 ) is a single -item rating that asks the clinician to evaluate the severity 
of the subject’s illness on a 7 -point ordinal sca le: 
 
“Considering  your total clinical  experience  with this particular  population,  how ill is the patient 
at this time? (1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill;  5 
= Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; 7 = Among the mo st extremely ill patients).”  
 
The CGI -C (Guy, 1976; Spearing et al., 1997 ) is a single -item rating that a sks the clinician to 
evaluate the extent to which the subject’s symptoms have changed since baseline on a 7 -point 
ordinal scale:  
 
“Compared to his/her condition at the baseline/Day 1 visit, how much have the patient’s 
trichotillomania symptoms changed? (1 = Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3  
= Minimally  improved;  4 = No change;  5 = Minimally  worse;  6 = Much  worse;  7 = Very  much 
worse.”  
 
8.2.7 Milwaukee Inventory of Subtypes of Trichotillomania – Adult  Version  
 
The MIST -A (Flessner et al., 2008 ) will be used  to assess automatic and focused pulling 
subtypes at the times indicated in Appendix A . The scale is presented in Appendix H . 
 
8.2.8 Trichotillomania Symptom  Diary  
 
The ePRO device will be used by subjects to complete the TSD at home, every 24 hour s for 
the 7 da ys during the screening period (baseline) and every day during the treatment period. 
Subjects will be instructed to complete the TSD assessment in evening. At Week 3, 5 
consecutive days or a total of 6 or more days of non -compliance with TSD completion wil l 
result in the subject being withdrawn from the Per Protocol Population analyses and replaced. 
At Week 6, 5 consecutive days or a total of 6 or more days of non -compliance with TSD 
completion since the Week 3 visit will also result in the su bject being wi thdrawn from Per 
Protocol Population analyses.  
 
The scale is presented in Appendix D .

8.3 Glutathione Blood  Collection  
 
Whole blood samples will be collected at the times indicated in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix A ). Instructions for the sampling, proces sing, and storage of laboratory samples 
will be provided in the laboratory manual.  
 
9 TEST ARTICLE AND  ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 Test Article Identification, Supply, Packaging, Labeling, and  Storage  
 
SXC -2023 will be supplied as 50 mg and 200 mg capsules for use in thi s study. Placebo 
capsules will be matching SXC -2023 to maintain the blind. Subjects will take 4 capsules of 
blinded study drug daily.  
 
Capsules will be supplied in blister packs within a wallet card. SXC -2023 is stable at room 
temperature  and requires  no special  protection  or handling;  special  protection  from  light is not 
required. SXC -2023 should be stored at 20 ℃ to 25 ℃, with excursions allowed between 15 ℃ 
to 30℃. 
 
All supplies will be packaged and labeled according to applicable local and regulatory 
requi rements. All supplies must be stored in a locked area, accessible to authorized persons 
only, until needed for dispe nsing/dosing.  
 
9.2 Study Drug Administration  
 
Subjects will be administered study drug at the clinical site at the Day 1 visit. The SXC -2023 
or placebo dose will be administered with water. Qualified personnel will administer study 
drug. After dosing, unit per sonnel will perform a hand and mouth check to ensure the  subjects 
have swallowed the dose  administered.  
 
The remaining doses will be self -administered by the subject every day for approximately 6 
weeks  outside  the clinic.  Subjects  will be instructed  to take the dose at approximately  the same 
time each day, preferably in the morning. Subjects will be instructed that each dose should be 
taken  at least 1 hour prior  to a meal  and at least 2 hours  after a meal.  Subjects  will be instructed 
to tak e study drug with water. If needed, subjects may also take a bite of applesauce, gelatin 
dessert, yogurt, or other soft food to help with swallowing the caps ules. However, they  should 
not fill the stomach  with soft foods,  and the site should  request  that they try water  first. 
 
9.3 Study Drug Accountability and  Destruction  
 
The Sponsor  will supply  sufficient  quantities  of blinded  study  drug to allow  completion  of this 
study. The lot numbers and expiration dates (where available) of the study drugs supplied  will 
be recorded in the final  report.  
 
Subjects will be supplied with an appropriate amount of study drug at the Day 1 and Week 3 
visits to complete the planned doses and allow for variances in the study schedule. At Day 1, 
subjects  will receive  4 weeks  of study  drug doses  and at Week  3, subjects  will receive  3 weeks  
Phase 2 Study Protocol

of study drug doses. The extra week of study drug provided at Day 1 will be used if needed  to 
allow for time variances in the visit schedule throughout the treatment period. Subjects 
returning at the Week 3 visit who have used 4 or more days of study drug from the additional 
wallet card given at the Day 1 visit will be administered an additional walle t card. Subjects 
will be asked to bring all unused capsules at Week 3 and Week 6. Study site staff will record 
the number of capsules dispensed and number retu rned at each applicable  visit.  
 
Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the study d rugs supplied. At the 
conclusion of the study, any unused study drugs will be returned to the Sponsor or designee, 
or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions. I f no supplies remain, this fact will be documented 
in the product accountability records.  
 
9.4 Blindi ng 
 
Subjects will be randomized to treatment assignments. Treatments will be double -blinded to 
avoid bias by the subject, PI, and study site staff. If the PI d eems it is necessary to break the 
blind  in the interest  of a subject’s  safety,  individual  unblind ing may occur.  The PI must  attempt 
to contact the medical monitor and must document the reason for breaking the  blind.  
 
9.5 Randomization  
 
Subjects will be randomi zed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to SXC -2023 50 mg, 200 mg, or 800 mg or 
placebo QD for approximately 6 wee ks. The randomization will be stratified by whether the 
subject is receiving SSRI/SNRIs as the time of randomization. This stratification is to ensure 
balance among the treatment groups with respect to the number (%) subjects receiving these 
medications. T here is no minimum requirement for the number of subjects with (or without) 
SSRIs/SNRIs in this study.  
 
9.6 Missed  Doses  
 
Subjects who miss more than 5 consecutive doses or 6 or more total days of study drug prior 
to or as assessed  at the Week  3 visit will be dropped  from  PP Population  analyses  and replaced 
after subject completes the Week 3 assessments. Subjects withdrawn from analyses for non - 
compliance will be given the option of completing the study, including continuing on study 
drug and completing assess ments. Subjects who miss more than 5 con secutive doses or 6 or 
more total days of study drug prior to or as assessed at the Week 6 visit will be dropped from 
PP Population analyses but not replaced after completion of Week 6  assessments.  
 
9.7 Dose  Suspension  
 
The PI may decide to suspend study drug in the case of an AE or concerns about the subject’s 
safety. Dose suspensions initiated via a telephone contact should be followed by an in -clinic 
visit (either  scheduled  or unscheduled  visit)  as soon  as possible.  Subjects  with dose suspensions 
of 5 or fewer consecutive  days can resume  study  drug,  per PI discretion;  however,  if more  than 
1 dose suspension is required during the course of the trial, medical monitor approval is 
required prior to resuming study drug. Sub jects who require a dose suspension of longer than 
5 days will also require medical monitor approval to resume study  drug.

Page 51 
CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
9.8 Medication Errors  
 
Any study drug administration or usage that is not in accordance with study protocol should 
be reported as a pro tocol deviation and any comments/rationale should be documented in the 
subject’s source documents, regardl ess of whether an adverse event (AE) results.  
Unintentional medication errors should be evaluated to provide appropriate correction and 
retraining as needed. Intentional medication errors (e.g., intentional misuse or abuse) should 
be discussed with the med ical monitor to determine if subject should be withdrawn from the 
study.  
 
9.9 Treatment of  Overdose  
 
Standard  symptomatic  support  measures  should  be used in the case of excessive  pharmacologic 
effects or overdose. No antidotes are available. In the instance th at a subject consumes more 
IP than per protocol, the subject will be instructed to contact the site. Gastrointestinal  reaction 
is anticipated, and the  subject should be clinically followed for 48  hours.  
 
10 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
Starting  at the time of informed  consent,  subjects  will be asked  to spontaneously  report  all AEs 
that occur  during  the trial until discharge  from  the study.  Additionally,  subjects  will be queried 
about AEs at each study visit. AE queries should be performed in a nonspecific manne r such 
as “How have you felt since the last visit?”, “How do you feel?”, or “Are there any recent 
changes to your  health?”  
 
AEs occurring during screening and pre -dose Day 1 that are not procedure related will be 
captured and reported as medical history. A Es occurring after first dose of study drug will be 
captured  in the AE page  of the CRF.  Non-serious  AEs will be collected  through  the Follow -up 
visit. SAEs will be  collected through 30 days post last dose (as reported through subject - 
initiated contact following the Follow -up visit).  
 
Evaluation of AEs should include assessment of changes in psychiatric symptoms, including 
changes in emo tions, cognition, or behavior , to determine whether changes are clinically 
significant (e.g., onset or exacerbation of depressed mood) and possibly related to study drug.  
 
Cases of pregnancy that occur during the study or up to 30 days following last dose of study 
drug should be repor ted. Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for  regulatory 
reporting and drug safety  evaluation.  
 
Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each subject’s pre -existing 
conditions, including c linically significant signs a nd symptoms of the disease under treatment 
in the study. Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, laboratory tests, vital sign 
measurements, etc. that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Promentis or its designee 
and included as part of the s ubject’s medical history. After first dose of study drug, site 
personnel  will record  any change  in the condition(s)  and the occurrence  and nature  of any AEs. 
All AEs related  to protocol  procedures  are reported  to Promentis  or designee.  The PI will be 
Phase 2 Study Protocol 
Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Protocol No.: PRO -201 
US IND No.: 133689

CONFIDENTIAL  PRO -201_Protocol_25 Jun 2019   
  
instructed to report to Promentis or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness  of 
each AE to protocol procedure and/or study drug via  CRF.  
10.1 Definition  
 
An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign,  including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding,  
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or  not 
considered related to the study  drug.  
 
A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity 
following initiation of study drug.  
 
When an SAE or possibly or probably treatment -related AE persists at the end of the study, 
the PI will ensure a follow -up of the subject until the PI and Sponsor agree the event is 
satisfactorily re solved or stabilized.  
10.2 Severity Scale for Adverse  Events  
 
The severity of an AE is to be scored according to the following scale:  
 
Mild:  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to work or perfor m usual activity  
 
10.3 Relationship to Study Drug  
 
The relationship of an AE to study treatment is to be assessed according to the following 
definitions:  
 
Unrelated:  Should be reserved for those events which occur prior to study treatment orfor 
those  events wh ich cannot  be even  remotely  related  to study  participation  (e.g., 
injuries sustained in an automobile  accident).  
Possible:  The suspected  AE may or may not follow  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from 
study treatment administration but seems to be the type o f reaction that cannot 
be dismissed as unlikely. The event could have been produced or mimicked by 
the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy concomitantly 
administered to the  subject. 
Probable:  The suspected  AE follows  a reasonable  tempora l sequence  from  study  treatment 
administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and cannot be 
reasonably  explained  by the known  characteristics  of the subject’s  clinical  state.

10.4 Reporting Adverse  Events  
 
All clinical events, including eithe r observed or volunteered problems, complaints or 
symptoms are to be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. The need to capture this 
information  is not dependent  upon  whether  the clinical  event  is associated  with study  treatment. 
Adverse clinical events re sulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent 
medications are also to be recorded. In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology r ather than the 
subject’s own  words.  
 
Each  adverse  clinical  event  is to be evaluated  for duration,  severity,  and whether  the event  may 
be associated with the study drug or other causes. Start and stop dates, relationship to study 
drug, medical management, a nd alternative causality of event mu st be recorded in the AE 
section of the CRF. SAEs and AEs believed to be possibly or probably related to study drug 
must be followed until resolution or  stabilization.  
10.5 Serious Adverse  Events  
10.5.1  Definition  
 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• Is life threatening (an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
was more  severe)  
 
• A per sistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly, or birth  defect  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused by AE is to be 
consider ed as  serious)  
 
• Other medically important  events  
• Medical and scientific judgment should be e xercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening o r result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize  the subject  or may require  intervent ion to prevent  one of the other  outcomes 
listed  in the definition  above.  These  events,  including  those  that may result  in disability, 
should also usually be conside red serious. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of  drug

dependency or drug abuse. If a subject b ecomes pregnant during treatment, this should 
be reported as if it were a SAE.  
 
Refer to Section 10.6  in case of pregnancy.  
10.5.2  Initial  Reporting  
 
Any SAE, occurring in a subject receiving treatment or if the PI becomes aware of any SAE 
post-treatment,  must  be reported  by the PI to the medical  monitor  and to Syneos  Health  Safety 
within 24 hours even if the SAE does not appear to be drug -related. This should be done by 
telephone  or by sending  a faxed  or email  copy  of the SAE  form  plus other  related  information.  
 
A Sponsor Designee will contact you with any follow -up question s related to the event.  
 
The Sponsor Designee must be notified immediately of all deaths. Deaths must be reported, 
regardless of cause, from the time of informed consent and up to 28 days afte r completion of 
study medication administration, irrespective of  the PI’s opinion regarding drug relationship. 
Documentation of cause of death and copy of autopsy or hospital report must be provided.

10.5.3  Follow -up 
 
All additional follow -up evaluations must be reported to the medical monitor and Syneos 
Health  Safety.  Such  data should  be sent to the Sponsor  within  10 calendar  days.  All SAEs  will 
be followed until the PI and Spon sor agree the event is satisfactorily res olved. The Sponsor 
will be responsible for completing the safety report and for notifying the relevant authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines. 
The PI wil l also ensure that the appropriate ethics  committee is notified of the  SAE.  
10.6 Pregnancy  
 
If a pregnancy  does occur,  each pregnancy  must  be reported  by the PI to the Sponsor  Designee 
using the Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pre gnancy. The 
PI must follow up and documen t the course and the outcome of all pregnancies even if the 
subject was withdrawn from the clinical  study.

Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may 
have  interfer ed with the effectiveness  of a contraceptive  medication.  Elective  abortions  without 
complications should not be regarded as AEs, unless they were ther apeutic abortions (see 
below). Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be cons idered  an 
SAE.  
 
All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the PI to the Sponsor on the pregnancy 
outcome report form within 30 days after he/she h as gained knowledge of the normaldelivery 
or elective abortion.  
 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must  be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted  fetus , stillbirth  or neonatal  death])  and reported  within  24 hours  in accordance  with the 
procedure for reporti ng SAEs.  
 
For more information on pregnancy reporting, please refer to the Safety Monitoring Plan.

11.7 Publication  Policy  
 
All unpublished  information  given  to site by the Sponsor  shall  not be published  or disclosed  to 
a third party without the prior written consent of the  Sponsor.  
 
The data generated by this study are considered confidential information and the property of 
the Sponsor. This confidential information may be published only by the Sponsor or in 
collaboratio n with participating  personnel  from  the Sponsor  or upon  Sponsor’s  written  consent 
to publish the  article.  
 
12 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in a Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be prepared bySyneos 
Health  and agreed  upon  with the Sponsor.  This document  may modify  the plans  outlined  in the 
protocol; however, any major modifications will be reflected in a protocol  amendment. 
Additional statistical  analyses other than those described in this section may be performed. 
These additions or changes to planned analyses will be documented in the  SAP.  
 
Unless otherwise noted, continuous variables will be summarized using num ber of non - 
missing  observations,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum,  and maximum;  categorical 
variables  will be summarized  using  the frequency  count  and the percentage  of subjects  in each 
category.  
 
12.1 Determination of Sample Size  
 
The primary objecti ve of this study is to explore th e safety and tolerability of SXC -2023 in 
adults with TTM when dosed for a period of 6 weeks. The sample size of this study (30 per 
group) was determined by reviewing other studies in this disease area and early stage of dru g 
development ( Chamberlain et al. , 2018; Julious, 2010; Chow et al., 2008; Machin et al.,1997; 
Zar et al., 1984 ). The planned sample size of 30 per dose group is 80% powered to detect an 
effect size of 0.70 (Cohen’s d=0.70). This effect size for change in MGH -HPS total score 
corresponds t o a change in the MGH -HPS of approximately 4 units ( Grant et al., 2009 ). An 
effect size of 0.7 is in the range of 0.5 (medium) to 0.8 (large) effects.  
 
12.2 Analysis Populations  
 
ITT Population (FAS):  All subjects randomized to study drug will be included in th e ITT 
population/full analysis set (FAS).  
 
Per Protocol (PP) Population:  All subjects randomized to study drug and with no major 
protocol deviations will be included in the PP Population. The PP population will be used for 
the descriptive analyses of the n eurocognitive and other behavioral tests.  
 
Safety Population:  All subjec ts who receive a dose of the study drug will be included in the 
safety population. Safety summaries will use the safety population.

12.3 Statistical  Analysis  
 
12.3.1  Subject Disposition  
 
The num ber of screen failures, subjects enrolled, completed, or di scontinued from the study 
and the reason for study discontinuation will be tabulated by treatment group. The number of 
discontinued subjects will be broken down by treatment period of the study. Su bject count by 
analysis population will be tabulated. Scree n failures with reason for screen failure will be 
summarized.  
 
12.3.2  Protocol  Deviations  
 
Protocol deviations will be categorized as major or minor. Major deviations will be 
summarized by treatment group  and type (reason) of deviation. Decisions regarding 
major/ minor  deviations  will be determined  by medical,  data management  and statistical  review 
prior to database lock, as these deviations determine inclusion/exclusion in the PP  population.  
 
Protocol devi ations (both major and minor) will be included in the listings.  
 
12.3.3  Demographics and Baseline  Characteristics  
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be listed and summarized by treatment  group 
and overall.  
 
12.3.4  Safety  Analysis  
 
All safety data will be li sted with pertinent information, e.g., demographics, treatment group.  
Safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Safety data will be listed and 
summarized in tabular and/or graphical form. No formal statistical t esting will be performed 
on these  safety  data.  Summaries  will be provided  by treatment  group.  Descriptive  statistics  will 
be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compiled for 
classification of qualitative safety  data.  
 
12.3.4.1  Adver se Events  
 
AEs will be col lected after the first dose in the AE page of the CRF. AEs occurring during 
screening through pre -dose Day 1 that are not procedure related will be captured and reported 
as medical history. TEAEs will be defined as AEs with a star t date after the first dos e of the 
study drug. Non -serious AEs will be collected through the Follow -up visit. SAEs will be 
collected  through  30 days post last dose (as reported  through  subject -initiated  contact  following 
the Follow -up visit).  
 
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs, treatment -emergent SAEs, and 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be summarized for treatment group/period by 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities® (MedDRA®) (most recent version) system 
organ class (SOC) and/or preferred  term (PT).  
 
Summaries of TEAEs may include:

• by PT in descending order of  frequency  
• by SOC and  PT 
• by SOC, PT, and  severity  
• by SOC, PT, and relationship to study drug (unrelated vs.  related)  
AEs of possible or probable relationship to study drug will be c ombined for the “related” 
summaries.  
 
12.3.4.2  Other Safety  Assessments  
 
Summary statistics for vital signs, including blood pressure,  heart rate, respiratory rate, and 
temperature,  will be presented  for each scheduled  time point  measured  and for the change  from 
baseline to each time  point.  
 
Clinical laboratory data and change from baseline will be summarized by the scheduled time 
point. Subject incidences of change in classification with respect to the laboratory normal 
ranges  will be summarized  as shift tables.  Baseline  will be the last non-missing  value  obtained 
before randomization. Clinically significant clinical laboratory abnormalities will be reported 
and included in the AE  tabulations.  
 
Clinically significant physical examination abnormalities will be report ed and included in the 
AE tabulations.  
Screening and Week 6 ECGs will be summarized descriptively. 
The C -SSRS results will be summarized descriptively.  
12.3.4.3  Concomitant Medications  
 
Concomi tant medications will be coded using the most current WHODD and summariz ed by 
ATC code. All reported concomitant medications will be provided by randomized treatment 
group.  
 
12.3.5  Analysis of Neurocognitive and Other Behavioral  Measurements  
 
An efficacy outcome measure of focus is the MGH -HPS ( Keuthen et al., 1995 ). The MGH - 
HPS is a 7-item self -report scale that rates urges to pull hair, actual amount of pulling, 
perceived  control  over the behavior,  and distress  associated  with hair pulling  in the past 7 days 
on severity scale from 0 to 4 for each item (total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores 
reflecting greater disease severity. Overall changes in the MGH -HPS and changes in MGH - 
HPS sub -factor 1 and sub -factor 2 scale scores will be analyzed. T he percentage of subjects 
experiencing clinically significant change versus tho se not experiencing clinically significant 
changes based on CGI -S/CGI -C and the PGI -S/PGI -C will be compared using Fisher’s Exact 
Test.

Results of the BIS, SST, C GT, RTI, PAL, MGH -HPS, PGI -S/C, CGI -S/C, MIST -A, and TSD  
will be summarized descriptively by  treatment.  
 
Change  from  baseline  for MGH -HPS,  PGI-S/C, CGI-S/C, MIST -A, and TSD  will be analyzed 
using linear mixed models using treatment, SSRI/SNRI strata, visit, treatment by visit 
interaction as factors. Estimates of the treatment effect (least square s means with 95% 
confidence intervals) will be obtained from this model. Impact for poten tial covariates will be 
explored using this same model. Multiple imputation methods may be explored to determine 
the impact  of missing  responses.  Supportive  analysis  of covariance  models  for the change  from 
baseline at Week 3, Week 6, and the last available post -baseline value will be used. Estimates 
of treatment effect (least squares means with 95% confidence intervals) will be  obtained.  
 
For SST, CGI, RTI, and PAL (co llected only at Baseline and Week 6 ), analysis of covariance 
models for the change from baseline at Week 6 will be used. Estimates of treatment effect 
(least squares means with 95% confidence intervals) will be obtained.  
 
For the neurocognitive and other b ehavioral measurements, the primary  analyses will use the 
PP Population. Subjects who miss more than 5 consecutive doses or a total of 6 or more days 
of study drug prior to or as assessed at the Week 3 visit will be dropped from PP Population 
analyses  and replaced.  Subjects  withdrawn  from  analyses  for non-compliance  will be given  the 
option of completing the study, including continuing on study drug and completing 
assessments.  Subjects  who miss more  than 5 consecutive  doses  or 6 or more  total days of study 
drug prior to or as assessed at the  Week 6 visit will be dropped from PP Population analyses 
but not  replaced.  
 
Five consecutive days or a total of 6 or more days of non -compliance with daily TSD 
completion at either the Week 3 or between the Week 3 and We ek 6 visits will result in the 
subject being withdrawn from PP Population analyses (and replaced if observed at Week 3).  
 
Analyses may be repeated using the FAS.  
 
Planned  analyses  will follow  standardized  instruction  manuals  for neurocognitive  assessments,  
where such manuals  exist.  
 
Results will be presented with no adjustment for multiplicity.  
 
12.3.6  Analysis of Glutathione  Concentrations  
 
Glutathione levels will be summarized descriptively.

1 The screening period may be extended by 10 days on a case -by-case basis with medical monitor or designee 
approval. The screeni ng assessments may be split across multiple visits; however, the screening neurocognitive 
and other behavioral assessments must be  done at the same visit.  
2 On Day 1, the site will review any changes in medical/psychiatric history or concomitant medication s to 
confirm eligibility in the study.  
3 ePRO: Training (Day 0) will be performed on site. After all of the screening assessments are complete, the 
subject will be instructed to complete the TSD at home every 24 hours (evening) for a 7 -day run -in period 
within the screening window.  
4Subjects with  confirmed sterility (e.g. oophorectomy) are excluded.  
 
Notes:  
Subjects who terminate early will be asked to return for the Week 6 assessments along with the following: 
physical examination, vital signs assessment, and urine pregnancy test (female subjects ). 
Unscheduled visits may be performed at the Investigator’s discretion. Assessments performed at unscheduled 
visits will be done at the investigator’s discretion and results must be recorded in the electronic case report

APPENDIX F CAMBRIDGE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST 
AUTOMATED BATTERY  
 
 
Version  1.0 20 July  2018  
 
Introduction  
 
The CANTAB Connect electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used to ru n cognitive 
tests, capture subject responses and record data for transfer to Cambridge Cognition Limited.  
 
The system offers a simple touch -screen interface to guide the test adminis trator through the 
process of entering required subject information e.g. s ubject number, any required 
demographic details and selecting the appropriate visit. The system then automatically 
administers the CANTAB tests for the subject and visit selected.  
 
The system informs the subject how to complete each CANTAB task and each ta sk includes 
practice and assessed phases. The system automatically records all subject responses. 
CANTAB Connect automatically synchronizes with the server at the end of each session  to 
transfer data to the secure server.  
 
The following CANTAB Connect task s will be used in the clinical study.  
 
Reaction Time (RTI)  
 
In this reaction time task the participant must hold down a button at the bottom of the iPad 
screen,  with the index  finger  of their dominant  hand,  until a yellow  spot briefly  appears  in one 
of five circles  at the top of the screen.  Once  the yellow  spot has flashed  in one of the circles

the subject must release the button and with the same finger touch inside the circle where the 
yellow spot appeared as quickly as they can.  
 
The voiceover introduc es the RTI test to the participant explaining how the test should be 
completed. There is a sh ort practice phase prior to the assessed phase. The participant will  see 
five circles at the top of the screen and a button at the bottom of the  screen.  
 
 
The voi ceover prompts the participant to practice touching the button at the bottom of the 
screen and then informs the subject that they should hold this button down until a yellow spot 
flashes in one of the circles above. Once they see the yellow spot app ear the y should release 
their finger from the button as quickly as they can and using the same finger touch the circle 
where  the yellow  spot appeared.  Once  they have  touched  the circle  they must  return  their finger 
to the button and hold the button until they see  another yellow spot flash in one of the circles 
above and then once again touch the circle where the yellow spot  appeared.

The RTI task includes a practice phase (10 trials) followed  by the assessed phase. The 
voiceover  reminds  the subject  that they should  go as quickly  as they  can whilst trying  to avoid 
making any mistakes. 30 assessed trials are then  presented.  
 
The key outcome measures for this task are median reaction and movement  time.  
 
Stop Signal Task (SST)  
 
The Stop Signal Task (SST) is a clas sic stop signal reaction time test that measures the 
participant’s ability to inhibit a response. The subject is shown two buttons on the screen, one 
on the right side of the screen and the other on the left hand side of  the screen. Arrows appear 
in the mi ddle of the screen and the participant learns to press the button corresponding to the 
direction in which the arrow points.  
 
The task starts  with a practice  phase  where  the subject  simply  responds  by touching  the button 
on the left side of the screen when the arrow points to the left and the button on the right hand 
side when the arrow points to the right. A stop signal (an auditory tone) is then introduced. If 
a stop signal  is presented,  the participant  must  inhibit  their response  i.e. try not to touch  the on- 
screen button. A stop signal occurs on 25% of  trials.  
 
 
 
 
 
The assessed phase with the stop signal (tone) is presented in 4 blocks. At the end of each 
assessed block, a graphic representing the participant’s performance is shown on screen. 
Depending on the participant’s performance on the previous block the partic ipant is 
encouraged  to either  go faster  or slower  on the next block,  whilst  trying  not to touch  the button 
whenever they hear the  tone.

The time between the arrow being shown on screen , and the delay interval between the 
participant hea ring the tone (Stop Signal Delay (SSD)) is varied throughout the task.  
 
Paired Associates Learning (PAL)  
 
The Paired Associates Learning task consists of a number of stages, which the subject must 
complet e in order. For each stage, boxes are displayed on t he screen. These boxes are opened 
one at a time, in a randomised order. Two or more of the boxes will contain a pattern. The 
patterns shown in the boxes are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one  at a time, and 
the subject must touch the box where  the pattern was originally located.

When  the participant  successfully  identifies  the correct  box for all of the patterns  the test moves 
to the next level.  The PAL  test gradually  becomes  more  difficult  with the number  of boxes  that 
contain a pattern increasing from 2 trials with 2 boxes that contain a pattern, 1 trial with 4 
patterns, 1 trial with 6 patterns. Following successful completion of the trial with 6 boxes 
containing a pattern, 8 boxes are presented on the  screen.  
 
If the participant is not successful, the boxes will reopen to remind the participant where the 
patterns  were.  The participant  will have  up to 4 chances  to correctly  identify  the location  of the 
patterns at each level. If the participant fails after 4 attempts at any level the test will end. If a 
participant  is successful  at the 8 box level  the final level  will show  12 boxes  on screen  with each 
box containing a  pattern.

Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)  
 
The participant is pre sented with a row of 10 color squares at the top of the screen. Some of 
the squares are blue in color others red. Beneath these colored squares are two buttons, one 
labelled  red and the other  blue.  The participant  is informed  that a yellow  token  is hidden  in one 
of the colored  boxes.  The participant  should  touch  the red button  at the bottom  of the screen  if 
they think it is more likely that the yellow token will be hidden in a red box or the blue  button 
if they think it is likely to be  hidden in a blue  box. 
 
 
 
 
If the participant is correct they see the words You Win. If incorrect the participant will see 
You Lose.

In the assessed phase the participant is given 100 points and can bet on their decision. The 
proportion of the total score that the participant wants to bet is selected as the number on the 
screen counts up or down from 100% by tapping the Red or Blue box to place the desired bet 
amount.  
 
The participants total score increases or decreases incrementally dependent on successful or 
unsuccessful bet outcome. The total score is displayed at the top of the screen.  
 
 
 
 
The participant must try to amass as many p oints as possible.

1.1 Title  
Riǀaƌoǆaban  ǀeƌƐƵƐ Waƌfaƌin in PaƚienƚƐ ǁiƚh Aƚƌial Fibƌillaƚion  ;ROCKET AF  ƚƌialͿ  
 
1.2 Intended aim(s)  
To compare the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial f ibrillation (AF) patients  at increased risk for stroke  
with rivaroxaban  versus  warfarin use.  
 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The primary outcome of the study was  composite of  stroke (ischemi c or hemorrhage) and systemic embolism.  
 
1.3.1 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable)  
The test was designed for noninferiority.   The most conservative approach was chosen, selecting the lower limit, ϭ.ϰϲ to 
obtain a ϵϱй power with a ϭ -sided α equal to 0.0Ϯϱ.  With  expected study duration was ϰ0 months, project event rate of 
Ϯ.ϯй per ϭ00 patient years in the warfarin group,  and ϭϰй  annual  attrition rate, ϰ0ϱ events were selected as the 
prespecified target to ensure a robust statistical result.  
 
1.4 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding  
Major bleeding; HR с ϭ.0ϰ (ϵϱй CI 0.ϵ0 -ϭ.Ϯ0)  
 
1.5 Trial estimate  
HR с 0.ϳϵ ( ϵϱй CI 0.ϲϲ -0.ϵϲ ) comparing rivaroxaban vs warfarin (Patel et al., Ϯ0ϭϭ)

5.1 Cohort Summary  
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score -matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing 
rivaroxaban  (at a  daily dose of Ϯ0mg  or ϭϱ mg ) to warfarin users . The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment 
during baseline period of ϭϴ0 days before initiation of rivaroxaban  or warfarin (index date) . We will restrict the analyses to 
patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with risk factors for stroke or systemic embolism . 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
 New users (defined as no use in ϭϴ0 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified.  
 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates  
      Rivaroxaban was approved  for non -valvular at rial fibrillation on November ϰ, Ϯ0ϭϭ . 
x For Marketscan : November ϰ, Ϯ0ϭϭ -December ϯϭ, Ϯ0ϭϴ (end of data availability).  
x For Medicare: November ϰ, Ϯ0ϭϭ -December  ϯϭ, Ϯ0ϭϳ (end of data availability).  
x For Optum: November ϰ, Ϯ0ϭϭ -December  ϯϭ, Ϯ0ϭϵ (end of dat a availability).  
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion /exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided 
in AƉƉendiǆ A  and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. VaƌiableƐ  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposur e of interest is initiation of rivaroxaban . Initiation will be defined by no use of rivaroxaban  or a comparator in the 
prior 6 months before treatme nt initiation (washout period).  
 
Comparator agents - 
x Initiators of rivaroxaban  will be compared to initiators of - 
o Warfarin  
 
6.2 Covariates:  
x Age 
x Sex 
x Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as ϭϴ0 days prior to 
and including index date  
 
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and 
analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient 
overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has 
passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial pow er assessment  and are listed in Table ϭ ( AƉƉendiǆ B ).

 ϲ  
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
 
Primary Effectiveness outcomes of interest  (definitions provided in Appendix A ):  
x Primary outcome: s troke (hemorrhagic, ischemic) and systemic embolism  
x Secondary outcome: Individual components  
o Hospital admission for stroke  (principal diagnosis position)  
o Hospital admission for systemic embolism (principal diagnosis position)  
 
Control outcomes of interest  (control outcomes only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further interpreted) :  
1. Major bleeding  
 
6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on da y of 
cohort entry.  Because adherence in the real -world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
 
For the as -treated analyses, the follow -up will sta rt the day after initiation of rivaroxaban  and comparator and will continue until the 
earliest date of the following events:  
x The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  
x The date of end of continuous registration in the database,  
x End of the study period,  
x Measured death event occurs,  
x Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to 
no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason.  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 ϳ x The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatm ent episode of the index drug 
(rivaroxaban  and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 10 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in 
main analyses).  
x  The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any other 
NOAC  (e.g. switching from rivaroxaban  or warfarin  to apixaban would be a censoring event);  
o A dosage change on the ind ex treatment does not fulfill this criterion  
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion  
 
 For the intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation 
will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow -up time of 365 days .

outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. 
Complete a ϭ:ϭ PS -matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only ϯ covariates: age, sex, and combined 
comorbidity index . Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (Ϯ00ϴ).

reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.

Brand Name Xarelto 
Generic Name rivaroxaban

Year 2011
Measurable endpoint Primary endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism
Exposure Rivaroxaban
Comparator Warfarin
Populationpatients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk 
for stroke
Trial finding HR = 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.96)
 No. of Patients                                                                                                         14,264 
Non-inferiority margin HR = 1.46
Power0.95 power of 95% to calculate a noninferiority margin of 1.46 with a 
one-sided alpha level of 0.025.
Blinding Double-blinded
Statistical MethodAlternative hypothesis of non-inferiority (NI) by a NI margin of 1.46 in 
hazard ratio (HR) based on on-treatment data from the per protocol 
population. The required number of primary efficacy endpoint events 
was determined based on the following assumptions: NI margin of 
1.46, 1-sided alpha of 0.025, power of >95% when true HR is 1, and 
exponential distributions. The margin was selected based on clinical 
appropriateness and quantitative analysis of relevant studies in Hart et 
al.
Approval indication For the reduction in the risk of stroke and systemic embolism 
resulting from atrial fibrillation

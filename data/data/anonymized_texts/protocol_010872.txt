Study Design and Methodology  
 Arm B and C , General  
• Clarification that the erlotinib dose for Arm s B and C may be reduced from 150mg in 
accordance with the prescribing information ( Sections 11.3.2 ; 8.3.1 ). 
• Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation status expanded to include “other 
rearrangements of the EGFR gene” ( Section 9 .1.4 Arm B Inc l. 12, and Arm C Section 
9.1.5 Incl.20). 
• CTs scan frequency: Patients who remain on treatment for 12 months or longer will require 
scans at a frequency of 6 months, or earlier if progression of disease is suspected  
(Section  10.2.10 ). 
• Patients who remain on BGB324 for 12 months or more will be able to reduce the 
frequency and number of assessments required at each visit.  Patients will return to clinic 
every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles) ( New Section 10.1.7).  
• The End of Study ( EOS ) is defined as when all patients have completed or withdrawn and 
the EOS visit has been completed ( Section 8.11).  
• Inclusion of 15% boundary  from the prescribed dose ( Section 13.4.8).  
• Post dose 30- hour ECG collection time point has been removed ( Section 10 and Table  5). 
• New Section 10.1.8 Visit schedule while on corticosteroids  
Additional weekly monitoring (physical exam, vital signs, hematology /  chemistry 
analysis) while patients are receiving prednisolone (or equivalent) at 10mg to 40 mg 
daily  
 
• New Section 11.3. 1.4 
BGB324 dose modification for steroids doses over 40mg daily (prednisolone equivalent)  
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 80 If a patient requires prednisolone (or equivalent) at daily doses above 40mg then 
BGB324 should be interrupted until the steroid dose is equivalent to or less than 40mg 
prednisolone daily, at which time weekly monitoring will be undertaken until the steroid 
dose is equivalent or less than 10mg (Section 10.1.8)  
For those patients who experience a BGB324 dose delay of ≥7 days, the BGB324 loading dose assigned should be repeated. If the patient was unable to tolerate the loading dose in Cycle 1 the repeat loading dose can be omitted. The requirement to 
reintroduce the loading dose should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
Steroid restrictions do not apply to topical/ inhaled/ eye or nasal drops.  If required, 
additional advice on the concomitant use of steroids with BGB324 should be obtained from the  BerGenBio  Medical Monitor . 
 
• Section 11.5 – Concomitant Medications and Procedures (New Text)  
Patients receiving BGB324 who require the support of prednisolone (or equivalent) at 
10mg daily or above should be monitored at weekly intervals whilst receiving treatment. If 
a patient requires prednisolone (or equivalent) at daily doses above 40mg then BGB324 
should be interrupted until the steroid dose is equivalent to or less than 40mg daily, at 
which time weekly monitoring will be undertaken until the steroid dose is equivalent to or less than 10mg.  
 Steroid restrictions do not apply to topical/ inhaled/ eye or nasal drops.  If required, 
additional advice on the concomitant use of steroids with BGB324 should be obtained from 
the BerGenBio Medical Monitor  
. 
 
Arm B  
• The r
equirement for collection of and analysis of circulating tumor cell (CTC)  samples in 
has been removed. Pharm
acodynamic  (PD) endpoints associated with analysis of CTC 
have been removed ( Sections  10.2.9.1 . 7.8). 
• As a 3-day loading dose has been confirmed in Arm A , reference to pharmacokinetic ( PK) 
schedules associated with a 2-day loading dose have been removed ( Table 6 updated). 
• Requirement for starting erlotinib 1 week prior to the first dose of BG324 has been removed  
(Section 9; Arm B ). 
• PK sampling will be limited to BGB324 and pre -dose PK sampling will stop at Cycle 3 
(Table 6 updated).  
• Cycle 1 –Day 1 assess ments have been removed (Section 10 .1.2.). 
• Clarification that only BGB324 PK samples will be required in Arm B ( Section 10).  
• Clarification on the requirements for T790M testing - patients who have progressed on 
osimertinib will not require retesting (New Section 10. 2.11). 
• The 28- day screening window may be extended to allow for T790M testing, all other 
assessments are to be conducted in the 28- day window  (Section 9.1.4 ; Arm B Incl.12 ). 
• Expansion of the inclusion criteria to allow patients who have progressed on an approved EGFR inhibitor to be considered for inclusion into the study  (Section 9 .1.4; Arm B 
Incl.14). 
• Clarification  that toxicities  associated with other EGFR inhibitors must  be <Grade 2 in 
severity at the time of first dose of BGB324  (Section 9.1.4 ; Arm B Incl. 15). 
• Confirmation  that afatinib  or gefitinib treatment must complete 1 week before the first dose 
of BGB324 ( Section  9.1.4; Arm B Incl .16). 
• Expansion to allow  up to 4 previous treatments in the advanced setting ( Section 9 .1.4; 
Arm B Incl 18 ). 
• Secondary objectives looking at BGB324 and erlotinib PK have been revised to reflect that 
only BGB324 PK samples will be  collecte d (Section 7.3.2 ). 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 of 80 • PK population revised to reflect that no erlotinib PK will be collected in Arm B 
(Section  14.4.1). 
 Arm C  
• This arm may be closed if Arm B stops or completes recruitment before Arm C reaches 
the 14patient target.  Patients already enrolled into Arm C will be able to continue in 
accordance with the protocol  (Section 8.5). 
• Clarification of the exclusion criteria to facilitate those patients who may have received 
alternative treatment while awaiting confirmation  of EGFR status ( Section 9 .1.5; Arm C  
Incl.24). 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Safety Justifications 
 
The protocol has been changed to include patients who experienced disease progression 
whilst receiving an approved EGFR inhibitor such as afatinib or gefitinib as an alternative to  
erlotinib. This has been done as the biological mechanisms of resistance to all 3 agents are similar and may be reversed following exposure to BGB324.  
 Pharmacokinetic data collected and analyzed to date supports that there is no interaction between erlotinib and BGB324, therefore no requirement to collect additional er lotinib PK  or 
long term pre -dose BGB324 PK. BGB324 PK will be collected as per schedule up to Cycle 3 
and EOS.  
 30hr ECG removed. ECGs are already being collected pre -dose on Day s 1,2, and 3. The 
change is not considered to have any impact on safety . 
 Arm B: Inclusion 18  - revised in response to Investigator eligibility request . The change is 
not considered to have any impact on patient safety  or study integrity.  
 Arm B: Inclusion. 14/15- The Sponsor has seen an increase in the use of EGFR  inhibitors 
other than erlotinib as standard of care.  Additional criteria have been implemented that 
restricts use to 1 week before the first dose of BGB324 and requires the patient to have Grade 
2 or less toxicities at the time of BGB324 dosing. 
 
Only erlotinib will be administered in combination with BGB324 thus t he change is not 
anticipated to have any effect on the safety of the patients . 
 
Revised visit schedule after 12 month:  This has been expanded from a visit each cycle to 
a visit to every 2 cycle s. This change in frequency is not anticipated to have any effect on 
patient safety  as it only applies to patients who have received treatment with BGB324 for one 
year, and reduces the visit burden for the patient.   
 Oral Corticosteroid use with BGB324  
Following advice from the FDA on preclinical data in mice with high dose steroids and 
BGB324, additional weekly monitoring has been introduced for those patients who require  
treatment  with 10mg  or above daily prednisolone (or equivalent) and guidance that  at  doses 
above 40mg daily BGB324 should be interrupted until the  steroid  dose is 40mg or less daily.

PRODUCT  BGB324  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Phase 1/2 
RATIONALE  In patients with non -small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) , there is 
a progressive decline in response to repeated lines of 
therapy, primarily due to development of biologic resistance 
within the underlying tumor and a progressive decline in 
patient performance status resulting from treatment - and 
disease- related morbidities.  There is a significant need for 
development of strategies that can prolong response and 
prevent development of resistance to earlier -stage treatment 
regimens.  
 
BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, 
a surface membrane protein kinase receptor that is 
over-expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has 
been identified as a marker of a poor prognosis in patients 
with NSCLC. In vitro  studies indicate that signaling through 
Axl stimulates several  pro-survival pathways, some of which 
are mediated by AKT phosphorylation and up -regulation of 
the epithelial receptor kinase pathway. Recent non- clinical 
data implicate Axl in development of resistanc e to several  
agents used in the treatment of NSCLC, especially epidermal 
growth factor receptors ( EGFR) inhibitors including erlotinib.  
 
This study is designed primarily to evaluate the safety  and 
tolerability  of BGB324 when administered in combination with 
erlotinib, and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of the combination of BGB324 and erlotinib in 
patients with Stage  IIIb or Stage IV NSCLC.  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a multi -center, multi -arm open -label Phase 1/2 study 
that will be conducted at approximately  10 clinical sites ; the 
number of sites may be revised to reflect changes in 
recruitment rates.  
 
Up to  60 patients with histologically - or cytologically -
confirmed Stage IIIb or Stage IV NSCLC will receive BGB324 
as a single agent (R un-in Cohort) or in combination with 
erlotinib  (Arms  A, B and C).  
 
At the time of Amendment 5, patient recruitment into the Run-In Arm ( BGB324 monotherapy)  
and Arm A (BGB324 
dose escalation in combination with erlotinib) was complete  
and the RP2D has been confirmed. Patients  that remain on 
treatment in the Run -in Cohort or Arm A should be followed 
up in accordance with the protocol schedule.  
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 80 Run-in Cohort  (Phase 1)  
Prior to commencing dosing of BGB324 in combination with 
erlotinib, the safety and tolerability of single agent BGB324 
will be assessed in a minimum of 6 patients . The safety data 
from the first cycle in  these  6 patients will be reviewed by the 
safety monitoring committee (SMC) before enrolment into 
Arm A can commence . 
 
Arm A (Phase 1)  
Arm A is designed to determine the daily dose  and loading 
schedule of BGB324 that can be safely administered in 
combination with erlotinib  in patients who have received prior 
treatment with erlotinib . The starting dose of e rlotinib will be  
150mg daily . Lower doses of erlotinib may be explored at the 
request of the SMC.  In addition to safety and tolerability, the 
pharmacokinetics  (PK) and pharm
acodynamics (PD) of 
BG
B324 and erlotinib will be evaluated.  
 
In Arm A , dose and dosing schedules will be explored to 
assess tolerability of the loading and daily  doses and to 
select the RP2D f or expansion into Phase 2 ( Arms B and C ). 
 
The dose of BGB324 will be escalated in a standard 3+3 
design. The starting dose level of BGB324 will be 600 mg 
loading dose (2 days) and 200 mg daily dose.  It is anticipated 
that a maximum of 3 BGB324 Dose Levels will be evaluated 
with up to 18 patients enrolled.  Alternative loading dose 
schedules may be explored in combination with daily dosing 
schedules  (see Table 4). 
 
Dose escalation may be stopped prior to achieving the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) if it is considered that a 
clinically acceptable recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D) 
has been achieved.  Safety will be reviewed by the Safety 
Monitoring Committee  (SMC ). 
 
When the  RP2D of BGB324 is identified and the dose of 
erlotinib to be administered in combination with BGB324 is 
confirmed, the Phase 2 part of the study will commence and 
Arms  B and C will open simultaneously to enrolment. 
 
Arm B (Phase 2)  
Arm B will follow a Simon -like 2-stage design with relaxed 
stopping for futility to evaluate the PK of BGB324 and the 
safety and tolerability, PD, and clinical efficacy  of BGB324 in 
combination with erlotinib in patients with an activating EGFR 
mutation who have progressed after receiving an approved 
EGFR inhibitor  (i.e., erlotinib,  afatinib, or gefitinib)  
 
For patients to be  eligible for Arm B , their EGFR  T790M 
status should be confirmed during the screening period prior 
to receiving the first BGB 324 dose. This can be done either 
via blood test ( circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA ]; serum or 
plasma;)  or tumor biopsy . Patients who test negative for 
T790M in ctDNA testing will require a confirmatory result from 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 80 a tumour biopsy. Both the  blood test/biopsy should be 
undertaken in accordance with local procedures and do not 
require central analysis . For patients to be eligible for Arm 
B, a negative EGFR  T790M result  must  be documented . 
Patients who  have previously been treated with  a T790M 
inhibitor (i .e., osimertinib) and who subsequently progressed 
will not require T790M  testing . 
 
If clinical response ( complete response  or partial response) 
or disease control (stable disease) is not evident  after 4 
cycles of treatment  in at least 1 patient among the first 9 
patients , no further patients will be enrolled. If at least 1 
patient in the first 9 patients demonstrates evidence of clinical 
response or disease control, an additional 16  patients will be 
enrolled.   
 
Recruitment will continue whilst data from the first 9 patient s 
are being analyzed. Thus, up to 25 patients are anticipated 
to be enrolled in Arm B.  
 Arm C  (Phase 2)  
Arm C will evaluate the safety  and t
 olerability , PD, and 
clinical efficacy (time to progression) of BGB324 when 
administered in combination with erlotinib in patients  with an 
activating EGFR mutation who have received  ≥12 weeks  of 
erlotinib without disease progression.  Up to 14 patients  will 
be enrolled. Recruitment into Arm C may be stopped if Arm 
B completes recruitment or is stopped before the 14 patient target is reached. Patients already enrolled into Arm C at thi s 
time will be allowed to continue in the study in accordance 
with the protocol.  
  
In all parts of the study, patients will be allowed to continue 
BGB324 treatment (in combination with erlotinib or as a 
single agent) for as long as, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
they continue to derive clinical benefit or until unacceptable 
toxicity, disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent.  
 
In the event of erlotinib- related toxicities in Arms A, B , or C, 
patients  who stop  treatment with  erlotinib  will be allowed to 
continue receiving BGB324 as a single agent until disease 
progression (unless unacceptable toxicity, disease 
progression,  death or withdrawal of consent ). Patients  who 
stop BGB234 treatment will be withdrawn from the study.

TREATMENT S AND  
INTERVENTIONS  Patient eligibility for the study, including assessment of EGFR 
mutation/T790M  status  in Arm B , and disease status 
according RECIST Version 1.1 will be performed within 
28 days prior to the first dose of BGB324.  The 28- day 
screening window may be extended to confirm T790 M status, 
however all other assessments including scans will be  
conducted in the 28-day screening window . Patients who 
have previously been treated with a T790M inhibitor (i.e., 
osimertinib) and who subsequently progressed and fulfil all 
other eligibility criteria will not require T790M testing.  
 
The treatment period will consist of continuous 21- day 
treatment cycles. Patients will be monitored through daily 
clinic visits on Day  1 to Day 4, Days 8, 9, and 15 in Cycle 1  
(and Day - 1 in Arms A and B)  and weekly during Cycle 2.  
Beginning with Cycle 3, patients will have a clinic visit on 
Day 1 of each cycle.  Patients who remain on treatment for 
12 months will need to return for a clinic visit every 2 cycles ( 
i.e. 6 weekly) . 
Patients receiving BGB324 who require the support of 
prednisolone (or equivalent) at 10mg to 40 mg daily should 
be monitored at weekly intervals whilst receiving treatment.  
Disease assessment will be performed at the end of every 2 
cycles or to confirm disease progression.  The frequency of 
scans may be extended to the end of every 3 cycles after 
12 weeks ( 4 cycles) and every 4 cycles after 24 weeks 
(8 cycles). Patients who remain on treatment for 12 months 
or longer may have their scans extended to a frequency of 6 
months, unless disease progression is suspected in which 
case a scan should be conducted at an earlier time point.  
 
The end of study (EOS) visit will occur 28 days after the last 
dose of study drug (including study withdrawal) . 
STUDY DRUG DOSE, 
SCHEDULE, ROUTE of 
ADMINISTRATION  In the Run -in Cohort , BGB324 will be administered as a 
single agent. In Arms A , B, and C, BGB324 will be 
administered in combination with erlotinib.  At the t ime of 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 80 Amendment 5 the Run  in Cohort  and Arm A have completed 
recruitment . 
 
BGB324  
BGB324 is prepared in size zero capsules each containing 100 mg of drug substance for oral administration.  
 
BGB324 will be self -administered orally on an empty stomach 
according to a daily schedule during continuous 21- day 
treatment cycles. In Cycle 1, a loading dose of BGB324 may be administered followed by smaller daily  dose  (see Table 4) . 
 
 
Dose escalat ion can only occur in Arm A.  If unacceptable 
toxicity is reported, the Sponsor and Investigators may agree 
to implement a lower dose for investigation or other dosing 
schedules . 
 
In Arms B and C, BGB324 will be administered at the RP2D  
(the dose identified in Arm A  that can be safely administered 
in combination with erlotinib).  
 Erlotinib  
Erlotinib will be self -administered orally on an empty stomach 
according to a daily  schedule during continuous 21- day 
treatment cycles in Arms  A, B, and C. 
 The starting erlotinib dose in Arm A will be  150 mg daily.  
Patients  requiring a dose reduction before the end of Cycle  1 
will not be evaluable for toxicity and may be replaced. 
 
The prescribing information for erlotinib recommends a  
150mg dose for NSCLC patients , however if local clinical 
judgement /standards require, a patient in Arm B or C may be 
treated at a lower erlotinib dose (i.e., 100 mg). 
 
If a patient  presents with erlotinib toxicities that warrant dose 
reduction, the dose may be reduced in accordance with the

PARTICIPATION  Patients may remain on study until disease progression, 
development of unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of 
consent . 
 
Patients  in Arms A, B, or C who discontinue treatment with 
erlotinib may remain on BGB324 as a single agent .  
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 80 A patient who discontinues treatment with BGB324 but

CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Safety  
Safety will be assessed through the monitoring of adverse 
events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), 
clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation,  urinalysis)  vital sign measurements, 
ECG monitoring, ECOG performance status  and physical 
examinations.  
 Clinical Efficacy  
Clinical efficacy will be estimated based  on imaging 
assessments of disease status performed after every 2 
cycles (6 weeks) of treatment .  
 
The frequency of scans may be extended to the end of every 3 cycles after 12 weeks ( 4 cycles) and every 4 cycles after 24 
weeks ( 8 cycles). Patients who remain on treatment for 12 
months or longer may have their scans extended to a 
frequency of 6 months, unless disease progression is 
suspected in which case a scan should be conducted at an 
earlier time point.  
Identification of target and non- target lesions and 
assessment of treatment response and progression will be conducted according to RECIST Version 1 .1. Endpoints will 
include time to progression.  
 
Pharmacokinetics (Run-in Cohort, Arm A and Arm B only)  
Blood samples for assessment of PK for BGB324  and 
erlotinib  (Arm  A) will be collected at specified time points  
before and after beginning treatment with BGB324:   
• Cycle 1 Day -1: 0 (pre -dose), 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours2. 
• Cycle 1 Day 1 : 0 (pre -dose) . 
• Cycle 1  Day 2 : 0 (pre -dose) . 
• Cycle 1 Day 3 : 0 (pre -dose) , 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours . 
• Cycle 1 Day  4: 0 (pre-dose) . 
• Cycle 1 Day 8: 0 (pre -dose), 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours . 
• Cycle 1 Day 9 : 0 (pre -dose . 
• Cycle 1 Day 15 :0 (pre -dose) . 
• Cycle 2 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15: 0 (pre -dose) . 
• Cycl e 3 Day 1: 0 (pre -dose).  
• End-of-study  visit. 
Pharmacodynamics  
Blood and tissue samples for the evaluation of PD endpoints 
will be collected at baseline (within 28  days before the first 
dose of study drug after patient eligibility has been

BGB324 and at the time of disease progression. 
The tissue samples  for PD testing are optional and require 
additional consent. The tissue specimen collected at the time 
of disease progression should be derived from a lesion 
exhibiting progression.   
 
Pharmacodynamic samples will be analyzed to determine 
endpoints associated with Axl . 
STATISTICAL METHODS  The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 study are to 
determine the safety and tolerability of BGB324 administered 
in combination with erlotinib and to establish a RP2D . 
 Arm B will incorporate a 2- stage design that is intended to 
minimize patient exposure if preliminary evaluation of activity 
sugg ests the combination may not be active.  
 
The s
tatistical analysis will be primarily descriptive in nature 
and will account for all dose levels studied. Although all 
clinical efficacy analysis for this study is to be regarded as 
essentially exploratory, there will be a formal hypothesis test  
for the  objective response rate in Arm  B.  
 
This will consist of 1- sided, within -group tests of proportion of 
responders, against the null hypothesis of a response rate 
≤5% (this being the observed response rate under current 
treatment). Values of p <0.2 will be taken as sufficient 
evidence of a trend to justify further study.  
 
The PK of erlotinib in combination with BGB324 will be 
compared to that when erlotinib is administered alone.

 INTRODUCTION  
In patients with non -small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) , there is a progressive decline in response 
to repeated lines of therapy, primarily due to development of biologic resistance within the 
underlying tumor and a progressive decline in patient performance status resulting from 
treatment - and disease -related  morbidities  (NCCN Treatment Guidelines Version 4.2014) . 
There is a significant need for development of strategies that can prolong response and prevent development of resistance to earlier -stage treatment  regimens.  
 BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein kinase receptor that is over -expressed in many metastatic solid tumors (Linger, 2008)  and has 
been identified as a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC  (Ishikawa, 2013; 
Zhang, 2012) . In vitro  studies indicate that signaling through Axl stimulates a number of 
pro-survival pathways, some of which are mediated by AKT phosphorylation and up -regulation 
of the epithelial receptor kinase pathway  (Korshunov, 2012) . Recent non- clinical data 
implicate Axl in development of resistance to a number of agents used in the treatment of 
NSCLC, especially epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibitors including erlotinib  
(Brand, 2014; Byers, 201 3; Zhang, 2012) . The current  study is designed primarily to evaluate 
the safety of the Axl inhibitor BGB324 when administered in combination with erlotinib, and to 
establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of BGB324 and erlotinib 
in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage  IV NS CLC.

6.1.2  Inhibition of p roliferation of NSCLC c ells 
The anti -proliferative activity of BGB324 was demonstrated in a panel of human NSCLC cell 
lines by either resazurin cell viability assay or colony formation assay. As summarized in Table 
2, BGB324 inhibited proliferation of several human lung cancer cell  lines with half maximal 
inhibitory concentration ( IC50) values of 0.4 - 0.8 μM; the anti -proliferative effect was 
dose-- responsive (not shown).

The ability of BGB324 to inhibit cell proliferation was investigated in a panel of 654 human 
tumor cell lines. When administered at a concentration of 1 µM, BGB324 inhibited proliferation 
by >50% in 48 of the cell lines tested, including 10/101 NSCLC . 
 
6.1.3  Re-sensitization to e rlotinib in a NSCLC c ell line by BGB324 
It has been reported that Axl mediates chemoresistance in a variety of cancer types, including NSCLC (Zhang, 2012), breast cancer (Liu, 2009), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (Alvarez, 
2010). In vitro  and in vivo  models also suggest that Axl activation is one of the main 
mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR targeted therapies in NSCLC (Zhang, 2012) and 
inhibition of Axl may restore drug sensitivity.  
 To evaluate whether BGB324 can restore sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, the 
erlotinib -resistant human NSCLC cell line NCI -H1299 was treated with BGB324 
(concentrations of 200, 500 and 750 nM) and erlotinib (concentrations of 1 and 3 μM) and  
evaluated in a colony formation assay. As can be seen in Figure 1 , the combination of BGB324 
and erlotinib restored erlotinib- sensitivity, in an additive or synergistic manner, as 
demonstrated by the substantial inhibition of proliferation.  
 
Figure 1 Restoration of Erlotinib Sensitivity in NSCLC Cells  
  
 
 
To confirm these results, a 3 -dimensional (3- D) tumorsphere assay was performed  in 
NCI-H1299 NSCLC cells treated with BGB324 ± erlotinib.  This study showed that BGB324 in 
combination with erlotinib demonstrates an additive or synergistic effect (p  <0.05) in inhibiting 
the growth and establishment of NCI -H1299 lung cancer cells in Matrigel ( Figure 2 ).

6.1.4  In vivo anti-tumor activity of BGB324 and e rlotinib  
The anti -tumor activity of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib was evaluated in the human 
A549 NSCLC xenograft model. Treatment was initiated when tumors reached 100 mm3. 
BGB324 alone at doses of 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg orally twice daily  (BID) were evaluated, as 
well as BGB324 at 50 and 100 mg/kg orally BID  with erlotinib at 75 mg/kg orally once daily . 
Single agent BGB324 showed minimal anti -tumor activity, while the combination of BGB324 
and erlotinib resulted in significant (p <0.005) anti -tumor activity ( , left panel). BGB324 alone 
and in combination with erlotinib was well -tolerated, as evidenced by evaluation of body weight 
(Figure 3 , right panel), and there was no drug- related mortality.

The anti -tumor activity of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib was further evaluated in a 
xenograft model of the human HCC827 NSCLC, which bears an EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Mice 
were treated with vehicle alone, BGB324 at 50 and 100 mg/kg orally BID , erlotinib at 50 mg/kg 
orally once daily  (QD) or a combination of both drugs, using a 5- day on and 2- day off dosing 
schedule.  As shown in Figure 4 , animals receiving single agent erlotinib began to develop 
acquired drug resistance at approximately Day 100.  However, combination dosing with 

BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 80 BGB324 significantly delayed the onset of acquired resistance to erlotinib by at least 40  days 
(n=7- 8, p <0.001).

6.1.5  High Dose Steroids and Mouse Model  
In an academic model of osteoporosis, BGB324 was administered in combination with high 
dose corticosteroids (12.5 mg/kg per day of prednisolone). In this research study, 6 out of 7 
mice experienced severe toxicity after five continuous days of combination therapy.   Four out 
of 7 animals died and the other 2 were euthanized for humane reasons. The exact mechanism 
of this effect is currently under investigation.  The mice received very high levels of 
corticosteroids to induce rapid onset of osteoporosis – on a mg/kg basis, the corticosteroid 
dose was 20 fold higher than a typical high dose commonly used in clinical practice. 
Additionally, the dose of BGB324 used in this model was 50mg/kg which is 6 fold higher than 
the maximum exposure observed in human clinical studies.  
 
 
6.2 Clinical Studies with BGB324  
There has been1 previous clinical study conducted with BGB324 (Protocol BGBC001 ). This 
study explored the effect of a single administration  of BGB324 i n healthy male subjects . Eight 
dose levels (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg) were 
evaluated under fasted conditions in cohorts of 4 subjects  (32 subjects  in total ). Seven of these 
subjects went on to receive  a single administration of the same dose of BGB324 under fed 
conditions . 
 
The current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) contains a description of ongoing studies and 
preliminary safety data and should be used as a reference in conjunction with the protocol.  
 
6.2.1  Summary of clinical safety  to date 
In general , exposure to BGB324 in healthy subjects was well tolerated with all toxicities being 
spontaneously reversible and predominantly gastrointestinal in nature.  No serious adverse 
events (SAE) were reported.  Adverse events (AE) judged as related to BGB324 are 
summari zed in Table 3 .

In addition to this study there is one other clinical study of BGB324 recruiting patients with 
either relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or high- risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome. 
Treatment with BGB324 has been generally well tolerated with most AEs  being mild or 
moderate in severity and reversible. Approximately one half of patients who receive treatment 
with BGB324 experience gastrointestinal AEs  including diarrhea  and nausea. Further details 
can be found in the current version of the IB. 
 ECG findings  
In light of the recoverable, non- adverse decreases in heart rate and corresponding increases 
in the RR interval durations observed in the cardiovascular study in monkeys, each subject in Study BGBC001 underwent serial electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment after administration 
of BGB324.  At the 1500 mg dose level, 3 subjects had increases from baseline in QT interval 
utilizing Fridericia’s correction ( QTcF ) of >30 ms, with subject exceeding 60 ms.  Three 
subjects ( 1 in the 400 mg group and 2 in the 1000 mg group) had noticeable, mild changes in 
T-wave morphology from baseline (flattening and, in one case, broadening).  
 
6.2.2  BGB324  pharmacokinetics  
Concentrations of BGB324 were quantified in plasma samples from subjects enrolled in Study 
BGBC001 using a fully -validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS) method with a lower limit of quantitation of 2.0 ng/mL.  Pharmacokinetic  
parameters were derived by non -compartmental analysis using WinNonlin Phoenix 
Version 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation Inc., Mountain View, CA ). 
 Following a single oral administration  of BGB324 at doses of  50 - 1500  mg, mean maxim um 
plasma concentrations  achieved (C
max) of 7.6 to 388 ng/mL were reached 8- 23 hours 
post-dose . 
 The mean apparent terminal half -life of BGB324 was 45.6 to 88.7 hours . Between- subject 
variability in systemic exposure (area under the curve extrapolated to infinity [ AUC
0-∞] and  Cmax) 
to BGB324 at 50 mg to 1500 mg was generally high (coefficient of variation of 25.8% to 96.7% 
for area under the curve within a dosing interval [ AUC 0-t] and  Cmax), most probably reflecting 
variable absorption. Across this dose range, C max of BGB324 increased approximately dose 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 80 proportionately, although the AUC 0-∞ of BGB324 increased slightly greater than dose 
proportionately  
Figure 5 Mean Plasma Concentrations of BGB324 Following a Single Oral 
Administration of BGB324 at 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600, 1000, and 1500 mg 
to Healthy Male Subjects 
 
 
Following administration of BGB324 with food (whole milk and buttered toast) to 7 subjects 
who had previously received BGB324 , there was an overall reduction in the between- subject 
variability with an increase in systemic exposure to BGB324 in 3 subjects, no appreciable 
change in 3 subjects and an apparent reduction in 1 subject.  It was estimated that 
administration with food would achieve an increase in exposure in some subjects of up to 2-
fold. 
 
6.2.3  Rationale for BGB324 starting dose  
In healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of BGB324, the elimination of BGB324 
was slow, with mean apparent terminal  half-life >24 hours . The administration schedule and 
starting dose of BGB324 proposed for Study BGBC004 is based on fitting a 1e- compartment 
model, incorporating a lag time and no weighting, to the available clinical PK data. It is 
anticipated that administration of a loading dose  of BGB324 on Day s 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 , 
followed by daily dosing at a lower level , will deliver the optimum exposure of BGB324 . The 
application of a loading dose will facilitate achievement of therapeutic levels, whil e daily dosing 
will prevent  wide changes in systemic concentration during therapy. The simulated mean 
plasma concentr ation- time profile of BGB324, based on the PK  model, following dosing of 
BGB324 at 600 mg on Day s 1 and 2 and 200 mg daily thereafter is presented in Figure  6. 
 
In Arm A , dose and dosing schedules have been explored to asses s tolerability of the loading 
and daily doses and to select the RP2D for expansion into Phase 2 ( Arms B and C).

Oral Administration of 200 mg BGB324 to Healthy Male Subjects Under 
Fasted Conditions (Loading Dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2)  
 
On the basis of the PK profile identified in healthy subjects, it is anticipated that a loading dose 
of 600 mg on Day s 1 and 2 of Cycle 1, followed by 200 mg daily thereafter  will maintain mean 
systemic concentrations of approximately  400 ng/mL. PK -ECG mod eling performed on the 
data collected in healthy subjects  showed that  a plasma concentration of 400 ng/mL would be 
expected to result in a mean increase in QTcF of 54.3 ms (90% CI of mean increase of 47.7 and 58.2 ms) from baseline.

 STUDY DESIGN 
 
8.1 Overview  
This is a multi- center open- label Phase 1/2 study of BGB324 as a single agent (Run -in Cohort) 
and in combination with erlotinib (Arms A , B and C) in patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV 
NSCLC.   
At the time of Amendment 5, patient recruitment into the Run -In Cohort  (BGB324 
monotherapy) and Arm A (BGB324 dose escalation in combination with erlotinib) has 
completed  and the RP2D has been confirmed. Patients that remain on treatment in the Run-
in Cohort  or Arm A must  be followed up in accordance with the protocol schedule.  
 
This study is  anticipated to be conducted at  approximately  10 sites in the US and in Europe 
(the number of sites and the involvement of European sites may be revised to reflect changes 
in recruitment rates) , and will enroll approximately  60 patient s with histologically - or 
cytologically -confirmed Stage IIIb or Stage IV NSCLC.  
 
It is anticipated that up to 6 pa tients will be enrolled in the R un-in Cohort, 18 patients in Arm 
A, up to 25 patients in Arm B , and up to 14 patients in Arm  C.
 Recruitment into Arm C may be 
stopped if Arm B completes recruitment or is stopped before the 14 patient target is reached. 
Patients already enrolled into Arm C at that time will be allowed to continue in the study in 
accordance with the protocol  
 Prior to starting dosing of BGB324 in combination with erloti nib, the safety and tolerability of 
single agent BGB324  will be assessed in the Run -in Cohort  (Phase 1) in patients who have 
either exhausted existing licens ed therapies or are unsuitable f or existing licens ed therapies 
for NSCLC.  A minimum of  6 patients must each receive at least 1 continuous 21- day cycle of 
BGB324 before enrolment into Arm A can commence.  
 
Arm A  (Phase 1) incorporates a standard 3+3 design to determine the dose of BGB324 that 
can be safety administered in combination with erlotinib in patients who have received prior 
treatment with erlotinib . To confirm the RP2D for Arms B and C,  loading dose schedules, 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 80 loading doses and daily dose levels will be explored in Arm A. D osing schedules will be revised 
in response to reported toxicities, DLT experience and SMC recommendations ( Table 4). 
 
When the RP2D dose of BGB324 is identified and the dose of erlotinib to be administered in 
combination with BGB324 is confirmed, the Phase 2 part of the study will start and Arms B and C will open simultaneously to enrolment.  
 Arm B will incorporate a 2- st
 age design to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD and 
cl
inical activity of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib in patients  with an activating EGFR 
mutation ( including exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [L858R ] substitution or other 
rearrangement 
of the EGFR gene ) who are T79 0M negative and who have progressed after receiving 
treatment with  an approved EGFR  inhibitor (i .e., erlotinib , afatinib, or gefitinib ). Patients who 
have previously been treated with  a T790M inhibitor (i.e., osimertinib) and who subsequently 
progressed will not require T790M testing.  
 Arm C will evaluate the safety  and tol
 erability , PD and clinical activity (time to progression) of 
B
GB324 when administered in combination with erlotinib in patients with an activating EGFR 
mutation (including exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [L858R ] substitution or other 
rearrangement 
of the EGFR gene  mutation) who have received ≥12 weeks treatment with erlotinib without 
disease progression.   
 
In all parts of the study, BGB324 will be self -administered orally on an empty stomach 
according to a daily schedule during continuous 21- day treatment cycles .  
 Erlotinib will be self -administered orally on an empty stomach as specified by  a daily schedule 
during continuous 21- day treatment cycles  (Arms A , B, and C only). 
 
Both drugs will be taken with water in the morning.  BGB324 should be administered in the 
hour following erlotinib administration and at least 2 hours before breakfast.  
 Patients will be allowed to continue BGB324 treatment (as a single agent or in combination 
with erlotinib) if , in the opinion of the Investigator, they continue to derive clinical benefit or 
until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent.  Patients who 
stop BGB324 treatment will be withdrawn from the study.  
 An outline of the study design is provided in Figure 7.  
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 80 Figure 7 BGBC004 Study Design Outline  
 
Arm C will recruit up to a maximum of 14 patient s. Recruitment into Arm C may be stopped if Arm B 
completes recruitment or is stopped before the 14 patient target is reached. Patients already enrolled 
into Arm C will be allowed to continue in the study in accordance with the protocol.  
 
8.2 Run-in Cohort  (Phase 1)  
The primary goal of the Run- in Cohort is to establish the safety and tolerability of BGB324 
administered as a single agent . Eligible patients will have either exhausted existing licens ed 
therapies or be unsuitable for treatment with existing licensed therapies for NSCLC.  BGB324 
will be administered at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1, followed by 
200 mg daily thereafter . 
 
The safety data from a minimum of 6 patients who have each received at least 1 cycle of 
treatment with BGB324 will be reviewed by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  before 
enrolment into Arm A can commence.  The SMC will be comprised of a representative from 
each actively -recruiting investigational site and a representative of the Sponsor  study team.  
 
8.3 Arm A ( Phase 1 ) 
The primary goal of Arm A is to establish the dose of BGB324 administered in combination with erlotinib  to be used in Arms B and C .  
 Patients in Arm A will have received ≥ 6 weeks treatment with erlotinib.  This may either be 
historical treatment in which case there may have been an interval prior to the study and 
erlotinib treatment must be re -started ≥1 week immediately before the first dose of BGB324  
or the treatment may be current and ongoing at the time of the fi rst dose of BGB324 (Cycle 1, 
Day 1). 
 All erlotinib toxicities must be well controlled and <Grade 3 at the time of the first dose of 
BGB324 (Cycle 1, Day 1).  
 Erlotinib is typically administered in patients with activating EGFR mutations and it is 
anticipated that the majority of patients enrolled in Arm A will have activating mutations in EGFR; however, patients with wild- type EGFR  who are receiving erlotinib for treatment of their 
NSCLC are eligible to participate in Arm A .

In addition to safety and tolerability, the PK of  BGB324/erlotinib  and t
he PD of BGB324 and 
er
lotinib will be evaluated.  
 When
 the RP2D of BGB324 is identified  the Phase 2 part of the study will start and Arms B 
and C will open simultaneously to enrolment.  
 
8.3.1  BGB324 and erlotinib dose levels  
The dose of BGB324 will be escalated  following  a standard 3+3 design in combination with 
erlotinib . The starting dose level of Arm A (600 mg loading dose administered over 2 days  with 
a 200 mg daily) was selected based on the results of PK modelling. 
 
The total loading dose may be given over 2 days (Days 1 and 2) or 3 days (Days 1, 2, and 3) *. 
Possible dosing levels are illustrated in  Table 4 also describes the maximum dose escalation 
step for any increase in loading or daily dose.  Note that although the half -life of BGB324 has 
resulted in the recommendation to give a BGB324 loading dose over 2 days to achieve steady 
state by Day 4, the use of the loading dose will depend on tolerability and DLT evaluation, and 
the SMC may recommend the dose  is reduced.  This may be achieved by giving the total 
loading dose over 3 days, giving a lower (including intermediate) loading dose, or not giving a 
loading dose at all.  
* At the time of Amendment 5 a 3 day loading dose schedule has been confirmed  
 In Arm A, a t least 3 evaluable patients will be entered per dose  cohort according to the  3+3 
study design as described below.  A dose cohort will include at least 3 patients on the same 
loading dose schedule and daily  dose level . 
 The SMC may consider that data from 3 patients at any dose level is sufficient to confirm the 
RP2D. In addition, the SMC may recommend that alternative dose levels or dosing schedules 
are explored as part of the study. At the time of patient registration, the loading dose schedule, 
loading dose and daily  dose will be confirmed.

If 2 DLTs occur in the combination treatment at the Arm A BGB324 starting dose, a lower dose level may be 
investigated (see Section 8.3.2)  
 If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn for reasons other than DLT prior to completing Cycle 1, 
the patient will be replaced for the purposes of toxicity evaluation.  Patients who experience a 
DLT during C ycle 1 may continue on BGB324 treatment ( at their assigned daily dose or lower).  
 In Arm A t he starting erlotinib dose will be 150 mg daily during the first continuous 21- day 
treatment cycle.  Patients who require an erlotinib dose reduction prior to completing 1 cycle 
of treatment will not be evaluable for toxicity  and may be replaced.  After completion of Cycle 1 
the daily dose of erlotinib may be reduced in accordance with the patient prescribing 
information. In response to potential toxicity the SMC may recommended evaluating lower 
doses of erlotinib.  
 The prescribing information for erlotinib recommends a 150mg dose for NSCLC patients, 
however if local clinical judgement/standards require, a patient in Arm B or C may be treated 
at a lower  erlotinib dose (i. e.,100 mg). 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 80  
8.3.2  Dose escalation scheme 
In Arm A, i nitially 3 patients will be recruited at a starting dose of 600 mg on Days 1 and 2 
followed by  200 mg daily , and must  complete 1 21-day cycle of treatment  before a dose 
evaluation is made . A patient must receive all loading doses and miss no more than 3 daily 
doses in Cycle 1 to be considered as informative  to support dose escalation, unless the 
inability to administer BGB324 was a result of treatment -related toxicity.  
 
If 1 patient in a cohort experiences a DLT during Cycle 1, the cohort will be expanded to 6 
patients.  If2 of 3 or 2 of6 patients in a cohort experience DLT, no further dose- escalation will 
take place and the prior dose level will be nominated as the RP2D.  
Safety reviews and recommendations for dose escalation or reduction will be made by the 
SMC. Minutes of the SMC meetings will be placed in the Trial Master File.  The decision to 
dose escalate will be based on the safety and tolerability of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib observed in the first cycle of treatment. 
 If dose escalation occurs, 3 patients will be recruited at Dose Level 2 and will complete 1 cycle 
of treatment before a dose  escalation evaluation is made, as outlined above.  
 Dose escalation may be stopped prior to achieving the MTD if it is considered by the Sponsor 
and SMC that a clinically acceptable  RP2D has been achieved. If the starting dose  exceeds 
the MTD, a lower dose, or dosing schedule ( including an extended loading dose schedule) 
may be explored if recommended by the SMC.  
 
If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn for reasons other than DLT prior to completing Cycle 1, 
the patient will be replaced for the purposes of evaluation of BGB324 dose. The operating 
characteristics of the 3+3 dose escalation process are summarized in Figure 8 .

8.3.3  Assessment of DLTs  
AEs will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE  Version 4.03 (See 
Appendix 4)  during the first cycle ( 21 days) of treatment  in Arm A for the purposes of 
establishing the dose  of BGB324  that can be safely given in combination with erlotinib.  
 
DLTs will include:  
• Any non -hematological toxicity ≥Grade 3, except Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea 
that resolves within 72 hours with optimal therapy . 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia persisting for ≥5 days  or Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia. 
• Treatment discontinuation or dose reduction for >72 hours during the first cycle as a 
result of treatment -related toxicity . 
 
8.4 Arm B  (Phase 2)  
Arm B will follow a S imon -like 2-stage design with relaxed stopping for futility  to evaluate the 
safety  and tolerability , PK, PD and clinical efficacy of  BGB324 in combination with erlotinib in 
patient s with an activating EGFR mutation(s)  (including exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [L858R ] 
substitution or other
 rearrangement of the EGFR gene mutations)  who during screening have 
been confirmed as T790M  negative , who h ave progressed after receiving an approved EGFR 
inhibitor  (i.e., prior erlotinib , afatinib, or gefitinib) and who have radiologic al confirmation of 
progressive disease .  Patients who have progressed on osimertinib and fulfill all other Arm B 
criteria will not require testing of T790M status.  0 DLT

BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 80 If clinical response (complete response or partial response) or disease control (stable disease) 
is not evident after 4 cycles of treatment in at least 1 patient among the first 9 patients enrolled, 
no further patients will be enrolled  in Arm  B. If at least 1 patient in the first 9 patients 
demonstrates evidence of clinical response or disease control, an additional 16 patients will 
be enrolled. Recruitment will continue whilst data from the first 9 patients are being analyzed.  
Thus, up to 25 patients are anticipated to be enrolled in Arm B.  
 
The daily dose of erlotinib may be reduced in accordance with the erlotinib prescribing 
information and in line  with standard practice.  If a patient  presents  with erlotinib toxicities that 
warrant that they stop treatment with erlotinib, then they  should be either withdrawn from the 
study  or they may continue receiving BGB324 as a single agent until disease progression  
(unless unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent ). 
 
8.5 Arm C (Phase 2)  
Arm C will evaluate the safety  and t olerability , PD and clinical ef ficacy (time to progression) of 
BGB324 in combination with erlotinib in the first -line setting.  Eligible patients  will have 
activating EGFR mutation(s) ( including exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [ L858R ] substitution or 
other r
earrangement of the EGFR gene  mutations) ≥12weeks  of erlotinib without disease 
progression at the time of the first dose of BGB324 (Cycle 1, Day 1),  with e rlotinib -related 
toxicities well- controlled and <Grade  3.  
 
The daily dose of erlotinib may  be reduced in accordance with the erlotinib prescribing 
information.  If a patient  presents with erlotinib toxicities that warrant that they stop treatment 
with erlotinib , then they should be either withdrawn from the study  or may continue receiving 
BGB324 as a single agent until disease progression (unless unacceptable toxicity, death or 
withdrawal of consent ). 
 
Recruitment into Arm C may be stopped if Arm B completes recruitment or is stopped before 
the 14 patient target is reached. Patients already enrolled into Arm C will be allowed to 
continue in the study in accordance with the protocol.  
 
8.6 Overall Study Duration and Follow -Up 
The study period will consist of screening, treatment  and an EOS visit. The EOS visit will occur 
28 days after the patient  has discontinued BGB324 treatment.  
 
8.7 Screening  
Patient  eligibility for the study will be determined within 28 days prior to the first dose of 
BGB324  (Cycle 1 , Day 1). Screening assessments will be conducted according to 
Section 10.1.1 and Table 5.  
 
In Arm B, the screening period may be extended to accommodate T790M confirmation from 
tumor biopsy  Patients who have previously been treated with  a T790M inhibitor (i.e., 
osimertinib) and who subsequently progressed will not require T790M testing. A ll other 
assessments including scans should be conducted in the 28- day screening period.  
 
8.8 Treatment  
Eligible patient s will visit  the study site to receive study  drug and protocol -specified procedures 
according to Section  10.1.2 to Section  10.1.4 and Table 5. The treatment period will consist 
of continuous 21 -day treatment cycles.   
 All patients will be carefully  monitored throughout Day 1  to Day 4 in Cycle 1 and will attend 
the clinic on C ycle 1, Day 8, Cycle 1, Day 9 and  Cycle 1 , Day 15 (and Day - 1 in Arm A) .  
 
Pati
ents will attend the clinic once per week (on Cycle 2, Day1, Cycle 2, Day 8 and Cycle 2, 
Day 15) during Cycle 2  and then once per cycle (on Day  1) thereafter  up to 12 months of 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 80 treatment ( Cycle 17). Patients who remain on study after 12 months will attend the clinic every 
2 cycles ( 6 weekly).   
 
Patients who do not receive loading doses as assigned but are considered suitable for daily 
dose treatment should attend the clinic for additional ECG assessments. Twice weekly 
triplicate ECGs should be conducted during C ycle 1, D ay 8 – D ay 15 and Cycle 1, 
Day 15 -D ay 21. 
 
Additional visits will be scheduled for disease assessment at the end of every  2 cycles 
(6 weeks)  cycles. The frequency of scans may be extended to the end of every 3 cycles after 
12 weeks ( 4 cycles) and every 4 cycles after 24 weeks ( 8 cycles). Patients who remain on 
treatment for 12 months or longer may have their scans extended to a frequency of 6 months 
unless disease progression is suspected in which case a scan should be conducted at an earlier time point.  
 
Patients will continue to receive BGB324 (in combination with erlotinib or as a single agent) 
for as long as, in the opinion of the Investigator, they continue to derive clinical benefit or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent.  
 
In the event of erlotinib- related toxicities in Arms A , B, and C, patients  may be allowed to 
continue receiving BGB324 as a single agent until disease progression  unless unacceptable 
toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent . Patients  who stop BGB234 treatment will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
 
8.9 End-of-Study Visit  
Patients will return to the study site for an EOS visit 28 days after the last dose of study drug 
(or at study withdrawal ) according to Section 10.1.5 and Table 5.  
 If BGB324 -related toxic ities continue beyond this follow -up period, patients  will be followed 
until all BGB324- related toxicities have resolved to ≤Grade 1, stabilized or returned to 
baseline.  If necessary, f ollow- up monitoring for AEs may be conducted over the telephone.  
 
8.10 Study Stopping Rules  
The Sponsor  may close a site or terminate the study or arm of the study at any time . The 
Investigator  may also terminate the study at his/her  clinical site at any time, provided there is 
reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
 
Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is st opped due to safety concerns.   
 The reason for closure of an investigational site or termination of a study or arm of the study 
by the Sponsor  may include but is not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious or unacceptable risk to patients  enrolled in 
the study . 
• Failure of the Investigator  to comply with the protocol and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
guidelines . 
• Inadequate recruitment of patients . 
• Attainment of the study objectives . 
• As a result of commercial considerations , including discontinuation of further clinical 
development of BGB324  in NSCLC. 
 
8.11 End of Study  
The EOS is defined as when all patients have completed or withdrawn and the EOS  visit has 
been completed.  Patients who continue to receive clinical benefit while receiving BGB324 may 
remain on treatment until such time of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 80 who remain on treatment after 12 months of treatment (C ycle 17) will have a revised visit and 
assessment schedule.

and the end- of-study visit.  
 
Urinalysis will be performed on Days 1, 8 , and 15 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, Day 1 in all 
subsequent cycles and the EOS visit. 
 
10.2.2  Pregnancy tes t 
In women of child bearing potential a serum pregnancy test should be taken at screening and 
Day 1 (and  on Cycle 1 , Day -1 for patient s in Arm A  unless conducted as part of screening 
procedures within 3 days prior to Cycle 1 , Day 1) and at the EOS  visit.  
 
During the study, a urine pregnancy  test should be repeated every 3 months.   
 Should a patient  suspect that pregnancy may have occurred an unscheduled pregnancy test 
should be conducted. The patient  must have negative test s for eligibility and continuation on 
the study.  
 
10.2.3  Vital signs  
Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate  and oral  temperature  will be consistently recorded at 
all study visits (with the exception of visits performed for disease assessment ).

8, and 15 in Cycles 1 2 and Day 1  in Cycle 3 onwards.  
 
10.2.7  Performance status  
Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale (see Appendi x 1) at screening, 
Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 2 and the EOS  visit. 
 
10.2.8  Pharmacokinetic assessments  
Detailed procedures for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be 
provided in the laboratory manual.  Approximate blood volumes required for PK analysis will 
be included in the patient information sheet, actual volumes will depend upon the arm to which 
the patient has been enrolled and the duration of treatment.  
 Blood samples will be taken for the determination of BGB324 in plasma in the Run- in Cohort  
and Arm B and for the determination of BGB324  and erlotinib  in Arm A at the time  points 
shown in Table  6. 
 
If there is sufficient PK data from the first 9 patients in Arm B , consideration may be given to 
omitting PK sampling in the second 16 patients.  In addition, sampling on Day 1 of each cycle 
will be discontinued after Cycle 3.

Pharmacokinetic schedules should be adhered to  where possible. Pre-dose samples should 
be taken has close to the erlotinib/BGB324  dose as possible (and within a maximum of 
20 minutes prior to the erlotinib dose).  At each post -dose time point an approximate 
±20 minute window is allowed.   
 Standard procedure should be followed for the collection of blood and the preparation of 
plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis.  Sufficient blood ( approximately 3 m L) should 
be collected and processed to support the preparation of duplicate 1  mL plasma samples  
(primary sample for analysis and secondary sample for retention).   
 
 
 
 
10.2.9  Pharmacodynamic assessments  (Arms A, B and C)  
 
 Pharmacodynamic tissue and blood samples  
Detailed procedures for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be provided in the laboratory manual.  The effects of BGB324 on PD  endpoints of Axl inhibition 
will be determined in blood samples and tissue specimens (see Section 7.8).  
 A tumor tissue sample for analysis of PD endpoints should be taken using a core needle 
biopsy at  baseline ( within 28  days before  the first dose of BGB324 , after patient eligibility has 
been confirmed), 1 on-study collection time  point performed any time after 14  days of 
continuous exposure to BGB324 during Cycle 1 or in Cycle 2 and 1 collection time  point at the 
time of disease progression and prior to the EOS  visit (derived from the lesion exhibiting 
disease progression).  
 Standard clinical site  practice should be followed for the collection of core needle tumor  tissue 
samples . These samples are optional and will only be taken from patients  providing separate 
consent in Arms A , B and C.   
 
10 mL (2 x 5  mL) blood samples (for the preparation of plasma and buffy coat fractions) will 
be collected for all patients  enrolled in Arms  A, B, and C at baseline ( within 28  days before  the 
first dose of BGB324 and after patient eligibility has been confirmed), 1 on-study collection 
time point performed any time after 14  days of continuous exposure to BGB324 during Cycle  1 
or in Cycle 2 and 1 collection time  point at the time of disease progression and prior to the 
EOS visit.  
 Note:  If a patient has consented to have optional tumor biopsy  samples taken, the PD blood 
samples should be taken at the same time.

2.10 C
linical efficacy  
Disease assessment will be performed at screening and at the end of every 2 cycles (6 weeks) 
beginning with Cycle 2, Day 21; the assessment may be performed up to 5 days before Day  21 
(Day 17 - Day 21) but attempts should be made to conduct the assessment as close to Day 
21 as possible.   
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 80 
 Disease assessment may be performed prior to initiation of the next cycle, but results must be 
available prior to initiation of treatment and must confirm continued eligibility for next cycle.   
 
• Patients who remain on treatment for 12 months or longer may have their scans extended 
to a frequency of  6 months,  unless disease progression is suspected  in which case a scan 
should be conducted at an earlier time point.  
 Disease assessment and confirmation of response will be performed according to RECIST  
Version 1.1  guidelines  (Eisenhauer, 2009 ).  
 
10.2.11  T790M confirmation  
 For patients to be  eligible for Arm B , their latest EGFR  T790M status should be confirmed 
during the screening period. This can be done either via blood test ( circulating tumour DNA 
[ctDNA ], serum or plasma)  or tumour biopsy.  Both the  blood test/biopsy should be undertaken 
in accordance with local standard procedures  
  Patients who have previously been treated with a T790M inhibitor (i .e., osimertinib) will not 
require T790M testing and will be  eligible providing they meet all other inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  
For those patients who have not been on a T790M inhibitor , blood- based testing  using 
circulating tumor DNA  for the presence of the mutation may be utilised, however if a negative  
T790M blood result is obtained, the result requires confirmation on biopsy material.  
 
 STUDY TREATMENT  
The Sponsor  will provide BGB324 to each study site. 
 Erlotinib will be obtained locally and administered following institutional practices.   
 
11.1 Treatment Schedule and Administration of BGB324 
BGB324 will be self -administered orally on an empty stomach according to a daily schedule 
during conti nuous 21- day treatment cycles.   
 
The BGB324 dose will be based on the cohort and study arm to which the patient is enrolled.  
BGB324 should be administered with water in the morning at least 2  hours before breakfast 
and best efforts should be made to administer BGB324 at the same  time each day , other than 
study visit days when BGB324 should be administered during the visit .  
 Patients will record their dosing at home in a dosing diary that will be reviewed at each study visit by the site staff.  Patients will be instructed as to the importance of following the dosing 
instructions they have been provided with and for maintaining an accurate and up -to-date 
dosing record.  Patients will also be instructed to bring their dosing diary and all BGB324 
bottles, including unused and empty bottles, with them to each study visit.  The site staff will 
record the amount of used and unused BGB324 capsules  at study visit s.  
 
11.2 Treatment Schedule and Administration of Erlotinib  
Erlotinib will be self -administered orally  with BGB324 on an empty stomach according to a 
daily schedule during continuous 21- day treatment cycles.  Best efforts should be made to 
administer erlotinib in the morning at the same  time each day , other than on the morning of 
study visit days when erlotinib  should be administered during the visit.  Erlotinib should be 
administered with water.  Patients will be instructed to take their erlotinib dose first followed by 
BGB324 within the next hour .  
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 80 
 Patients will record their dosing at home in a dosing diary that will be reviewed at each study 
visit by the site staff.  Patients will be instructed as to the importance of following the dosing 
instructions they have been provided with and for maintaining an accurate and up -to-date 
dosing record.  Patients will also be instructed to bring their dosing diary and all boxes of 
erlotinib , including unused and empty boxes , with them to each study visit.  The site staff will 
record the amount of used and unused erl otinib at study visits.  
 
11.3 Dose Modification  
The AE profile for BGB324 suggests that diarrhea and gastrointestinal disturbances are 
frequentl y reported (see current  IB for further information).  As BGB324 and erlotinib  have the 
potential for overlapping toxicities  patients  should be advised accordingly and provided 
with antidiarrheals for symptomatic management . 
 Dose modifications and dose interruptions to manage toxicities should be considered for both 
BGB324 and  erlotinib.  Dose modifications for  erlotinib should be undertaken in line with the 
curren t prescribing information.   
 
Dose modifications and recomm endations for the management of  toxicities  suspected to be 
related to BGB324 are provided in Table 7 and Table 8. 
  
11.3.1  BGB324  toxicities and dose modification 
 
 BGB324 loading dose toxicities   
If the patient is unable to tolerate the loading doses (i .e. for example  more than a single 
CTCAE grade worsening of any adverse event or the appearance of any new Grade 3 
toxicities) , they may continue with the assigned daily  dose, but will be required to attend the 
clinic for additional ECG assessments between Cycle 1, Days 8 and 15 and between Cycle 1, 
Day 15 and the end of Cycle 1.  
 
 BGB324 daily dose toxicities  
Recommended BGB324 dose modifications are provided in Table 7 and Table 8. 
If, after a 14-day delay,  treatment -related toxicity has not resolved, the patient may be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to being withdrawn from the study.  
 
For those patients who experience a BGB324 dose delay of ≥7 days,  the BGB324 loading 
dose assigned should be repeated.  If the patient was unable to tolerate the loading dose in 
Cycle 1 the repeat loading dose can be omitted. The requirement to reintroduce the loading 
dose should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
 
Drug holidays for reasons other than BGB324 or erlotinib  toxicity may be permitted on a 
case --by-case basis  and should be discussed with the Medical M onitor .

Notes:  
• Treatment interruption for BGB324-related toxicity should be limited to 14 days ,  
• Dose reduction below 100 mg daily is not possible (a single capsule contains 100 mg BGB324) , 
• Patients being considered for dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of BGB324, may be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor , 
 
 BGB324 dose modification for QTC  
BGB324 demonstrates some potential for QTc prolongation. In order to reduce the risk of QTc 
prolongation, all efforts should be made to maintain the patient’s  serum potassium levels at 
>4 mmol/L during treatment with BGB324 and for 2 weeks following completion of therapy  (at 
an unscheduled visit, if required) . If a patient presents with QTcF prolongation of ≥ Grade 2, 
the dose modification / dose interruption r ecommendations (Table 8) are recommended.

Notes:  
• Serum calcium, magnesium and potassium should be measured regularly whilst receiving BGB324; all 
abnormal results should be corrected. 
• The mean QTcF value from  triplicate ECG  readings should be used when considering dose modification  
• Treatment interruption for BGB324-related toxicity should be limited to 14 days . 
• Dose reduction below 100 mg daily is not possible (a single capsule contains 100 mg BGB324) . 
• Patients being considered for dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of BGB324 should  be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor . 
 
 
 BGB324 dose modification for steroids doses over 40mg daily (prednisolone 
equivalent)  
If a patient requires prednisolone (or equivalent) at daily doses above 40mg then BGB324 
should be interrupted until the steroid dose is equivalent to or less than 40mg daily, at which 
time weekly monitoring will be undertaken until the steroid dose  is equivalent or less than 
10mg (Section 10.1.8)    
 For those patients who experience a BGB324 dose delay of ≥7 days, the BGB324 loading 
dose assigned should be repeated. If the patient was unable to tolerate the loading dose in 
Cycle  1 the repeat loading dose can be omitted. The requirement to reintroduce the loading 
dose should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
 Steroid restrictions do not apply to topical/ inhaled/ eye or nasal drops.  If required, additional 
advice on the concomitant use of steroids with BGB324 should be obtained from the BerGenBio Medical Monitor . 
 
 
 
11.3.2  Erlotinib  dose reduction 
In Arm A Cycle 1 , the erlotinib dose should be maintained at 150mg daily for at least 21 days, 
after which  dose reductions may be made in accordance with the erlotinib prescribing 
information.   In Arms B and C , erlotinib d ose reductions may be made in accordance with the current 
erlotinib prescribing information. The prescribing information for erlotinib recommends a 
150mg dose for NSCLC patients, however if local clinical judgement/standards require, a 
patient in B and C may be treated at a lower erlotinib dose (i.e.,  100mg) . 
 
11.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
No additional treatment for NSCLC may be taken during the study period. 
 
Previous adjuvant therap y is permitted provided it  has been completed for ≥6 months.  
 Previous radiotherapy for cerebral metastases  is permitted providing this is completed 
≥2 weeks  before the first dose of BGB324 and  provided  the patient  is neurological stable and 
does not require  corticosteroids . 
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 80 
 11.5 Concomitant Medication and Procedures  
All prescription, non -prescription, or over -the-counter medications , including herbal remedies , 
taken by  the patient  at entry and during the study must be clearly documented in the eCRF.   
 
The patients must be instructed that no additional medication will be allowed without the prior 
consent of the I nvestigator.  Any medication considered necessary for the patient’s safety and 
well-being may be given at the discretion of the I nvestigator.   
 Hematopoietic  growth factors may be administered for the treatment of AEs  such as 
neutropenic infections but should not be used to maintain the dose intensity of BGB324 in the Run-in Cohort or Arm A.  
 
Patients who have evidence of treatment benefit after ≥1 cycle (21 days) of treatment in 
Arms  B or C may receive hematopoietic  growth factors to maintain BGB324 dosing.  
 
Concurrent treatment with any agent known to  cause Torsade de Points  is an exclusion 
criterion for the study.  A comprehensive list of these prohibited medications is provided in 
Appendix 3. 
 
Anti-diarrheal  medications (e.g. loperamide)  may be administered according to standard 
practice for the management of diarrhea. Patients must be provided with anti -diarrheal 
medications to take home, which may be used if required. 
 Patient s being treated with antacid, histamine receptor 2 inhibitors  or proton pump inhibitors 
on study entry will be excluded.  The Investigator may  initiate  rescue treatment with these 
medications during the study, providing they are taken in the evening.  
 Patients receiving BGB324 who require the support of prednisolone (or equivalent) at 10mg 
to 40mg daily should be monitored at weekly intervals whilst receiving treatment. If a patient 
requires prednisolone (or equivalent) at daily doses above 40mg then BGB324 should be interrupted until the steroid dose is equivalent or less than 40mg daily, at which time weekly 
monitoring will be undertaken until the steroid  dose is  equivalent or less than 10mg.  
 
 
Steroid restrictions do not apply to topical/ inhaled/ eye or nasal drops.  If required, additional 
advice on the concomitant use of steroids with BGB324 should be obtained from the BerGenBio Medical Monitor . 
 
 
 
11.6 Discontinuation of Treatment and Withdrawal  
Patients  may withdraw informed consent and discontinue from the study at any time, or for 
any reason, without prejudice to their future treatment.  
 
The reason for the patient’s withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the e CRF.  
 
A pat ient must be discontinued from the study if any of the following criteria are met: 
• Patient  non-compliance with the protocol, as agreed by the I nvestigator  and the 
Sponsor . 
• Patient lost to follow -up. 
• Termination of the study by the S ponsor . 
• Subject  experiences an unacceptable toxicity that precludes continuation in the study, 
as agreed by the I nvestigator and the Sponsor.  
• Lack of recovery from a DLT to Grade 0 or 1 within 14 days of occurrence . 
• Female patient  becomes pregnant.  
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 80 
 • Disease progression. 
 
11.7 Patient Replacement  
Patients in Arm A who discontinue during the DLT assessment period ( Cycle 1  [21 days ]) for 
any reason other than a DLT  will be replaced. All other patients who discontinue study 
treatment will not be replaced.  
 
 MANAGEMENT  OF STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Every patient enrolled in the study will receive BGB324 as a single agent (Run- in Cohort) or 
in combination with erlotinib ( Arms A, B, and C). 
 
12.1 BGB324  
Accountability for study treatment  BGB324 is the responsibility of the Investigator . The 
Investigator /designee must ensure that BGB324 will be dispensed to patients in accordance 
with the protocol and that any unused BGB324  will be  reconciled in accordance with written 
instructions from the Sponsor . 
 Study staff should refer to the pharmacy manual for specific instructions regarding the 
handling, storage, dispensing of BGB324.  
 BGB324 has been manufactured in accordance with appropriate Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) standards.  BGB324 will be label led in compliance with GMP Annex 13 requirements , 
US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) requirements  and local regulatory guidelines. 
 BGB324 will be supplied in size zero Swedish orange hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) 
capsules at a dose strength of 100 mg for oral dosing.   
 Please refer to the current version of the IB for additional information on the physical, chemical 
and pharmaceutical properties of BGB324. 
 
12.1.1  BGB324 storage  
BGB324 will be shipped to the site and must be stored at the site in a secure location under ambient temperature conditions  (store below 77
0F). The patient dosing diary will provide 
guidance for storage at home.  
 
12.1.2  BGB324 accountability  
The Investigator/designee must  maintain complete and accurate accountability records for 
BGB324, showing the date of receipt and quantity of all supplies of investigational product . 
These records must include accurate patient- specific dispensing information, including 
quantity , bottles dispensed, date dispensed and quantity and date returned.   
 
At the end of the study , reconciliation must be made between the amount of BGB324  supplied, 
dispensed with reconciliation of any discrepancies.  The Pharmacy manual will contain 
additional information on the reconciliation and returns procedures.  
 
12.2 Erlotinib  
Erlotinib will be stored and dispensed following institutional guidelines.  
 The Investigator or his/her designee must maintain complete and accurate erlotinib  dispensing 
logs, including the amount  administered and the date. 
 
 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTIN G 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs, including SAEs ; 
measurement of protocol- specified clinical laboratory  assessments ; 12-lead ECGs  
measurement  of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -specified tests that are 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 80 
 deemed critical to safety evaluation of each patient.  Certain types of events require immediate 
reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section  13.5. 
 
13.1 Adverse Event  Definitions 
 
13.1.1  Adverse event  
According to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for GCP , an AE 
is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An AE can therefore be any of the 
following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),  
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product,  
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product . 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency or severity of a known condition); worsening of the patient’s underlying 
cancer is not considered an AE. 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g. , headache) not present at  
baseline. 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g. , ECG, X -ray) that  is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or  concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug . 
• AEs that are related to a protocol- mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g. , invasive scr eening  procedures , such as 
biops y, blood sampling). 
 
13.1.2  Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal (i.e. , the AE actually causes or leads to death) . 
• Is life -threatening (i.e. , the AE, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at  
immediate risk of death).  This does not include any AE that had it  occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death . 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, with exception of those events described in Section 13.4.7. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. , the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient‘s ability to conduct normal life functions) . 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to  study 
drug. 
• Is a s ignificant medical event in the Investigator's judgment (e.g. , may jeopardi ze the  
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) . 
 
The terms  severe  and serious  are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of  an AE 
(rated as mild, moderate, severe or life threatening or according to NCI CTCAE criteria  
Version 4 .03 [Appendix 4] ; see  Section 13.3.1 ). The event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as  severe headache without any further findings).  Severity and 
seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
 SAEs must  be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. , no more than 
24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 13.5 for re porting guidelines).  
 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs are recorded on the AE eCRF  pages  
and appropriately reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided. 
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 80 
 For each AE recorded on the AE eCRF, the Investigator will make an assessment of 
seriousness , severity (see  Section 13.3.1 ), and causality . 
 
13.2 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period will begin following the first dose of BGB324 (Run -in Cohort) or 
erlotinib (Arms  A, B, and C) and will end 28 days after the last dose of BGB324.  If study  
drug- related toxicities continue beyond this period, patients will be followed until these  
toxicities have resolved to ≤Grade 1 or less, stabilized or returned to baseline.  Any study  
drug- related SAEs will be collected indefinitely.  
 
Any SAEs occurring between informed consent and the first dose of BGB324 or erlotinib must also be reported to the Sponsor according to the process in Section 13.5 and also recorded 
on the eCRF if the patient receives study treatment.  
 
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each patient contact.  
 All AEs, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the 
patient‘s  medical record and in the AE eCRF.  A consistent methodology of non -directive 
questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE information at all patient evaluation time  points.  
Examples of  non-directive questions include the following:  
• How have you felt since your last clinic visit?  
• Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?  
 
13.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
 
13.3.1  Assessment of severity of a dverse events  
The AE severity grading  scale for the NCI CTCAE Version 4 .03 (Appendix 4) will be used for  
assessing AE severity.   
 
For AEs not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE, the guidelines  in Table 9 will be used for 
assessing severity.  
 
Table 9 Guidelines for Assessment of Severity for Adverse Events not Listed in 
CTCAE  
Grade  Guideline  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; or intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily livinga 
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting self -care activities of daily livingb,c 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicatedd 
Grade 5  Death related to adverse eventd 
a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding one's self, 
using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden.  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event 
per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 1 13.1.2 . 
d. Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events per the definition of serious adverse 
event in Section 13.1.2 .

 13.3.2  Assessment of causality of adverse e vents  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the 
event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or  not an 
AE is considered to be related to BGB324 and/or related to erlotinib  indicating " suspected" or 
"not related " accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration:  
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug. 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction,  
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable) . 
• Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments . 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study . 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the even t. 
• Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event . 
 
Causality will be assessed individually for  each protocol -mandated t reatment . 
 
13.4 Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology  and concepts when recording AEs on  
the AE eCRF. C olloquialisms and abbreviations  should be avoided. 
 
Only one AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AE eCRF. 
 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the AE eCRF rather than  individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than  jaundice, asterixis and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs  and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characteri zed as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and 
replaced by one AE report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds 
to the starting date of the first  symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
 A pre -existing medical condition which is present at the start of the study and described in the 
Medical History eCRF, should only be recorded as an AE or SAE if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on the AE 
eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by 
including applicable descriptors (e.g. “more frequent headaches”).  
 
13.4.1  Adverse events occurring secondary to other events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g. , cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or  serious 
secondary events.  However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to  an initiating 
event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events  on the AE eCRF.  
 For example:  
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy  adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe h emorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported  
separately in the eCRF . 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all 3 events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 80 
 • If neutropenia is accompanied by a mild, non- serious infection, only neutropenia  
should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by a severe or serious infection, both events  should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
All AEs should be recorded separately on the AE eCRF if it is unclear as to  whether the events 
are associated.  
 
13.4.2  Persistent and r ecurrent adverse events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient  
evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the AE  eCRF.  The initial 
severity of the event should be recorded and the severity should be updated to reflect the 
most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  If the event  becomes serious, the AE  
eCRF should be updated to reflect this. A recurrent AE is one that resolves between patient 
evaluation time points and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence  of an AE should be recorded 
separately on the AE eCRF.  
 
13.4.3  Abnormal l aboratory and ECG v alues   
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE.   
 
A laboratory test result should be reported as an AE if it is assessed to be clinically significant.  
Suggested criteria  for the assessment of clinical significance are : 
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms . 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g. , dosage modification, treatment  
interruption or treatment discontinuation) . 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g. , potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy . 
• Requires more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc. 
• Is judged as c linically significant in the Investigator‘s opinion. 
 
Abnormal laboratory results clearly consistent with the pattern of NSCLC disease or progression  do not need to be reported as an AE.  
 It is the Investigator‘s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory  abnormality should 
be classified as an AE.  If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease 
or syndrome (e.g. , alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the ULN associated with 
cholecystitis), only  the diagnosis (i.e. , cholecystitis) should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome,  the 
abnormality itself should be recorded on the AE eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the 
test result is above or below the normal range (e.g. , "elevated  potassium," as opposed to 
"abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical 
term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE.  For example, an 
elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L  should be recorded as hyperkalemia.   
 Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit  should 
not be repeatedly recorded on the AE eCRF, unless the etiology  changes.  The initial severity 
of the event should be recorded and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event  worsens.  
 
13.4.4  Abnormal vital sign values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result should be reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms . 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 80 
 • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g. , dosage modification, treatment  
interruption or treatment discontinuation) . 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy . 
• Is judged as clinically significant in the Investigator‘s opinion. 
It is the Investigator‘s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific  
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality  should 
be classified as an AE. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or 
syndrome (e.g. , high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e. , hypertension) should be 
recorded on the AE eCRF. 
 
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit  should 
not be repeatedly recorded on the AE eCRF unless the etiology  changes.  The initial severity 
of the event should be recorded, and the severity or  seriousness should be updated any time 
the event worsens.  
 
13.4.5  Abnormal liver function tests 
An AE meeting the following criteria should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of its 
initial discovery:  
 
An increase in ALT or AST greater than 3.0  times  the ULN accompanied by an increase in 
serum bilirubin at least 2.0  times the ULN or in the presence of clinical jaundice in the absence 
of any non- drug related cause such as viral hepatitis.  
 The event must then be reported to the Regulatory Authority following the process for SAEs (see Section 13.6). 
 
13.4.6  Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the AE reporting period that are attributed by the Investigator  solely 
to cancer progression should be recorded only on the End of Treatment eCRF and not as an 
SAE. All other on- study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on  
the AE eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor. Death should be considered an 
outcome and not a distinct event.  
 The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as 
the single medical concept on the AE eCRF.  Generally, only  1 such event should be reported.  
The term sudden death should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt  and unexpected 
death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre -existing heart disease, 
within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 
24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting,  the term unexplained death  should be recorded 
on the AE eCRF.  If the cause of  death later becomes available (e.g. , after autopsy), the term 
unexplained death should be replaced by the established cause of death. 
 
13.4.7  Hospitali zation or prolonged hospitali zation  
Any AE that results in hospitali zation or prolonged hospitali zation should be documented and 
reported as an SAE, except as outlined below.  The following hospitalization scenarios are not 
considered to be SAEs:  
• Hospitalization for respite care . 
• Hospitalization for a pre- existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria are 
met: 
− The hospitali zation was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal 
progression of the disease; 
− The patient has not suffered an AE. 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 80 
 • Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer . 
 
13.4.8  Overdoses  
Study drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher  than 
the dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug is not  an AE 
unless it results in untoward medical effects. An overdose is defined by a boundary of 15% 
above the prescribed dose of any medicinal product. 
 
Any study drug overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on  the 
Study Drug Administration eCRF.  All AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect 
administration of study drug should be  recorded on the AE eCRF. If the associated AE fulfills  
serious criteria, the  event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. , no more than 
24 hours after  learning of the event ).  
 
13.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE experienced by a patient between the time of consent  and 28 days after the last 
dose of BGB324 is to be recorded on an SAE Report Form within 24 hours of knowledge by 
the Investigator of its occurrence, regardless of the severity and causality of the event.  Study 
drug-r elated SAEs should continue to be reported indefinitely.   
 The SAE Report Form should be faxed or e -mailed to the Chiltern  Pharmacovigilance Group.  
 
GlobalSAEInbox@Chiltern.com   
Fax: + 888-726-8416  
 A telephone report may only be made in exceptional circumstances and must be followed by completion of the SAE Report Form  within 1 working day.  Where applicable, information from 
relevant hospital case records and post -mortem reports should be obtained.  
 
All SAEs that have not resolved by the EOS , or that have not resolved upon the patient’s 
discontinuation from the study, must be followed until any of the following occur:  
• The event resolves . 
• The event stabili zes. 
• The event returns to baseline status . 
• The event can be attributed to agents other than  study treatment  or to factors unrelated 
to study conduct .  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained .  
 
13.6 Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Expedited safety reporting within this clinical study complies with the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting (E2A) , 
investigational new drug (IND) application safety reporting (under 21CFR312.32), and with 
applicable local regulatory requirements . 
 
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the Regulatory 
Authorities  and Institutional Review Boards (IRB).  Although this responsibility can be 
delegated to the Sponsor’s Clinical Research organization (CRO), the S ponsor retains 
ultimate responsibility for safety reporting.   All SAEs that are unexpected and associated with the use of the investigational product  are 
classified as suspected, unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and will be reported 
to the IRB s, Regulatory Authorities  and to all investigational sites according to local 
requirements.  
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 80 
 Any safety information from other observations that could change the risk -benefit evaluation 
of BGB324 should be promptly communicated to the Regulatory Authorities and IRBs.  
 
Any other SUSARs associated with BGB324  should be reported as soon as the S ponsor 
becomes aware of them , including SUSARs which occur in another clinical study conducted 
by the same S ponsor or which are identified by spontaneous reports, a publication, or which 
are transmitted to the Sponsor by another Regulatory Authority .  
 Other safety issues that also qualify for expedited reporting where they might materially alter 
the current benefit -risk assessment of the BGB324 (sufficient to consider changes in the 
administration or in the overall conduct of the trial), include:  
• An increase in the rate of occurrence of an expected serious adverse reaction, which 
is judged to be clinically important . 
• Post-study SUSARs that occur after the patient has completed a clinical trial and are 
reported by the I nvestigator to the S ponsor . 
• New event s relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of BGB324  likely to 
affect the safety of the patients , such as:  
− An SAE which could be associated with study  procedures and which could modify 
the conduct of the  study ; 
− A major safety finding which differs from the underlying disease. 
 
Expedited reporting is not usually required  for reactions which are serious but expected,  and 
it is inappropriate to report events that are considered unrelated to the investigational product . 
The cause of death of a patient  in a clinical study, unless it is associated with disease 
progression, is considered a SAE whether the event is expected or associated with the  
investigational agent . 
 
13.7 Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
In the event of a pregnanc y occurring in female patients , or in the partners of male patients 
during the study, the pregnancy must be reported to : 
 
the Chiltern Pharmacovigilance Group  (fax + 888-726-8416 or email 
GlobalSAEInbox@Chiltern.com   
 by the investigational staff within 1 working day of their knowledge of the event using a 
Pregnancy Notification Form.  
 
The reporting period for pregnancies will start with the first administration of BGB324 and end 
28 days after the final administration of BGB324.  
 Any female patients who become pregnant whil e taking part in the study will be withdrawn; a 
male patient whose partner  becomes pregnant can remain in the study.  Female partners of 
male patients  will be asked to provide details of the pregnancy  (may be subject to additional 
consent) . 
 A patient  who completes or withdraws from the trial before the full term of the pregnancy will 
be asked to consent to provision of follow- up information about  the pregnancy and its outcome.  
 
13.7.2  Medical e mergency  
In a medical emergency requiring immediate attention, study staff will apply appropriate medical intervention according to standard medical practice.

 13.8 Investigator’s Safety Responsibilities  
The Investigator’s responsibilities include the following:  
• Monitor and record all AEs, including SAEs, regardless of the severity or relationship 
to BGB324. 
• Determine the seriousness, relationship and severity of each event . 
• Determine the onset and resolution of each event. 
• Compl ete an SAE form for each SAE . 
• Pursue SAE follow -up information actively and persistently . 
• Ensure all AE and SAE reports are supported by documentation in the patient medical records . 
• Report SAEs to their local IRB  as required by local law . 
 
13.9 Sponsor’s Safety Responsibilities  
The Sponsor’s responsibilities include the following:  
• Ongoing safety evaluation of BGB324 . 
• Reporting of SUSARs to the Regulatory Authorities , main IRB  and Investigators 
according to required timelines . 
• Submission of  annual updates  to the Regulatory Authorities and main IRB . 
 
 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Detailed statistical analysis information will be provided separately in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  Any deviations to the planned analyses will be justified in writing and presented within 
the final clinical study report (CSR).  The database lock will take place when all data are 
reconciled.  A single CSR will be generated for this study.  All study data will be listed. 
 
14.1 Patient Disposition, Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Patient disposition, including reason for withdrawal  will be summarized by dose group.   
 Demographics and baseline characteristics will be performed on the Safety Analysis 
Population (see Section 14.2.1).  Demographics and disease baseline characteristics,  
pregnancy test results, medical history and prior medications will be tabulated. 
 
14.2 Safety  
 
14.2.1  Safety analysis population  
The Safety Analysis Population will be defined as all patients  who receive at least 1 dose of 
BGB324  or erlotinib .  
  
14.2.2  Methods of analysis  
No formal statistical analysis will be performed on safety data.  AEs will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 15 .0 or above . The number 
and percentage of patients  reporting treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by preferred 
term, system organ class  and dose cohort , and further summarized by both CTCAE grade 
and relationship to study drug.  All AEs commencing prior to dosing with study drug will be 
excluded from the tabulation but will be fully listed.  AEs that have missing onset dates will be 
considered to be treatment -emergent, unless the stop date is known to be prior to the first 
administration of BGB324.  
 
Separate listings  will be produced for DLTs, SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and events 
of ≥Grade 3 severity.   
 
Summary statistics by dose cohort and time point will be produced for v ital signs, 12-lead ECG 
parameters and laboratory safety data , together with changes from baseline.  The incidence 
of laboratory test results showing shifts of more than one CTCAE grade will be sum marized 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 80 
 by dose cohort, time point  and overall . Laboratory test results outside the normal range will be 
individually listed for clinical review, including clinical significance and the baseline value . 
Abnormal ECG results will be summarized by dose cohort.  Changes in continuous parameters  
will be analy zed according to administered dose.  
14.3 Efficacy  
 
14.3.1  Efficacy analysis population  
The Efficacy Analysis Population will include all patient s who receive ≥1 cycle of BGB324 and 
undergo a post -treatment assessment of response. 
 
Patients who on review do not meet the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria or have a major protocol deviation may be excluded from the efficacy analysis.  This will be reviewed on a per 
patient basis at the pre -database lock meeting.  
 
14.3.2  Methods of analysis  
Data relating to efficacy will be summarized descriptively by dose cohort and time point, as 
appropriate.  
 Although all efficacy analysis for this study is to be regarded as essentially exploratory, there 
will be  
a formal hypothesis test for the objective response rate  in Arm B . This will consist of 
one-sided, within -group tests of proportion of responders, against the null hypothesis of a 
response rate ≤5% (this being the observed response rate under current treatment).  Values 
of p <0.2 will be taken as sufficient evidence of a trend to justify further study.   
 
14.4 Phar
macokinetics   
 
14.4.1  Pharmacokinetic analysis population  
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population will include those patients in the Run- in Cohort  and 
Arm B  who receive at least 1 dose of BGB324  and have PK  data available and those patient s 
in Arm A who  receive at least 1 dose of BGB324  and erlotinib and have BGB324 and erlotinib 
PK data available.  
 
14.4.2  Methods of a nalysis  
Full details of analysis of BGB324 PK will be provided in a Pharmacokinetics Analysis Plan.  
BGB324 plasma concentration- time data will be summarized descriptively mean, standard 
deviation and coefficient of variation).  Mean plasma profiles will be illustrated in graphical form.  
An appropriate PK model will be fitted to the individual plasma profiles of BGB324.  
 Pharmacokinetic  parameters of BGB324 that will be estimated are summarized in Table 10. 
These parameters will be estimated at steady state. 
 
Table 10  BGB324 Pharmacokinetic Parameters to be Evaluated  
Cmax The observed maximum plasma concentration after single dose administration  
tmax The time to reach C max  
AUC 0-τ The area under the curve within a dosing interval , calculated by the linear up -log 
down trapezoidal method.  
  
14.5 Pharmacodynamics  
 
14.5.1  Pharmacodynamic analysis population  
The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Population will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose 
of BGB324 and erlotinib and have at least 1 PD biomarker sample collected for analysis . 
 
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 80 
 14.5.2  Methods of analysis  
No formal analysis of PD will be performed . Pharmacodynamic biomarker results will be 
summarized descriptively by dose cohort and timepoint as appropriate.  
 
14.6 Sample Size Considerations  
Arm A will utilize a conventional algorithm (3+3 patients per dose level) to identify the dose of 
BGB324 that can be safely given in combination with erlotinib. Escalation between dose levels 
will occur if 0/3 or 1/6 patients  experiences  a DLT.  Under this design, there is a 71% chance 
of escalation if the true but unknown rate of DLT is 20%  and <50% chance of escalation if the 
true but unknown rate of DLT is >30%.  The operating characteristics of this 3+3 design are 
outlined in Table 11. 
 
Table  11 Operating Characteristics of the 3+3 Study Design  
True but Unknown Rate of DLT (%)  Probability of Escalation (%)  
20 71 
30 49 
40 31 
50 17 
60 8 
 
It is anticipated that a maximum of 3 BGB324 dose levels will be evaluated, with up to 
approximately 18 patients enrolled.  The total sample size in Arm A  will depend upon whether 
a DLT is experienced at a given dose level  (i.e., whether 3 or 6 patients have been treated)  
and how many dose levels are tested to reach the dose  that can be safely administered in 
combination with erlotinib.   
Arm B will follow a Si
 mon-like 2-stage design with relaxed stopping for futility to evaluate the 
PK of BGB324 , safety and tol
erability,, PD  and clinical efficacy of BGB324 in combination with 
erl
otinib in patients  with an activating EGFR mutation(s)  (including exon 19 deletion or exon 
21 [L858R] substitution or other
 rearrangement of the EGFR gene mutations) who have 
progressed after receiving a prior EGFR inhibitor ( i.e., erlotinib, afatinib, or gefitinib) . The null 
hypothesis (H0) that the true response rate is 0.05 will be tested against a 1-sided alternative  
in the first stage, 9 patients accrued.  If the number of patients with response ( complete 
response or partial response) after 2 cycles or stable disease after 4 cycles is equal to zero  in 
these 9 patients, the study will be stopped.  Otherwise, 16 additional patients will be accrued 
for a total of 25.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if 4 or more responses are observed in 
25 patients.  Assuming that the stable disease rate has a uniform distribution under H 0, this 
design yields a type I error rate of at most 0.73 and power of at least 0.0367  when the true 
response rate is 0.2.  
 
Arm C will evaluate the safety, PD and clinical ef ficacy  (time to progression) of BGB324 when 
administered in combination with erlotinib in patients with activating EGFR mutation(s) (including exon 19 deletion or exon 21 [ L858R ] substitution or other
 rearrangement of the 
EGFR gene mutations) who have received ≥12 weeks  of erlotinib  without disease progression. 
Up to  5 patients  will be enrolled . Arm C will recruit up to a maximum of 14 patients. Recruitment into 
Arm C may be stopped if Arm B completes recruitment or is stopped before the 14 patient target is 
reached. Patients already enrolled into Arm C will be allowed to continue in the study in accordance 
with the protocol . A statistical analysis is not planned and it is anticipated that an assessment 
of general activity will be derived from the  enrolled patients; further assessment will require 
protocol amendment.   
 
14.7 Clinical Study Report  
The results of the study will be presented in an integrated CSR  in accordance with  ICH 
guidelines.

Helsinki, ICH Guidelines, GCP and all applicable local regulatory requirements.  
 
15.2 Institutional Review Board 
The final study protocol and informed consent form ( ICF) must be approved, in writing, by the 
relevant IRB before patient  enrol lment commences.  
 The following information should be reported to the IRB  (in accordance with local 
requirements ) during the study:  
• All amendments to the clinical research study . 
• Annual progress reports . 
• Individual SUSARs . 
• Urgent safety measures .  
 
15.3 Patient Information and Consent

written informed consent must be obtained from the patient, in accordance with local regulations . 
 The ICF must be in accordance with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
must be approved by the prevailing IRB for each study center.  
 
15.4 Subject Data Protection 
Personally identifiable information, i.e. , identifiable information from or about an individual 
subject, will not be collected by the S ponsor.  The collection and processing of data from 
patients  enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to investigate the 
clinical activity , safety, tolerability, quality and utility of the study drug used in this study.  These 
data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations.   
 The ICF must explain that identifying information will be kept by the Investigator on file and that portions of the patient ’s medical records pertinent to the study will be reviewed by Sponsor 
personnel (or their designees) and possibly by Regulatory Agencies and the IRB for data 
verification purposes.   
 
 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
In compliance with GCP and regulatory requirements, the Sponsor/designee, external 
Regulatory Agency and/or /IRB may conduct quality assurance (QA) audits at any time during 
or following completion of the study.  The Investigator will be expected to cooperate with any 
audit and to provide assistance and documentation (including source data) as requested.  
 
16.2 Case Report Form and Source Document Verification  
Electronic CRFs will be provided for recording clinical data.  Designated site personnel will 
record data in the eCRF for observations, tests and assessments as specified in the protocol.  
The Sponsor will provide eCRF completion guidelines to assist site personnel.  
  Data required for the eCRF should be completed in a timely manner so as to aide Sponsor 
and CRO management.   
 
BGBC004 V5 16 May 2017                             CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 80 
  
The Investigator  must permit the Sponsor/designee reasonable direct access to designated 
source documentation (e.g. , medical records) for the purpose of verifying that the data 
recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the original source data.   
 
16.3 Study Monitoring

Investigator  and study team . The Sponsor/designee will conduct regular site visits, according 
to applicable ICH and GCP guidelines, to:  
• Confirm the facilities remain acceptable. 
• Confirm the site study team  is adhering to the protocol and regulatory requirements . 
• Confirm that the investigational product is being properly maintained and accountability 
records are accurate and current . 
• Confirm data are being accurately recorded in the eCRF by performing source document verification. 
• To intervene and stop any serious protocol non- compliance by a site and if requir ed 
report to IRB and the Regulatory Authority . 
 
16.
4 Retention of Study Data 
A copy of all records and essential documents must be retained in the study files for a minimum of 2 years following the last approval of the drug in an ICH region and until there are 
no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or a minimum of 2 years 
have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the drug.  No 
documents should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the S ponsor and the 
Investigator  and/or clinical site.  
 Should the Investigator  wish to assign the documents to another party or move them to

 Appendix 2  The NYHA Functional Classification in a Subject  with Heart Disease  
Overview: The NYHA developed a functional classification for subjects  with heart disease.  
Subjects : Heart disease must be present.  
Parameters:  
• Limitations on physical activity  
Symptoms (undue fatigue palpitations dyspnea and/or anginal pain) with ordinary physical 
activity  
• Status at rest  
 
Functional Capacity  Objective Assessment  
Class I.  Patients with cardiac disease but without 
resulting limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary physical 
activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, 
dyspnea, or anginal pain.  A. No objective evidence of 
cardiovascular disease.  
Class II.  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight 
limitation of physical activity.  They are comfortable at 
rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
 B. Objective evidence of 
minimal cardiovascular 
disease.  
Class III.  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
marked limitation of physical activity.  They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes 
fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  C. Objective evidence of 
moderately severe cardiovascular disease.  
Class IV.  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal 
syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any physical 
activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.
 D. Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular disease.

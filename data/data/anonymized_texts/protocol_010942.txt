Title:  Use of a Proliferation Saturation Index to Determine Personalized  
Radiotherapy Fractionation for Patients  with  HPV+  Oropharyngeal 
Cancers.  
 
 
Précis:   We will use a mathematical model for each HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer 
patient’s tumor growth characteristics to select radiotherapy fractionation. We 
believe it will most likely  to result  in a rapid response by  week 4  of treatment.  
 
Objectives:  
Primary  Objective:  
We hypothesize that by using  individual  patient  proliferation  saturation index  (PSI)  
to select radiotherapy fractionation (conventional fractionation or  
hyperfractionation) to improve the likelihood of a rapid response (defined as ≥  
32% reduction in volume  at 4 weeks).  
 
Secondary  Objectives:  
• Rate of complete response by CT at 2 months  or PET/CT  at 3 months  following  
completion of therapy.  
• Correlate  response and outcome  to pre-treatment  and during  treatment  radiomics  
features  on PET/CT/MRI. 
• Correlate response  and outcome  to mathematical  models  of tumor  growth and 
death dynamics  pre-treatment  and during treatment.  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Identify potential biomarkers of response to adaptive radiation therapy based on 
evaluation of tumor  immune  microenvironment  and detection of HPV DNA  in oral 
gargles  and plasma.  
 
Endpoint  
Primary  Endpoint:  For patients  with HPV+  squamous  cancer  of the oropharynx,  fractionation  
of radiation will be individualized based on their PSI. Response will be measured after 4 
weeks of RT as assessed by CT or MRI, as described in section 10.0. Primary objective is to  
increase the rate of response of ≥ 32% at 4 weeks to 63% of patients, above the expected 49%.  
 
Population:  Total  sample  size of 60 patients,  which  will include men and 
women ≥ 18 years with pathologically (histologically or  
cytologically) proven diagnosis of HPV+ squamous cell  
carcinoma of the oropharynx and no evidence of distant  
metastases.  This is a single  center  study

With increasing understanding of the complexity of tumor heterogeneity, it would be reasonable to 
hypothesize that cancer therapy should be tailored to individual patients, which is the central  
principle underlying precision medicine. Currently in radiation medicine, decisions for total dose 
and fractionation  are based empirically  on clinical data,  albeit often  from randomized trials.  
Current efforts in radiation oncology to personalize radiation therapy mainly address adapting the target volume based on response.  However, there have been no trials attempting to individualize 
total dose and fractionation.  Here we provide one of the first clinical studies to deliver  
personalized radiation fractionation  dose therapy  for cancer.  
 
 
Tumors are composites of proliferating and growth arrested cells. Overall radiation response  
depends on their respective proportions at irradiation. In multi -compartment mathematical models  
that distinguish between proliferating and growth -arrested cells, we have shown that proliferation  
and oxygenation status -dependent radiation response can be simulated on the cellular level1. 
Tumor growth in vivo can be approximated by logistic dynamics. Initial exponential growth at low  
cell densities  when most  cells have access to ample  resources  decelerates  when cells at the core 
of the tumor become growth- arrested, mainly due to limited space and exhausted intratumoral  
nutrient supply as resources are consumed by cells closer to the tumor surface. This established  
the notion of a tumor carrying capacity (K) as the maximum tumor volume that can be supported  
by a given env ironment2. The tumor carrying capacity is patient -specific, depending on the  
established oxygen and nutrients supply through tissue vascularization, removal of metabolic  
waste  products,  and evasion of immune  surveillance.  Hence,  the tumor  volume -to-carrying 
capacity ratio (V/K) describes the saturation in overall tumor cell proliferation as the tumor  
approaches its carrying capacity, which we call a Proliferation Saturation Index (PSI).   Logistic  
growth is modeled as  (eqn.  1), where  V is the tumor  volume at time t, dV/dt  is 
the change  of tumor  volume over time TPOT  is the intrinsic  potential  doubling time.

Radiation response  is modeled as instantaneous  volume changes   
(eqn.  2)

at irradiation moments, where  represents radiation- induced death after dose d  
following the linear -quadratic model. It follows from (eqns. 1+2) that larger PSI reflect a low  
proliferating cell fraction and, thus, treatment refractory tumors, whereas tumors with low PSI are  
more  proliferative  and radiosensitive.  As such, two patients  that present  with similar  tumor  volume  
could have a different tumor growth history and thus a different PSI, which results in different  
responses  to the same radiotherapy  protocol (Fig. 1A). In a preliminary  study  of non-small  cell lung 
cancer and head and neck cancer patients we have confirmed that PSI varies greatly between  
patients (0.26±0.33; [0.03- 0.75]) and correlates inversely with radiotherapy response2. A patient - 
specific  pretreatment  PSI was  sufficient  to fit individual  patient  response data (r2=0.98;  Fig. 1B).  
 
 
 
Radiotherapy as definitive treatment for oropharyngeal cancer is a standard of care3. Based on  
multiple clinical trials, standard doses are in the range of 60 – 70 Gy at 2 Gy given once daily or  
60 – 81.6 Gy given twice daily4,5. However, to date the selection of fractionation has been empiric  
in nature. We hypothesize that head and neck cancer represents an ideal opportunity to establish 
a paradigm  of individualized radiotherapy  dosing  based on mathematical  models.  
 
We are specifically selecting HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer patients because at an early stage (AJCC 8
th edition stage T1- 2 N0 -1 with limit ed lymph node involvement), radiotherapy alone is a  
standard of care, reducing the variables in question.  For example, RTOG H0022 treated patients  
with up to radiographic T1- 2 N0 -1 (AJCC 7th edition T1- 2 N0 -2a) oropharyngeal tumors with  
radiotherapy alone,  with locoregional control rates of >90%6. Additionally, multiple retrospective 
reports from large institutions such as MD Anderson and Princess Margaret demonstrate >90%  
locoregional control  rates  for oropharyngeal  cancer  patients  with T1-2 N0-2b (AJCC 7th edition).7,8 
 
However, RTOG 1016, which treated patients with locoregionally advanced HPV+ oropharyngeal  
cancer with 70 Gy of radiotherapy and either cisplatin or cetuximab was recently published.  This 
demonstrated  the superiority  of cisplatin  over cetuximab in combination  with radiotherapy.9 RTOG 
1016  included  overlapping patient  population  that is eligible  for the current  trial, specifically  patients  
with a single  lymph  node > 3 cm or multiple  lymph  nodes  in ipisilateral neck.  Examination of Forrest

3 plots from the trial suggests that patients with a > 10 pack year history of cigarette smoking were 
at higher risk and had a greater benefit from cisplatin.  We therefore will exclude patients who are  
locoregionally advanced with a significant  smoking history.  
 
Additionally,  recent  review  of Moffitt Cancer  Center  internal  data suggests  that patients  with greater  
than 5 positive lymph nodes are at a higher risk of regional failure, with locoregional control at 3 
years of 94.9% for 1 -5 lymph nodes vs 80.1% for > 5 lymph nodes (p = 0.001). By restricting 
patients to T1 -2 N0 -1 with 5 or less lymph nodes and a smoking history of 10 pack years or less,  
3-year locoregional control of patients treated with radiation alone at Moffitt Cancer Center was 
94.7% (n=81) compared to 95.9% with concurrent radiotherapy and systemic therapy (n=98)  
(personal  communication J. Caudell).  
 
In a retrospective analysis of 44 patients, decrease in nodal size of ≥ 40% was associated with a  
locoregional control (LRC) of 100% at 2 years, compared with 78% for a decrease of < 40%10. 
Retrospective review  of a Moffitt cohort  (n=49)  suggests  that a cut point  of 32% reduction resulted  
in 100%  LRC and DFS (Figure 2A&B)11. Of note,  half of these  patients  were  treated with radiation  
alone.

4 In the mathematical modeling of radiation treatment response, there is a suggestion of a more  
robust  treatment  response by hyperfractionation  when the PSI is > 0.75 (Figure 3). 
 
 
Figure  3: Model  of tumor  response at 4 weeks by  initial  pretreatment  PSI. 
 
We therefore hypothesize that by personalizing the fractionation, we will increase the number of  
patients achieving a 32%  reduction  by week  4. 
 
 
All fractionation schemes are selected are standards of care in H&N cancer. For example, RTOG  
7913 established that the locoregional control  rates  between these two total dose  and fractionation  
schemes  were  equivalent12. 
 
 
2.5.1 EVALUATION  OF TUMOR  IMMUNE  MICROENVIRONMENT  (TIM)  
 
The interplay between the tumor and its TIM is critical in tumor formation, metastasis, and clinical  
outcomes including radiation therapy response13,14. Characterization of lymphoid and myeloid 
immune  cells has shown to be prognostic  in HNSCC15, but their association with radiation  therapy  
benefits  has not been clearly  evaluated.  Significance of the TIM in context  of the PSI in HNSCC is 
entirely unknown. The findings from this innovative and highly interdisciplinary project will have a 
significant  clinical impact  in improving  the selection  of patients  who will gain the most  benefit  from 
receiving PSI based radiation therapy, offering further biological insight to the mechanisms of  
resistance,  and subsequently  developing optimal  combination therapies  for immune  modulating 
agents.

2.5.2 EVALUATION  OF HPV  DNA  VIRAL  LOAD IN  ORAL  GARGLES  AND  PLASMA  
 
Detection of HPV DNA in oral gargles and plasma after the completion of treatments has shown to 
associate with recurrence16,17. In a study by Ahn, et al, HPV -16 E6 and E7 DNA were determined 
from plasma and/or saliva samples obtained before and after treatments in 93 patients16. Patients  
with detectable HPV DNA in the posttreatment saliva and either saliva or plasma had reduced 
overall survival. However, significance  of persistent HPV DNA detection in saliva and/or plasma in 
context of the PSI in HNSCC is entirely unknown. Evaluation of HPV DNA as a predictive 
biomarker  of PSI-based  radiation therapy  warrants further  studies.  
 
 
 
As all interventions  are considered standards  of care,  no additional potential  risks would  be 
incurred.  
 
 
By selecting the most ideal fractionation scheme, we may be able to improve the 4 week response 
rate which  has been  associated with  improved locoregional control.  
 
 
 
For patients with HPV+ squamous cancer of the oropharynx, fractionation of radiation will be individualized based on their PSI. Response will be measured after 20 days of RT as  
assessed by CT or MRI, as described in section 10.0. Primary objective is to increase the rate of response  of ≥ 32% at 20 days  to 63% of patients,  above  the expected 49%
11.

• PSI will be calculated according the above formula, where Vdiagnosis is the volume of the 
tumor at first imaging and Vtreatment  is the volume of the tumor at second pretreatment  
imaging, t is time, and λ is doubling time.  Patients with a PSI ≤ 0.75 will be assigned to  
conventional fractionation group, and PSI > 0.75 will be assigned to the hyperfractionation group (Figure 3).  
• Each  site of disease (primary  and each  lymph  node) will be independently  contoured and PSI 
calculated for each.  PSI of the lymph nodes will take priority over primary site.  PSI of the  
largest  lymph  node  will take priority over  smaller  lymph  nodes.  
• Based on PSI, patients  will be assigned to one of two cohorts:  
• PSI ≤ 0.75:  Conventional fractionation  – 2 Gy once  daily,  Monday  through Friday.  
• **Should patients  be assigned to conventional  fractionation,  and do not meet  the predicted  
>32% reduction AND they are not receiving concurrent chemotherapy, their treatment will be accelerated via a 6th fraction per week, given as a BID dose once during the week or on a Saturday
18. 
• PSI > 0.75: Hyperfractionation – 1.2 Gy twice daily, at least 6 hours apart, Monday through 
Friday.  
 
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be evaluated for on -treatment response after 4 
weeks, and re -evaluated at 2 or 3 months post RT (the selection of post -RT timepoint for imaging 
is at physician discretion (either is standard of care; eg if CT is negative a 2 months, no further  
imaging is required.  If disease still present at 2 month CT, a 3 month PET will be obtained, or  
simply a 3  month  PET).  
 
4.2.1 On Treatment  response at 4 weeks  during RT 
 
Week 4 CT and/or MRI will be loaded into the treatment planning system or other software for  
volumetric evaluation of tumor size.  This will be compared against CT simulation or week 1 
CT/CBCT  and/or  MRI,  whichever  is larger.  The percent  response  will be calculated.  
 
4.2.2 Post Treatment  response at 2-3 months  after RT 
 
A complete response will be defined as resolution of all disease in the head and neck by CT at 2 months or PET/CT at 3 months.  On CT scan, nodes less than 1 cm in short axis without  
evidence of necrosis will be defined as negative.  On PET/CT, resolution of hypermetabolism  
to maximum SUV of 3 or less will be defined as negative, even with evidence of a node larger  
than 1 cm in short axis on CT scan.  CT scans or PET scans which do not meet these criteria 
will be reviewed  at the Moffitt H&N tumor  board  for determination  of response.

The treatment plan used for each patient will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose,  
including dose- volume histogram  analyses  of the planning target  volume  (PTV)  and critical normal  
structures.  
 
Gross tumor volume (GTV) represents the region judged to contain gross primary tumor or  
involved node(s)  based on clinical and endoscopic  examinations,  CT scan,  MRI,  and PET-CT. 
 
Clinical target volumes (CTV) are defined and contoured in relation to the targets that they are 
intended to encompass and the dose they are intended to receive. For gross targets (GTVs), the  
CTVs are defined by 3D isotropic expansions of 0.5 cm that should then be limited by potential  
barriers  to tumor  spread such as air cavities, external  contours,  and bony  or fascial  planes  through  
which  tumor  spread  is not possible or apparent.  
 
Elective clinical target volume consists of elective nodal basins at risk depending on size and 
location of the primary site and grossly involved nodes. In general this consists of levels 2 -4 and  
potentially retrostyloid and retropharyngeal ipsilaterally, and level s 2-3 contralaterally. If tonsil  
primary without involvement (or <1 cm involvement) of base of tongue or soft palate, unilateral  
elective  neck  radiotherapy  may be delivered.  This will be at the discretion  of the treating radiation 
oncologist.  6.1 DOSING  AND  ADMINISTRATION

PTV repres ents an additional  margin around  the GTV to compensate  for the variability  of treatment  
set up and internal organ motion. The CTVs will be expanded symmetrically 2.5 to 3 mm to 
generate  the PTV.  
 
Detailed  Organs at Risk  Specifications  
 
SpinalCord:  The cord begins  at the foramen magnum.  Superior  to this is brainstem  and inferior  to 
this is cord. The inferior border of the spinal cord volume will be defined at approximately the 
carina (ie, 2-3 cm below  the lowest  slice level that has PTV on it). The spinal  cord shall be defined 
based on the treatment  planning CT scan.  
 
SpinalCord_PRV05:  Planning Risk Volume (PRV)  spinal  cord defined as SpinalCord + 5 mm in all 
directions.  
 
BrainStem: The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial -cervical junction where it  
meets  the spinal  cord.  For the purposes  of this study,  the superior  most  portion of the brainstem  is 
approximately  at the level of the top of the posterior  clinoid.  The brainstem  shall be defined based 
on the treatment  planning CT scan. 
 
BrainStem_PRV03:  Planning Risk Volume  (PRV)  brainstem  defined as Brainstem  + 3 mm in all 
directions.  
 
Parotid_R/L:  Parotid  glands  will be defined in their entirety  (superficial  and deep lobes)  based on 
the treatment  planning CT scan. 
 
Pharynx:  This will be defined as superior/middle/inferior  constrictor muscles.  This extends  from the 
superior constrictor region (level of the inferior pterygoid plates) to the cricopharyngeal inlet (level  
of the posterior  cricoid  cartilage).  
 
Esophagus_UP:  This will be defined as the cervical or superior  (S) esophagus,  a tubular  structure  
that starts  at the bottom  of pharynx  (cricopharyngeal inlet)  and extends  to the thoracic  inlet. 
 
Larynx:  This will be defined as the glottic  and supraglottic  larynx, including the tip of the epiglottis,  
the epiglottis,  the aryepiglottic  folds,  arytenoids,  false  cords, and true cords,  up to but not including 
the medial  border  of the thyroid cartilage,  and including the cricoid  cartilage to the inferior  edge of 
the arytenoid cartilage,  but not the hypopharynx.  
 
OralCavity:  The oral cavity will be defined  as a composite  structure  consisting of the lips, oral 
tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and superiorly the palate, and inferiorly to the plane 
containing the tip of the mandible.  
 
Submandibula_R/L:  Submandibular  glands  will be defined in their entirety  based on treatment  
planning CT scan.  
 
Mandible:  This includes  the entire bony  structure  of the mandible from TMJ through the symphysis. 
Thyroid:  Thyroid gland should be contoured  in its entirety  based on treatment  planning CT scan. 
The density -corrected dose  distributions  shall be calculated,  and the dose prescription  will be 
based on a dose  distribution corrected  for heterogeneities.

Dosimetry : Intensity -modulated RT, volumetric  modulated arc therapy,  or tomotherapy  planning is 
acceptable.  Typically, ≥ 7 beams  or ≥ 2 arcs of radiation will be used.  
 
Prescription  Isodose  Surface Coverage : The prescription isodose  surface  will be chosen such that 
≥ 95% of the PTV is conformally  covered by the dose  and 100%  of the PTV would  be covered  with 
the isodose surface that is represented by 95% of the prescription dose. 100% of the GTV should 
be covered by 100%  of the prescription dose.  
 
High Dose Spillage: Any dose ≥ 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily within the 
PTV itself and not within  the normal  tissues  outside  the PTV.  Therefore,  the cumulative  volume  of 
all tissue outside the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of the prescription dose should be no more than 0.03 cc of the PTV volume.  
 
Prioritization  for Intensity -Modulated  RT Planning:  
1. Spinal  cord 
2. Brainstem  
3. Gross  target  PTV 
4. Elective  PTV 
5. Organs  at Risk 
a. Parotid gland  contralateral  to primary  tumor  site 
b. Larynx  
c. Pharynx  
d. Contralateral  submandibular  gland  
e. Oral Cavity/Lips  
g. Esophagus  
h. Parotid gland  ipsilateral  to primary  tumor  site 
i. Mandible 
6. Unspecified tissue outside  the targets  
 
 
Dose  limitations  to normal  structures  are described  below.  For the critical structures  of spinal  cord 
and brainstem, these are mandatory. For other structures, recommended limits are provided, but  
the doses delivered should always be as low as reasonably achievable without compromising 
doses  to PTVs.  
 
• Spinal cord: The planning risk volume (PRV) (Spinal cord + 0.5 cm) for spinal cord should 
not exceed 48 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cm3 (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 
mm).  
• Brain stem: The PRV for (brainstem + 0.3 cm) brainstem should not exceed 50 Gy to any  
volume in excess of 0.03 cm3 (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). In treatment  
planning, the brain stem_03 should be given less priority than the spinal cord, but more 
than the critical str uctures  listed below.  
• Oral cavity/Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be <32 
Gy for the oral cavity. Efforts should also be made to avoid hot spots (> 60 Gy) within the  
non-involved oral cavity. 
• Parotid glands: The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid gland to  
receive a mean dose of < 26 Gy, but efforts should be made to reduce this further if  
possible without  compromising dose  to PTVs.  
6.3 DOSES  TO NORMAL  STRUCTURE

Protocol  MCC# 19579          09 Jul 2021  
 
12  
 
• Contralateral submandibular gland: If contralateral level Ib is not a target, aim to reduce 
mean  contralateral submandibular  gland to  < 39 Gy. 
• Pharynx: Reduce the dose  as much  as possible.  Mean pharynx  dose  recommended  to be 
<50 Gy. 
• Esophagus: Reduce the dose as much as possible; recommended (not mandatory)  
treatment  goal:  mean dose <  30 Gy. 
• Larynx: Reduce  the dose  as much as possible. The larynx  mean  dose is recommended to 
be ≤ 35 Gy if whole -neck  intensity -modulated  RT is used.  
• Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible. Hot spots within the mandible should 
be avoided. It is recommended that maximum dose within the mandible be < 105% of  
prescription  dose.  
• Unspecified  tissue outside the targets (Non -PTV): No more  than 1 cm3 of unspecified tissue 
outside the targets  can receive ≥ 105%  of the prescription dose.  
 
 
 
Treatment  breaks  must  be clearly  indicated  in the treatment  record  along with the reason(s)  for the 
treatment break(s). Treatment breaks, if necessary, should not exceed 3 treatment days at a time 
and 5 treatment  days  total.  Treatment  breaks  should be allowed  only for resolution of severe acute  
toxicity  and/or  for intercurrent  illness  and not for social or logistical reasons.  Any treatment  break(s)  
exceeding 2 treatment days for reasons other than toxicity/illness will be considered a protocol  
deviation.  
 
 
Photon beams  of ≥ 6MV are required with treatment  distance ≥ 80 cm source to axis distance  for 
isocentric  techniques.  
 
Immobilization : Treatment  should include use of a thermoplastic  head and shoulder  mask. 
 
Planning CT scan: CT scan  thickness  should be ≤ 0.3 cm. If possible,  planning CT scan should 
be done with contrast.  MRI and/or  PET/CT  should  be fused to the planning CT scan.  
 
Localization : Isocenter or reference point port localization images or volumetric imaging study on 
the linear accelerator couch should be obtained at each treatment on the treatment unit  
immediately  before  treatment to ensure proper  alignment  of the geometric  center  (i.e., isocenter)  of 
the simulated fields. 
 
 
There will be no concurrent chemotherapy.  Other drug therapy (e.g. lidocaine rinses, skin  
creams,  narcotics)  as clinically  indicated for the management  of radiotherapy  side effects  as per 
standard  of care.

PSI will be calculated according the above formula,  where  Vdiagnosis  is the volume  of the tumor  
at first imaging  and Vtreatment  is the volume  of the tumor  at second pretreatment  imaging,  t is 
time, and λ is doubling time.  Each site of disease will be contoured individually, and PSI  
calculated.  PSI of lymph nodes will have priority over primary site.  PSI of the largest lymph  
node will have priority  over smaller  lymph  nodes.  Patients  with a PSI ≤ 0.75 will be assigned to 
conventional fractionation group,  and PSI > 0.75 will be assigned  to the hyperfractionation group  
(Figure 3). 
 
• Medical  history  within  90 days  of start of treatment,  including history,  focused physical  
exam  of the head  and neck, assessment  of performance  status, and  weight.  
 
• Imaging will consist of pre- treatment CT and/or MRI, with at least 2 exams one week  
apart.  Pre-treatment PET/CT while ideal, is not required.  On first day of RT (or within 
5 days of starting RT), CT simulation will be repeated. During week 4 of radiotherapy  
(~fraction 20 for conventionally fractionated patients or ~fraction 40 for  
hyperfractionation patients, CT simulation and MRI will be repeated. At ~8 weeks after  
treatment  is complete CT of neck  or ~12 weeks  PET/CT  will be performed  for response  
assessment. 
 
 
 
The following samples will be sent to the Moffitt Cancer Center Tissue Core for processing and 
storage for the following analyses in the Chung Laboratory. Detailed sample collection and 
processing are described in Lab  Manual.  
 
7.2.1 EVALUATION  OF TUMOR  IMMUNE  MICROENVIRONMENT  (TIM)  
 
An innovative methodology, multiplex immunohistochemical (mIHC) staining, developed in the  
Chung Laboratory allows the analysis of an array of markers from limited sample specimens. The  
evaluation of a complex cellular microenvironment is best acco mplished using high mIHC, which  
enables simultaneous detection and measurement of multiple protein antigens on the same tissue section allowing accurate classification of cells as well as enumeration and quantification of protein 
signal. This is accomplished by using sequential steps of antigen retrieval followed by primary  
antibody application, and then antibody stripping. The process is repeated using different primary  
antibodies  for each antibody  target.  The result  is that up to 18 protein  targets  can be visualized  along 
with the nuclear  stain.  This complex  staining can then be analyzed by imaging  systems such as the 
the Aperio FL scanning system. Image analysis software such as Cell Profiler can then be applied  
to enumerate cells and quantify signal. Complex analysis can determine cellular densities and also  
measure co -localized targets. The multiplexing will encompass evaluation of antigen presenting  
cells, T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and tumor cells using 30 immune cell markers and EGFR.  
The goal is to link a comprehensive clinical characterization and immune microenvironment  
assessment and to correlate these  with radiation treatment  response  and survival.

Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention  in humans,  whether  or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 312.32  (a)). 
 
 
Adverse events and suspected adverse reactions are considered "serious" if, in the view of  
either the investigator or sponsor, they result in any of the following outcomes: death, a life- 
threatening adverse event,  inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions , or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life- threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based  
upon appropriate  medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize the patient  or subje ct and may require 
medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  Examples  
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  
emergency room  or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient  
hospitalization,  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
 
OHRP  considers  unanticipated problems  (UPs)  involving  risks to participants  or others  to 
include, in general,  any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following 
criteria: 
 
• Unexpected in terms  of nature,  severity, or frequency  given (a) the research procedures  
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB- approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population  being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means  
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused  by the procedures  involved in  the research);  and 
 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm  
(including physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  
known or recognized.  
 
This study  will use the OHRP  definition of UP.

All AEs will be graded using the CTCAE  5 criteria.  For AEs not included  in the protocol -defined 
grading system, the following  guidelines  will be used to describe severity. 
 
• Mild – Events  require  minimal  or no treatment  and do not interfere  with the participant’s  
daily activities. 
• Moderate  – Events  result  in a low level of inconvenience or concern  with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life- 
threatening or incapacitating.]>  
 
 
 
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to the study agent (drug, biologic, device) is 
part of the documentation process,  but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported  
in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether  a clinical observation is an AE, the event  should 
be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must  always be suspect.  To help assess,  the following  guidelines are used. 
 
• Attribution of the AE: 
- Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely  related to the study  treatment.  
- Possible  – The AE may be related to the study  treatment.  
- Un likely  – The AE is doubtfully  related to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.  
 
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study  
visits  and interviews  with study  participants  presenting for medical  care,  or upon review  by a 
study monitor. All AEs, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for  
SAEs, will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s  assessment of severity, relationship to study product  
(assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of  
resolution/stabilization of event. All AEs occurring during the study must be documented 
appropriately,  regardless  of relationship.  All AEs will be followed  to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as  baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s  
condition deteriorates  at any time during the study,  it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be 
recorded in the data collection  system throughout  the study.  
 
Changes  in the severity of AEs will be documented  to allow an assessment  of the duration of the 
event  at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset  and duration of each episode.

22 The PI will record all reportable  events  with start dates  occurring  any time after informed  consent is  
obtained until 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of  study participation. At  
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of  AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or  stabilization  are achieved.  
 
All Grade 3 or greater AEs will be monitored until resolution or, if the AE is determined to be 
chronic, a cause is identified. If an AE is considered potentially related to study treatment and 
remains ongoing at the conclusion of the study, the event will  be followed until resolution,  
stabilization,  or initiation  of treatment  that confounds  the ability  to assess the event.  RT-related AEs 
and SAEs  will be collected at follow- up contact  90 days  from the end of treatment  provided  no new 
treatments  have  been initiated  that could confound the ability  to assess the event.  
 
 
 
All Grade  3 or greater  Adverse Events  possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related to radiotherapy  up to 
the primary  outcome  time point  (4 weeks)  MUST  be reported in routine study  data submissions. 
Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt Cancer Center's clinical trials database. Regulatory  
documents  and case report  forms  will be monitored internally  according to Moffitt  Cancer  Center  
Monitoring  Policies.  
 
 
Any clinical adverse event or abnormal laboratory test value that meets the definition of serious  
noted below and occurs in a patient during the course of the study, irrespective of the treatment  
received by the patient,  must  be reported  within  24 hours  of the investigator  becoming aware  of the 
occurrence.  Serious  adverse event  definition and reporting requirements  will be in accordance with 
the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Managements.  
 
Definitions  and Standards  for Expedited  Reporting,  Topic E2A:  
An SAE is defined as any untoward  medical  occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results  in death  
2. Is immediately life -threatening (i.e., in the opinion of the investigator, the AE places the  
patient  at immediate  risk of death;  it does  not include  a reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more  
severe form,  might  have  caused death)  
3. Requires  inpatient  hospitalization or results  in prolongation of an existing  hospitalization 
4. Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
5. Is a congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
6. Is an important  medical  event  that may not be immediately  life-threatening,  result  in death,  
or require hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical  judgment,  it jeopardizes  the patient  or may require medical  or surgical  intervention to 
prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  abov e. 
 
Any SAE, whether or not considered to be related to study treatment, will be reported within 24 
hours  of the investigator  becoming aware  of the event.  It will be recorded on both the SAE form and 
the CRF AE page.  Additional  SAE information including medications  or other  therapeutic  measures  8.4 REPORTING  PROCEDURES

23 used to treat the event,  action  taken  with the study  drug due to the event,  and the outcome  / 
resolution of the event  will be recorded  on the SAE form.  Forms  for reporting SAEs  will be provided 
to the study  sites.  
 
Conversely, some hospitalizations, particularly those that are the result of elective or previously  
scheduled surgery  for preexisting conditions,  which  have not worsened  after initiation  of treatment,  
will not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a drainage of obstructed bile duct  
would not be classified as an SAE. Pre -specified study hospitalizations for observation are not  
considered SAEs. All overdoses, whether or not resulting in an AE, require reporting within 24  
hours. 
 
All Grade 3 and greater AEs and SAEs that occur after the first treatment with RT and through 4 
weeks of treatment will require reporting by the investigational site. SAEs that meet the criteria for  
expedited reporting to the FDA will be reported in accordance  with US regulations  governing safety  
reporting (Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 312.32 and 312.33). Reporting of  
SAEs by the investigator to his or her Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be done in accordance 
with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be 
maintained showing  that the IRB was properly  notified.  
 
In case of an SAE,  the investigator  will electronically  report  to the University  of South Florida 
Institutional  Review Board via website  http://www.research.usf.edu/cs/.  
 
 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of  
an UP report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study  sponsor.  The UP report will include the following  information:  
 
• Protocol  identifying  information:  protocol  title and number,  PI’s name,  and the IRB 
project  number;  
• A detailed description of the event,  incident,  experience,  or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis  for determining that the event,  incident,  experience,  or 
outcome  represents  an UP; 
• A des
cription  of any changes  to the protocol  or other  corrective actions  that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement  for prompt  reporting,  UPs will be reported using  the following  timeline: 
 
• UPs that are SAEs  will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study  sponsor  within  
1 day of  the investigator  becoming aware  of the event.  
• Any other  UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study  sponsor  within  7 days  of 
the investigator  becoming  aware of  the problem.

24 upon review of any agenda item, may  approve the study for continuation, require revisions, or  
suspend or close a protocol.  This study  will be reviewed by the  PMC  for data and safety  
monitoring. The principal investigator will enter into Oncore all adverse events and deviations  
as they  occur for review by  the PMC.  
 
The Principal Investigator is ultimately responsible for every aspect of the design, conduct, and 
actions  of all members of  the research  team.  This includes final  analysis of  the protocol.  
 
 
This study will be monitored internally by Moffitt Cancer Center using the OnCore reporting system.  
Data will be captured in OnCore, Moffitt’s electronic Clinical Trials Database. For each participant  
enrolled, the electronic CRF must be completed by the assigned data manager or other authorized study staff. Any paper forms should be typed or filled out indelible ink and must be legible. Errors  
should be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed and dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate. This also applies to records for those patients who 
fail to complete the study. If a patient stops dosing or terminates from the study, the dates and reasons must be noted on the CRF. If a patient terminates from the study because of a DLT,  
thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. The Case Report Forms will be reviewed by Moffitt’s Internal Monitors periodically throughout the conduct of the trial. The monitoring 
will include source data verification, utilizing research patients’ medical records. The investigator  
should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to the 
protocol  monitoring committee.  
Each Scientific Review Committee conducts a formal internal peer review of all clinical protocols and general scientific oversight of interventional clinical research. Protocols are reviewed for scientific  
merit, adequate study design, safety, availability of targeted study population, and feasibility of t imely  
completion of all proposed research  projects to be conducted by its  assigned programs  at the 
Cancer Center. Each SRC is responsible for evaluating the risk/benefit assessment and corresponding  data and safety  monitoring plan as part of  the scientific  review  and approval  process.  
 
No modifications will be made to the protocol without the agreement of the investigators. Changes  
that significantly affect the safety of the patients, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific  
quality  of the study  will require Scientific  Review Committee  and Institutional  Review Board  approval  
before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to human subjects. Any departures from the protocol must be full y documented in the case 
report  form and the source documentation.  
 
 
 
 
Demographic information such as age and race will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics, including 
means, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous parameters, as well as percents and  
frequencies  for categorical  parameters, will be  presented.  
 
The effectiveness of PSI to select fractionation schema will be assessed by percent response at  
the 4th week of treatment.  One- sided 95% confidence interval for the percent response at the 4th 
week of treatment will be also reported.  A proportion difference test will be performed to test a 
difference  of complete response rate  from a target  of 49%.  9 CLINICAL   MONITORING

As for secondary endpoints, response will be correlation with pre -treatment and during treatment  
radiomics features on PET/CT/MRI using two sample t -tests and univariate/multivariate logistic  
regression  analysis  as appropriate.  Correlation of response and outcome s to the mathematical  
models of tumor growth and death dynamics pre- treatment and during treatment will be 
performed using  logistic  regression analysis.  
 
 
 
 
This protocol  is a single  arm, phase  II design with a primary  endpoint  of 63% of patients  achieving 
a ≥ 32% reduction in tumor volume by week 4 . This study will test the null hypothesis that the true 
response rate is equal to or less than a historical control of 49%11 versus the alternative 
hypothesis that it is greater than 49%.  
 
Based on Fleming’s 2 -stage group sequential design, a total of 60 subjects will provide 
approximately 79% power with a type I error rate of 0.1 to detect a true response rate of 63%. 
The study will enroll subjects in two stages, with 49 subjects in the first stage. One interim 
efficacy/futility analysis will be conducted when the first 49 subjects have completed the study treatment and response evaluation. If the number of responsive patients is equal to or less than 
27, the trial will be stopped for futility. If the number of responsive patients is equal to or greater than 30, the trial will be stopped for efficacy. Otherwise, the trial will continue to the second stage 
by enrolling 11 additional subjects.  
 
At the final analysis with the total 60 subjects at the second stage, if there are equal to or more 
than 35 responsive patients, it will be concluded that the null hypothesis is  rejected  and the study 
treatment will be promising.  
 
 
 
The effectiveness of PSI to select fractionation schema will be assessed by percen t response at  
the 4th week of treatment.  One- sided 95% confidence interval for the percent response at the 4th 
week of treatment will be also reported.  A proportion difference test will be performed to test a 
difference  of complete response rate  from a target  of 49%.  
 
 
 
• Assess complete response by CT at 2 months or PET/CT at 3 months following completion of therapy.  This will be compared  against historical  controls.  
• Response correlation with pre -treatment and during treatment radiomics features on 
PET/CT/MRI:  
Radiomics features based on CT, MRI, PET- CT, noted during various imaging scans  
(pre-treatment, at 4 week of RT, and follow -up scan) will be correlated with the overall 
oncological  response and outcome

• Correlate response and outcome to mathematical models of tumor growth and death

Mathematical models will be generated based on the pattern of tumor growth and 
response as depicted by tumor volume measurement on various scans. These 
mathematical models will be validated by correlating with the overall response and 
oncological  outcome  
 
 
 One interim efficacy/futility analysis will be conducted when the first 49 subjects have 
completed evaluation of response to the study treatment. If the number of responsive 
patients is equal to or less than 27, the trial will be stopped for futility. If the number of 
responsive patients is equal to or greater than 30, the trial will be stopped for efficacy. 
Otherwise, the trial will continue to the second stage by enrolling 11 additional subjects.  
 
 
 
When the first 33 subjects (55% of the total planned sample size  of 60) will complete the study 
treatment, a n early interim exploratory data analysis will be performed for data on  HPV DNA  viral 
load in oral gargle and plasma samples, demographic  variables , and basic biometric  screening 
results . This exploratory analysis is a pilot proof -of-concept study to evaluate the feasibility and 
consistency of HPV  DNA  detection in salivary and plasma samples. No  analysis of p rimary and 
secondary safety and efficacy endpoints  will be performed  in this exploratory data analysis  to keep 
trial integrity . 
 
• Data for the exploratory analysis will be summarized overall using descriptive 
statistics. Continu ous data will be summarized with number of patients (n), 
mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Categorical data 
such as gender, race, and ethnicity will be summarized using frequency counts 
and percentages.  
• Cross -tabulation of descriptive statistics of demographic variables and 
biometric screening results with dichotomized HPV DNA viral load results  
(presence/absence of HPV DNA)  will be made with Chi- square test and two-
sample t-test as appropriate.  
• Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and 
Kappa statistics will be calculated along with p -values as summary statistics for 
the consistency of HPV viral loads and detection results  in oral gargle samples 
and plasma sam ples.

The participants  should  have  the opportunity  to discuss  the study  with their surrogates  or think  about it 
prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document  prior to any  
procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw  consent  at any time 
throughout  the course of the trial. A copy  of the informed  consent  document  will be given to the 
participants  for their records.  The rights  and welfare  of the participants  will be protected by emphasizing 
to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely  affected  if they decline to participate  
in this study.  
 
 
Participant  confidentiality  is strictly  held in trust by the participating investigators,  their staff,  and 
the sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological  
samples  and genetic  tests  in addition to the clinical information  relating to participants.  
Therefore,  the study  protocol,  documentation,  data,  and all other  information generated  will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to  
any unauthorized  third party  without  prior written  approval  of the sponsor.  
 
The study  monitor,  other  authorized representatives  of the sponsor,  representatives  of the IRB or 
pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records  
required to be maintained by the investigator,  including but not limited  to, medical  records  (office,

All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.  Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies.  When 
making changes or  corrections, cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and 
date the change.  DO NOT  ERASE,  OVERWRITE,  OR USE CORRECTION FLUID  OR TAPE 
ON THE ORIGINAL.  
 Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and 
maintained for recording data for each participant  enrolled in the study. Data  reported  in the 
eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents or the 
discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the 
participant’s  official electronic  study  record.  
 
Clinical data (including AEs,  concomitant  medications,  and expected adverse reactions  data)  and 
clinical laboratory data will be entered into <specify name of data capture system>, a 21 CFR  
Part 11 -compliant  data capture system provided by Moffitt Cancer Center. The data system  
includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent,  incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered 
directly  from the source documents.  
 
 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if  required by local regulations. No records will be 
destroyed  without  the written  consent  of the sponsor,  if applicable.  It is the responsibility  of the 
sponsor  to inform  the investigator  when these  documents  no longer  need  to be retained.  
 
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP or MOP  
requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or  
the site study staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site 
and implemented promptly.  
 
These practices  are consistent  with ICH E6: 
4.5 Compliance  with Protocol,  sections  4.5.1 -3

Clinical phase II
Trial rationale The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of three oral doses of BI 685509 over 20 weeks in male and female patients with DKD as adjunctive to ACEi or ARB treatment plus local standard of care according to respective guidelines. The results of this trial will be crucial for the decision about further development of BI 685509 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
Trial objectives The main objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the effectiveness of BI 685509 and to characterize the dose-response relationship for BI 685509 in patients with DKD by assessing 3 doses and placebo.
Trial endpoints Primary endpoint:Change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment.
Secondary endpoints:
Change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in First Morning Void urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment.Proportion of patients achieving UACR decreases in 10-hour urine of at least 20% from baseline after 20 weeks of trial treatment.Proportion of patients achieving UACR decreases in First Morning Void urine of at least 20% from baseline after 20 weeks of trial treatment.

Statistical methods The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate proof of concept of clinical 
activity of BI 685509 on the primary endpoint. For the proof of concept an evaluation of the benefit of BI 685509 compared to placebo will be conducted.
To account for the repeated nature of the primary endpoint data and the 
covariates in the model, MMRM analysis will be carried out for change from baseline of log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour 
urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment in each patient group. The 
analysis will include the fixed, categorical effect of treatment at each visit, and the fixed continuous effects of baseline log transformed UACR at each visit. Visit will be treated as the repeated measure with an unstructured covariance matrix used to model the within-patient measurements. The adjusted mean change from baseline (and the related standard error) will be calculated for each group and will be used for the MCPMod to determine therapeutic dose. The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod whereby several possible dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models.
Regarding analyses of the secondary endpoints,
1. MMRM will be used for the analysis for the change of UACR 
in First Morning Void.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019∀ If screening (including the 2 week baseline period) are not completed within 35 days prior to randomisation, the patient will b e a screen failure. IRT should be contacted to record the 
screen failure. If appropriate the patient may be re-screened (see above).
ivThe timepoint of first treatment (Visit 3) defines Day 1.
vVisits 4 and 5 must be performed at least 14 days after the previous visit.
viIn case a patient needs or wishes to terminate the treatment prematurely the patient should have an End of Treatment (EoT) visi t, if they agree. Please see section 6.2.4 for details.
viiThese visits can either be performed at the Investigational site or at the patient’s home. All local approvals for this must be  in place and confirmed by the sponsor. Consent for home visits 
must also be obtained from the patient. See section 6.2.1 for further details.
viiiThere are various ways that Telemedicine contacts (phone call or video call) can be used during this trial:
1. Telemedicine contact to provide support for patient’s urine sampling. Before the patient does their first UACR and eGFR sampl ing at home (before Visit 2) the investigational site 
staff should contact the patient to ensure the patient is comfortable with the sampling process. The other timepoints marked as  ‘(X)’ are suggested times to contact the patient if they 
are shipping samples directly from home to ensure they understand the instructions given to them. The site may, at their discre tion, offer support with further home sampling according 
to the individual needs of a patient. 
2. Telemedicine calls at visit 6 (marked as “O”) and/or FUp2. If this visit is being performed at the patient’s home by a nurse,  a telemedicine contact must be established between the 
nurse, patient and an Investigator who will guide the nurse through the physical exam (see section 6.2.1 ).
3. FUp1 must be performed as telemedicine contact for all patients, unless they prefer to come to the trial site.
4. Phone/ video calls may also take place at any other time if needed to support the patient.
ixInformed consent does not need to be obtained on the day of the screening visit but must be obtained before the first screening  assessment and within 35 days of randomisation (Visit 3). 
The consent discussion should include showing the patient the home sampling kits and explaining this procedure.
xOnce screening assessments have been completed, a member of the trial team will contact the patient by phone to provide confirm ation about eligibility.
xiAt Visits 3 to 8 vital signs will be measured before the morning dose and approximately 30 min and 120 min after dosing. If app licable this must occur prior to the ECG and PK samples. 
See FLOW CHART FOR PROCEDURES for further details.
xiiAll ECGs should be performed after the patient has been in the supine position for 5 minutes. They should be evaluated by the i nvestigator or a designee. See FLOW CHART FOR 
PROCEDURES for details on the timing of ECGs.
xiiieGFR at clinic visits will be determined from serum creatinine analysed by the central laboratory and also from . To confirm el igibility the eGFR at screening will 
be used.
xivPatients do not need to be fasted on the days of PK sampling, see FLOW CHART FOR PROCEDURES for further details. For further instructions see section 6.1 .
xvThe pharmacogenomic samples may be collected at Visit 3 or anytime afterwards.
xviOptional biobanking samples will only be collected if the patient has signed the biobanking informed consent separate form the m ain consent for the trial. See section 5.5 .
xviiA pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing potential. This will be a serum pregnancy test at Screening (Visit 1 ), thereafter a urine pregnancy test will be performed.
xviiiTo confirm eligibility at Visit 1, UACR measured in spot urine (midstream urine sample) by the central laboratory will be used.  Should the first test for UACR at screening be borderline 
out of range and not match inclusion criteria due to UACR variability, this test can be repeated once. The result must be avail able and eligibility confirmed before the baseline UACR 
sampling starts. If the second result does not meet the eligibility criteria the patient should be screen failed.
xixTraining on how to use the  device and how to do the FMV and 10-hour sampling will be provided to the patient at the screening visit. This will include instructions 
regarding sample shipments / what to bring in for clinic visits.

should return the samples to the investigational site. Countries may be exempted from microsampling if use of the  is not permi tted in that country.
xxiPatients will need to complete 2 different diaries. The ‘Diary for Urine and Blood Collection and Trial Drug Times’ will enable  the site to record information entered during urine and 
blood collection at home and 2 days prior to PK sampling including times of trial drug intake, start and stop times of collecti on and volumes. The ‘Daily Diary for Trial Drug 
Intake’ will help to check the compliance of the patient and a possible need for down-titration. If the patient chooses they wi ll be able to download an app containing the diaries to their 
phone at visit 1 or 2, or will be provided at visit 2 with an electronic device with the app installed. The app will also be us ed for the videocalls and can be used for patient reminders. If the 
use of the e-diary is not possible, alternatively a paper diary will be available to the patient.
xxiiThe planned last dose taken by the patient will be the evening dose the day before their EoT visit. If a patient withdraws from  treatment early the EoT visit should be performed as close as 
possible to their last dose.
xxiiiAll AEs, SAEs and AESIs will be collected from informed consent until FUp1 (end of residual effect period). Please see section 5.2.6.2.1 .
xxivAfter FUp1 until the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator should report any cancers of new histology and exacerb ations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and 
all trial treatment related AESIs. Please see section 5.2.6.2.1 .
xxvAs detailed in section 5.2.6.2.1 after the individual patient’s end of the trial the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any occurrence of 
cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any m eans of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs 
should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not on the CRF.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019In the patient MRD trial a responder was defined as a patient whose decrease from baseline in Urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) was at least 20%. For UACR measured in morning void urine, 15.8 to 27.8% of analysed patients receiving BI 685509 in DG1 to DG3 (3 to 5 patients) were responders, compared with 1 patient (7.1%) receiving placebo. For UACR measured in 10-hour urine, ≥50% of analysed patients receiving BI 685509 in DG2 and DG3 
(8 to 10 patients) were responders, compared with no patients receiving placebo [ c30365927-
01].
Based on recent data from a clinical trial (1366-0020) in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh 
stage A (24 patients) and B (25 patients), an effect of BI 685509 on the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF ( ∆∆QTcF) was seen. Dosing regimens up to 3 mg bid, 
similar to the highest dose group in this trial, were used. In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up to 13.7 ms, with the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one 
patient group (Child-Pugh B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate ( ∆∆HR) of > 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in 
the other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial. In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of ∆∆QTcF was seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, 
concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly 10 bpm.
BI 685509 has no effect on human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel at doses used 
in this clinical trial, and no effect on QT-interval was seen in conscious animal studies.

Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [ c02778238 ].
1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Although ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have 
demonstrated efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, the relative risk reduction was moderate (16% in the RENAAL [Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan] trial and 19% in the IDNT [Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial]) for the triple composite primary endpoint of all-cause death, ESRD and doubling of serum creatinine [ R02-0327 ], [R02-2101 ]. The residual risk remains high. Even 
with the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors that will provide an additional treatment option for 
renally compromised patients, there is still a large unmet medical need for effective and safe treatments that can further slow, halt or reverse the progression of diabetic kidney disease, and positively impact the patient’s quality of life.
The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of three oral 
doses of BI 685509 over 20 weeks in male and female patients with DKD as adjunctive to ACEi or ARB treatment, plus other local standard of care according to respective guidelines. The results of this trial will be crucial for the decision about further development of BI 685509 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily 
donate biospecimens for banking (please see section 5.5 ). If the patient agrees, banked

1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
1.4.1 Benefits
Potential benefits of treating DKD patients with BI 685509 result from the prediction of 
slowing progression of the disease and prevention of cardiovascular events, which is only partially achieved by current standard of care. Treatment with BI 685509 will potentially result in decreased progression towards dialysis or kidney transplantation due to preventing the progression of renal damage, which may directly translate into relevant improvements for patients’ morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Beyond that, it may reduce the number of cardiovascular events in the target population.
Patients may also benefit from more frequent clinical monitoring as a result of being part of a 
clinical trial.

device called  kit, to take blood from the tip of their finger. This tool has been established for easy-to use capillary blood collection at home. Patients will be trained on how to use this. Patients with diabetes are used to glucose determination in blood at home.
Patients may develop AKI or ESRD.Rare but severe event 
related to the trial diagnosis. Patients with such an event will need to receive different treatment and are unlikely to benefit from treatment with BI 685509.Treatment withdrawal criteria 
include AKI and ESRD as factors to remove the patient from treatment.
Patients may develop SARS-CoV-2 or other severe infectionBased on the mode of 
action BI 685509 is not expected to have a relevant impact on the susceptibility to or the course of an infection. The underlying disease studied in this trial and the expected higher age of the impacted population increase the risk of hospitalization and intensive care in case of a SARS-CoV-2 or other severe infection.In case of a confirmed severe 
infection, trial treatment will be discontinued immediately and appropriate measures for monitoring, treatment and quarantine will be implemented.
During a period of an increased 
risk of a severe infection, physical visits to the sites should be replaced with home visits or telemedicine and procedures (including lab testing) followed as far as the situation allows (see section 6.2.1 ). Direct shipment of 
the trial medication will be 
managed by the site or the provider directly as permitted by local regulations. These measures ensure the safety of the patients throughout the trial.

A charter will be available before trial initiation to define the specific data reviews and meeting intervals.
1.4.3 Discussion
Based on pre-clinical results, BI 685509 has the potential to slow progression of renal 
damage, delay end stage renal disease (ESRD) and reduce cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalisation for heart failure, in patients with DKD. In addition, clinical studies in healthy volunteers and DKD patients have shown that it is well tolerated when up-titrated to the doses to be administered in this trial.
A placebo arm is needed to allow for a true assessment of the effects of BI 685509 on the 
UACR in patients with DKD. All patients will be on stable background standard of care therapy of at least either ACEi or ARB, therefore the inclusion of a placebo arm is considered to be ethically justifiable.
Patients will be carefully monitored for side effects during the trial. The sponsor will 
continuously assess the risks and benefits of the trial based on accumulating clinical data from all clinical trials with BI 685509. Any significant change in risk-benefit ratio will be communicated to Investigators and patients.
It cannot be excluded that hitherto unknown AEs will be detected in this trial, but given the 
well characterised mode of action and the careful monitoring throughout the trial, the sponsor feels that the risks to participating patients are minimized and justified when compared with the potential benefit that a successful clinical development of BI 685509 could provide to the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.
Overall, in the context of the unmet medical need and the anticipated effect on progression of 
DKD in humans and based on the safety profile of BI 685509, the benefit-risk evaluation of the compound is considered favourable for the intended trial population.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN
This trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), parallel, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to compare three doses of BI 685509 with placebo in patients with 
diabetic kidney disease who are on background treatment with either ACEi or ARB plus any 
other standard of care according to respective local guidelines.
A schematic illustration of the trial design is presented in Figure 3.1: 1 .
Figure 3.1: 1 Trial design
Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once they have signed the informed consent. 
They will undergo a screening period of up to 3 weeks from the time of informed consent.
After their eligibility has been confirmed at screening, patients will continue in a 2-week 
baseline run in period. Patients who successfully complete the screening and baseline run-in period and meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be randomised equally into one of three parallel dose groups, and in each dose group to treatment either with BI 685509 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio (see Figure 3.1: 1 ).
From the start of the run-in until the end of the trial, at various time points patients will 
collect their urine for UACR sampling. These timepoints are listed in the UACR and eGFR 
flow chart . For each day that UACR is collected patients will start by collecting a First 
Morning Void urine in the container provided. As soon as the First Morning Void sample is 
collected the clock starts for the 10-hour urine collection. During this 10-hour period every time the patient urinates, they collect their urine into the provided container. An aliquot of this urine will be taken and used as the 10-hour UACR sample.
Once at each time point of urine collection patients will also give blood samples for eGFR 
analysis. For each time point where a physical visit to the site is not foreseen, the patient will

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019be equipped with a  kit to take blood at home, and urine collection containers to sample urine from their First Morning Voids and 10-hour collection container.
To decrease the burden on patients, where local regulations allow, samples taken at home 
between visits or when a home visit occurs will be shipped by the patient or a nurse or equivalent function visiting the patient for analysis at a central laboratory. Where this is not possible alternative arrangements will be made, e.g. samples taken to the investigational site. 
After end of treatment patients will continue with a 4-week follow-up with further urine and 
blood sampling. Beyond analysis for safety, urine and blood samples in this trial will serve for biomarker analysis including UACR and eGFR.
The trial will be stratified according to SGLT2 inhibitor use and type of diabetes at the time 
of randomisation. SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising class of drugs for DKD patients and it is anticipated that their use might increasingly become standard of care. [ P20-09106 ].To avoid a 
confounding effect, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors will have to be kept stable prior to trial 
participation and throughout trial treatment (see section 4.2.2.1 ). An approximate of 10% 
patients on Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients will be expected.
All patients will start on 1 mg TID BI 685509 or matching placebo. If the medication is 
tolerated, up-titration to 2 mg TID BI 685509 or matching placebo will occur after 2 weeks for patients in dose groups 2 and 3, and up-titration to 3 mg TID BI 685509 or matching placebo will occur after another 2 weeks for patients in dose group 3. Patients will receive 20weeks of treatment in total, which is expected to be the duration required to obtain stable effects.
Following the 20-week treatment period, or at the time trial treatment is permanently 
discontinued, patients will have an End of Treatment (EoT) visit, which will be the start of a 4-week follow-up period. A first follow-up telephone call (FUp1) at least 7 days later isconsidered as the end of the Residual Effect Period (REP). Until the end of REP all AEs and changes to concomitant medication need to be collected, documented and reported.
During the entire follow-up period the patient will not be treated with trial medication, but 
should if possible continue with any background treatment they were on, and will collect additional urine and/or blood samples at home. At the end of the 4-week follow-up a last physical visit will occur where again blood and urine samples will be collected. Depending on local regulations and approvals this visit may occur at the site or the patient’s home. With the conclusion of this visit the trial participation is complete for the individual patient.Historical serum creatinine data will be collected in the trial over a period of 3 years before start of treatment. This may be used in future to explore the benefit of BI 685509 in patients with rapid CKD progression.
Database lock will occur after the last patients have completed their final visit.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20193.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
A parallel group design was chosen to compare three different dose regimens, including a 
placebo control within each dose group, to find the optimal dose for phase III. Placebo control is used to control for observer and subject bias, and randomisation to control for assignment bias.
UACR was chosen as primary endpoint (10-hour collection) and secondary endpoint
(responder rate and First Morning Void (FMV)) because it was shown in previous phase II trials by others in CKD that it is sensitive, differentiating different doses, broad in its dynamic range and reaching a stable plateau within a reasonable time after start of treatment. It has been accepted by authorities as dose finding biomarker in CKD. In the MRD phase I trial in patients (1366-0004) UACR in 10-hour urine collected over the day (approximately starting with the morning dose) showed a greater difference to placebo compared to FMV urine. It is considered that 10-hour urine is able to capture the drug effect during the dosing schedule, while FMV urine contains the urine produced over night. While a 10-hour urine at daytime may be easier for patient to collect, a 24-h collection would be more burdensome and prone to error during night time collection. Also 10-hour UACR may be superior to FMV urine as the latter is depending on many factors such as nocturia and time of the first urination in the morning.
Furthermore, the change in UACR upon treatment within approximately 16 weeks of full 
dose correlates with long-term patient relevant outcomes. Based on this and including a 4-week up-titration, until the target dose is achieved, the full duration of treatment has been selected to be 20 weeks. Since UACR is a parameter that varies intra-individually over time, multiple measurements are required at baseline and during the treatment period especially towards the end of treatment where a stable response to the drug should be achieved.Sequential collection of urine during a 4-week follow-up period may deliver exploratory results of response stability and potential rebound effects.
To further characterise haemodynamic effects and potential early benefit on renal function 
serum creatinine will be measured at regular intervals for exploratory analysis.
In this parallel design, double-blind conditions regarding the patient’s treatment (active or 
placebo) are maintained within each dose group. It is not feasible to apply double-blind conditions between dose groups because the individual tablet strengths and matching placebo look different. Therefore investigators will know which dose group their patient is in but will be blinded to whether they are on active drug or placebo. Patients will be blinded to both the dose group they are on and whether they are taking active drug or placebo. Keeping investigators blinded to the dose group would require patients to take multiple tablets three times a day on top of the extensive background medication they already receive, which is considered too burdensome for this clinical trial. However, in order to minimise possible observer bias with regard to dose dependent effects, the dose group will be blinded to the patient as much as possible by applying the following measures:
The trial medication label will not include dose strengths so the dose will not be identifiable 
to the patient from the label.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Every effort should be made by the trial team and sites staff that the patient is not informed about the dose group assignment.Up-titration or “pseudo-titration” will occur for all patients two weeks after start of trial medication and again after another two weeks, regardless of dose group (see Table 4.1.4: 1 ). 
Pseudo-titration is a term used to describe when patients are told that they are potentially 
assigned to a higher dose, but actually remain on the same dose:
oPatients in Dose Group 1 (1 mg TID) will be “pseudo-titrated” to 1 mg TID after 
two weeks and to 1 mg TID two weeks after that.
oPatients in Dose Group 2 (2 mg TID) will be up-titrated from 1 mg TID to 2 mg 
TID after two weeks and then “pseudo-titrated” to 2 mg TID two weeks after that.
oPatients in Dose Group 3 (3 mg TID) will be up-titrated from 1 mg TID to 2 mg 
TID after two weeks and to 3 mg TID two weeks after that.
However, in case the patient experiences a related adverse event or for any other reason the patient pauses trial treatment, the investigator will need to decide whether a down-titration is needed based on the rules reflected in section 4.1.4 and the dose group the patient is assigned 
to. The patient will not know the specific rules. This will eliminate an additional burden of 
the patient to visit the site for a sham-downtitration if the patient is staying on the lowest dose already.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is expected that 240 patients will be randomised from approximately 100 sites. Screening 
of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial unless screening needs to be re-opened due to a higher rate of screen failures.
A log of all patients screened into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria), the sponsor should be contacted immediately.

3.3.4 Withdrawal of patients from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications; please see sections 3.3.4.1 and 
3.3.4.2 below.
Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at 
least to collect important trial data (UACR and eGFR sampling) according to the flow chart .
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as theexplanation of the consequences of withdrawal. The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If applicable, consider the requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see sections 5.2.6.2.1 and 
5.2.6.2 ).
3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient will discontinue trial treatment if:
∀The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment, without the need to justify the decision.
∀The patient has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
∀The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the safety of the 
investigational medicinal product, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 . If there is no safety 
concern then the Sponsor will review on a case-by-case basis as to whether it is 
appropriate for the patients to continue.  This decision will be based on factors such as duration of treatment, dose etc. If the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.
∀The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury as per clinical judgment by the Investigator.
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[ R17-2439 ] should 
be used for guidance:
oIncrease in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL ( ≥ 26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours; 
or
oIncrease in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times, which is known or presumed to have 
occurred within the prior 7 days; or
oUrine volume < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.
∀The patient progresses to end stage renal disease and needs to obtain renal replacement 
therapy.
∀Patients with a QT or QTcF interval > 500 ms, or an increase of QT or QTcF of > 60 ms 
from the pre-dose value at Visit 3 (baseline). Such cases must be reported as AEs.
∀The patient experiences a severe infection, e.g. with SARS-CoV-2 that precludes their 
safe participation in the trial, as determined by the investigator.

surgery, serious or severe Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) attributable to the trial drug 
(see section 5.2.6.1.4 ), other adverse events, or other diseases.
∀The patient has discontinued trial treatment for at least 10 consecutive days* or has not 
taken medication at a total of 14 days* during the trial. In case of a temporary reason, trial treatment should be restarted if medically justified, please see section 4.1.4 for dose 
adjustments. * a missed day is classed as all 3 doses being missed
∀A female patient becomes pregnant. The patient will be followed up until birth or 
otherwise termination of the pregnancy. The data of the patient will be collected and reported in the clinical trial report until last patient last visit and any events thereafter will be reported in the BI Pharmacovigilance database. See section 5.2.6.2.3 .
If new efficacy/safety information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review the 
benefit-risk-assessment and, if needed, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all patients or take any other appropriate action to guarantee the safety of the trial patients. 
Please see section 6.2.4 for details of the procedures to be performed if trial treatment is 
discontinued.
The sponsor may decide to replace patients if patients terminate early due to a pandemic 
outbreak.
3.3.4.2 Withdrawal of consent to trial participationPatients may withdraw their consent to trial participation at any time without the need to 
justify the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and withdrawal of consent to trial participation, as well as explain the options for continued follow-up after trial treatment discontinuation, please see section 6.2.4 .
3.3.4.3 Discontinuation of the trial by the sponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial
site at any time for the following reasons:Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site.New efficacy or safety information invalidating the earlier positive benefit-risk-assessment, please see section 3.3.4.1 .
Deviations from GCP, the trial protocol, or the contract impairing the appropriate conduct of 
the trial.
Further follow up of patients affected will occur as described in section 6.2.4 .
The investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria at Visit 3, each eligible patient will be 
randomised according to a randomisation plan.

Randomisation codes will be generated through a validated software and kept blinded to the 
trial team, sites and patients. An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used to screen patients, perform drug assignment, manage initial/ re-supply ordering of drug supplies and handle emergency un-blinding.
The investigator will receive all necessary instructions from the sponsor to access the IRT. 
Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the User Requirement Specifications mutually agreed by the sponsor and the IRT vendor. Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
All patients, regardless of dose group assigned, will start on a dose of 1 mg TID of BI 685509 
or matching placebo. Up-titration or pseudo up-titration will occur after 14 days and after 28 days in each dose group, until the maximum planned dose for that dose group is reached. Patients who do not tolerate an up-titration, e.g., due to orthostatic dysregulation, should follow the guidance in section 4.1.4.2 .
The treatment assignments and dose regimen are detailed in Table 4.1.4: 1 .

It is recommended that the first daily dose is taken in the morning, the middle dose around 
lunchtime, and the third dose in the evening (one tablet at each time point). There must be at least 4 hours in between trial medication intake. If a dose is missed this should not be rectified by taking two doses at the next time point. The medication should be taken with a glass of water and can be taken with or without food. The last dose of trial medication will be administered in the evening of the day before the EoT visit.
All trial medication assignments including up/down-titrations and replacement kits will be 
managed through the IRT system. Standard up-titrations in the first 4 weeks have to be done in the same manner for all patients to blind the patient to the dose group they’re assigned to. If no true up-titration is required for a patient at regular timepoints (i.e. Visit 4 and again at Visit 5), then the patient will still get new medication on the same dose as before. All patients will be told that the medication could either be the same or a higher dose depending on the treatment and dose group to which the patient is allocated.
During a COVID-19 or similar pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted 
to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations (for more details see section 6.2.1 ). Shipment of trial medication to the patient’s home will also be 
allowed to support regular visits performed at the patient’s home.
Potential down-titrations (dose reductions) can be done based on the dose group known by 
the investigational site. This will be managed via the IRT system. Dose reductions must not be performed by instructing the patient to take less than the three daily doses. While the patient will not get to know the precise rules as listed in sections 4.1.4.1 and 4.1.4.2 , the 
patient will be informed that down-titrations may be needed as decided by the investigator.
4.1.4.1 Rules for titration in case of interruption of trial treatmentSince an interruption of trial medication may have an influence on the tolerance, the 
following rules will apply for the safety of the patient:

Proprietary confidential information © 2022 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019An interruption of trial treatment is defined as any occurrence where 4 consecutive doses* or more were not administered (i.e. missed or dosing temporarily discontinued). *One dose 
refers to an individual timepoint e.g. morning dose, or middle dose or evening dose.
oIf less than 4 consecutive doses of trial medication are missed then the next dose 
of trial medication should be taken as scheduled.
After an interruption of trial treatment the patient should be restarted at 1 mg BI 685509/ placebo TID independent from the dose the patient was on before unless the patient was down-titrated due to an adverse event (see section 4.1.4.2 ) in which case:
oIf they had been on 2 mg/3 mg BI 685509/ placebo they would re-start on 1 mg 
BI 685509/ placebo.
oIf they had been on 1 mg BI 685509/ placebo then they should restart on placebo 
(matching 1 mg BI 685509).
Before any up-titration occurs the patient must have taken the preceding dose for at least 7 consecutive days. This applies throughout the treatment period.
oThis may mean that a patient due to be up-titrated at Visit 4 or 5 (as per Table
4.1.4: 1 ) is held at their current dose until their next scheduled visit. They could 
also be up-titrated at an unscheduled visit once this requirement is met.
If interruption for any reason occurs after Visit 5, subsequent up-titration will be allowed either at a scheduled or unscheduled visits.Patients with an interruption on 2 mg or 3 mg or matching placebo will need to return to the clinic either for the next scheduled or an unscheduled visit to receive 1 mg tablets before continuation of trial treatment.
4.1.4.2 Rules for down-titration in case of intolerance to trial treatmentIf a patient has an adverse event that the Investigator believes may be related to trial 
medication then the Investigator may either interrupt a patient’s trial medication (re-start to follow the rules above (see section 4.1.4.1 ) or dose reduce the patient as described below. See 
Appendix 10.3 for a schematic guidance on down-titration:
If the patient is on 1 mg TID or matching placebo the patient will be down-titrated to placebo 
matching 1 mg.If the patient is on 2 mg TID or 3 mg TID (or corresponding matching placebo) and interrupts trial treatment
oless than 4 consecutive doses, then the patient will be down-titrated one level i.e.
2 mg /placebo goes to 1 mg TID/ placebo.
3 mg/ placebo goes to 2 mg TID/ placebo.
o4 consecutive doses or more, then the patient will be down-titrated to 1 mg TID or 
placebo.
Dose-reduction must NOT be performed by taking less than the three daily doses or by splitting tablets so that a whole tablet isn’t taken.If the patient experiences a second adverse event that the Investigator believes is related and they have already had an interruption/ down-titration, then the patient should permanently discontinue trial treatment.In case of persistent adverse events despite dose reduction, or severe effects at any dose, permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered.Uptitration for patients who were down-titrated or interrupted for a related AE is not permitted.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20194.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other 
interest except the Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial Bioanalyst in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignmentswithin each dose group until after database lock. The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics prior to last patient completed to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of PK samples taken from placebo patients. Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
In order to expedite the population PK and PK-PD analyses and ensure timely delivery of 
PK/PD results after DBL, specific data must be unblinded and the treatment information must be made available to selected individuals. The unblinding procedure and logistics specific to this purpose will be provided in a separate document. It should be noted no PK/PD results will be communicated to the project and trial team prior to database lock.
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the codeEmergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trialparticipants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the Pharmacovigilance (PV) database system and not be shared further.
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by BI or a designated CRO. They 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).
Re-supply to the sites will be managed via an IRT system, which will also monitor expiry 
dates of supplies available at the sites.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.

The investigator or designee will receive the investigational drugs delivered by the sponsor
when the following requirements are fulfilled:Approval of the clinical trial protocol by the IRB / ethics committee,Availability of a signed and dated clinical trial contract between the sponsor and the investigational site,Approval/notification of the regulatory authority, e.g. competent authority,Availability of the curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator,Availability of a signed and dated clinical trial protocol,Availability of the proof of a medical license for the Principal Investigator (if applicable),Availability of FDA Form 1572 (if applicable).
Investigational drugs are not allowed to be used outside the context of this protocol. They 
must not be forwarded to other investigators or clinics. Patients should be instructed to return unused investigational drug.
The investigator or designee must maintain records of the product’s delivery to the trial site, 
the inventory at the site, the use by each patient, and the return to the sponsor or warehouse / drug distribution centre or alternative disposal of unused products. If applicable, the sponsor or warehouse / drug distribution centre will maintain records of the disposal. 
These records will include dates, quantities, batch / serial numbers, expiry (‘use- by’) dates, 
and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational medicinal product and trialpatients. The investigator or designee will maintain records that document adequately that the patients were provided the doses specified by the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP) and reconcile all investigational medicinal products received from the sponsor. At the time of return to the sponsor’s appointed CRO, the investigator or designee must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial patient and that no remaining supplies are in the investigator’s possession.
4.2 OTHER TREATMENTS, EMERGENCY PROCEDURES, 
RESTRICTIONS
4.2.1 Other treatments and emergency procedures
Patients should keep their existing therapies as stable as possible, particularly their therapy 
with either ACEi or ARB from screening at Visit 1 until the end of follow-up at Visit Follow-up 2 (FUp2).

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019New therapies should only be initiated if necessary for medical reasons. Please see the inclusion / exclusion criteria ( sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 respectively) and Table 4.2.2.1: 1 for 
full details of restrictions.
Background therapies (ACEi/ARB) or any other standard of care medications are not 
considered part of the clinical trial supplies, and therefore will not be provided.
There are no special emergency procedures to be followed.
4.2.2 Restrictions
4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Mitigation of the potential risks can be achieved by close monitoring of patients and the 
prohibited co-administration of drugs with  
. Special caution is warranted when administering BI 685509 in 
combination with drugs metabolized viaCYP3A4, because the exposure of such drugs may 
potentially increase. In addition, BI 685509 must not be co-administered with OATP1B1/3 inhibitors and drugs known to inhibit or induce UGT enzymes, as this may impact BI 685509 exposures in a clinically relevant manner. List of relevant drugs can be found in the investigator site file.
In addition, intake of concomitant therapies with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes must not 
be co-administered with BI 685509 (also refer to Table 1.4.2: 1 ). These restrictions apply 
from screening (Visit 1), until Visit FUp3. In the event of temporary concomitant use of such 
a therapy, trial medication must be temporarily stopped and can then be re-started after a period of at least 5 half-lives after the concomitant therapy with the known risk of Torsade de Pointes has been stopped, as long as the interruption rules are followed. Refer to Section 
4.1.4.1 for rules for re-starting up-titration in case of interruption of trial medication.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20194.2.2.3 Contraception requirements
WOCBP (for the definition please refer to section 3.3.3 ) trial participants, must use a highly 
effective method of birth control throughout the trial, and for a period of at least 7 days after 
last trial drug intake, if their sexual partner is a male able to father a child. No contraceptiveis required for the WOCBP participant’s partner.Highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly include (examples depending on approval status in each country):Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control that prevents ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal).Progestogen-only hormonal birth control that prevents ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable).Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).Bilateral tubal occlusion.
A male trial participant must be vasectomised with documented absence of sperm or use a 
condom until at least 7 days after last trial drug intake , if their sexual partner is a WOCBP. No contraceptive is required for the male participant’s partner.
Alternatively, WOCBP participants and male participants able to father a child must abstain 
from male-female sex. This is defined as being in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug; and withdrawal are not acceptable.
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty package 
material with them when attending visits.A patient will be considered as non-compliant in taking their trial medication if they have missed 4 consecutive doses or more. There are permitted exceptions to this, please see sections 3.3.4.1 (discontinuation of trial treatment) and 4.1.4 (withdrawal and assignment and 
administration) for further details.
A patient would also be considered as non-compliant if the patient, in the investigator’s 
opinion, has not followed the drug administration guidance on a consistant basis, e.g. repeatedly not taking 3 tablets a day, or repeatedly not following the dosing interval.
Compliance will be verified by the CRA authorised by the sponsor.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20195. ASSESSMENTS
5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
5.1.1 UACR
Urinary albumin and creatinine measurements are the basis for the calculation of urine
albumin creatinine ratio (UACR). FMV and 10-hour urine samples will be collected by the 
patient at home. 
The first morning void is the first urination after the patient wakes up at their usual time to 
start their day. Thus, if the patient goes back to sleep after urinating early in the morning this void does not need to be collected or documented. This applies also to any urinations earlier during the night in patients who have nocturia. There may be cases when a patient might go back to bed after their usual rising time. In those cases, the void at their usual rising time constitutes the first morning void.
Starting with the baseline run-in period, UACR will be determined on two consecutive days 
to average biological variability at the timepoints indicated in the flow chart . On each 
collection day a sample must be obtained from the patient’s FMV and from the total of urine 
collected over 10 hours after the FMV on the same day. Intake of trial medication in the morning should always occur after the FMV has been collected. Containers for collection of urine will be provided by the same central lab that will perform specimen management. An appropriate number of containers will be provided to the patient for collection at home. Patients will be reminded e.g. by telephone contacts ahead of sampling time points on how to collect and store their urine samples. Further collection and sample storage instructions are given in the laboratory manual in the ISF and instructions to the patient.
Urinary albumin and creatinine will be analysed at a central laboratory using routine 
validated methods. Urinary creatinine may also be used for normalisation of exploratory urinary biomarkers (see section 5.4.1 ).
5.2 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.2.1 Physical examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in the flow
chart . Assessments include at a minimum general appearance, neck, lungs, cardiovascular 
system, abdomen, extremities, and skin. 
Measurement of height and body weight will be performed at the time points specified in the flow chart .
The results must be included in the source documents available at the site. 
5.2.2 Vital signs
Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in the flow chart , prior to the 12-lead 
ECG and prior to blood sampling as applicable.
Boehringer Ingelheim 14 Mar 2022
BI Trial No.: 1366-0005c32274622-05 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 56 of 107

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019This includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (electronically or by palpation count for 1 minute) in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. At Visits 3 to 8 vital signs will be measured before dosing and approximately 30 min and 120 min after dosing. BP measurements should be recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg. The results must be included in the source documents available at the site.
5.2.3 Safety laboratory parameters
Safety laboratory parameters to be assessed are listed in Table 5.2.3: 1 . For the sampling time 
points please see the flow chart .
A central laboratory result will be used to confirm eGFR and UACR for eligibility and safety 
analyses, the respective reference ranges will be provided in the ISF. 
Patients do not have to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety laboratory. Instructions regarding sample collection, sample handling/ processing and sample shipping 
are provided in the Laboratory Manual in the ISF. Where samples are collected by the patient directly, appropriate instructions in lay language will be provided.
The central laboratory will provide reports to the investigator. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to evaluate the laboratory reports. Clinically relevant abnormal findings as judged by the investigator will be reported as adverse events (please refer to section 5.2.6 ).
Lab tests may need to be repeated in case of required medical follow-up due to an adverse 
event or if a test was not successful due to incorrect specimen handling or storage. Should a patient not fulfil all lab requirements to take part in the trial due to a transitional medical condition, the patient may continue in the run-in phase but not be randomised until the re-test of the lab result has shown eligibility of the patient.
To test the eGFR throughout the trial, a small capillary blood volume will be collected by the 
patient (if needed with assistance by the site staff or caregiver) with the  at the time points indicated in the flow chart . Therefore during each period of home based urine 
collection for UACR analysis patients will need to draw one blood sample on their own and 
ship to the central lab or the site, if permitted by local legislation. Alternatively the patient will need to take the specimens to the site directly. The samples collected at visits will be compared to the eGFR calculations based on the common safety blood sample to show comparability for future trials.
In case the criteria for a potential severe DILI are fulfilled, a number of additional measures 
will be performed (please see section 5.2.6.1 and the DILI Checklist provided in the eDC
system. The amount of blood taken from the patient concerned will be increased due to this
additional sampling.
The central laboratory will transfer the results of the analysis to the sponsor.
The CKD-EPI Equation is used for reporting eGFR based on serum creatinine (see appendix 
section 10.2 ).

the ECG is taken. The ECG should be performed after the patient has rested for at least 5 
minutes in a supine position and prior to blood sampling. The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and assess clinical relevance. ECGs may be repeated for quality reasons and a repeated recording used for analysis.

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse eventAn AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions.
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse.
For Japan only: An event that possibly leads to disability will be handled as ‘deemed serious 
for any other reason’ and, therefore, reported as an SAE.
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiative on Important Medical 
Events, Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2 .
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in section 5.2.6.2 , subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interestThe term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
∀Severe orthostatic dysregulation as judged by the investigator
∀Severe hypotension as judged by the investigator
∀Syncope
∀Potential Severe DILI:
A potential severe DILI that requires follow-up is defined by the following alterations 
of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
∀An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019total bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples 
drawn within 30 days of each other, or
∀ALT and/or AST elevations ≥10 fold ULN.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in 
the eDC system.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the “DILI checklist” should be followed.
5.2.6.1.5 Intensity (severity) of AEsThe intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEsMedical judgement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given study treatment, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history.
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:

5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting5.2.6.2.1 AE CollectionThe investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the 
investigator:From signing the informed consent onwards until the follow-up visit 1 all AEs (non-serious and serious) and all AESIs.After follow-up-visit 1 until the individual patient’s end of trial:cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and all trial treatment related AESIs.After the individual patient’s end of the trial: the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should reportany occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not on the 
CRF.
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelinesThe investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20195.2.6.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnancy must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies (Part B).The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of pharmacokinetics
PK sampling times and periods are indicated in the Flow Chart for Procedures . Date and 
clock time of drug administration(s) and PK sampling will be recorded in the eCRF. Patients 
do not need to come fasted to visits, but the fasting status needs to be recorded for PK sampling.
Noncompartmental PK parameters will be calculated based on actual sampling times using a
validated PK software (Phoenix
®WinNonlin®8.1). Further PK parameters will be calculated 
as feasible and may include, but are not limited to:C
max (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma)
tmax(time from dosing to maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma)
AUC t1-t2 (area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time

Additional PK parameters may be calculated as appropriate.
Individual plasma concentration data and the PK parameters calculated thereof will be tabulated and graphically displayed. A subject’s PK data will be flagged and excluded from the PK analyses in case of protocol deviations relevant to the evaluation of PK or in case of PK non-evaluability (as revealed during data analysis, based on the criteria specified below). Reasons for exclusion of a subject’s data will be documented in the CTR.
Protocol deviations relevant to the evaluation of PK may be
Incorrect trial medication takenIncorrect dose of trial medication taken
PK non-evaluability applies, if for example
The subject experienced emesis that occurred in the time window of two times median t

(median t maxis to be determined excluding the subject(s) experiencing emesis)
The subject has missing samples/concentration data at important phases of the PK disposition curve
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
For quantification of analyte plasma concentrations of BI 685509 blood will be taken from an 
antecubital or forearm vein at the times indicated in the flow chart . Blood will be withdrawn 
by means of either an indwelling venous catheter or by venipuncture with a metal needle. 
Further details of sample processing for plasma generation will be described in the study-
specific lab manual (see ISF) .
After analysis the samples may be used for further methodological investigations (e.g., for 
stability testing or assessment of metabolites) or to address Health Authority questionsregarding the results/methodology. However, only data related to the analyte and/or its metabolite(s) will be generated by these additional investigations. The study samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations, but no later than 5 years after the final study report has been archived.

Participation in biobanking is voluntary and not a prerequisite for participation in the trial. 
Biobanking will only occur after a separate biobanking informed consent has been given in accordance with local ethical and regulatory requirements.
5.5.1 Methods and timing of sample collection
Sampling will be performed at the time points specified in the flow chart .
Plasma banking: Blood will be drawn into a K-EDTA blood collection tube.
Serum banking: Blood will be drawn into a serum separation tube.
Urine banking: Urine will be taken at the timepoints shown in the flow chart , after tubes for 
exploratory biomarkers (see section 5.4.2 ) have been filled. The urine will be taken from the 
urine sample collected for safety.
For all biospecimens collected, detailed instructions on sampling, preparation, processing,
shipment and storage are provided in the laboratory manual. Samples will be stored at an external biobanking facility contracted by the sponsor.

5.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
All measurements performed during this trial are standard measurements and will be 
performed in order to monitor safety aspects and to determine efficacy, PK and PD markers of BI 685509 in an appropriate way.
The scheduled measurements are appropriate to assess drug induced changes in kidney 
function with regard to albuminuria (UACR), and safetywise in vital signs, standard laboratory values, and ECG. While UACR is widely accepted as a PD marker for efficacy in renal trials, safety lab, vital signs and ECG are standard to examine the safety of the investigational product and to descriptively identify differences between different doses and placebo.
Instead of the widely used FMV, serial 10-hour urine sampling over day were selected as an 
appropriate measure for the primary endpoint, as this is supposed to correlate with the immediate effect of BI 685509 after administration and has shown a relevant change in

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All visits should should be scheduled according to the flow chart . Each visit date (with its 
window) is to be counted from Day 1 (randomisation). If any visit has to be rescheduled, 
subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule. The trial medication packs contain 
sufficient medication to allow for these time windows.
All trial visits should be initiated preferentially in the morning. Patients should be instructed 
to not take their morning dose of the study medication at home at scheduled visit days as they will be dosed whilst at the study site.
Patients do not need to come fasted to study visits, but their fasting status will have to be 
recorded in the CRF for PK sampling timepoints. From the first PK sample before administration of BI 685509 until the PK sample 2 hours after administration the patient should only drink water and eat no food unless it is medically needed.
Unscheduled visits will be possible at the discretion of the investigator at any time in order to 
check the safety of the patient or to provide trial medication e.g following an interruption. If the reason for removal of a patient from treatment is an adverse event or a clinically significant laboratory test result, the patient must be followed-up until complete resolution or stabilisation of the event or until follow-up is agreed adequate by the Investigator and sponsor.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Study measurements and assessments should be performed according to the flow chart and 
Flow Chart for Procedures . All assessments should be performed before study drug 
administration.
Where the following assesments occur at a visit they should be performed in the following 
order:Vital signs – see flow chart and Flow Chart for Procedures
ECG – see flow chart and Flow Chart for Procedures
Blood draws including trough PK and  – other PK samples are drawn after
drug administration (see Flow Chart for Procedures )
Spot urine (mid-stream) samples can be collected at any time prior to trial medication. 
Aliquots should be taken from the urine sample in the following order: first safety and pregnancy sample (if applicable), then if applicable biomarkers, followed by biobanking (if consent obtained).
Please see refer to the following sections for specific details about alternatives to visits at the 
site (the type of visit needs to be recorded on the CRF):Flow chart and Flow Chart for Procedures – overview of what procedures should be 
performed and at what timepoints.

6.2.1 Telemedicine Contacts and Home Visits
In this study Telemedicine Contacts and Home Visits may be performed if all local approvals 
are in place and confirmed by the sponsor.
These contacts are used to help support patients with protocol procedures and compliance. 
The Home visits can be used to reduce the burden of participation on patients, and also to encourage participation following the COVID-19 or similar pandemic in case a patient is otherwise not able to travel to the site.
Telemedicine contacts should be performed as indicated in the flow chart but may also be 
performed at any time during the course of the trial to support patients with the home 
sampling and/ or following up on AEs or trial medication compliance. This may be via a straightforward phone call between the patient and an appropriately qualified member of the Investigational Site or via a video call using a smartphone/ tablet application. If the telemedicine contact is being done during a home visit to support a physician guided physical exam this must be done as a video call.
The following visits may be performed at the patient’s home, i.e. a home visit by a nurse or 
physician:Visit 2 (Run-in)Visits 7 and 8 (Treatment Phase)FUp3 Unscheduled visits where a physical exam is not required
If the patient reports an AE during these visits then it’s at the discretion of the Investigator as 
to whether a telemedicine contact is need to support this assessment or even if the patient should attend the site.
The following visits may be performed at the Patient’s home by a physician. If allowed by 
local regulations these visits may also be performed by a nurse if they are qualified to perform a physical exam or if they are guided by a physician via a video call i.e. a home visit with telemedicine. The guided physical exam cannot be done via a phone call as the physician must observe the nurse who is doing the physical examination:
Visits 6 and FUp2Home visits may be performed either by an appropriately qualified member of the 
Investigational Site team or by a CRO working on behalf of the sponsor. Where a CRO is used all source information will be made available/ transferred to the Investigational Site.
To support visits performed at the patient’s home direct shipment of the trial medication will 
be managed by the site or the provider directly as permitted by local regulations. Unused medication provided at a previous visit may be returned to the site via a courier. If needed

All other visits must be performed at the Investigational Site. The only exception to this is if 
COVID-19 or similar pandemic restrictions are in place. In these exceptional cases, if the scheduled visits at the trial site are impossible, they may be performed at the patient’s home or as a telemedicine contact or as a combination, based on a thorough benefit-risk assessment (see section 1.4.2 ). Critical safety measures will remain in place. All home visits/telemedicine 
contact need to be discussed with and approved by the sponsor`s trial team. Local regulatory 
and legal requirements of the participating country still apply.
6.2.2 Screening and run-in period
Screening Period
No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. 
Once informed consent is obtained, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial and have started screening. The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered in the IRT system as a screened patient before any other activites are performed. Patients who do not start the run-in period should be registered as a screen failure in the IRT system.Patients who do not fulfil all eligibility criteria for a reason that later resolves and allows eligibility criteria to be met, may be re-screened after discussion with the sponsor. Re-screening will only be allowed once.
The footnotes to the flow chart provide details about when screening procedures may be 
repeated and when re-screening is allowed.
Run-in Period
The run-in period for this trial lasts for two weeks prior to randomisation. During this period
the patient will start to collect their UACR samples as described in the flow chart and in 
section 5.1.1 .
6.2.3 Treatment period
The treatment period in this trial is 20 weeks. All visit procedures should be completed as 
indicated in the flow chart .
6.2.4 Early discontinuation of Treatment
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely and who do not withdraw their informed 
consent should return for an End of Treatment visit.
If the patient has stopped taking trial drug the day of a scheduled visit or one day prior, the
scheduled visit should be performed as an EoT Visit. All samples including PK and all biomarkers ( , UACR and others) should be collected in addition to safety samples. If the early discontinuation does not coincide with a scheduled visit, the patient should return for an EoT Visit. PK or biomarker samples should not be collected, but all safety assessments must be performed as indicated in the flow chart .

have FUp1 as a mimimum.
6.2.5 Follow-up period and trial completion
The Follow-up Period consists of three visits, FUp1, FUp2 and FUp3 with a timepoint for 
UACR and  in between these visits, please see the flow chart for timelines 
and visit details.
The Residual Effect Period (REP) in this study is 7 days, visit FUp1 should therefore be 
performed no earlier than 7 days after the End of Treatment Visit.FUp visits FUp2 and FUp3 should also be scheduled relative to the EoT Visit, i.e. FUp2 willbe 2 weeks after EoT, 3 weeks after EoT there will be home sampling without visit, and FUp 3 should be 4 weeks after EoT.
Visit FUp3 may be conducted as a Home visit where permitted (see section 6.2.1 ), however 
should a patient have any adverse event(s) that require assessment then the Investigator may 
request they attend the site for a full assessment.
Participation in this trial is concluded once FUp3 has been completed.

SAMPLE SIZE
This is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), placebo-controlled and 
parallel group trial to investigate the effect of different doses of BI 685509 on UACR reduction over 20 weeks in patients with diabetic kidney disease.
The primary endpoint for patients is Change from baseline in log transformed UACR 
measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate PoC (proof of concept) of clinical activity of BI 685509 on the primary endpoint and to determine the optimal dose for phase III. The methodology for dose finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) will be applied to the 4 groups of patients, i.e. the patients on BI 685509 in each of the three dose groups and the combined patients from all dose groups who are not on BI 685509.
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null hypothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve for Change from baseline in log 
transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment comparing the placebo and the BI 685509 dose groups whereas the alternative hypothesis is that, there is a non-flat dose response curve indicating a benefit of BI 685509 in at least one of the patient groups.
The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose 
response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probability of Type I error (one-sided α of 5 
%). The pre-specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in section 
7.2.1 .
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following analysis sets will be defined for statistical analyses:
Entered Set (ES): This patient set includes all patients who signed informed consent. The ES
will be used for the analysis of patient desposition.
Randomised Set (RS): This patient set includes all entered and randomised patients. The RS
will be used for the analyses of protocol deviations as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Treated Set (TS): This patient set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study
medication. The TS is used for safety analyses and exposure.
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The patient set includes all patients who had at least one baseline 
measurement of UACR in week -2, -1, or 0 and at least one post-baseline measurement after week 6. The FAS is the main analysis set for the analysis of efficacy.

The same process will be repeated for the supplemental 1 and 2 approaches in Table 7.2.2: 1 .
Dose finding
The second primary objective is to determine therapeutic dose. The trial will characterize the dose-response curve for BI 685509 in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by assessing 3 doses and placebo. The response is the change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. Patients will be evaluated in the dose group they were assigned to at randomisation for primary analysis in the MCPMod analysis.
The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod whereby several possible 
dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models (refer to Figure 7.5: 1 ). If PoC is established, the statistically significant (best 
fitting) model(s) from the candidate set are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for 
all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target dose(s) can be estimated from that model by incorporating information on the minimum clinically relevant effect and accounting for safety. Doses within the dose range investigated (0 to 9 mg, total daily dose) will be considered.
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
The analysis for the change of UACR in FMV urine will be performed by using MMRM.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the change of UACR in FMV urine/10-hour urine
and the UACR response rate along with figures.
7.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of 7 days after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20197.4 RANDOMISATION
BI will arrange for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The 
randomisation list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a pseudo-random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non-predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.
In order to ensure a balance of patients who are on SGLT2 inhibitors and who are type 1 or 2 
diabetes mellitus compared with those who are not, the trial will be stratified according to SGLT2 inhibitor use and type of diabetes mellitusat randomisation. Patients will be randomised to 1 mg tid, matching placebo, 2 mg tid, matching placebo, 3 mg tid, and matching placebo in a 3:1:3:1:3:1 ratio. There will be 60 patients on BI 685509 and 20 on placebo in each dose group (240 in total).
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
The sample size calculation is conducted assuming effect size of BI 685509 versus placebo, 
(0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.35) for (placebo, BI 685509 3 mg, BI 685509 6 mg, BI 685509 9 mg total daily dose) in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment from baseline. The pre-specified models in Figure 7.5: 1 are used for testing null 
hypothesis. The following models have been selected as the candidate set of possible dose 
response patterns based on current expectation. Assuming the following dose groups will be tested: placebo, active BI 685509 3 mg, 6 mg, and 9 mg in terms of total daily dose.
Emax: 80% of the maximum effect is achieved at 6 mg.
Exponential: 20% of the maximum effect is achieved at 3 mg.Linear: No assumption is needed.Quadratic: 50 % of the maximum effect is achieved at a dose of 3 mg.
90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at a dose of 6 mg.
Sigmoid emax: 30 % of the maximum effect is achieved at a dose of 3 mg.
  90 % of the maximum effect is achieved at a dose of 6 mg.

Re-consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and 
should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions. The consent and re-consenting process should be properly documented in the source documentation.
8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach is used for trial quality management. It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes for trial subject protection and reliability of the results as well as identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing on areas of greatest risk.
Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design 
or monitoring approaches.
A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted by the sponsor, sponsor’s 
designees, or by IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by the sponsor. See section 4.1.5.2 for rules 
about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability, refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action e.g. re-training must be 
documented in the patient file.

The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.ECG results (original or copies of printouts).For electronic patient reported outcomes the electronic record is the source document.In case electronic data are available that can be uploaded to the CRF via an electronic interface, the data stored and secured on the system to collect the data will be considered the source data and the data transferred must be a validated copy of it.Source documentation for telemedicine visits.Source documentation for visits performed at the patient’s home.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which must be available at all times for review by the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA). They may review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy of the data will be verified by direct comparison with the source documents described in section 8.3.1 .T h e  
sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Added new footnote xxii to explain timing of the planned last dose.
Rationale for change Correction and clarification.
Section to be changed Flow Chart, UACR and GFR Sampling Flow Chart and 
Section 3.1
Description of change Extended the maximum time before randomisation from 28 
to 35 days throughout the protocol.
Rationale for change More time is needed to allow screening procedures to be 
repeated where permitted. 
Safety assessment such as vital signs, safety labs and 
physical examination will be performed again at Visit 2 and/or Visit 3 therefore there will be recent safety assessments prior to receiving the first dose of IMP. 
Section to be changed Flow Chart 
Description of change Rephrased footnote xviii from:
“Should the first test for UACR at screening not match inclusion criteria due to UACR variability, this can be repeated once.”
To:
“Should the first test for UACR at screening be borderline out of range and not match inclusion criteria due to UACR variability, this test can be repeated once. The result must be available and eligibility confirmed before the baseline UACR sampling starts.”
Rationale for change Clarification that the spot urine retest needs to be done and 
results received prior to start of baseline UACR sampling.
Section to be changed 1.4.2 Risks
Description of change Removed “at home”.
Rationale for change Clarification. This relates to blood sampling. It’s 
intended that patients will use the  to take capillary blood themselves both at home and also at the (applicable) site visit.
Section to be changed 3.1 Overall trial design
Description of change Clarified that shipment of samples from patient’s home can 
also be done by a nurse or equivalent function visiting the patient. Also clarified that this is applicable for both samples collected between visits and when home visits are performed.

Description of change Added further requirement to inclusion criterion #3: 
eGFR must remain ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 after Visit 1 up to 
the start of Visit 3, measured by central or any local laboratory analysis.
Rationale for change To ensure patient safety the eGFR value must not drop 
below 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 prior to visit 3. For the samples drawn at visit 3 and onwards withdrawal criteria have to be considered.
Section to be changed 3.3.2 Inclusion Criteria
Description of change Rephrased inclusion criterion #6: 
From:
“Stable on anti-hypertensives, NSAIDs, endothelin receptor antagonists, systemic steroids, within at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 until start of trial treatment, with no planned change of the therapy during the trial.”
To:
“If the patient is taking any of the following medications they should be on a stable dose at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1 until start of treatment, with no planned change of the therapy during the trial: anti-hypertensives, NSAIDs, endothelin receptor antagonists, systemic steroids or SGLT2 inhibitors.”
Rationale for change Clarification
Section to be changed 4.1.4 and 4.1.4.2 Drug assignment and administration of 
doses for each patient

Rationale for change Clarification on use of restricted nitrates in an emergency.
Section to be changed 4.3 Treatment Compliance 
Description of change Removal of tablet count recorded in the CRF.
Rationale for change Implementation of the administrative letter. Tablet counts 
are not required for compliance calculation, but will be provided through accountability procedures at the site.
Section to be changed 5.1.1 UACR
Description of change Definition of FMV added.
Rationale for change Clarification.
Section to be changed 5.2.3 Safety laboratory parameters and Flow Chart
Description of change Replaced requirement to test non-sterilized women <65 
years of age with the requirement to test women of child bearing potential for pregnancy.
Added clarification of why a safety laboratory may not be 
done at the central lab and added requirement to check S-creatinine to the minimum tests at the local lab.
Added further explanation that capillary blood draws using 
the  should always be performed by the patient unless assistance is required.
Rationale for change Pregnancy testing requirements have been updated as it is 
unnecessary for a women who is not, for whatever reason, of 
child bearing potential to undergo pregnancy testing. 
S-creatinine has been added as an important lab parameter to 
monitor kidney function.
Further clarifications.

Section to be changed 5.4.1 Exploratory biomarkers
Description of change Added further explanation on capillary blood draws, which 
can be assisted by site staff/nurse or a caregiver.
Rationale for change Further clarification.
Section to be changed 6.2.1 Telemedicine Contacts and Home Visits
Description of change Added further clarification on shipments to and from 
patient’s home and physical examinations by a qualified nurse.
Rationale for change Clarifications.
Section to be changed 7.2.5 Safety analyses
Description of change Adverse events will be summarized by the treatment to 
which the subject was randomised, and the treatment at the onset of AE for the drug-related AE rather than the treatment at end of the up-titration period as was before.
Rationale for change The original wording was reliant on a patient completing the 
up-titration period which may not be the case for all patients. The new wording is aligned with the Sponsor’s Company standards.
Section to be changed 8.3.1 Source documents
Description of change Deleted the following sentence: 
“This includes the values for eGFR and UACR and their method of analysis at or before screening to confirm eligibility.”
Rationale for change Since this is performed by the central lab and the sentence 
before already mentions all inclusion criteria, this sentence has been removed for clarification.

placebo-controlled and parallel group trial to investigate the effects of different doses of oral BI 685509 given over 20 weeks on UACR reduction in patients with diabetic kidney disease
Global Amendment due to urgent safety reasons
Global Amendment X
Section to be changed 3.1
Description of change Removed duplicate Figure 3.1: 1 from previous protocol 
version with 2 weeks screening instead of now 3 weeks.
Rationale for change Correction. The removal of the figure was missed in global 
amendment 2.
Section to be changed Flow Chart and Flow Chart for Procedures (Formerly PK 
Flow Chart) 
Description of change Addition of ECGs at visits where there were previously no 
ECGs: three ECGs at visits 4, 5 and one ECG at Visits 7 and 8. At Visits 3 and 6 an additional ECG will be done to the two already performed.The main Flow Chart also reflects the number of times these ECGs occur.
Footnote xii has been updated to reflect this.
Rationale for change More frequent ECG monitoring introduced as a response to 
the recent additional data mentioned in – see section 1.2.
Section to be changed Flow Chart
Description of change Where multiple assessments/ procedures are done e.g. 
ECGs, PK sampling the numbers have been added to the flow chart
Rationale for change For clarity

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Description of change The text in footnote xviii about pre-screening for UACR has 
been moved to footnote iii. In addition eGFR has been added as a test that patients can be pre-screened for if consent is given.
Rationale for change The text about eGFR has been added as this is not always 
done regularly and several patients have failed screening for this. Allowing pre-screening for eGFR means less unnecessary screening procedures for patients who would not be eligible due to eGFR.
The UACR pre-screening text has been moved as it is more 
appropriate to have all screening text together.
Section to be changed Flow chart footnote ix
Description of change The text “……. And within 35 days of randomisation (visit 
3)” has been added.
Rationale for change For clarity and consistency.
Section to be changed Flow chart footnote xi
Description of change The following text has been added:
“…..If applicable this must occur prior to the ECG and PK samples. See FLOW CHART FOR PROCEDURES for details on the timing of ECGs."
Rationale for change For clarity and consistency.
Section to be changed Flow Chart for Procedures (Formerly PK Flow Chart)
Description of change The PK flow chart has been expanded to include all the 
assessments/ procedures to be performed and the order in which they should be done.
The PK Flow Chart has been renamed to “Flow Chart for 
Procedures”. These changes apply throughout the protocol.
Rationale for change It is important that procedures are done within the order 
mentioned in section 6.2. The table has been added to make this easier to follow and to include the timings.
Section to be changed UACR and GFR sampling flow chart
Description of change Reference added to flow chart for visit windows.
Rationale for change For clarity.
Section to be changed Section 1.2 Drug Profile
Description of change The following text was added:

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF ( ∆∆QTcF) 
was seen. Dosing regimens up to 3 mg bid, similar to the highest dose group in this trial, were used. In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up 
to 13.7 ms, with the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one patient group (Child-Pugh B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate (∆∆HR) of > 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in the 
other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial. In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting 
with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of 
∆∆QTcF was seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, 
concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly 10 bpm.
BI 685509 has no effect on human ether-a-go-go related 
gene (hERG) channel at doses used in this clinical trial, and no effect on QT-interval was seen in conscious animal studies.
Rationale for change To provide new information this also serves as the detailed 
rationale behind the additional measures being included in this amendment.
Section to be changed Section 1.4.2, Table 1.4.2:1 Overview of Trial Related Risks
Description of change Potential QT-interval prolongation was added as a risk along 
with the summary of data, rationale for the risk and the mitigation strategy.
Rationale for change Updated due to the new data available.
Section to be changed Section 3.2 discussion of the trial design
Description of change From: 
“In order for patients and investigators to be blinded to dose group, patients would be subjected to taking multiple tablets three times a day on top of the extensive background medication they already receive, which is considered too burdensome for this clinical trial.”
To:
“Therefore Investigators will know which dose group their patient is in but will be blinded to whether they are on active or placebo medication. Patients will be blinded to both the dose group they are on and whether they are taking active drug or placebo. Keeping Investigators blinded to the dose group would require patients to take multiple tablets three times a day on top of the extensive background medication

Rationale for change To clarify blinding within this trial.
Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Exclusion criteria 11) Removal of lactose monohydrate as an 
example of an excipient.
Rationale for change Lactose monohydrate is not used  in the Phase II formulation.
Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Addition of the following exclusion criteria:
17. QTcF -interval > 450 ms in men or > 470 ms in women 
at any time from screening (Visit 1) until start of treatment.18. A family history of long QT syndrome.19. Concomitant use of therapies with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes at screening (Visit 1) and throughout screening and baseline run-in or planned initiation of such therapies during the trial (refer to Section 4.2.2.1 ).
Rationale for change Added to ensure patients with QTc prolongation or with the 
potential for QTc prolongation do not participate.
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change “• The patient needs to take concomitant medication that is 
not permitted, see section 4.2.2. However, if the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.
Was rephrased to:
“•The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the safety of the investigational medicinal product, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.  If there is no safety concern then the Sponsor will review on a case-by-case basis as to whether it’s appropriate for the patients to continue.  This decision will be based on factors such as duration of treatment, dose etc. If the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.”
Rationale for change The patient may remain on trial treatment in an exceptional 
case once the patient uses restricted medication, if there are no safety concerns. The patient will be analysed according to the TSAP.
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of Trial Treatment
Description of change The following was added:

Rationale for change An additional patient safety measure.
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of Trial Treatment
Description of change “The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury according to the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[R17-2439]” 
Was changed to:
“The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury as per clinical 
judgment by the Investigator. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[R17-2439] should be used for guidance”
Rationale for change The KDIGO guidelines are for use within a clinical setting. 
Patients with low urine output for reasons other than AKI, for example poor fluid intake, potentially could have been incorrectly discontinued.
Section to be changed 4.1.4
Description of change The following text was added: “The last dose of trial 
medication will be administered in the evening of the day before the EoT visit.“
Rationale for change Clarification. 
Section to be changed 4.2.2.1 Restrictions Regarding Concomitant Medication and 
Table 4.2.2.1:1 Concomitant Medication Restrictions 
Description of change The following text was added:
“In addition, intake of concomitant therapies with a known 
risk of Torsade de Pointes must not be co-administered with BI 685509 (also refer to Table 1.4.2: 1). These restrictions apply from screening (Visit 1), until Visit FUp3. In the event of temporary concomitant use of such a therapy, trial medication must be temporarily stopped and can then be re-started after a period of at least 5 half-lives after the concomitant therapy with the known risk of Torsade de Pointes has been stopped, as long as the interruption rules are followed. Refer to Section 4.1.4.1 for rules for re-starting up-titration in case of interruption of trial medication.”
The restricted medication table was updated to include drugs 
with known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
Rationale for change Update to exclude medications that could impact QTc

(Visit 1):“…….. and planned to remain stable throughout the trial, i.e. must be at a dose of prednisolone ≤10 mg or equivalent.”
Rationale for change Clarification.
Section to be changed 5.2.2 Vital signs
Description of change “Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in 
the flow chart.”
Was changed to:
“Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in the flow chart, prior to the 12-lead ECG and prior to blood sampling as applicable.”
Rationale for change For consistency with other changes in this amendment to 
ensure vitals are done prior to ECG.
Section to be changed 5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
Description of change Text was added to state that ECGs should be performed 
prior to blood draws and after the patient has been in the supine position for 5 minutes.
Text was also added about the review of ECGs and also 
about the collection and storage of ECGs
Rationale for change To ensure ECGs are accurate, any anomalies are correctly 
reported and to include a new storage procedure.
Section to be changed 6.2 Details of Trial Procedures at Selected Visits
Description of change Text relating to number of vital signs and ECG assessments 
was removed to just leave the reference to the Flow Chart. The Flow Chart for Procedures was added.
Rationale for change For clarity.

Global Amendment X
Section to be changed 1.2 Drug Profile
Description of change The combination of BI 685509 with other compounds 
involved in the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, such as nitrates and PDE5 inhibitors, non-specific PDE inhibitors, sGC-simulators might further increase the risk for hypotensive episodes and potentially reactive heart rate increases and the severity of these effects.
Was expanded to:
The combination of BI 685509 with other compounds involved in the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, such as NO-donors including nitrates and PDE5 inhibitors, non-specific PDE inhibitors, sGC-simulators might further increase the risk for hypotensive episodes and potentially reactive heart rate increases and the severity of these effects.
Rationale for change All NO donors as belonging to NO-sGC-cGMP pathway 
activating drugs must not be administered due to possible synergistic effects with BI 685509.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Exclusion criterion #1 was changed from:
Treatment with Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) interventions (apart from either ACEi or ARB), phosphodiesterase inhibitors, nitrates, sGC-stimulators/activators (other than trial treatment) or any other restricted medication (including OATP1B1/3 inhibitors, UGT inhibitors/inducers) as provided in the Investigator Site File (ISF) within 4 weeks prior to visit 1 and throughout screening and baseline run-in.

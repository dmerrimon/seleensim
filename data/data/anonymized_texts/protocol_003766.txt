Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 5glycemic control on DPP4(i) with or without metformin for at least 
12weeks prior to Screening will be eligible for enrollment in this study . To 
ensure an approximately equal number of patients have Screening SBP 
<130 mmHg or SBP ≥130 mmHg , the number of patients enrolled in each 
category will be limited to 60% of all patients ( ≤420 patients).
Allpatients will have an up to 4-week S creening Period (consisting of a 
Screening Phase up to 2 -week s and a 2 -week, single -blind Run -in phase 
prior to randomization, followed by a 26 -week Double -blind Treatment 
Phase and a 4 -week post -treatment Follow -up visit. To qualify for 
randomization, patients must demonstrate compliance based upon tablet 
and capsule count ( ≥80%) during the Run -in Phase .
Randomization will be stratified by:
 HbA1c at Screening ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%)
 SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg)
 Metformin useat Screen ing (Yes, No)
Patients will be randomly assigned 2:2:1 to the following 3 treatment 
groups on top of DPP4(i) with or without metformin:
 Sotagliflozin 400 mg
 Empagliflozin 25 mg
 Placebo
The patient’s HbA1c, FPG, PPG, UGE , and UGCR will be masked to study 
centers and patient safter randomization and until the end of the study . 
Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick will not include the measurement of 
urine glucose. Urine glucose, albumin, calcium ,and creatinine will be 
measured separately at Visits 3, 6, and 8 by the central laboratory.
To further evaluate the diurnal effect of sotagliflozin on SBP compared 
with the comparator arms (placebo and empagliflozin) and to avoi d the 
white- coat effect, SBP will be evaluated by 24-hourABPM in a subset of 
180 patients .
Early termination
If a patient discontinues treatment with investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) early during the double -blind Treatment Period, the patient will have 
a Premature End ofTreatment (EOT) Visit, and Follow -up Visit 4weeks
after the last dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to have the 
patients return to the site at the time corresponding to their scheduled 
visits, particularly the Week 26 Visit. If the patient does not agree to site 
visits, they will be contacted by telephone to inquire about safety status 
and collect adverse event ( AE)data.

Noninvestigational medicinal products Patients will continue on their existing DPP4(i) with or without metformin, if 
applicable . The doses should remain unchanged during the study period 
unless as needed for safety reason.
Rescue therapy (Glycemic Parameters)
The threshold values for rescue are defined as follows, depending on the 
study period :
 From Baseline Visit (V3, Day 1) to Visit 5 (Week 8) (including 
value at Visit 5): FPG >270 mg/dL (>15 .0mmol/L )
 From Visit 5 (Week 8) to Visit 6 (Week 12) (including value at 
Visit 6): FPG >240 mg/dL (>13.3 mmol/L)
 From Visit 6 (Week 12) up to the end of the treatment period 
Visit 8 (Week 26): FPG >200 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c 
≥8.5% (the 8.5% criteria does not apply if the HbA1c decrease 
from Baseline was ≥1.0% )
Routine fasting self -monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and central 
laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12 and onwards) are set 
up to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined 
thresholds.
If a central laboratory FPG and/or HbA1c is above the threshold, the 
Investigator will receive an alert from the central laboratory. Upon receipt 
of a central laboratory rescue alert, a centr al laboratory re testmust be 
completed and confirmed.
Likewise, patients are instructed to contact the sites for a confirmatory 
FPG test via central lab oratory in case of high fasting SMBG readings for 
3consecutive days. Hyperglycemia must be confirmed as exceeding the 
criterion for rescue before rescue the rapy is initiated. The central 
laboratory FPG confirmation should be performed as soon as possible 
preferably within 7 days by unscheduled visit.
If rescue thresholds are reached, it is recommended to us e sulfonylurea 
(glimepiride, if available) first (unless there is a contraindication to 
sulfonylurea treatment per label). In case of contraindication to 
sulfonylurea, another antidiabetic medication ,eg, insulin or oral 
antidiabetic drugs (except SGLT2 in hibitors) will be added according to the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment a nd in accordance with the treatment 
guidelines.
If a patient requires rescue, the IMP received at Randomization should 
continue and must remain blinded until the end of the study .

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Study Flow Chart(Section 1.2)
STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS Sample size determination:
A sample size of 280 patients in the sotagliflozin group and 140 patients in 
the placebo group will provide more than 90% power to detect a difference 
of 0.6% for change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c between 
sotagliflozin and placebo ( standard deviation [SD] =1.1% ; 5% significance 
level 2 -sided) .
A sample size of 280 patients in the sotagliflozin group and 280 patients in 
the empagliflozin group will ensure that the upper bound of the 2 -sided 
95% confidence interval ( CI)of the adjusted mean difference would not 
exceed 0.3% with more than 80% power to show noninferiority for 
intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis and for com pleter analysis considering 
15% dropout . This calculation assumes a common SD of 1.1 %, and the 
true difference between sotagliflozin and empagliflozin is zero for change from Baseline to Week 26inHbA1c .
Thetotal sample size will be 700 patients to be randomized (sotagliflozin 
group: 280; empagliflozin group: 280; placebo group: 140).
Analysis population:
Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population, defined as all 
randomized patients, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol 
and procedures.
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint :
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints will be performed using the ITT 
population, using measurements obtained during the study, including 
those obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy.
The statistical test will be two -sided tests at a nominal 5% significance 
level.The primary efficacy endpoint of change from Baseline to Week 26 in 
HbA1c will be analyzed with missing post- baseline values imputed by 
placebo control -based copy reference multiple imputation method under 
the missing not at random framework.
 For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the 
placebo group data
 For pat ients in the active arms (sotagliflozin and empagliflozin) ,
missing data will be imputed as if the patient swere on placebo 
group throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements 
including the on -treatment measurements will be considered as 
if the me asurements were from the placebo group in the 
imputation model .

Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed values, 
and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided 
for each treatment group. The summary will include the number of

over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from Baseline
(±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using observed cases [OC] ).
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints:
For each of the continuou s secondary endpoint s, a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be used, with missing values imputed by placebo control -based copy reference multiple imputation method under 
the missing not at random framework:
 For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the

treatment group, as well as the between -group difference s and the 95% 
CIs for the differences .
Categorical secondary endpoint ssuch as HbA1c responders (<6.5 %, 
<7.0%) at Week 26 will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
method stratified by randomization strata of Screen ing HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, 
>8.5% ), Screen ing SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130mmHg), and metformin useat 
Screen ing (Yes, No). The proportion in each treatment group will be 
provided, as well as the difference of proportions between sotagliflozin and 
placebo with associated 2 -sided 95% CI. For HbA1c responders at 
Week 26, all values at Week 26 will be used to determine whether a 
patient is a responder or not, even if they are measured after IMP 
discontinuation or rescue medication use. Patients who have no HbA1c 
measurement at Week 26 will be treated as nonresponders.
A sensitivity analysis to noninferiority tes t will be conducted with the 
26-week treatment completers (ie, a ll patients who complete the 26 -week

values and the same ANCOVA model described above.
Multiplicity considerations:
To control for the family -wise T ype I error, a fixed -sequence testing 
procedure will be applied.Once the primary hypothesis (superiority of the change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo) is 
established statistically significant for the primary efficacy endpoint, the following secondary hypotheses will be tested in the following prioritized 
order:
1. The noninferiority of sotagliflozin ver sus empagliflozin on HbA1c 
reduction at Week 26
2. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on 2 -hour PPG 
reduction at Week 26
3. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on FPG reduction at Week 26
4. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo o n body weight 
reduction at Week 26
5. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on HbA1c 
responder analysis (HbA1c<7.0 % at Week 26)
6. The superiority of sotagliflozin ver sus placebo on sitting SBP 
reduction at Week 12 in patients with Baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg
7. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo on sitting SBP reduction at Week 12
8. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus empagliflozin on HbA1c 
reduction at Week 26
9. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus empagliflozin on sitting SBP reduction at Week 12 in patients with Baseline SBP 
≥130 mmHg
10. The superiority of sotagliflozin versus empagliflozin on sitting SBP reduction at Week 12.
If any hypothesis is found to be no t statistically significant, the testing 
procedure will be stopped and the following hypotheses will not be tested. 
The noninferiority hypothesis will be declared statistically significant if the 
upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the adjusted mean diff erence is 
<0.3. The superiority hypothesis will be declared statistically significant at α = 0.05 (2- sided).
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints:
The analysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal testing. Summary statistics at scheduled visits using OC will be provided by each treatment group. Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate 
trends over time.
Analysis of safety data:
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance tests will 
be performed on safety data. These analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population, which is defined as all randomized patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of double -blind treatment, regardless of the amount of 
treatment administered. Patients will be analyzed for safety ana lyses 
according to the treatment actually received.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 18bThe Follow -up Visit will take place 4 weeks ± 5 days after the last dose of IMP. All attempts will be made to contact the patient to inquire about safety status .
cHeight will be measured only at Screening Visit.
dVital sign measurements (sitting blood pressure [BP ]and heart rate ): At theScreening Visit, BP will be measured on both arms to identify and select the appropriate arm for future measurements. Three separate 
seated BP and heart rate measurements shou ld be taken with at least 1 minute between readings, following a 5 -minute rest period and prior to phlebotomy. Assess ment for volume contraction and correct volume 
status ,if indicated ,will be done before randomization.
eThe abbreviated physical exam inatio n should focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas important for assessment of adverse events if necessary.
fThe SMBG is to be performed fasting (before first meal of the day) for at least 3 days in the week prior to each study visit. The SMBG should be performed in case of hypoglycemia symptoms ; any SMBG values 
≤70mg/dL (≤ 3.9mmol/L) should be documented in the diary and collected in the hypoglycemia event case report form ( CRF). The SMBG will be presented as equivalent SMPG .
gThe 12 -lead ECG should be performed after the patient has spent at least 10 minutes in supine position and prior to IMP administration . The ECG results will be evaluated as “normal” or “abnormal”.
hPlasma p ostprandial glucose will be assessed at Baseline Week 0 and Week 26, 2 hours after consuming a standard mixed liquid breakfast meal via an MMTT .
iVisit for ABPM for asubset of patients (180 patients ) will occur 1 week before the Randomization Visit; patients will return the ABPM device by mail after 24 -hour monito ring is complete. Patients will also have 
additional in-person visits for placement of the ABPM device onthe day before Week 12 and 26 visits. At least 70% recording of the expected BP recording is needed in each 24 -hour period. The measurement will 
be done on the nondominant upper arm .Patients who discontinue the IMP before the visit for ABPM will not continue in the ABPM substudy post-IMP discontinuation. Patients who receive rescue therapy but 
remain on IMP will continue on the ABPM substudy as planned .
jWith the exception of PPG, all laboratory assessments will occur prior to IMP administration on the day of the visit . All visit dates will be scheduled based on the date of randomization with a ±3- dayvisit window 
allowed during the core treatment perio d, except for Visits 7, 8A, 8, and 9, when a ±5 days visit window will apply .Laboratory tests are outlined in Table 2.
kThe FPG collection will be performed on the morning of visit.
lSerum pregnancy testing will be performed only at Screening and urine pregnancy testing is performed at subsequent visits . Serum pregnancy test results mus t be reviewed prior to beginning the Run -in Phase for 
allwomen of childbearing potential ( WOCBP, Appendix A). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed based on serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform additional te sts at their discretion or as 
required by local regulations. For women of nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle -stimulating hormone ( FSH)and/or estradiol levels should be tested if the definition of postmenopausal or prem enopausal 
cannot be satisfied, eg , no medical document of hysterectomy or cessation of m enses <12 months without an alternative medical cause .
mPlasma concentration samples (ie, of sotagliflozin and sotagliflozin -3-O-glucuronide) should be drawn with the other laboratory assessments . However, timing should be carefully recorded ;previous dose should be 
captured in the eCRF .Samples will be collected at pre dose and for Week26 an additional sample will be collected 3 hours postdose.
nHemodynamic markers including PRA, aldosterone, angiotensinogen 1, angiotensinogen 2,andglucagon will be checked to provide better characterization of hemodynamic markers in relation to sotagliflozin 
treatment .
oUrinalysis will include urine dipstick and microscopy. Dipstick will include assessment of specific gravity, pH, protein, blood, ketones , bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitri te, and leukocyte esterase. Microscopy will include , 
butnot be limited to, detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and crystals in centrifuged urine sediment. In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspic ious of urinary tract 
infection (UTI) , urine culture should be performed. Positive urine culture determination will be based upon the criteria of the reporting la boratory. Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point the 
Investigator sus pects the presence of a UTI.
pPatients will collect overnight urine on Week 0, 12, and 26 (Visits 3, 6 and 8) . In the night prior to the visits, the urine before sleep will be discarded and the urine during sleep and the first morning urine 
(after getting u p) will be collected. The visits should be rescheduled to allow for urine collection in case a patient missed it. Urinary alb umin, total protein, creatinine, calcium (adjusted for creatinine), phosphorus 
(adjusted for serum phosphorus and creatinine), magn esium (adjusted for serum magnesium and urinary creatinine), and glucose will be assessed.
sAll SAEs, AEs, AESI, and EOSI will be collected starting from signing informed consent and cont inue until the end of the study. All AEs that occur during treatment should be followed until study completion (or unt il 
patients leave the study) or until the event has resolved, the condition has stabilized or the patient is lost to fo llow-up.All patients will have a Follow- up visit 4 weeks ±5 days after the last dose of IMP to collect 
safety information.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 284 INTRODUCTION AND RA TIONA LE
4.1 BACKGROUND: SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium -glucose cotransporters T ype 1 and 2 (SGLT- 1 and 
2) being developed for use in T ype 2 diabetes (T2D ), a metabolic disorder characterized b y 
hypergl ycemia that results from a combination of increased insulin resist ance and beta -cell 
dysfunction ( 1). The microvascular complications of diabetes are well known and can result in 
impaired renal function, retinopathy ,and neuropathy . Other comorbidities that are frequently  
associated with diabetes are h ypertensi on, obesit y, and cardiovascular (CV ) disease (2). 
TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention released a report in 2010 stating that if current 
trends continue , 1 in 3 Americans will have diabetes by  the year 2050 (3). According to the most 
recent International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, the estimates in 2015 were that 1 in 
11adults have diabetes, which me ans 415 million people and is estimated to be 642 million by  
2040 ( 4).
According to the World Health Organization, there are about 60 million people with diabetes in 
the European Region, or about 10.3% of men and 9.6% of women aged 25 y ears and over (5). 
While these numbers include both people with T2D and T ype 1 diabetes (T1D ), over 90% of 
adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes is among the leading causes of death by  disease and is a 
leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney  disease, and amputation (4, 5).
The sodium -glucose cotransporter T ype 1 (SGLT1) is expressed predominantly  in the 
gastrointestinal (GI ) tract; SGL T1 is responsible for the majority  of glucose absorption by  the 
small intestine (6). Inhibition of SGL T1 in the GI tract delay sglucose from being absorbed. 
Additionally , there is accumulating evidence that SGL T1 inhibition stimul ates secretion of 
glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GL P-1) and peptide YY (PYY ),gut hormones that are involved in 
pancreatic beta- cell function and appetite c ontrol, respectivel y. Reduced glucose absorption in the 
proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally , which allows L  cells in both the 
ileum and the colon to sense glucose and its b yproducts, and as a result, they secrete GLP -1 and 
PYY . Although a complete lack of functional SGLT1 may  be associated with sy mptoms of 
glucose and galactose malabsorption ( 7), pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin has 
not produced these effects in preclinical models or in patients with T2D. Selective inhibitors of 
the SGL T1 transporter are in earl y stages of development.
Extensive clinical studies conducted for selective sodium -glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2 ) 
inhibitors have established this class as effective agents for the treatment of T2D (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 
13)and have led to approvals by  the United States ( US)Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) 
and the European Medicines Agency . Studies with sotagliflozin, a potent, dual inhibitor of SGL T2 
and SGL T1, have shown that this agent produces significant glucosuria in preclinical animal 
models, healthy  human volunteers, and patients with T2D. Single -and multiple -dose 
administration of sotagliflozin to healthy  human patients has resulted in dose -dependent increases 
in glucosuria. Multiple -dose (28-day) administration in diabetic patients produced improvements 
in several metabolic parameters, including urinary glucose excretion (UGE ), fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG ), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ), GLP -1, and PYY (14). These data suggest that 
sotagliflozin should be of therapeutic benefit to patien tswith T2D.

EFC14867 -sotagliflozin Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 29In Stud y LX4211.1 -202- DM, patients with sy stolic blood pressure (SBP ) ≥130 mmHg at Baseline
had reduction in SBP after 12 weeks of treatment with sotagliflozin (15). The reduction noted in
patients with Baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg (a target based on guidelines for management of blood 
pressure ( BP)in diabetic patients and used b y several SGLT2 inhibitors) was 1, 3, 10, 16, and 
17mmHg , respectivel y,in placebo, 75 mgonce daily , 200 mg once daily, 400 mgonce daily , and 
200mgtwice daily of sotagliflozin. Similar to other parameters, the sotagliflozin 400- mgdaily  
dose has optimal effect on the SBP reduction.
Empagliflozin is shown to reduce BP and HbA1c. Patients (N = 825) with T2D and mean seated 
SBP of 130 to 159mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP ) of 80 to 99mmHg were 
randomized (doub le-blind) to 10 mgor 25 mgempagliflozin or placebo once dail y for 12 weeks . 
At Week 12, adjusted mean difference versus placebo in change from Baseline in mean 24 -hour
SBP (ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring [ABPM ]) was -3.44 mmHg (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: -4.78, - 2.09) with 10 mgempagliflozin and -4.16 mmHg (95% CI : -5.50, -2.83) with 25 mg
empagliflozin (both p < 0.001). At Week 12, adjusted mean difference versus placebo in change 
from Baseline in mean 24 -hour DBP (ABPM) was -1.36 mmHg (95% CI : -2.15, - 0.56) with 
10mgempagliflozin and -1.72 mmHg (95% CI - 2.51, -0.93) with 25 mgempagliflozin 
(both p <0.001). Changes in office BP were consistent with ABPM. Adjusted mean difference 
versus placebo in change from Baseline toWeek 12 in HbA1c was -0.62% (95% CI : -0.72, - 0.52) 
(-6.8 mmol/mol [95% CI: -7.9, - 5.7]) with 10 mgempagliflozin and -0.65% 
(95% CI: -0.75, - 0.55) ( -7.1mmol/mol [95% CI: -8.2, - 6.0]) with 25 mgempagliflozin (both 
p <0.001) ( 13).
Based on the glucose -lowering and BP -lowering effects of sotagliflozin and empagliflozin, the 
purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effects of sotagliflozin (a SGLT1/2 inhibitor) compared with 
empagliflozin (a SGL T2 inhibito r) and placebo. In addition, patients in this study  will be taking 
concomitant dipeptidy l peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4[i] ), which will enable the investigation of the 
increase in medium chain fa tty acid and sodium excretion in patients treated with sotagliflozin 
compared with patients treated with empagliflozin.
4.2 CLINICA L TRI ALS OF SOTA GLIFLOZIN IN HUMA NS
Approximately  840 subjects (698 assigned to sotagliflozin and 229 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety  concerns have 
been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and s otagliflozin has been well -tolerated in all 
studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAE s) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) 
have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and comparator groups. Reports 
of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs ) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available 
were generally  balanced between treatment and comparator groups. The most frequentl y reported 
TEAEs ( ≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and upper respiratory  
tract infection, all of which were reported at a greater frequency  with sotagliflozin than with 
placebo. However, most were described as mild to moderate, and most resolved spontaneously  
and without discontinuation of the study  drug.
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no safet y issues in addition to those alread y descri bed in 
the current Investigator ’sBrochure (IB ) have been observed. In general, no significant imbalances 
of SAE/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparators were observed in completed studies.

EFC14867 -sotagliflozin Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 30Cumulat ively , across the completed studies 8 SAEs were reported in 6 patients (4 patients with 
T2D and 2 patients with T1D), all of which were assessed as unrelated to study  drug; those 
reported in 4 patients with T2D who received sotagliflozin included pulmonary embolism, deep 
vein thrombosis, bile duct stone, cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a my ocardial 
infarction (MI ) was experienced by  a patient receiving placebo. Two SAEs of diabetic 
ketoacido sis (DKA ) were reported in 2 patients with T1D receiving 400 mgonce dail y 
sotagliflozin in the Phase 2 T1D study  LX4211.1 -203- TIDM(16); both SAEs were assessed as 
due to failure of insulin delivery  via insulin pump.
Study  LX4211.1-114- NRM, a drug interaction study  with digoxin, a sensitive P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp) substrate, indicated that sotagliflozin ac ts as a weak P -gp inhibitor . Thus , sotagliflozin 
increases sy stemic exposure of digoxin and other substrates of P -gp(17).
The efficacy  of sotagliflozin has been shown in other studies in T2D patients. Study  
LX4211.1 -202-DM, which was also described in Section 4.1, was a Phase 2, multicenter, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , parallel- group stud y evaluating the safet y and 
efficacy  of sotagliflozin in combination with metformin in patients with T2D who had inadequate 
glycemic control on metformin monotherap y (N = 299) ( 15). The primary  objective of this 
dose-ranging stud y was to evaluate the change from B aseline to Week 12 in HbA1c of 4 different 
dosing regimens of sotagliflozin (75 mgonce daily , 200 mgonce daily , 400 mgonce daily , and 
200mgtwice daily  given as tablets) versus placebo in combination with metformin. Prespecified 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints were proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c value of <7 .0% at 
Week 12, change from Baseline in FPG and 3 -hour oral glucose tolerance test, and changes from 
Baseline in bod y weight, BP , and trigly cerides. Sotagliflozin reduced mean HbA 1c from Baseline
to Week 12 to a statistically  and clinically  significant degree for all four dose regimens compared 
to placebo (p = 0.025, p = 0.018, p <0.001, and p <0.001), respectivel y. The arithmetic mean 
change from Baseline in HbA1c was greatest for the 400 mgonce daily group ( -0.92%), followed 
by the 200 mgtwice daily group ( -0.80%). The least squares ( LS)mean difference from placebo 
was also greatest for the 400 mgonce daily group ( -0.79%; p <0.001), followed b y the 200 mg
twice dail ygroup ( -0.61%; p <0.001). The LS mean differences from placebo were similar for the 
200mgonce daily group ( -0.34%) and the 75 mgonce dail ygroup ( -0.33%) .
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
IB.
4.3 RATIONA LE FOR SELECTION OF DOSE
The proposed 400 mgonce daily dosage is based on the results of the Phase 2b study  
LX4211.1 -202- DM(15). In this study ,dosages of 75 mgonce daily, 200 mgonce daily, 200 mg
twice da ily, and 400 mgonce dail ysotagliflozin were tested over a 12- week, double -blind period. 
The 400 mgonce daily dosage was chosen for further evaluation based on its HbA1c lowering 
effect and the overall safety  and tolerabilit y observed at this dose. At 12 weeks, the 400 mgonce 
daily dosage lowered HbA1c by  a mean of 0.92%, while placebo lowered HbA1c b y a mean of 
0.09%. L ower doses were less effective than the 400- mgdose and did not have an y advantages in 
safet y or tolerability. The overall incidence of AEs at the 400mgonce daily dosage was similar to 
placebo. In addition for this active controlled trial, it is appropriate to compare the projected 
maximum dose for sotagliflozin versus the approved maximum dose for the comparator
(empagliflozin) (12).

EFC14867 -sotagliflozin Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 31In Stud y LX4211. 202, patients with SBP ≥130 mmHg at Baseline had a reduction in SBP after 
12weeks of treatment with sotagliflozin ( 15). The reduction noted in patientswith Baseline
SBP ≥130 mmHg was 1, 3, 10, 16 ,and 17 mmHg ,respectivel y,in placebo, sotagliflozin 75 mg
once dail y, sotagliflozin 200 mgonce daily, sotagliflozin 400mgonce daily , and sotagliflozin 
200mgtwice daily . Similar to other parameters, the sotagliflozin 400mgdaily  dose has optimal 
effect on the SBP reduction.
From a safet y perspective, sotagliflozin was well tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects,
sotagliflozin was well tolerated following single doses up to 2 000mg, and in mult iple doses up to 
800mgover 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT study , single doses of sotagliflozin (800 mg
and 2000 mg) were well tolerated and did not prolong the QT interval. Additionally , evaluation of 
metabolites in urine and plasma of health y subjects resulted in no safet y concerns following single 
doses of 400 mgsotagliflozin. I npatients with T2D, single doses of 400 mgin combination with 
sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to 400 mgin combination with metformin over 12 weeks were 
also well t olerated. Additional details on these studies are available in the IB.
4.4 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN A ND CONTROL GROUPS
This study  is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  in lowering HbA1c, lowering BP and safet y of 
sotagliflozin when used as add- on therapy  inpatients with T2D who have inadequate gl ycemic 
control . Based on the study  design, the protocol stipulates that patients be provided antidiabetic 
agent rescue therap y according to a predefined algorithm. Safet y, tolerability , pharmacokinetic 
(PK),and pharmacod ynamic effects of sotagliflozin are supported b y Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies 
and animal toxicology  data in rats up to 26 weeks and dogs up to 39 weeks as well as 2- year 
carcinogenicit y data in rats.
The study  will be a double -blind design. There will be 3 arms in this study : placebo, 
empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The control group will be treated with the maximum tolerated 
dose of empagliflozin (SGL T2 inhibitor) or placebo ,and the double -blind de sign willallow for an 
unbiased assessment of treatment effects and safety data. Bias will be minimized by  randomizing 
the patients to treatment groups; blinding the patients, the Investigators, the Sponsor, and the 
service provider to the treatment alloca tions; and by  adjudicating the endpoints in a blinded 
fashion. A placebo arm was included to support the primary  objective of demonstrating benefit of 
sotagliflozin as add -on therapy  to patients inadequately  controlled on a DPP4(i) with or without 
metformi n.
A parallel -group, randomized ,controlled design was selected because trial participants are 
exposed to a single treatment and assignment to that treatment is based solely  on chance . This 
design is free of the limitations of competing designs such as cro ssover in which there may  be a 
carryover of effect from one treatment to the second treatment . Although this carry over effect can 
be minimized with a washout period, it is possible that some longer -term effects may  persist . 
While the sample size of the par allel-group design is larger to account for more variabilit y when 
participants cannot serve as their own control, the above mentioned limitations of the crossover 
design have led the randomized controlled trial design to be the standard for therapeutic confirmatory  trials for regulatory approval such as this trial.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 324.5 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTA GLIFLOZIN
Sotagliflozin is currently  being investigated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with T2D. The program will also provide effica cy and safet y data for 
sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetic medications. The use of sotagliflozin in the 
treatment of T1D is also being studied in a separate development program.
Sotagliflozin may  benefit a wide variet y of diabetic patients based on multiple potential beneficial 
effects of dual SGLT2/SGL T1 inhibition, and its insulin- independent mechanism of action. 
Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial glucose (PPG ) were observe d with sotagliflozin 
in multiple studies. As anticipated from the mechanism of action, treatment with sotagliflozin 
resulted in increased UGE (from inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased incretin levels (from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the impro vements in body  weight, BP, and trigl ycerides
observed with sotagliflozin treatment have the potential to benefit patients with diabetes through 
their effects on common diabetic comorbidities.
Overall, sotagliflozin has been well tolerated in all studies t o date, with the majority of events 
assessed as mild to moderate; most of which resolved spontaneousl y. Serious AEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs have been limited and balanced between treatment and comparator 
groups. Based on an evaluation of the cumulative safet y data for the sotagliflozin clinical 
program, genital infections are monitored closely as an important identified risk. However, reports 
of these events have been infrequent and have responded to standard treatment.
The improvement in gly cemic c ontrol, the reductions in weight and BP, and the tolerability  and 
safet y profile of sotagliflozin to date, demonstrate a favorable benefit -risk assessment for 
sotagliflozin.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This study  is a Phase 3, multicenter and multinational, 2:2:1 randomized, double -blind
(single -blind Run- in Phase ), placebo -and active -controlled, double -dummy, parallel -group study  
that is anticipated to enroll approximatel y 700patients.
The study  comprises a n up to 4-week Screening Period (consisting of a Screening Phase of up to 
2weeks and a 2- week single -blind placebo Run -in Phase ), a 26-week Double -blind Treatment 
Phase ,and a 4 -week post -treatment Follow -up visit. To qualify for randomization, patients must 
demonstrate compliance based upon tablet and capsule count (≥80%) during the Run-in Phase .
The study  design is presented graphically in Section 1.1.
6.1.1 Screening Period
6.1.1.1 Screening Phase
The Screening Phase will last up to 2 weeks . It must be long enough to collect the data required to 
establish whether the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Patients with T2D who have inadequate gl ycemic control on DPP4(i) with or without metformin 
for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening are eligible for en rollment in this study .To ensure an 
approximately  equal number of patients have Screening SBP <130 mmHg or SBP ≥130 mmHg, 
the number of patients enrolled in each category  will be limited to 60% of all patients 
(≤420 patients).
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1) after signing the informed consent form (ICF ), eligibility  criteria 
will be assessed and Screening assessments will be performed.The Interactive Response Technology  (IRT; either I nteractive Voice Response Sy stem or 
Interactive Web Respons e System) will be contacted at Visit 1 for notification of Screening and 
for patient number allocation.
6.1.1.2 Single -blind Placebo Run -in Phase
The Run-in Phase will last 2 weeks. Patients will be treated in a single- blind manner with placebo 
(identical to sotag liflozin 200 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg in appearance) administered once 
daily  during the Run- in Phase, starting from Visit 2, to assess patients’ compliance to the study  
medication.During the Run-inPhase , patients will receive a glucose meter and study  diary . Patients will be 
trained to perform blood glucose measurements and complete the stud y diary correctly .

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 366.1.2 Double -blind Treatment Period
Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 3). To qualify  for randomization, patients
must also demonstr ate compliance during the single- blind placebo Run -in Phase based upon tablet 
and capsule count (≥80%) and, as assessed, at the Investigator’s discretion.
Randomization will be stratified b y:
HbA 1c at Screening ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%)
SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg , ≥130 mmHg )
Metformin useat Screening (Yes, No).
Following randomization, patients will be treated in a double-blind manner for 26 weeks. 
Approximately  700 patients will be randomly  assigned 2:2:1 to the following 3 treatment groups 
on top of DPP4(i) with or without metformin:
Sotagliflozin arm (estimated N = 280) : sotagliflozin 400 mg, given as two (2) 200 mg
tablets and one (1) placebo capsule (identical to empagliflozin capsule), once dail y before 
the first meal of the day
Empagliflozin arm (estimated N = 280) : placebo, given as two (2) placebo tablets 
(identical to sotagliflozin in appearance) and one capsule of empagliflozin 25 mg, once 
daily  before the first meal of the day
Placebo arm(estimated N = 140) : placebo, given as two (2) placebo tablets (iden tical to 
sotagliflozin) and one placebo capsule (identical to empagliflozin) , once daily  before the 
first meal of the day .
The doses of the OADs (DPP4[i] ) and/or metformin should be held constant throughout the entire 
26-week double -blind Treatment Period (ie, not changed except for safet y reasons) , and the dose 
of all antihy pertensive medications should be held constant for t he first 12 weeks except for safety  
reasons.
6.1.3 Ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring substudy
In several preselected study  sites, approx imately  180 patients will participate in a substudy  of 
ABPM to further assess BP changes over time. In sites participating in the ABPM substudy , 
patients must consent to conducting ABPM to participate in this study  until the plan ned number of 
subset patien ts has been reached ( sites will be informed).
Baseline ABPM will be measured starting at an additional study  visit 1week before 
Randomization (Visit 3A). P ostrandomization ABPM will take place at 2 additional in -person 
study  visits 1 day prior to the Week 12 (Visit 6A ) and Week 26 (Visit 8A) visits. The details of 
the ABPM substudy  procedures are provided in Appendix B .

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 448.2.1 Background medications
Patients will be enrolled with a background therapy consisting of their existing DPP4(i) treatment 
and metformin treatment (for patients on metformin at Screen ing). Background metformin and 
DPP4(i) are considered to be NIMPs.
Metformin (commercial formulation) will be administered orally according to the I nvestigator’s 
recommendation and the locally  approved label. The metformin dose must be ≥1500 mgper day  
(or maximum tolerated dose [documented]). The dose of metformin must be stable for at least 
12 weeks before Screening. The metformin dose should remain unchanged during the 26-week 
treatment period unless down-titration or discontinuat ion is required for safety  reasons , or the 
patient ’srequirement for rescue medication .
TheDPP4(i) will be administered orall y at the appropriate dose per local label. The dose of 
DPP4(i) must be stable for at least 12 weeks before the Screening Visit and should r emain 
unchanged during the 26-week treatment period unless as needed for safet y reason s, or the 
patient ’srequirement for rescue medication .
Metformin and DPP4(i) treatment will be reported in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).This 
information should include specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency .
The cost of the background treatment metformin and DPP4(i) not covered by health insurance will 
be reimburse d where permitted by  local regulations.
Rescue therapies (see Section 8.2.2) will also be considered as NIMPs.
8.2.2 Rescue therapy
The threshold values for rescue are defined as follows, depending on the study  period:
From Baseline Visit (Visit 3, Day 1) to Visit 5 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 5): 
FPG >270 mg/dL (>15.0 mmol/L )
From Visit 5 (Week 8) to Visit 6 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 6): FPG >240 mg/dL 
(>13.3 mmol/L )
From Visit 6 (W eek12) up to the end of the treatment period Visit 8 (Week 26): FPG 
>200 mg/d L (>11.1 mmol/L ) or HbA1c ≥8.5%. 
Note: The 8.5% criteri ondoes not apply  if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was 
≥1.0%) .
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12 and 
onwards) are set up to ensure that gly cemic parameter re sults remai n within predefined thresholds.
If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific gly cemic limit on 1 day , the patient will 
check it again during the 2 following days. If all the values in 3 consecutive daysexceed 
the specific limit, the patient s hould contact the Investigator and a central laboratory  FPG 
measurement (and HbA1c after Week 12 and onwards) will be performed as soon as 
possible, preferabl y within 7 daysto confirm the hy pergly cemia.

In the e vent that a confirmatory  FPG and/or HbA1c exceed the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that:
The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food and drink [with the 
exception of water] intake for ≥8 hours )
IMP is given at the planned dose
There is no intercurrent disease, which may  jeopardize gly cemic control (eg, infectious 
disease)
Compliance to treatment is appropriate
Compliance to diet and li festy le is appropriate.
If any of the above can reasonabl y explain insufficient gl ycemic control, the I nvestigator should 
consider not initiating rescue medication and should undertake appropriate action, ie:
Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8- hours fast)
Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the eCRF and the medical record)
Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment
Organize a specific in terview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified 
nutrition professional and to reinforce on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and 
lifesty le recommendations, and schedule a FPG/HbA1c a ssessment at the next visit 
(incase the ne xt visit is a phone call, it should be replaced by  an on -site visit).
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication may  be introduced:
Sulfony lurea ( eg, glimepiride) should be added first, unless there is a contraindication to 
sulfony lurea treatment per label. In case of contraindication to sulfony lurea, another 
rescue medication (oral or injectable) can be added at the Investigator’s decision except 
for SGLT2 inhibitors
The patient continues the study  treatment (blinded) and stay s in the study  to collect 
efficacy  and safet y information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the 
last scheduled visit
Rescue therap y is considered a NIMP. Re scue the rapy is to be reported in the e CRF. This 
information should include specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and 
frequency .
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of rescue therap y will be reimbursed where permitted 
by local regulations.

8.3.1 Methods of blinding
To maintain blinding sotagliflozin, empagliflozin, and their matching placebo tablets (including 
packaging) will be blinded and indistinguishable.
During the double -blind treatment period, each treatment packag e will be labeled with a number, 
which is generated b y a computer program from Sanofi . Investigators will not have access to the 
randomization (treatment) code except under circumstances described in Section 8.3.2.
The randomization and the treatment allocation will be performed centrally by  an IRT. The stud y 
biostatistician provides the randomization scheme to the I RT. Then, the IRT generates the patient 
randomization list from which it alloca tes treatment arms to the patient s.
To prevent partial unblinding, results of laboratory assessments of HbA1c, FPG, PPG ,UGE , and 
UGCR will be masked to study  centers and patient safter randomization and until study  end. 
Additionally  urinal ysis by  dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. Urine 
glucose, albumin, calcium, and creatinine will be measured separately at Visit 3, 6, and 8by the 
central laboratory .
The CEC members will perform adjudication in a blinded manner.
8.3.2 Randomization cod e breaking during the study
In case of an AE, the randomization code should only  be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient.
Code breaking can be performed at an y time b y using the proper module of the I RT and /or b y 
calling an y other phone number provided b y the Sponsor for that purpose. Code breaking can be 
performed b y a local study Investigator, sponsor phy sician, or healthcare professional with direct 
responsibility  for patient care. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, 
time of day  and reason for code breaking. The identity  of the unblinded personnel, how the code 
was broken, and the treatment kit number should also be recorded. The Sponsor should also be 
informed. If the code i s broken by  the Investigator (or other medical doctor in emergency  
situation); the patient must be withdrawn from IMP administration.
Randomization code breaking will also be performed during the analy sis of the Pharmacokinetic
plasma concentration samples . Only  the Project manager and lead scientist at the Bioanal ytical 
laboratory  will have access to the randomization code to allow for the sorting of the sotagliflozin 
plasma samples. The Bioanal ytical lab oratory and responsible personnel will follow standa rd 
operating procedures to ensure the protection of the blind within the Sponsor’s clinical team. The randomization code or the individual anal ytical results will not be disclosed to any  clinical team 
personnel prior to the database lock.

Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, policies, and 
procedures.
Control of I MP st orage conditions, especially  control of temperature and instructions for handling 
the compounds should be managed according to the rules provided b y the Sponsor.
The expiry  date and storage conditions are written on the I MP labels. The IMP s should be stored 
between +15ºC and +30ºC (59ºF and 86ºF).
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securel y maintained 
as specified b y the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility  to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained.
Any quality  issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP ( deficiency  in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc.) must be promptly  notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may  be reco rded through a complaint procedure.
A potential defect in the quality  of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by  the 
Sponsor. In this case, the I nvestigator will be responsible for promptly  addressing any  request 
made b y the Sponsor, to r ecall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards.
Under no circumstances will the I nvestigator supply  IMP to a third part y allow the IMP to be used 
other than as directed b y this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any  other manner.
8.7.1 Treatment accoun tability  and compliance
Accounting and compliance for IMPs will be performed at Visit 3 (Treatment Day 1) and all 
subsequent on -treatment visits.
The Investigator will check the compliance to the study  treatments based on the patient diary  and 
will complete the appropriate site treatment and patient treatment log forms. Returned IMP should 
be counted b y site staff. In addition, the dosing information will be recorded on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF.
Rescue therap y (Section8.2.2) is to be reported in the eCRF. This information should include 
specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency .

mentored. If suboptimal compliance continues after training and mentoring, patients may be 
discontinued at the discretion of the I nvestigator after discussion with the Sponsor’s/CRO’s 
medical monitor.
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments
Patients are to return all IMP (unused, in- use,or empty  wallet[s]) at each on- site visit, or at on- site 
visits after premature treatment discontinuation, as described in Section 1.2.
Patients a re to return all the used, in -use and unused IMP at Visit 8(or final assessment 
on-treatment visit in case of permanent premature discontinuation).
All used, partially  used or unused IMPs will be retrieved b y the Sponsor or delegate. A detailed 
sitelogand patient treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the I nvestigator 
(orthe pharmacist) and countersigned by  the Investigator and the monitoring team.
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor (ie, rescue therap y), tracking and reconciliation is to be 
undertaken b y the Investigator (or pharmacist if appropriate) according to the system proposed b y 
the CRO.
8.8 CONCOMITA NT MEDICATION
A concomitant medication is any  treatment received by  the patient concomitantly  to an y IMP. 
TheIMP includes sotagli flozin 400 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, and placebo.
All concomitant medications should be documented on the Medications pages of the eCRF. This 
includes all NIMP treatments that are taken b y the patient sat an y time during the clinical study, 
beginning at Vis it1.
Additionally , all medications taken in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 and any  prior use of SGLT2
inhibitor should be reported.
8.8.1 Prohibited prior and concomitant medications
During the study  treatment period, the following medications are prohibited:
Initiation of any  antidiabetic agents, including oral or injectable antihy pergly cemic agents 
other than the IMP is not allowed before the rescue therap y. The existing background 
medication (NIMP) should not be modified before the rescue
Note :Short term use (<10 consecutive days) of the prohibited medication, eg, short- acting insulin 
for treatment of acute illness or surgery ,is allowed
Systemic use of glucocorticoids is not allowed for more than 10 consecutive dayswithin 
90daysprior to the Screening Visit .

Modification of antih ypertensive medication before Week 12 is not al lowed unless for 
safety reasons
Use of investigational medication in any  other clinical study
Initiation of an y weight loss dr ugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat)
Patients taking sotagliflozin with concomitant digo xin should have digoxin concentrations 
monitored and doses reduced as needed. In addition, other P -gp substrates may  be affected 
and the labels of P -gp substrate drugs should be consulted with regards to monitoring and 
dose adjustments.
Other medications w hich are unlikel y to interfere with the PKs or pharmacody namics of the IMP 
or confound interpretation of the study  endpoints are allowed as needed, following discussion 
between the Investigator and the Sponsor/CRO . However, doses of chronically  administere d 
medicines should be kept fixed during the trial if at all possible.
The dose of all antihy pertensive agents should be kept constant during the 12 weeks following 
randomization and no antihy pertensive agents should be added or withdrawn for the 12 weeks
following randomization unless it is considered necessary  for safet y reasons.
8.9 POSTSTUDY TREA TMENT
Because sotagliflozin may reduce BP, adjustment of antihy pertensive medication may  be needed 
during the stud y inpatients with hy pertension. Conversel y, monito ring for an increase in BP 
should be performed after withdrawal of study  medication. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal 
of study  treatment, the Investigator should consider adding or adjusting antihy pertensive 
medication.Sotagliflozin will not be prov ided after End of Treatment ( EOT) . Patient’s further treatment, for 
diabetes and other pathologies , will be at the Investigator’s discretion based on his/her clinical 
judgment .

9.1.4 Assessment methods of efficacy  endpoints
9.1.4.1 Hemoglobin A1c
Hemoglobin A1c will be assessed at Screening ( Visit 1), Baseline ( Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 5), 
Week 12 (Visit 6), and Week 26 (Visit 8), measured b y a certified Level I “National 
Glycohemoglobin Standar dization Program” central laboratory .
9.1.4.2 Blood pressure
Blood pressure is measured as part of the vital signs assessment that is performed at allstudy  
visits, except for ABPM substudy  visits, for both safet y and efficacy endpoints. At Screen ing, BP
will be m easured on both arms to identify  and select the appropriate arm for future measurements. 
Full details and directions for the measurement of BP and heart rate (HR )arepresented in 
Appendix E . The investigator will assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if 
indicated before randomization.
9.1.4.3 Postprandial glucose via MMTT
Postprandial glucose will be assessed at Baseline ( Visit 3, Week 0) and at Visit 8 (Wee k26) via 
MMTT toallow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26 in 2- hour PPG following a mixed 
meal. For the efficacy  assessments of the study , PPG will be measured at a central laboratory .Full 
details of the MMTT procedure at Baseline and Week 26 are presented in Appendix C . At 
Baseline (Visit 3) and Visit 8 (Week 26), PPG will be assessed b y MMTT at Baseline (fasting) 
and 2 hours after consuming a standard mixed liquid breakfast meal.
The first dose of double -blind I MP (and dosing with DPP4[i] and metformin, if applicable) on 
Day 1 (Visit 3) will be given after collection of the 2- hour PPG sample is completed.
For the Week 26 (Visit 8) standardized MMTT, the patient should take the dose of double -blind 
IMP immediatel y after the fasting blood samples are obtained, and approximately 30 minutes 
before ingestion of the standardized mixed meal begins. At Week 26, DPP4(i) and metformin (if 
applicable) dosing will occur after collection of the 2 -hour PPG sample and 3 -hour PK sample is 
completed .
Plasma concentration samples at Week 26 (Visit 8) should be taken at the same time as the fasting 
blood sample and 3 hours postdose (30minutes after the 2- hour PPG sample collection; 
seeSection 9.3.1.1).
The composition and the quantity  of the standard mixed liquid breakfast meal must be identical

participate in the MMTT. Any patient who requires the addition of rescue medication prior to 
Week 26 should still have the standardized MMTT performed as scheduled.
In case of permanent discontinuation of the treatment with I MP before Week 26, every  effort will 
be made to have the patient return to the site at the time of their Week 26 visit; however ,the 
MMTT should not be performed at these or an y other visit following a Premature EOT visit.
On the day s of the MMTT, patients will come to the investigational site in the morning, in fasted
conditions for at least 8 hours and must not eat any food or drink, except water, before the 
scheduled standardized meal test.
The exact times of the IMP administration, standard mixed liquid breakfast meal intake, and the 
blood draws are to be documented.
9.1.4.4 Fasting plasma glucose
Fasting plasma glucose will be assessed at all study  visits except at the Run-in Phase Visit 
(Week -2, Visit 2),the Follow -up Visit (Week 30, Visit 9), and ABPM substudy  visits. Fasting is 
defined as no food and drink (with the exception of water) intake for ≥8 hours. The FPG 
assessment is performed on the morning of the visit. For the efficacy assessments of the study , 
FPG is measured at a central laboratory .
9.1.4.5 Body weight
Body weight is measured at every stud y visit. Body  weight should be obtained w ith the patient 
wearing undergarments or very  light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty  bladder. The same 
scale should be used throughout the stud y, and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended b y 
the manufacturer. Calibration should be documented in source documents. The use of balance 
scales is recommended; if digital scales are used, testing with standard weights is of particular 
importance. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or 
covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced with both weights at zero and the 
balance bar aligned. The patient should stand in the center of the platform, as standing off -center 
may affect measurement. The weights are moved until the beam balances (the arr ows are aligned). 
The weight is read and recorded in the e CRF and source data. Self -reported weights are not 
acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves.
9.1.4.6 Kidney function parameters
Serum creatinine will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1),Base line (Visit 3),Week 4 (Visit 4),
Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 26 (Visit 8), and the Follow -up Visit (Visit 9). H ome-collected urine 
albumin, total protein, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and glucose will be assessed 
at Baseline ( Visit 3), Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 26 (Visit 8), and the Follow -up Visit (Visit 9)
(Section 1.2). Details of urine collection and analy sis are provided in Section 9.2.1.4.

double -blind Treatment Period. Routine alerts on FPG and/or HbA1c will be sent to the 
Investigator from the central laboratory  to ensure that gl ycemic parameter results remain within 
predefined thresholds. For details and further actions should FPG values fall above thresholds, 
refer to Section 8.2.2.
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS
Assessments for safet y include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, ECG, weight, and vital signs. An independent DMC will meet on a regular basis to review accumulating clinical trial safety  data by treatment.
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE ,and other selected CV events, selected renal events, bone 
fracture, and DKA will be performed in a blinded manner b y a CEC. Further details are available 
in Section 6.4.3 and in the CEC Charter.
Two expert committees will review all potentia l cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a 
treatment -blinded manner.
The following safet y endpoints will be assessed throughout the 26- week double -blind Treatment 
Period :
Adverse e vents, h ypogl ycemia ( all, severe, and /ordocumented s ymptomatic 
hypoglycemia ), events of special interest ( EOSI ), adverse events of special interest 
(AESI ), AEs leading to discontinuation from the IMP, SAEs, and deaths
Acute renal failure (seeSection 9.1.4.6)
Clinical laboratory  result s, (including fasting lipids; see Section 9.2.1.3), vital signs, and 
ECG results.
Observation period of safety endpoints
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments:
The pretreatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first dose of double- blind I MP
The on-treatment period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of double -blind I MP up to 10 days(1 day  for hy pogly cemia) after the last dose of 
double -blind I MP, regardless of the introduction of rescue therapy . The 10- day interval is 
chosen based on the half -life of the IMP (approximately  5 times the half -life of 
sotagliflozin) in patients with moderate renal dy sfunction .
The post -treatment period is defined as the time starting 11 daysafter the last dose of 
double -blind I MP (after the on- treatment period).

Hypoglycemia events ( all, severe, and /ordocumented sy mptomatic hy pogly cemia ) will be 
assessed starting with signing of the ICF until 4 weeks after the last dose of I MP ( Note:For 
patients who discontinue treatment bef ore Week 26, safet y data will be collected until scheduled 
study  end). Patients will also complete the patient diary , which will be regularly  reviewed by  
Investigators. See Section 10.6.1 for further details.
9.2.1.3 Laboratory safety variables
The clinical laboratory  data consist of blood anal ysis (including clinical chemistry , hematology  
amylase,lipase, fasting lipid profile , and additional evaluations ) and urinalysis, according to the 
schedule presented in Section 1.2. Clinical laboratory  values will be evaluated after conversion 
into standard international units. I nternational units will be used in all listings and tables. Table 2
lists the blood safety  parameters to be assessed by the central laboratory .Urinaly sis parameters 
are presented in Section 9.2.1.4.
In addition, for WOCBP ,a serum pregnancy  test is performed at Screening (Visit 1, Week -4) and 
urine pregnancy  tests are taken at all visits during the double -blind Treatment Period (there is no 
pregnancy  testing at the Run -in Phase Visit (Visit 2, Week -2). Any positive urine test result must 
be confirmed b y a serum pregnancy  test. The Investigator may  perform additional pregnancy tests 
at their discretion or as required b y local regulations.
For women of nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH ) 
and/orestradiol levels should be tested if the definition of postmenopausal or premenopausal 
cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical document ation ofhysterectomy  or cessation of menses 
<12months without an alternative medical cause .

Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 26 (Vi sit8),and the Follow -up Visit (Visit 9). H ome-collected urine 
albumin, total protein, creatinine, calcium (adjusted for creatinine) , phosphorus (adjusted for 
serum phosphorus and creatinine) , magnesium (adjusted for serum magnesium and urinary  
creatinine ), and glucose will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3), Week 12 (Visit 6), and Week 26 
(Visit 8) (Section 1.2).
Patient s will collect home overnight urine samples during the night prior to Visits 3 (Week 0), 
6(Week 12) and 8 ( Week 26). The urine sample before the sleep will be discarded and all urine 
during sleep and the first urine after getting up the next morning will be collected. 
A central laboratory  will anal yze samples and estimate change from Baseline in UACR, UGE, 
UGCR, serum creatinine, and eGFR. To prevent partial unblinding, results of laboratory  
assessments of HbA1c, FPG, PPG, UGE, and UGCR will be masked to study  centers and patients 
after randomization and until study  end.
9.2.1.5 Vital signs and physical exam ination
Vital signs, including sitting BP and HR , will be assessed at all study  visits, except for ABPM 
substudy  visits, for safet y and efficacy endpoints . Full details and directions for the measurement 
of BP and HR are presented in Appendix E .
Physical examinations will be performed at every  study  visit.
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 8 (Week 26). 
Body weight measurements are discussed in Section 9.1.4.5. The complete phy sical examination 
will include recording height, body  weight, and vital signs. Height will be measured onl y at 
Screening Visit, for BMI calculations .
An abbreviated phy sical exam ination will be performed at the Run- in Phase Visit (Visit 2, 
Week - 2), at every  visit during the Double- blind Treatment Period except for Visit 8, and at the 
Follow -up or Premature EOT Visit (within 4 weeks of the last dose of IMP or after patient 
withdraws earl y from treatment). The abbreviated phy sical exam ination should focus on cardiac 
and respiratory  systems, as well as any  areas important for assessment of AEs, if necessary .

Twelve -lead ECG record ingwill be performed locally  at the Run -in Visit (Visit 2), and at 
Week 26 (Visit 8).
The 12-lead ECG should be performed after the patient has spent at least 10 minutes in supine 
position and prior to I MP administration. The Investigator should review the E CG trace and 
document the interpretation, sign and date the ECG print out, and report the interpretation in the 
eCRF. Each subsequent ECG trace will be analyzed in comparison tothe Screening ECG trace. 
All original ECG traces are retained as source data.
The ECG results will be evaluated as “normal” or “abnormal”.
Note: Any new ECG abnormality  should be rereviewed for confirmation and reported as 
appropriate for that finding.
9.2.1.7 Self -monitor edblood glucose
A meter for the self -assessment of blood glucose wil l be dispensed at the start of Run- in (Visit 2). 
Patients will receive a patient diary  at each visit except for the Follow -up Visit (Week 30)and 
ABPM substudy  visits. The patient will enter SMBG levels into this diary .The diary  will be 
collected and reviewed by  investigators and study  staff at each visit (except ABPM substudy  
visits).
Patients will be asked to self- assess blood glucose levels 3 times a week (at least 3 times in the 
week prior to a study  visit) from the Run -in Visit (Visit 2) through the e nd of the study  (Visit 9).
Patients will be requested to self -assess blood glucose levels in the fasted state and whenever they  
experience an y illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or s ymptoms of hy pergl ycemia or hypogl ycemia. 
Symptoms of hy poglycemia may  include sha kiness, dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale 
skin color, sudden moodiness or behavior changes (such as cry ing for no apparent reason), clumsy  
or jerk y movements, seizure, difficult y paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations 
around the mouth. Patients will be instructed to record the presence or absence of hy poglycemic 
episodes or h ypogl ycemic symptoms in the patient diary provided. Patients will also be instructed 
to record SMBG values that are ≤70mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L) in the patient diary . 
SMBG for h ypergl ycemia: patients should be instructed to contact the site if fasting SMBG values 
over 3 consecutive day s are:
>270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Baseline Visit (Visit 3, Day 1) to Visit 5 (Week 8) 
(including value at Visit 5)
>240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) from Visit 5 (Week 8) to Visit 6 (Week 12) (including value 
at Visit 6)
>200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) from Visit 6 (Week 12) to Visit 8 (Week 26) (including value

9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin
The PK endpoint for sotagliflozin is the plasma levels of sotagliflozin and 
sotagliflozin-3-O- glucuronide in the sotagliflozin treatment arms .
Pharmacokinetic sotagliflozin d ata may  be subjected to a population PK analy sis, which will be 
reported separatel y from the clinical study  report (CSR ).
9.3.1.1 Sampling time
At Weeks 4, 18, and 26(Visits 4, 7, and 8, respectively ), blood samples for PK assessment are to 
be drawn with the other laboratory  assessments, prior to administration of IMP. An additional 
blood sample will be drawn at Week 26 (Visit 8), 3 hours after administering the dose of IMP
(30minutes after the 2 -hour PPG sample collection ). The time of the last intake of study  drug 
prior to visits PK samples were taken should be recorded by  the patient in the patient diary . 
Patients should be reminded of this at visits preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the 
Premature EOT Visit, or at subsequent visits. See Table 3for identification of samples.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 62The concentration of HbA1c reflects the gl ycemic history  of the previous 120 daysand is thus an 
index of mean gl ycemia, documenting gl ycemic control over the past 2 to 3 months. 
Hemoglobin A1c has also been shown to correlate with the development of long -term 
complications of diabetes, and reduction of HbA1c is known to reduce the risk of long -term 
microvascular complications. Therefore, HbA1c is considered an appropriate primary  endpoint for 
assessing the effect of a treatment on glycemic control. The duration of study  treatment (26 weeks
for the primary  HbA1c endpoint) is considered to be sufficient for achieving stable conditions 
with I MP and for enabling an adequate assessment of time -dependent changes in HbA1c.
The problem of w eight gain in T2D is widely  recognized. More than 80% of individuals with T2D 
are overweight, man y at the time of diagnosis. Consequently , iatrogenic weight gain is not onl y 
unwelcome, but represents an important clinical issue that can become a barrier to the successful 
management of gl ycemic control. Therefore, in this study , assessing change in body  weight from 
Baseline to Week 26 is a secondary  endpoint.
Improvements in FPG have been observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. Therefore ,
assessment of FPG is relevant in this study . This parameter is also considered b y regulatory 
agencies to be supportive of efficacy  of an antidiabetic agent.
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may  reduce SBP by  10 to 15 mmHg inpatients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no significant effect in patients with SB P <130 mmHg , and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients. Since this could be of benefit to patients
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary  objective in this tri al, as well as the 
potential in patients with DBP >80 mmHg . Although effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed 
with the 400- mgdose at 12 weeks , the effects will be examined at Weeks 12 and26.
To further evaluate the diurnal effect of sotagliflozin on SBP compared with the comparator arms 
(placebo and empagliflozin) and to avoid the white- coat effect, a subset of patients (180 patients) 
similar to the full study  population in BP levels (ie, equal distribution in SBP <130 mmHg or 
≥130 mmHg) will be evalua ted by  ABPM.
Safet y anal yses focus on the TEAE sinclude occurrences with SAE, AESI , EOSI , AE leading to 
IMP discontinuation, and hy poglycemic events. Other standard safety  parameters such as vital 
signs, ECG and laboratory measurements will also be evaluat ed.The other efficacy  and safet y 
assessments in this study  are standard, well -established measurements for a Phase 3 study  
evaluating the treatment of T2D in adult participants.
The length of the stud y is considered appropriate for detection of the primar y endpoint given the 
power estimates (see Section 11).

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The visit schedule and procedures and assessments are listed in the Study  Flow Chart 
(Section 1.2). The aim of this section is to provide details on how some of the procedures and 
assessments should be performed.
This is an out -patient study  and consists of 9 on- site visits (a total of 12 on -site visits for patients 
participating in the ABPM substudy ).
The patient sneed to arrive at the stud y site in a fasting state for Visit 1 through Visit 8
(Week -4/Screening through Week 26/end of double -blind Treatment Period ), unless instructed 
otherwise b y the Investigator. Throughout the study , “fasting” is defined as ≥8 hours without 
food. Note: If the patient is not fasting at the visits specified above, the blood sample will not be 
collected and a new appointment should be given to the patient for the following day  if possible, 
with instruction to be fasted. O ther pr ocedures can be performed as sched uled. With the exception 
of PPG, a ll laboratory  assessments will occur prior to I MP administration on the day  of the visit.
The Run- in Visit (Visit 2) can be performed up to 2weeks after the Screening Visit and once the 
results of all Screening tests are available and the patient is confirmed to be eligible for 
participation in the study . The visit window sforthe Double -blind Treatment Period visits will be 
as follows: Visit 4through Visit 6should occur at the schedule ±3days; Visit 7 through Visit 8
should occur at the schedule ±5 days. For the Follow -up Visit (Visit 9), the visit window should 
occur within ±5 days, 4weeks after last dose of IMP.
If one visit date is changed, the next visit should occur according to t he original schedule, ie, 
calculated from the date of Baseline V isit (Visit 3, Week 0).
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for each study  visit please refer to the Study  Flow 
Chart ( Section 1.2), which details the procedures to be performed.
All data obtained during the study  visits are reviewed by  the Investigator and Sub -Investigators 
who are qualified in treatment of T2D and are trained on the study .

the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the 
Investigator has considered, according to his/her best medical judgment, thatthe occurrence of the 
concerned event was unlikely to be related to the IMP.
Since the IMP received is blinded, patients must return to the site and IRT will be contacted for 
IMP reinitiation.
It is in the interest of the patient to monitor their blood glucose during the temporar y 
discontinuation period, therefore regular determination of SMBG is to be performed and 
documented (see Section 9.2.1.7).
For all temporary  treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by  the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.
Temporary  treatment discontinuation decided by  the Investig ator corresponds to more than 1 dose 
not administered to the patient.Use of an y other anti hypergl ycemic medication during the time of temporary  treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospitalization) will be recorded as concomitant medication 
with the name and dose recorded in the eCRF.
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medici nal product(s)
Permanent treatment discontinuation isdefined as any  treatment discontinuation associated with 
the definitive decision from the I nvestigator or the patient not to re -expose the patient to the IMP 
at an y time.
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation
Patients may  withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they  decide to do so, at any  time ,and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. Patients should discuss 
stopping study  medication with the site be fore doing so , to allow for questions to be addressed, 
glycemic therap y to be adjusted, and a follow- up assessment to be arranged. All efforts should be 
made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation; this reason should be documented in the eCR F.
The following reasons can lead to permanent discontinuation:
At the patient’s own request (ie, withdrawal of consent for treatment)
If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the study  treatment 
would be detrimental to th e patient's well -being

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 7410.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study
Patients ma y withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at an y time 
and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from 
withdrawal of consent for follow- up visits. Patients will be told that t hey are free to withdraw 
from the study  at any  time without any  adverse effect on their care. However, if they no longer 
wish to take the IMP, they  will be encouraged to remain in the study  and attend the remaining 
study  visits. The value of all their stud y data collected during their continued involvement will be 
emphasized as important to the public health value of the study .
If possible, the patient s are assessed using the procedure normall y planned for the Week 26 (EOT)
visit.
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly  asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented. All confirmed study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens 
ofthe e CRF and in the patient’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented.
Forpatients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws consent for follow -up,the 
Investigator should make the best effort to recontact the patient (eg, contact patient’s famil y or 
private ph ysician, review available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts (3 p hone call attempts followed by  a 
certified letter) to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and 
dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).Patients who have withdrawn from the stud y cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events
10.4.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a p atient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with the I MP.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 7510.4.1.2 Serious adverse event
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death, or
Is life -threatening, or
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity , or
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect ; or
Is a medicall y important event .
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events t hat may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the p atient or may  require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.
Note: The following list of medicall y important events is intended to serve as a gui deline for 
determining which condition has to be considered a medicall y important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for:
-Allergic bronchospasm
-Blood d yscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplast ic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancy topenia, etc.)
-Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy , epileptic fit, absence, etc).
Development of drug dependence or drug abuse
ALT >3 xULN + total bilirubin >2 xULN or as ymptomatic AL T increase >10 xULN
- S uicide attempt or an y event suggestive of suicidality
-Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling)
-Bullous cutaneous eruptions
-Cancers diagnosed during the stud y or aggravated during the stud y
-Chronic neurodegene rative diseases (newl y diagnosed) .

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 7610.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest
An AESI  is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification b y the 
Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such events may  require further investigation to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may  be added, modified or 
removed during a stud y by protocol amendment.
The AESI for this stud y are:
Pregnancy  of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male patient entered in a study with I MP/NIMP :
-Pregnancy  occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. I t will be qualified as an SAE only  
if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section 10.4.1.2)
-In the event of pregnancy in a female particip ant, IMP should be discontinued
-Follow -up of the pregnancy  in a female participant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory  until the outcome has been determined (see Appendix A ).
Symptomatic ove rdose with I MP/NIMP :
-A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the I MP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneousl y notified by the patient and resulting in 
clinical sy mptoms and/or signs accompanied by  administration of mo re than twice the 
intended daily  dose within a 24- hour period. It will be recorded in the eCRF as an 
AESI  with immediate notification “Sy mptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental or 
intentional)” in all cases and will be qualified as an SAE only  if it fulfills the SA E 
criteria.
Note: An asy mptomatic overdose with the IMP/NIMP, accidental or intentional, is defined as 
administration of more than twice the intended daily  dose within a 24 -hour period, without 
clinical sy mptoms and/or signs, either suspected by  the Invest igator or spontaneously  notified b y 
the patient, not based on accountabilit y assessment. I t will be recorded as an AE “As ymptomatic 
OVERDOSE, accidental or intentional”.
ALT increase >3 x ULN (refer to related flowchart, Appendix F ).
10.4.1.4 Events of special Interest
An EOSI  is a serious or nonserious AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may  be appropriate. Such events may  require 
further investi gation to characterize and understand them. These events should be reported on the 
specific eCRF page (where applicable) and will only  qualify  for expedited reporting when serious 
(fulfilling SAE criteria).

10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to I MP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study  as defined b y the protocol for that patient, 
are to be rec orded on the corresponding pages of the eCRF
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single s yndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify  the date of onset, intensity , action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy giv en, additional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the AE was caused 
by the IMP or by  the study  procedure(s)
In this stud y, the use of concomitant medications including antidiabetic medications, as 
well as metformin and DPP4(i), may make it difficult to assess the causal relationship, 
particularl y for h ypoglyc emia. The Global Safet y Officer with input from other 
appropriate stud y team members will determine the causal relationship when it is not 
clear ly provided by  the Investigator
The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery  
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, to ensure the safet y of the patient s. This may  imply  that 
observations will continue bey ond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may  be requested by  the monitoring team up to as noticed by  the Sponsor.

10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or an y designees must immediately:
ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e CRF ; the s ystem will automatically  send a notification to the monitoring team and 
pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e CRF
SEND (preferably  by fax or e -mail) a photocopy  of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perfo rmed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and e -mail address appear on the clinical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity  is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properl y mentioned on an y cop y of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory  results, include the labora tory normal ranges
All further data updates should be recorded in the e CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as addi tional information (for laboratory  data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc.) should be sent (b y fax or e -mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every  effort should be made to 
further document an y SAE t hat is fatal or life -threatening within a week (7 days) of the 
initial notification
A back -up plan (using a paper CRF process) must be available and should be used when 
the e CRF system does not work.
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at an y time after the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by  him/her to be caused by  the I MP with a reasonable possibility , should 
be reported to the monitoring team.
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest
For AESI, the Sponsor must be informed immediately  (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE 
notification guidelines described in Section 10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion,

During the study ,patients are instructed to document an y hypoglycemic episodes in their study  
diary . Hypogl ycemia will be reported in the specific eCRF page with onset date and time, 
symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if availa ble, and the treatment. If t heevent fulfills SAE 
criteria, h ypogl ycemia will alsobe reported as an SAE.
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to the American Diabetes Association workgroup on 
hypoglycemia classification ( 20, 21) and summarized in Figure 1.
In addition to the threshold of ≤70mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L ), hypogl ycemia episodes with a plasma 
glucose of <54 mg/dL ( <3.0 mmol/L) will be analyzed separatel y.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 81PG = plasma glucose; SAE = serious adverse event .
Severe hypoglycemia
Severe h ypogl ycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to activel y administer 
carboh ydrate, glucagon, intravenous glucose ,or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may  
be associated with sufficient neurogl ycopenia to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. 
Self-monitored blood glucose values may  not be available, but neurological recovery  attributable 
to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced b y a low plasma glucose concentration.
Note :“Requiring assistance of another person” means that the patient could not help himself or 
herself to treat the h ypogly cemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not 
required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident.
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to unconsciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
repor ted as an SAE .
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia
Documented s ymptomatic hy poglycemia is an event during which t ypical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia accompanied by  a measured plasm a glucose concentration of ≤70mg/dL
(≤3.9 mmol/L ).
Clinical sy mptoms that are c onsidered to result from a hy poglycemic episode include increased 
sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma.
Asymptomatic hypoglyce mia
Asymptomatic hy poglycemia is an event not accompanied by  typical s ymptoms of hy poglycemia 
but with a measured pl asma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L ).
Note : Low plasma glucose values without sy mptoms or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose values within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error testing ,or follo wing up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try  not to document false low SMBG values or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hy poglycemic events. Further clarification with the patient sis needed.
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia
Proba ble sy mptomatic hypogl ycemia is an event during which sy mptoms of hy poglycemia are not 
accompanied b y a plasma glucose determination, (but that was presumabl y caused b y a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤70mg/dL [ ≤3.9 mmol/L ]), ie, sy mptoms treated with oral carbohy drate 
without a test of plasma glucose.

11.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the primary  endpoint.
A sample size of 280 patients in the sotagliflozin group and 140 patients in the placebo group will 
provide more than 90% power to detect a difference of 0.6% for change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c between sotagliflozin and placebo ( standard deviation [ SD]=1.1%; 5% 
significance level 2-sided).
A sample size of 280 patients in the sotagliflozin group and 280 patients in the empagliflozin 
group will ensure that the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the adjusted mean difference 
would not exceed 0.3% with more than 80% power to show non inferiority for intent -to-treat (ITT ) 
analysis and for completer analy sis considering 15% dropout . This calculation assumes a common 
SD of 1.1%, and the true difference between sotagliflozin and empagliflo zin is zero for change 
from Baseline to Week 26in HbA1c .
The total sample size will be approximately  700 patients to be randomized (sotagliflozin group: 
280; empagliflozin group: 280; placebo group: 140).

in the safet y population.
11.4.1.2 Compliance
A given administration will be considered noncompli ant if the patient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required b y the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.
Treatment compliance, above- planned, and under -planned dosing percentages will be summarized
descriptivel y (N, mean, SD, median, min, and max). The percentage of patients with compliance
<80% will be summarized. I n addition, the number and percentage of patients with at least 1 day

days under -planned dose.
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy  endpoints
Efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the ITT population. Statistical testing will be performed 
for primary  endpoint and secondary  endpoints at Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP ).
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint
The statistical test will be two- sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level (α level) .
Analy sis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c 
comparing sotagliflozin 400 mgversus placebo) will be performed on the ITT population, using 
HbA1c measurements obtained from visits during the study, includin g those obtained after IMP 
discontinuation or introduction of rescue therap y.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c will be anal yzed 
with missing post -baseline values imputed b y placebo control -based copy reference multiple 
imputation method under the missing not at random framework:
For placebo patients , missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 87measurements including the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the 
measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model.
Each of the complete datasets will be anal yzed by the analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )model 
with treatment groups (sotagliflozin, empagliflozin, placebo), randomization strata of Screening 
HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization strata of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg , ≥130 mmHg ) and 
metformin useat Screening (Yes, No) and country as fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c value as 
a covariate. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean 
change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the 
between -group difference (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mgvs placebo) and the 95% CI for the 
between -group difference .
Summary  statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline ) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group. The summary  will 
include the number of observations, mean, SD, standard error (SE ), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from Baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC s).
Assessment of treatment eff ect by subgroup
Descriptive anal yses will be performed on the primary  endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined b y the following Baseline or Screening factors:
Race
Ethnicity  (Hispanic, Not Hispanic)
Age group (<50 years, ≥50 to <65 y ears, ≥65 y ears)
Gender
Baseline BMI level (<30 kg/m
2, ≥30 kg/m2)
Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%)
Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg)
Country
Metformin use at Screening (Yes, No)
Baseline eGFR ( ≥30 to <60 mL /min/1.73m2[Mode rate decrease in GFR], ≥60 to 
<90mL/min/1.73m2[Mild decrease in GFR], and ≥ 90 mL /min/1.73m2[Normal])
Duration of diabetes (<10, ≥ 10 years).
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the anal ysis for the primary  efficacy  endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus empagliflozin and placebo) wit h SE and 
95% CI s will be provided as appropriate across the subgroups using contrast statements.

corresponding strata factor will not be included in the model.
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints
For each of the continuous secondary  endpoint s, a similar approach to the primary  efficacy  
endpoints will be used, with missing values imputed by placebo control -based copy reference 
multiple imputation method under the missing not at random framework:
For patients receiving placebo, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group 
data
For patients in the active arms (sotagliflozin and empagliflozin) missing data will be 
imputed as if the patient swere on placebo group throughout the stud y, where all patients’ 
measurements i ncluding the on -treatment measurements will be considered as if the 
measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model.
Each of the complete datasets will be anal yzed by the ANCOVA model with treatment groups 
(sotagliflozin, empagliflozin, placebo), randomization strata of Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), 
randomization strata of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg , ≥130 mmHg ) and metformin useat 
Screening (Yes, No) and country  as fixed effects, and Baseline value as a covariate. For anal ysis 
in patient s with Baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg, the randomization stratum of SBP will not be 
included in the ANCOVA model. Results from each complete dataset will be combined to provide 
the adjusted mean change from Baseline to Week 12/Week 26 for each treatment group, as we ll as 
the between -group difference s and the 95% CIs for the differences.
Categorical secondary  endpoints such as HbA1c responders (<6.5 %, <7.0 %) at Week 26 will be 
analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel method stratified by  randomization strata of 
Screen ing HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), Screening SBP (<130 mmHg , ≥130 mmHg ) and metformin 
useat Screening (Yes, No). The proportion in each treatment group will be provided, as well as 
the difference of proportions between sotagliflozin and placebo with associated 2 -sided 95% CI. 
For HbA1c responders at Week 26, all values at Week 26 will be used to determine whether a 
patient is a responder or not, even if they  are measured after IMP discontinuation or rescue 
medication use. Patients who have no HbA1c measurement at Week26 will be treated as 
nonresponders .
A sensitivity  anal ysis to noninferiorit y test will be conducted with the 26 -week treatment 
completers using the Week 26 values and the same ANCOVA model described above.
11.4.2.3 Analysis of other efficacy endpoints
The anal ysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal testing. Summary  statistics at 
scheduled visits using OCs will be provided by  each treatment group. Graphical presentations will 
also be used to illustrate trends over time.

Once the primary  hypothesis (superiorit y of the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c 
comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo) is established sta tistically  significant for the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint, the following secondary  hypotheses will be tested in the following 
prioritized order:
1.The noninferiorit y of sotagliflozin versus empagliflozin on HbA1c reduction at Week 26
2.The superiorit y of sotagl iflozin versus placebo on 2- hour PPG reduction at Week 26
3.The superiorit y of sotagliflozin versus placebo on FPG reduction at Week 26
4.The superiorit y of sotagliflozin versus placebo on body  weight reduction at Week 26
5.The superiorit y of sotagliflozin versu s placebo on HbA1c responder anal ysis 
(HbA1c<7.0% at Week 26)

10.The superiorit y of sotaglifl ozin versus empagliflozin on sitting SBP reduction at Week 12.
If any hypothesis is found to be not statistically  significant, the testing procedure will be stopped 
and the following h ypotheses will not be tested. The noninferiorit y hypothesis will be decl ared 
statistically  significant if the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI  for the adjusted mean difference 
is <0.3. The superiorit y hypothesis will be declared statistically  significant at α = 0.05 (2 -sided).
No multiplicity  adjustment will be made on efficacy  variables other than those mentioned above .

DEFINITIONS
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarch e and until becoming post menopausal unless 
permanentl y sterile (see below).
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented h ysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectom y.
3.Postmenopausal female
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm 
a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormon e
replacement therap y (HRT ). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a 
single FSH measurement is insufficient
-Females on HRT and whose menopau sal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonhormonal highly effective contraception methods if they  wish to continue 
their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before stu dy enrollment.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE
Female participants
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must use a highly  effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post- treatment follow up period (28 ±5 day s). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods that are User Dependenta
Failure rate of <1%  per year when used consistently and correctly
 Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing ) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation :
- Oral
- Intravagi nal
- Transdermal .
 Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation :
- oral
- injectable .
Highly Effective Methods that a re User Independenta
 Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associ ated with inhibition of ovulation :
- Intrauterine device 
- Intrauterine hormone- releasing system.
 Bilateral tubal occlusion .
Vasectomized partner
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole 
sexual p artner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used.
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
NOTES:
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local reg ulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.
COLLECTION OF PREGNAN CY INFORMATION
Male participants with partners who become pregnant
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study . This

Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally , the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery  date. Any  termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
Female participants who become pregnant 
The Investiga tor will collect pregnancy  information on any  female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. I nformation will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant's pregna ncy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the 
neonate, and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generall y, follow -up will 
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the estimated delivery date. Any  
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure
Any pregnancy  complication or elective termin ation of a pregnancy  will be reported as an 
adverse event ( AE)or serious adverse event ( SAE ).A spontaneous abortion is alway s 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any  poststudy  pregnancy -related 
SAE considered reasonably  related to the study  treatment by  the Investigator will be 
reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 10.4.3 . While the I nvestigator is not 
obligated to activel y seek this information in former study par ticipants, he or she may  
learn of an SA E through spontaneous reporting

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 110Appendix B Ambulator y blood pressure monitoring substudy
Background
A Phase 2 trial of sotagliflozin (L X4211.1- 202) provided evidence that sotagliflozin reduced both 
systolic blood pressure ( SBP)and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP )in patients with elevated SBP 
and DBP at Baseline, but not in normotensive patients. I n this substudy  of approximately  
180patients, patients with similar Baseline BP distribution as the full study population (ie, equal 
numbers of patients with SBP <130 mmHg or ≥130 mmHg) will have ambulatory  blood pressure 
monitoring ( ABPM) assessed for 24 hours via ambulatory  blood pressure ( BP)monitoring 
technology . The ABPM substudy  includes 3 sets of assessments, at 1 week before the 
Randomization Visit , and the days before the Week 12 and 26 visits, respectively , to provide a 
more sy stematic assessment of the SBP and DBP lowering efficacy  of sotagliflozin.
Ambulatory  blood pre ssure monitoring will be performed with a validated device provided by  the 
Sponsor or Sponsor representative .The AB PMdata process will be facilitated by  a vendor,  
( , USA).
Substudy procedures
At the preselected stud y sites participating i n the ABPM substudy , patients must consent to be a 
part of the substudy  to participate in the main study  until the planned number of patients for 
substudy  has been achieved.
At Visit 1, patients will be provided with information on the ABPM substudy  and se parate written 
consent will be taken before ABPM substudy -specific procedures are performed. Patients who 
work a night (third) shift (defined as 11:00 PM [23 :00] to 7:00 AM [07 :00]) will be excluded 
from the ABPM substudy .
Patients in the ABPM substudy  will have 3 additional visits to the site for placement of the ABPM 
device. These will be Visits 3A, 6A, and 8A. Visit 3A will occur at Week -1, 1 week before the 
Randomization Visit . Visit 6A,and Visit 8Awill occur the day  before Visit 6 (Week 12) and Visi t 
8 (Week 26).Patients do not need to be fasting at these 3 visits.
Patients who discontinued the Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP)during the study  before 
the visit for ABPM will not continue in t he ABPM substudy  post -IMP discontinuation. Patients 
who receive rescue therapy  but remain on IMP will continue on the ABP Msubstudy  as planned.
On the 3 visit day s (Visits 3A, 6A ,and 8A ) each recording will start in the morning, preferabl y 
between 08:00 and 10:00 immediately  after the administra tion of study  medication, and will end 
after at least 24 hours of recording on the following day.
Investigator and/or designee will help patients wear the ambulant BP monitor and the 
appropriate BP cuff (depending on the patient’s arm size) on the nondomin ant upper arm

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 111Patients should be aware that the device will automatically inflate the cuff and measure the 
BP every  20 minutes during the day -time (08:00 and 21:59) and every  30 minutes during 
the sleeping time (22:00 and 07:59) over a 24- hour period
During the ABPM period, patients should continue their daily  activities and concomitant 
medications, but avoid activities that may  interfere with functioning of the device such as 
vigorous exercis e, bathing, or taking a shower
When the cuff starts to inflate, t he patient should remain still and avoid arm movement.
Patients will record the time of sleep and any  unusual events or poor sleep quality  during 
the ABPM recording period in their study  diary
Patients will be instructed to remove the BP device after 24-hour wearing the ABPM device:
-Once the ABPM de vice has been placed at Visit 3A , patients will be instructed to 
remove it 24 hours later and return it to the site by mail in appropriate packaging 
provided b y the site
- T went y-four hours after Visits 6A and 8A, patients will return to the site in a fasting 
state at Visits 6 and 8, respectively, and the device will be removed at the site.
All ABPM data will be reviewed following return of the device to ensure quality  of the recording. 
The quality  of a visit recording will be considered insufficient if the visit recording does not meet 
the criteria below:
1. Visit recording does not contain ≥17 nonconsecutive hours of data where each hour has at
least one valid BP measurement
2.Visit recording has <44 total measurements.
Patients with ABPM data not of sufficient qualit y will be asked to repeat the process as soon as 
possible. Patients with ABPM data not of sufficient quality  at Visit 3A should not be randomized 
until the Baseline ABPM recording has been repeated, and the Randomization Visit (Visit 3) will 
be postponed correspondingl y.
Patients must be well trained to understand the importance of the ABPM performance and 
compliance of the instruction. Technique support via a 24/7 help- line service for troubleshooting 
will be provided b y . The patients should immediately contact the sites if they encounter an y 
device -related events (malfunction) or any  questions about the ABPM. The investigator or site 
staff will help patients contact the  service line for problem solving.

A 2-hour postprandial glucose ( PPG)will be obtained after a standardized mixed meal in all 
patients at Baseline (Day 1, Visit 3) and at Week 26 (Visit 8). P atientsrequiring rescue therap y
prior to Week 26 (see Section 9.1.4.3) should still have the standa rdized mixed meal tolerance test 
(MMTT )performed at Week 26 .Patients who permanentl y discontinued the Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP) before Week 26 will not perform the MMTT at the planned Visit 8
(Week 26) .
The standardized MMTT must not be performed while patien ts are temporarily  off IMP; the 
Medical Monitor will address an y episodes on a case -by-case basis and the standardized MMTT 
will be rescheduled when the patient can resume IMP, if applicable.
The first dose of double -blind investigational medicinal product (IMP; and dosing with dipeptidy l 
peptidase 4 inhibitor [ DPP4 (i)] and metformin , if applicable) on Day  1 (Visit 3) will be given 
after completion of the 2 -hour PPG collection. For the Week 26 standardized MMTT , the patient 
should take the dose of double-bl ind IMP immediately  after the fasting blood samples are 
obtained, and approximately 30 minutes before ingestion of the standardized mixed meal begins. 
At Week 26, DPP4(i) and metformin (if applicable) dosing will occur after collection of the 
2-hour PPG sa mple and 3 hour PK sample are completed .

The standard (breakfast) meal will be provided by the Sponsor as a liquid nutrition drink (Boost®, 
Ensure®, or similar), with approximately  40 g carbohy drate and approx imately  240 calories per 
bottle ( approximately  8 ounces). The cal oric composition of the meal is approximately  65% 
carboh ydrate, approximately  15% protein, and approximately  20% fat. The amount given is 
6mL/kg body  weight up to a maximum of 360 mL. Theref ore,for patients ≥60 kg, the standard 
meal consists of approximately  60 g carboh ydrate and 360 calories.
Patients are instructed to completely  consume the meal within 15 minutes, and every  effort should 
be made to complete the meal within 20 minutes after it is started. Water or noncaffeinated, zero 
calorie beverages may  be consumed ad libitum. No other food may  be consumed until the 2 -hour 
PPG plasma sample has been collected. If the patient is unable to consume at least 50% of the 
standard mixed meal, the MMTT should not be completed and the subsequent standardized 
MMTT should not be performed. If the patient is able to consume >50% of the standardized 
mixed meal, the approximate amount should be recorded, and an equivalent amount should be consumed at the subsequent standardized mixed meal.

hydration and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis
Basic genitourinary hygiene
Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at risk for developing genito urinary (GU) infections. The 
following guidelines should be communicated to females and uncircumcised males regarding GU
infections. Patient communication cards will b e printed with the following:
For females:
“The following advice may  be useful in helping you to keep y our bladder and urethra free from 
infection:
Go to the toilet as soon as y ou feel the need to uri nate, rather than holding it in
Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet
Practice good h ygiene b y washing your genitals e very day, and before having sex
Empty  your bladder after having sex.”
For uncircumcised males:
“The following advice may  be useful in helping you to keep the foreskin free from infec tion:
Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do n ot let soap get in the 
opening)
After your shower or bath, dry  the end of y our penis and foreskin pr operl y and replace the 
foreskin
Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enoug h so that urine does not get on the 
foreskin- this helps to keep it clean.”
Maintaining hydration:
Sodium -glucose cotransporter T ype 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizziness or hy potension, especially  in the elderl y. Before initiating 
study  drug (at Screening, Run- in and Randomization) and during all on -site study  visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with renal impairment, the elderl y, in patients with low systolic 
blood pressure , or if receiving diuretics, angiotensin- converting -enzy me inhibitors, or angiotensin 
receptor blockers. All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider 
increasing it if they  sense greater thirst, more urine production, or if they  feel dizzy  or faint.
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with Type 2 diabetes :
“The following advice may  be useful in helping you to maintain proper hydration and prevent 
dehy dration:
Dehydration is when your body lose s too much fluid, frequentl y due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

-You sense greater thirst than usual
-You have a dry  mouth or cracked lips
-You have a fever
-You have diarrhea or vomiting
-You urinate m ore frequently  or in larger amounts than usual
-You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual)
-You feel dizzy  or light -headed
-You exercise, or when it is hot outside” .
Recognizing d iabetic k etoacidosis
Potential gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events occurring with sotagliflozin may  mask presenting 
symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (D KA). Patient communication cards will be printed with the 
following:
“If you have an y of these sy mptoms on the list, then contact y our study  site immediately  for 
assistance with managing y our diabetes:
Inability  to maintain oral intake
Generalized weakness
Abdominal (belly ) pain
Increased weight loss
Fever
Frequent urination, including at night
Fruit y-scented breath
Confusion
Acute illness
Consistently  elevated blood glucose
Feeling very  thirsty  or drinking a lot
Nausea or vomiting
Having trouble thinking clearl y or feeling tired.
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated. Regardless of your blood 
glucose level, if you have an y of thes e symptoms on the list, then contact your study  site 
regarding the need to be evaluated for possible DKA, which will include specific blood testing.

room for e valuation.
If you are scheduled for a procedure or surgery that requires you to not take an y food or liquids, 
please contact your stud y doctor for instructions on continuing stud y drug. In such cases your 
study  doctor may  advise y ou NOT to take y our study  drug from the day  prior to the procedure or 
surgery  until after the procedure or surgery  is complete, and y ou are taking food and liquids as 
you normally  do.”
Whenever adverse event d ata are collected or the patient reports DKA or intercurrent illness 
(including infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, GIsymptoms including 
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or other s ymptoms or signs that the Investigator believes 
may be consistent with DKA, then the site will determine if an assessment f or DKA is 
appropriate. If laboratory testing confirms presence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible 
DKA” electronic case report form will be completed.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly con fidential Page 117Appendix E Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate
Equipment
1. Blood pressure measurements will be taken by an automated blood pressure ( BP)monitor 
or a manual sph ygmomanometer
2.Bladder length – Should nearl y or completel y encircle the patient’s arm. For man y adults, 
the standard “adult” size bladder is not long enough and the “large” size bladder is 
recommended
3.Bladder width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder length.
Patient f actors
Extraneous variables associated with the measurement of BP should be minimized. These include:
1.Food intake, caffeine -containing beverages, cigarette smoking, or strenuous exerc ise 
within 2 hours prior to measurement
2.Full urinary  bladder
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the 
patient’s arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugl y with the lower edge 2 to 3cm above 
the antecubital fossa
5.The patient should be allowed to sit quietly  in a comfortably  warm place (temperature 
around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with the arm supported at heart level, preferabl y with 
thecuff in place and with no restrictive clothing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles.
Determination of the arm with the highest blood pressure
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1, Week -4),BP will be measured on both ar ms to identify  and select 
the appropriate arm for future measurements. S eated BP should be measured in both arms after 
5-minute rest period, and then again after 1 minute in both arms in seated position. The arm with 
thehighest SBPwill be determined at t his visit, and BP should be measured in this arm 
throughout the stud y.
Measurement Technique (23)
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1, Week -4),immediately  following arm selection, with the patient in 
the same po sition, an additional seated BP should be measured in the selected arm (at least 
1minute after last measurement).
At all other visits, following the 5 -minute rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be measured 
in the arm selected at Visit 1, with at lea st 1minute between BP measurements and with the cuff 
fully  deflated between measurements.
All 3 BPs will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. The mean of the 3 seated BPs will constitute the 
BP value for that visit.
Three seated HR measurements will also be obtained. The mean of the 3 seated HRmeasurements 
will constitute the HR value for that visit.

transplant recipients with NAFLD. The samples will be collected at Pre -dose (0.0), 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 
3.0, 4 .0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 24 hours post -dose. In addition , pre-dose sample will be collected at 
Visits 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  
 
At the End of Treatment  visit, all required parameters and assessments will be performed  again . 
 
Subjects will return for their final visit, the Follow -up visit, 4 -week after the last dose of the study 
drug. At this visit assessments include a targeted physical examination  (lab results/signs/ symptom 
driven) , vital signs, safety laboratory tests, a review of concomitant medications and AEs. A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed for females of child bearing potential only.  All the study related 
procedures will be performed as per table 1 (Schedule of Events) .  
 
Unscheduled visits  – Permitted at any time during the study for assessment and management of 
AEs and any concurrent clinical conditions. To be captured in the electronic case report form

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease 
(Angulo, 2002; Wieckowska and Feldstein, 2005) with an estimated global prevalence  of 25% 
(Younossi et al., 2015).  The severity of NAFLD ranges from simple  hepatic steatosis to 
nona lcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and  around 7 –30% have  NASH, of which 10 –20% 
progress to liver cirrhosis, for which  the only treatment is liver transplantation  (LT) (Younossi 
et al., 2015).  
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  is now the fastest growing and second most etiology of liver 
disease among new waitlist registrants  for LT. Simultaneously to this course, the development 
and or recurrence of NASH after LT is certain to impose significant challenges.  The genetic 
predispo sition, immunosuppressive regimen and metabolic syndrome risk factors all play a 
role in the development of NAFLD/NASH after LT. In fact, NAFLD tends to recur 90% of 
the time after LT (Bhati et al. 2017) and patients with post -LT are at much higher risk of  
metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity. These 
metabolic conditions pose considerable risk to LT patients with NAFLD as these conditions 
or linked to post -LT mortality.  
Generally, c ontrol of lipids and weight loss by diet a nd exercise are recommended for 
treatment of patients with NAFLD, including NASH, but their long -term effectiveness is 
questionable because many patients are unable to comply with the required dietary and 
lifestyle changes (Bellentani et al., 2008 ; Musso et al., 2010). Therefore, an alternative and 
effective pharmacotherapeutic approach is needed. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach is 
required to manage transplanted patients with NASH, which include cardiovascular medicine, 
endocrinology, surge ry, nutrition, and behavioral psychology , etc., to reduce identified risk 
factors.   
2.2 RATIONALE FOR CONDUC TING THE STUDY  
Saroglitazar magnesium  is a novel predominately PPAR  agonist and moderate PPARγ 
agonist. Pre -clinical studies with Saroglitazar  magnesium  using various animal models 
wherein, EC50 of PPARα: PPARγ  >300; favorably modulated the lipid and glucose profile.

 Saroglitazar magnesium  showed favorable r esults. It was found to have superior or equivalent 
safety and efficacy profile compared to marketed fibrates or thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in pre -
clinical studies.  
PPARα activation by Saroglitazar magnesium  increases the hepatic oxidation of fatty acids 
(FA) and reduces the synthesis and secretion of TG. This, in turn, increases diversion of FA 
from peripheral tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle and fat tissue) to the liver, thereby decreasing 
both FA synthesis and delivery of TG to peripheral tissues. In addit ion, Saroglitazar 
magnesium  causes increased lipolysis and elimination of TG -rich particles from plasma by 
activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and reducing production of apolipoprotein C -III (an 
inhibitor of LPL activity). Consistent with the above mechani sm, Saroglitazar magnesium  was 
also found to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol. PPARα activation by Saroglitazar magnesium  
also induces an increase in the synthesis of apolipoproteins, A -I, A-II and HDL cholesterol.  
Although Saroglitazar magnesium  is predomina ntly a PPARα agonist, it also causes activation 
of PPARγ and regulates the transcription of insulin -responsive genes involved in the control 
of glucose production, transport and utilization. Saroglitazar magnesium  increases the 
expression of numerous PPARγ -responsive genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism, including adiponectin, adipocyte fatty -acid-binding protein (aP2), LPL, fatty acid 
transport protein and fatty acid translocase (CD36). By increasing the expression of these 
genes, Saroglitaz ar magnesium  decreases the post -prandial rise of plasma free fatty acids 
(FFA), improves post -absorptive insulin -mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output, 
reduces the metabolic burden on liver and muscle and promotes glucose utilization. Robust 
antid iabetic and insulin sensitizing effects of Saroglitazar magnesium  were observed in 
preclinical models, in which hyperglycemia and/or impaired glucose tolerance is a 
consequence of insulin resistance in target tissues.  
Peroxisome proliferator -activated rece ptors (PPARs), the largest family of nuclear receptors, 
are now a prime focus of NAFLD/NASH research. There are three subtypes, PPAR -α, γ and 
δ. Upon receptor activation, all bind the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form transcriptionally 
active heterodimers.  PPARα is primarily expressed in tissues that use fatty acids as a fuel, such 
as the liver, muscle, heart and kidneys. In contrast, PPARγ is found predominantly in adipose 
tissue where it mediates differentiation of pre -adipocytes (adipogenesis), lipid sto rage and 
insulin action.

  PPARα is central to hepatic lipid homeostasis. When hepatic fatty acid levels increase, 
PPARα is activated, leading to transcription of such genes as liver fatty acid binding protein 
(LFABP), acyl -CoA oxidase (ACO), cytochrome P45 0 (CYP)  4A, microsomal triglyceride 
transfer protein (MTTP) and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100). The net effect is catabolism and 
clearance of fatty acids. It has recently been appreciated that the liver may respond to newly 
synthesized fatty acids different ly from those 'recycled' from peripheral stores, and this 
discrimination is mediated by selective effects on PPARα. This may explain why PPARα 
activation does not appear to occur as an adaptive response in fatty liver disease, when it would 
be an effective  pathway to enhance insulin sensitivity and suppress inflammatory recruitment. 
Thus, while pharmacologic PPARα activation effectively 'cured' fibrosing steatohepatitis in a 
murine, dietary model, the efficacy of such agents is less clear in humans. PPARγ i s found 
predominantly in adipocytes. It has both opposite and complementary functions to PPARα. 
Thus, PPARγ activation leads to differentiation of adipocytes from pre -adipocytes in-vitro . 
This increases the lipid storage capacity of the adipose mass, and i n animals, also increases 
the number of small, insulin -sensitive adipocytes so as to improve insulin sensitivity. 
Increasingly, the importance of PPARγ is being recognized in the liver, despite the relatively 
low levels of expression normally found there. Steatosis is often associated with increased 
hepatocyte expression of PPARγ.  
Therefore , peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor (PPAR) agonists are known to lower 
high blood triglyceride levels (PPARα agonists) and improve insulin resistance (PPARγ 
agon ists), and may offer a potential treatment not only for patients with NAFLD or NASH but 
also for post liver transplant NAFLD/NASH.  
2.3 DRUG PROFILE  
Several research groups have developed or are attempting to develop dual PPARα/γ agonist, 
some of which may eventually reach desirable clinical efficacy and safety end point. But if the 
agonist has higher PPARγ binding properties then several of the side effects such as edema, 
weight gain, bone effect s and cardiovascular complication s may occur. Therefore, there  has 
been an increasing interest to develop new molecular entities which can treat insulin 
resistance, lower plasma glucose in diabetic patients and improve lipid profile without weight 
gain and cardiovascular risk.

 information about a given subject’s response to this therapy cou ld guide their clinician in 
making long -term therapeutic decisions. Thus, a potential benefit of the study is to determine 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy among subjects. As for risk, the protocol is designed to 
minimize the risks to participants whi le maximizing the potential value of the knowledge it is 
designed to generate. On balance, we believe there is a reasonable prospect for individual and 
generalized benefit when compared to the risk of participation.

 margin. Screening laboratory tests may be repeated following the approval of the Sponsor or 
its designee if the laboratory test results seem implausi ble or inaccurate.  
At least 35 days from the date of the subject’s initial screening will need to elapse prior to 
rescreening a subject. The subject will need to be rescreened under a new screening number 
and a new informed consent must  be obtained. A scre en failure occurs when a patient who 
has signed the informed consent form (ICF) does not meet all the entry criteria outlined in 
this protocol and has not been randomized or received study drug. No study procedures 
(including End -of-treatment procedures) w ill be performed for these patients. For patients 
who fail to meet the inclusion criteria or who meet 1 or more of the exclusion criteria, the PI 
(or designee) will document on a screening log the reason for the screening failure.  
4.5 HANDLING OF SUBJECT WITHD RAWAL  
In case of withdrawal of consent, and unless otherwise stated by the subject in the withdrawal 
of consent, PI(s) will be encouraged to obtain  information from the subject in order to follow 
the medical status of the subjects (especially when the subj ect withdraws his/her  consent after 
having experienced an AE/SAE or an efficacy endpoint). Principal Investigator or designee(s) 
must make reasonable attempts (at least 3 attempts, one of which will be via a 
certified/traceable mail) to contact subjects th at are lost to follow -up, in order to obtain health 
status  and reason for withdrawal . These attempts must be documented in the medical record s. 
In addition, if patient withdraws from the study, any data collected during the period of time 
will maintained a s part of the study data.

the next day to have the blood sample collected, and will be reminded not to take the IP until 
after the blood sample collections. If the subject again returns having take n the IP, blood 
samples will be collected and the subject will be asked to return for the next scheduled visit.  
5.3 PACKAGING, LABELLING  AND SUPPLY  
Tablets of Saroglitazar  magnesium 4 mg will be packed, labeled and supplied by the Sponsor 
according to all local legal requirements.  
 
 
. The 
investigator designee  will confirm the receipt of IP in writing  via fax/email .  
The P I or designee  will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the study drug, including 
the date s received.  Unused drug supplies will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) for 
destruction /destroyed at the site after approval for the same by the Spons or. No study drug 
will be destroyed or returned until complete drug accountability has been performed by the 
study monitor. All supplies must be accounted for at the end of the study period.  
Investigational product must be dispensed to each subject in such a way that the subject can 
take the doses in accordance with the Protocol. A Drug Accountability Log (s) for recording 
the receipt, dispensing and return of the IP must be maintained by the PI or any designated 
personnel. The Drug Accountability Log (s) must be kept up to date and must be made 
availab le to the study monitor during monitoring visits.   
5.4 STORAGE CONDITIONS A ND STABILITY  
Saroglitazar magnesium tablets will be stored at room temperat ure (20°C to 25°C or 68°F to 
77°F) in a dry place away from light at the study site or pharmacy. If the IP temperature 
extends outside the 20 -25°C range, a temperature excursion must be documented  in the study -
specific temperature log , and sent to the Sponsor. If the excursion is within 15 -30°C, 
quarantine is not required, and the IP is acceptable for use. If the excursion is outside of the 
15-30°C range, the IP must be quarantined until a decision on the stability of the IP is made 
by the Sponsor. If t he excursion go es beyond the range of 15 -300 C it will be consider ed as a

secure  location  with access limited to the Site Pharmacist or the PI designated site s taff. 
5.5 BLINDING  
This is a n open -label  study , therefore,  PI and participants will be made aware what  treatment 
they will be administered.  
5.6 METHOD OF ASSIGNING SUBJECT S TO TREATMENT GROUP  
All s ubjects will receive  Saroglitazar  magnesium 4 mg. A screening number will be assigned 
at the site and will be used to identify the subject throughout the study and will be entered on 
all documentation. The Screening Number will be assigned in numerical order at the site. A 
subject number will not be assig ned to more than 1 subject. If a subject is not eligible to receive 
treatment, or if a subject discontinues from the study, the Screening Number cannot be 
assigned to another subject.  
Subjects will be considered randomized as soon as the first allocation t reatment number /drug 
kit is assigned. The first study drug intake should take place as soon as possible after 
randomization (on the same day), under medical supervision. In the event a subject is 
randomized but is not administered study drug, this will be considered an early termination, 
not a screen failure. The randomization number and subject drug kit will not be reassigned to 
another subject.  
5.7 SELECTION OF DOSES  
Saroglitazar magnesium 2 and 4 mg have favorably modified the lipid profile and glycemia in 
the dyslipidemic patients with or without diabetes mellitus during its development in Phase 2 
and 3 studies. Considering the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Saroglitazar  magnesium , it 
is approved in India at the doses of 2 mg and 4 mg QD for the treatment of “Diabetic 
Dyslipidemia” and “Hypertriglyceridemia with T2DM not controlled by statin therapy”. 
Saroglitazar magnesium 4 mg dose ha s shown favorable effects  on lipid profile s and on liver 
enzyme  level s, therefore, this dose has been selected for this study.  
5.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION  
1. Standard of care for patients with  LT will be allowed . These include management 
of immunosuppression per site’s transplant related protocol. Additionally,

 management of metabolic co -morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and obesity will also be done as per local standard of care.  
2. Patient with stable doses of statins (simvastatin, pravastatin, a torvastatin, 
fluvastatin, lovastatin,  and rosuvastatin) or fibrates (clofibrate, fenofibrate) will 
be allowed  in the study ; however , their doses should remain stable throughout the 
study period.  
5.8.1 Subjects on concomitant anti -diabetic medication  
Patients on anti -diabetic medication must  be assessed at scheduled visits for 
hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia; rescue medication will also be permitted, if required.  
Patients on concomitant anti -diabetic medication will be provided with a glucometer and 
instruc tions for use. All point -of-care (POC) glucose measurements collected/documented by 
patients during the study period  must be performed on the study -provided glucometer . The 
investigational site will download/record the data from glucometer/patient diary fo r 
assessment of glucose levels from the previous visit.  
The patients should monitor their glucose levels as follows:  
 Fasting blood glucose should  be measured on at least two different days in a week. 
These measurements should  be done in the morning before having breakfast and when 
the patient has been fasting for a minimum of 10 hours.  
 Spontaneous measurements of blood glucose should be done in the event the patient 
suffers from suspected hypoglycemia. The PI or designee  should inform the patients 
on recognizing the symptoms of hypoglycemia (i.e. palpitations, tremor, diaphoresis, 
hunger and/or cognitive impairment) and instruct them on the actions to be taken in 
accordance with standard -of-care.  
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the f ollowing treatment for 
non-severe hypoglycemia during which a patient is willing and able to consume oral 
treatment:  
1. Consume 15 -20 grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates  
2. Recheck your blood glucose after 15 minutes  
3. If hypoglycemia continues, repeat #1 & # 2 
4. Once your blood glucose returns to a normal level, consume a small snack if 
your next planned snack or meal is greater than 1 hour in the future .

 Examples provided by the ADA of items containing 15 grams of simple carbohydrates 
include:  
 Glucose tablets ( follow instructions on the package)  
 Gel tube (follow instructions on the package)  
 2 tablespoons of raisins  
 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of juice or regular (non -diet) soda  
 1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or corn syrup  
 8 ounces of nonfat or 1% milk  
 Hard candy, gumdrops or jellybeans (read package for amount to consume)  
In the event of severe hypoglycemia when a patient is unconscious and possibly 
seizing, and/or unable to safely ingest carbohydrates, do not attempt oral treatment. If 
glucagon is available, this should be  administered as soon as possible. If glucagon is 
not available, it is not able to be administered or persons witnessing the event do not 
feel able to handle the situation, emergency medical personnel should be summoned 
via calling 911.  
Principal Investiga tor will advise patients to report all hypoglycemic episodes occurring 
during the course of the study  as they will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form  
(eCRF) . 
Treatment for such conditions should be initiated as soon as the need for treatment is identified 
by the PI, in accordance with treatment guidelines and standard of care, and should be adjusted 
as necessary to treat the patient’s condition(s). All treatmen t with these drugs must be recorded 
in the eCRF . 
5.9 STOPPING RULE(S)  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by the incidence, severity, and relationship to study 
intervention of any AEs and changes from baseline in laboratory test results, physical 
examina tion findings, and vital sign measurements, at any time after the subject has received 
study intervention. If continuous safety analysis reveals an adverse trend, the PI may halt the 
study independently, or in consultation with the IRB /Sponsor , as appropri ate. Furthermore, if 
three or more subjects develop the same SAE  related to the IP or a procedure, the study  will 
be suspend ed until  the safety review  outcome , in consultation with the IRB /Sponsor .

 Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as descri bed. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the PI that may make it infeasible to perform the test. 
In these cases, the PI will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the 
patient . When a protocol required test cannot be performed the PI will document the reason 
and the corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal 
processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study  team will  be informed of these 
incidents in a timely fashion.  
6.2 EFFICACY  
Efficacy will be assessed through a number of exploratory endpoints.  
1 Changes in hepatic fat as determined by MRI -PDFF  and MRE from baseline to EOT.  
2 Changes in metabolic flexibility from baseline to EOT.  
3 Changes in markers of insulin resistance FSIVGTT, HbA1c  and fructosamine from 
baseline to EOT.  
4 Change s in serum liver enzymes from baseline to EOT.  
5 Changes in serum lipids from baseline to EOT.  
6 Change s in atherogenic lipoprotein which includes sdLDL, LDL size and 
concentration, subtypes of VLDL and HDL from baseline to EOT . 
7 Change in QoL score from baseline to EOT . 
8 Pharmacokinetics of Saroglitazar following first dose and last dose in liver transplant 
recipients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  
9 Body composition assessment via c hange in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle volume  
from baseline to EOT  by whole body MRI . 
6.2.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging -Derived Proton Density -Fat Fraction  (MRI -
PDFF)  
The magnetic resonance imaging -estimated proton density fat fraction ( MRI -PDFF ) is a novel 
imaging -based biomarker that allows fat mapping of the entire liver. Liver fat content will be 
measured using MRI -PDFF. Proton -density -fat-fraction technique is an MRI p rotocol that 
improves on the conventional Dixon in - and out -of phase method. PDFF uses a low flip angle 
to reduce T1 bias (Bydder M et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2007). Multiple echoes per excitation are 
used to correct T2* decay (Bydder M et al. 2008; Yokoo et al. 2009; Yu et al. 2007). As a

 result, the expected loss of signal with longer echo times, particularly in the presence of iron, 
is corrected. In head -to-head comparisons, PDFF quantified liver fat more accurately than 
conventional two -point Dixon MRI (Yo koo et al. 2011; Mashhood et al. 2013). In addition, 
PDFF minimizes the multifrequency interference effects of fat protons (Yokoo et al. 2009). 
PDFF has been shown to have high reproducibility at 1.5 T and 3.0 T (Kang et al. 2011). 
Studies assessing liver fat have confirmed the accuracy of PDFF using hydrogen -1 MR 
spectroscopy (H1 -MRS) (Yokoo et al. 2009; Yokoo et al. 2011; Kang et al. 2011; Noureddin 
et al. 2013) or liver histology (Idilman et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2013) as gold standard. In 
addition, PDFF  MRI technique allows fat mapping for the entire liver, whereas longitudinal 
segmental changes of liver fat may be accurately determined and small differences can be 
detected (Noureddin et al. 2013). The procedure will be conducted per the site’s policies and 
SOPs for the procedure which will be followed for the study.  
6.2.2 Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP)  
CAP based on FibroScan  is a promising tool for noninvasive semiquantitative assessment of 
liver fat content  (De Ledinghen V,  2012 ). CAP measures the ultrasound attenuation at the 
center frequency of the FibroScan M probe (3.5 MHz), with values range from 100 to 400 
dB/m. Besides CAP being able to provide an instantaneous assessment of liver steatosis, some 
advantages, such as quantif icational accuracy and ease of performance (which provide for 
instantaneous results), as well as inexpensive cost and reproducibility are highlighted when 
compared with other imaging methods  (De Ledinghen V  et al, 2014 ). In a prospective study 
of 153 patie nts, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of CAP for ≥5%, 
>33% and >66% steatosis were 0.79, 0.76 and 0.70, respectively  (Myers RP  et al, 2012 ).  
See below table for vibration -controlled transient elastography cutoff values for CAP  
(Siddiqui et. al. CGH 2019 ). This table indicates 263 dB/m cutoff value to optimize sensitivity .

6.2.3 Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) 
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a dynamic elasticity imaging technique that uses 
mechanical waves to quantitatively assess the shear modulus or stiffness of tissues 
(Muthupillai et al., 1995).  
The three basic steps of this MRE are i) shear waves with frequencies ranging from 50 – 500 
Hz are induced in the tissue using an external driver, ii) the waves are imaged inside the body 
using a special MRI technique and iii) the resulting data are processed to generate quantitative 
images displaying the st iffness of tissue.  The procedure will be conducted per the site’s 
policies and SOPs for the procedure which will be followed for the study.  
6.2.4 Whole Body MRI  
Body composition is linked to cardiometabolic health and will be evaluated in patients. 
Subjects will  be scanned in a research -dedicated Phillips Ingenia 3.0T Omega HP Multi -
Transmit MRI scanner using 6 -minute dual -echo Dixen Vibe protocol, providing a water and 
fat separated volumetric data set covering neck to knees. Acquired images will be analyzed 
for visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, thigh muscle volume, and muscle fat 
infiltration in the anterior thighs. Liver fat content will be quantified via proton density fat 
fraction as published previously  (Linge et. al, 2018 ).   
6.2.5 Frequently  Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (FSIVGTT ) 
The Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test assesses insulin sensitivity by a 
computed mathematical analysis of glucose and insulin dynamics. FSIVGTT consists of an 
intravenously administer ed bolus of glucose and an infusion of insulin 20 minutes after

 glucose injection. Blood samples are collected periodically for total test duration of 1 20 
minutes . The procedure will be performed as per Institution standard operating guideline.  
6.2.6 Metabolic Flexibility  
Energy expenditure:  The recording of the components of energy balance, i.e. energy intake 
and expenditure is extremely important to understand the individual’s response to 
pharmacologic or lifestyle modifications interventions. Yet, estimation of energy expenditure 
by equati ons, and food dietary recording are imprecise and subject to recall bias, respectively. 
The indirect calorimetry technique, by measuring the oxygen consumption allows a precise 
measurement of energy expenditure; additionally, the measurement of carbon diox ide 
production provides the opportunity of measuring the respiratory quotient (RQ) and in turn 
calculating the substrate utilization (carbohydrate vs. fat). Virginia Commonwealth University 
has a newly established indirect calorimeters suite with two whole  room indirect calorimeters, 
a small 4’x8’ “flex room” for short term studies and a larger 10’x10’ room, fitted with hospital 
bed, sink, and toilet which allows long -term studies. Additionally, recent improvements in the 
data acquisition algorithm allow th e recording of acute changes in energy expenditure. By 
coupling minute by minute measurements of energy expenditure with wearable sensors able 
to capture spatial movements, researchers have the unique opportunity to precisely measure 
the energy expenditure  in its components. Finally, by providing study meals with known 
calorie content and macronutrient composition researchers are also able to control the energy 
intake arm of the energy balance equation  (Galgani and Ravussin, 2008).  
Metabolic Flexibility : The switch from carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation defined as 
a drop in RQ during an overnight fasting is one of the gold -standard measure s to assess 
metabolic flexibility. Insulin -resistant and T2DM  patients  are characterized by a metabolic 
inflexibi lity, which is associated with even worse insulin resistance, and they typically present 
with an impaired drop in RQ overnight (higher RQ), defining metabolic inflexibility, and 
specifically metabolic inflexibility to lipids. A significant change in mean 1 4-hour RQ, as well 
as changes of the RQ area under the curve between baseline and the end of the intervention 
would suggest improvements in metabolic flexibility, which is associated with improved 
metabolic outcomes  (Goodpaster and Sparks, 2017; Galgani et  al., 2008).

 6.2.7 Quality of Life Assessment  
6.2.7.1  SF-36 Health Survey  
Subjective QoL assessments will be measured using the SF -36 version 2.0, which is a 36 -item 
patient response questionnaire that measures QoL across 8  domains, both physically and 
emotionally base d. The 8 domains are physical functioning, role limitations due to physical 
health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well -being, 
social functioning, pain and general health.  
For information about the quality of life ass essment, SF -36, version 2, refer to the SF -36.org 
Community at http://www.sf -36.org/tools/sf36.shtml . 
6.2.8 Pharmacokinetics Assessment  
Pharmacokinetics of Saroglitazar will be assessed following first dose and last dose in liver 
transplant recipients with NAFLD. The samples will be collected at Pre -dose (0.0), 0.5, 1.0, 
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 24 hours post -dose. In addition , pre-dose sample will be 
collected at Visits 3, 4 , 5, 6  and 7. The samplin g will be performed only in approximately 
5 patients  participating in the PK evaluation.  A separate  PK manual will be created describing 
the detail ed procedure s for PK sample handling, storage, shipment, bioanalysis , quality  
oversight and reporting of data.  
The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated for first and last dose:  
a. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax)  
b. Time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax)  
c. Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve till the l ast time point (AUC0 -t) 
d. Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve extrapolated to the infinity (AUC0 -∞) 
after first dose  
e. Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve in a 24 h dosing interval (AUCtau)  
f. Elimination rate constant (λz)  
g. Elimination half -life (t1/2)  
h. Apparent v olume of distribution (Vd/F)  
i. Apparent c learance (CL/F)  
j. Minimal or trough plasma concentration (Cmin) -for last dose only  
k. Accumulation index calculated as a ratio of AUCtau  (last dose)/AUCtau  (first dose)

6.2.9 Appropriateness  of Measurement  
The endpoints chosen for the given study [safety  and efficacy ] are appropriate for the 
assessment of outcome of the study.  
6.2.10  Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
In addition, a clinically significant value outside the normal or referen ce range in a routine 
safety assessment, such as clinical laboratory, vital signs or standard 12 -lead ECG,  and 2D 
ECHO  may signify an adverse finding. Additional examinations or repetition of test will be 
performed as medically indicated.  
If the PI conside rs the abnormality as of major medical relevance, he/she should also record 
this as an AE. If the findings contribute to a clinical diagnosis (e.g. hepatitis in case of 
increased liver enzymes), this diagnosis should be recorded as an AE. 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows:  
1. The t est result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. The t est result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention, and/or  
3. The t est result leads to change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or  
4. The t est result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE , 
and/or  
5. The test result is considered to be an AE by the PI or designee . 
For any abnormal test result that meets one of the above conditions except for the last 
condition, the PI or designee will provide a justification in the source documentation for not 
reporting  the abnormal test finding as an AE.  
Each AE shall be evaluated for severity, seriousness, duration, resolution, action taken and its 
association with the study treatment. The participant may be withdrawn or terminated from 
the study depending on the serio usness of the AE(s).

 deviation or violation from  the protocol, considered serious, the patient may be withdrawn 
from the study  at the discretion of the Sponsor or the PI. 
7.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATION  
For the purpose of this study, no distinction will be made between Protocol Violations and 
Deviations. Deviations will be categorized as Clinical Study Report (CSR) non -reportable 
protocol deviation s and a s CSR reportable protocol deviation s. A CSR non -reportable protocol 
deviation includes any deviations that do not necessarily influence the results/outcome of 
primary endpoints or patient  safety. A CSR non -reportable protocol deviation does  not require 
immediate notification to the IEC/IRB , unless otherwis e specified by IEC/IRB  requirements. 
All CSR non -reportable protocol deviations will be noted in monitoring reports and provided 
to the PI by monitor . 
A CSR reportable protocol deviation includes any violation that may influence the 
results/outcome of prim ary endpoints or patient safety. CSR reportable protocol deviations 
must be reported immediately to the IEC/IRB , as specified by the IEC/IRB  requirements. All 
CSR reportable protocol deviations will also be reported to the Sponsor immediately . These 
deviations will also be noted in the monitoring reports and provided to the PI  by monitor . 
Note: Persistent non -compliance of CSR non -reportable protocol deviations may rise to the 
level of being considered  CSR reportable protocol deviations  (i.e., persist ent non -compliance 
with dosing) . 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at a given site in the event of monitoring 
and/or auditing findings of serious or persistent n on-compliance with the protocol, SOPs, 
GCP, and/or applicable regulatory re quirement(s) by the PI/institution.  In all cases of site 
closure due to protocol deviations, the IEC/IRB  and regulatory authorit ies will be informed.  
The CSR  will provide the list of protocol deviation/violations in a separate section. The result 
will be a nalysed for all participants with CSR reportable protocol deviations.  
Protocol deviation s/violation s will include but are not limited to the following : 
 Patients that did not meet entry criteria  but are enrolled into the study ; 
 Patients that received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose ; 
 Patients that received an excluded medication ; 
 Patients that met the discontinuation criteria but continued in the study ; 
 Failure to report within specified time lines of the planned visits ;

7.5 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
As per DMC charter , an independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
monitor the study for safety events. The DMC  will have a formal structure and will operate 
according to a previously agreed upon remit. Safety data will be reviewed regularly by a DMC . 
The DMC will meet on an ad hoc basis if there are at least 3  treatment -related AEs of CTCAE  
Grade ≥3 severity  obser ved in the study. In the event of 2 similar treatment -related AE s of 
CTCAE Grade 4 - or one treatment related AE of CTCAE Grade 5, the DMC will review the 
data and advise the Sponsor  regarding stopping or continuing the study.  
7.6 ADJUDICATION  
An external indep endent Central Adjudication  Committee (CAC) will adjudicate serious 
adverse events (SAEs), including all deaths, that are known or suspected to be a Major Adverse 
Cardiac Events (MACE) or heart failure hospitalizations. The CAC members will be 
independent of the Sponsor, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), and the clinical study 
sites and PI. A detailed CAC Charter and adjudication process will be described in a separate 
document.

procedure for reporting SAEs.  
The PI will permit the Sponsor or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as deemed 
necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During the 
monitoring vi sits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is 
entered by the site, the monitor will review the data for safety information, completeness, 
accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may 
be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction 
will be sent to PIs. The PI and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing information.  
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by signature and date on the study -specific monitoring 
log. 
9.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE AU DIT 
A quality assurance audit of this study  may be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designees. The quality assurance auditor must have access to all medical records, the study -
related files and correspondence, and the informed c onsent documentation that is relevant to 
this clinical trial.  
9.4 PROCEDURES  
9.4.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the course of the clinical trial from the signing of the informed 
consent onwards will be collected, documented, and reported to the Sponsor by  the PI or 
designee according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in this section.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
Any medical condition already present at screening should not be reported as an AE unless 
the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during  the study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE.

 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. electrocardiogram) 
findings that are detected during the study or are present at screening and significantly worsen 
during the s tudy should be reported as AEs. The PI will exercise his or her medical and 
scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an 
error does not require reporting as an AE.  
9.4.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
A ser ious adverse event is any AE occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor's product 
that: 
 Results in death;  
 Is life threatening;  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing inpatient 
hospitalization;  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is another important medical event that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting -Procedures for Investigator:  
Initial Reports:  
Any SAE , or follow -up to a SAE , including dea th due to any cause that occurs to any subject 
from the time the consent is signed through 4-week  following cessation of treatment, whether 
or not related to the Sponsor's product, must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the 
knowledge of the occ urrence to investigational site.  
Additionally, any SAE , considered by the PI or designee, who is a qualified physician , to be

 9.4.3 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a p atient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored 
until the AE has been resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or 
stabilized at a level acceptable to the PI and Medical Expert(s) , until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the 
patient has died.  
9.4.4 Evaluating Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the PI or a medically -qualified investigator with regard to the 
following categories:  
Severity  
The PI or designee will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by recording a 
severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (Version 4.03 or higher)  system will be 
used for reporting and grading AEs  severity of events not classified in CTCAE will be 
assessed according to the following scale:  
 Mild: Event is usually transient and easily tolerated, requiring no special treatment 
and causing no disruptio n of the patient’s normal daily activities.  
 Moderate: Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually improved by simple therapeutic 
measures. Moderate experiences may cause s ome interference with functioning.  
 Severe: Event interrupts the patient’s normal daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Causality  
For all AEs, the PI or designee  will p rovide an assessment of causal relationship to study 
drug. The causality assessment must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the 
patient’s eCRF.  
Causal relationship will be classified according to the following criteria:  
 Unrelated

Version No.: 7.0 
  Possibly related: Suggests that the association of the AE with the study drug is 
unknown. However, the AE is not reasonably supported /explained  by other 
conditions.  
 Probably related: Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with study 
drug administrat ion exists and, based upon the PI’s clinical experience, the 
association of the AE with study drug seems likely.  
 Definitely related: Suggests that a causal relationship exists between the study drug 
and the AE, and other conditions (concomitant illness, pr ogression or expression of 
the disease state, reaction to concomitant medication) do not appear to explain the 
AE. 
 Unknown  
Outcome  
Outcome of AEs will be defined according to the International Council for  Harmonisation  
(ICH) Topic E2B, ICH Guideline, as follows:  
 Recovered/Resolved  
 Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
 Recovering/Resolving  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 Fatal /results in death   
 Unknown  
9.4.5 Expected Adverse Events  
Adverse events reported by 2% or more patients treated with Saroglitazar  magnesium during 
the double -blind, active -controlled study  with pioglitazone as the comparator regardless of 
causality included gastritis and asthenia. In the double -blind placebo con trolled study, AEs 
reported by 2% or more patients treated with Saroglitazar  magnesium included gastritis, 
dyspepsia, pyrexia and pain. The details of AE (s) experienced during the Saroglitazar  
magnesium studies are mentioned in the IB. Principal Investigator(s) are advi sed to provide 
protocol education for patients and caregivers for potential symptoms of adverse effects that 
should be reported to the site/ PI, such as skeletal muscle pain, weight gain, peripheral edema, 
shortness of breath, hypogl ycaemia, etc.

 9.4.6 Pregnancy  
At the Screening Visit and the End of treatment Visit every female subject of childbearing 
potential will be tested for serum pregnancy test and urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at other visits . Women are advised not to beco me pregnant during the study  and for at least 4- 
week  after the end of the treatment  period. Adequate contraceptive measures shall be used to 
prevent pregnancy. Even when contraceptive methods are used, there is a small risk that 
pregnancy might occur. In case a patient becomes pregnant, then she will be withdrawn from 
the study  and adequate monitoring of the patients will be conducted.  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered AEs, it is the responsibility of the PI or 
their designees to report a ny pregnancy or lactation in a patient (spontaneously reported to 
them) that occurs during the study . All patients who become pregnant must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, 
miscarriage and stillbirth must be r eported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
The PI or designee  should report the pregnancy to the Sponsor within 24 hours of being 
notified. The Sponsor wil l then forward the completed Exposure -in-Utero form to the PI.  
9.5 RULES FOR AMENDING P ROTOCOL  
All amendments must be documented, dated and signed by all signatories (or their successors) 
of the original protocol  and then will be submitted to Regulatory Autho rities/IEC/IRB . 
Modification only for logistical or administrative changes may be implemented immediately; 
however, both the IEC/IRB  and the Regulatory Authorit ies will be notified immediately.   
9.6 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
The PI and sub -investigators are  required to provide financial disclosure information to the 
Sponsor to permit the Sponsor to fulfil their obligations. In addition, the PI/sub-investigator  
must commit to promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the 
study and for a period of 1 year after the completion of the study.

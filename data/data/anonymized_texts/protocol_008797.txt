OVERALL  RATIONALE  FOR  PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  01: 
 
Therefore, a decision was made by Bristol -Myers Squibb in September 2021 to stop the study. 
Importantly, there is no change to the understanding of the safety profile of nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab and trans -arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of 
patients with intermediate -stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  
Protocol  Amendment 01 describes the modification to study  procedures. All participants must be 
re-consented  upon  approval  and implementation  of Protocol  Amendment  01. These  changes  affect 
all participants and should be implemented when Protocol  Amendment 01 is implemented at  the 
site. 
Key changes  in Protocol  Amendment  01 include:  
• Details of closure of  the study  with provision for participants currently on treatment or in 
the follow -up period to continue in the study  as per the current protocol.  
• The study  will be unblinded.  
• Removal  of placebo  infusions for  participants  in Arms  B and C. 
• Removal of pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity (IMG), biomarker, and patient - 
reported outcome (PRO) assessments. Only safety assessments will be conducted . 
• Removal  of on-study imaging  assessments.  Sites should  continue imaging assessments as 
per local standard of care.  
• Removal  of study -related  efficacy  assessments.  Sites  should  continue  efficacy  assessments 
as per local standard of care.  
• Align  dose modification  criteria  and immuno -oncology  agent  management  algorithms  with 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0.  
• Add the collection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) 
infection -related adverse events (AEs) and serious  adverse events (SAEs) to evaluate the 
impact  of SARS -CoV -2 on participant safety  and add coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID - 
19) vaccination information for study participants.  
• Incorporate country -specific information for France, Czech Republic, and China; 
incorporate  additional  updates  to improve  alignment  across  protocol  sections  and/or  clarify 
expectations for assessments, sample collections, and treatment administration.  
 
This amendment  incorporates  the changes  from  the approved  Administrative  Letter  02, 03 and 04 
that are detailed  in the Document  History but  not listed  in the Summary of Key changes  below.

1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Multi -center, Double -blinded, Placebo -controlled Phase 3 Study 
of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, Nivolumab Monotherapy, or Placebo in Combination with  
Trans -arterial ChemoEmbolization (TACE) in Patients with Intermediate -stage Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (HCC)  
Short  Title:  Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  or Nivolumab  or Placebo  Plus TACE  in 
Intermediate -stage Liver Cancer  
Study Phase:  3 
Rationale:  
Nivolumab is currently in development and has been registered in a variety of tumors. 
Development of nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was initiated in 2012 with 
CA209040, which is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy  of nivolumab in 
advanced HCC. Data from the dose -escalation and expansion cohorts of this study led to the 
approval  of nivolumab  for the second -line (2L) therapy  of advanced  HCC  patients  who progressed 
on or were intolerant to sorafenib.  
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action offers the possibility 
of an additive  to synergistic  response,  and therefore  represents  an attractive  therapeutic  option  that 
has proven  to be effective in  several  cancer  types.  In advanced  HCC,  data from  CA209040  shows 
promising results of the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab as 2L therapy, with durable 
antitumor activity  and an acceptable and manageable  safety  profile and led to the Food and Drug 
Administration accelerated approval of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the 
treatment of HCC patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib. These data provide 
support  for evaluation  of nivolumab  and nivolumab  and ipilimumab  in an earlier  stage  of HCC  (ie, 
intermediate -stage HCC).  
Chemoembolization  is recommended  and widely  used for the treatment  of intermediate -stage  HCC 
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage B), with conventional trans -arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) being  the most widely  practiced embolotherapy for HCC. However, 
TACE is considered a palliative treatment and variable degrees of liver function impairment are 
observed post -TACE. The most common adverse effects of TACE include signs of liver injury 
and hepatic  insufficiency.  Elevated  aminotransferases  and negative  changes  in liver function  tests 
are seen in almost  all patients.  The impact  of treatment  on liver function  is problematic,  particularly 
for patients who undergo repeated TACE sessions. The majority of patients with HCCs have 
underlying cirrhosis and preserving liver function is important. Physicians have to consider the 
risks of TACE and avoid adverse effects that will outweigh survival benefit. These have led to 
efforts to define when continuing TACE will be an ineffective therapeutic option.  
The palliative nature of TACE and the need for a safer alternative for better liver function 
preservation  has driven  efforts  to improve  outcomes  with TACE  in patients  with 
intermediate -stage  HCC.  Over  the past decade,  significant  effort  has been  focused  on clinical  trials  
Clinical  Protocol

 combining TACE with systemic therapies, including sorafenib, brivanib, and orantinib. To date, 
these studies have been unsuccessful.  
Despite these failures, the research on TACE is still ongoing. In particular, deeper investigation 
into combination strategies is recommended. The avidity with which this effort is pursued is 
reflected  in the number  of ongoing  TACE  studies.  There  are currently  over 100 studies  registered 
on ClinicalTrials.gov exploring combinations of TACE with systemic agents, including 
immunotherapy. At present, however, TACE remains the sole recommended treatment for 
intermediate -stage  HCC.  No systemic  agent  has been  successfully  developed for this stage of  the 
disease.  
Current data support the potential of immunotherapy for HCC therapy. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors have clinical activity and are tolerable in advanced HCC, supporting their potential for 
use in other stages of the disease. Data on loco -regional therapy indicate that these procedures 
induce  changes  in the immune  environment  that suggest  a synergistic  potential  for the combination 
of loco -regional therapy with immunotherapy. The preliminary data from tremelimumab in 
combination with ablation and from nivolumab in combination with TACE indicate that the 
combinations are feasible and tolerable. The combination of TACE with ipilimumab and/or 
nivolumab  has the potential  to address  the need  for better  therapeutic  options  for 
intermediate -stage HCC, and support the further investigation of ipilimumab and nivolumab in 
combination with TACE in this setting.  
 
 
Therefore,  a 
decision was made by Bristol -Myers Squibb in September 2021 to stop the study. Importantly, 
there  is no change  to the understanding  of the safety  profile  of nivolumab  alone  or in combination 
with ipilimumab and TACE for the treatment of patients with intermediate -stage HCC.  
As of 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment for new participants was closed. The number of participants 
randomized was 26 as of 14 -Oct-2021. Per Protocol Amendment 01, there are no formal 
hypotheses  or efficacy  objectives  for CA20974W.  Only  safety  assessments  will be conducted. 
Following  unblinding,  study  participants  who are currently  receiving  nivolumab  ± ipilimumab  and 
tolerating  study  treatment  may continue  to receive  study  drug;  however,  placebo  infusions  will no 
longer be administered.  
Study Population:  
Male or female adults ( ≥ 18 years or age of majority) with histologically confirmed HCC who 
have intermediate -stage  HCC by  BCLC  staging,  have not previously received  TACE, and  whose 
tumor characteristics exceed the Beyond Milan and Up -to-7 (BMU7) criteria. Participants must 
not have extrahepatic spread (EHS), and disease characteristics must include no regional lymph 
node involvement, no portal vein thrombosis, and no macrovascular invasion (MVI).

 Objectives and Endpoints:  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, no analyses of efficacy, quality of life/patient -reported 
outcomes, healthcare resource utilization, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics, or 
immunogenicity  are planned.  Only  safety  assessments  will be conducted.  Previously  collected 
biomarker samples may be analyzed, but no further biomarker collections are planned with this 
amended protocol.  
 
Objective  Endpoint  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Arm A, 
Arm B, and Arm C in all treated participants.  • Incidence  of AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  AEs leading  to 
treatment discontinuation, and laboratory 
abnormalities in all treated participants.  
Abbreviations:  AE = adverse  event;  SAE  = serious  adverse  event.  
 
 
Overall  Design:  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, randomized Phase 3 study of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in  combination  with TACE  and nivolumab in combination  with TACE vs placebo in 
combination with TACE in participants with intermediate -stage HCC. Participants must have 
tumor characteristics that exceed the BMU7 criteria, no EHS, no regional lymph node 
involvement, no portal vein thrombosis, and no MVI must be present. As of 22 -Sep-2021, 
enrollment for new participants was closed. The number of participants randomized was 26 as of 
14-Oct-2021. Per Protocol Amendment 01, there are no formal hypotheses or efficacy 
objectives for CA20974W. Only safety assessments will be conducted. Following unblinding, 
study participants who are currently receiving nivolumab ± ipilimumab and tolerating study 
treatment may continue to receive study drug; however, placebo infusions will no longer be 
administered.  
The study  will consist  of 3 periods:  Screening,  Treatment,  and Follow -up. A complete  list of study 
required procedures are provided within the Schedule of Activities section in the main protocol.  
After  signing  an informed  consent  form,  participants  who have  not previously  received  TACE  will 
be evaluated for eligibility. If participants are eligible for receiving TACE and meet other 
eligibility criteria, they  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio  to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus TACE (Arm A), nivolumab and ipilimumab placebo plus TACE (Arm B), or nivolumab 
placebo and ipilimumab placebo plus TACE (Arm  C). Since TACE is the only recommended 
standard  of care in clinical  practice  guidelines  for the intended  population,  TACE  plus nivolumab 
placebo  and ipilimumab  placebo  will be used as a control.  Both  conventional  TACE  and 
TACE with drug -eluding beads (DEB -TACE) are acceptable treatment modalities in this study 
(see the TACE  Procedure  section  within  the main  protocol  for restrictions  on TACE  use) and first 
TACE will be administered 7 days (+ 3 days) after study drug administration. Stratification will 
occur by  albumin -bilirubin  (ALBI) grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2), baseline alpha -fetoprotein (AFP) 
level  (< 400 ng/mL vs ≥ 400 ng/mL), and Region  (West [Europe, Americas, and Australia] vs 
Japan vs rest of Asia).

• Arm C: Nivolumab  placebo  Q2W  and ipilimumab  placebo  Q6W  plus TACE  
 
Per Protocol Amendment 01, this study will be unblinded and participants randomized to 
Arm B and Arm C will no longer receive placebo infusions following unblinding . 
All randomized participants will receive treatment until progression as assessed by investigator, 
unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal, for a maximum duration of treatment of 2 years. 
Participants  will also receive  on-demand  TACE  during  the trial and can continue  to receive  TACE 
until they are not eligible for further TACE (see TACE Procedure section in main protocol). 
Participants in any arm may be treated with study therapy beyond progression as assessed by 
investigator  under  protocol -defined  conditions  (see Treatment  Beyond  Progression  section  in main 
protocol).

 3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study  Rationale  
Nivolumab is currently in development and has been registered in a variety of 
tumors.1Development of nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was initiated in 2012 
with CA209040,  which  is a Phase  1/2 clinical  trial evaluating  the safety  and efficacy  of nivolumab 
in advanced2Data  from  the dose-escalation  and expansion  cohorts  of this study  led to the approval 
of nivolumab for the second -line (2L) therapy of advanced HCC patients who progressed on or 
were intolerant to sorafenib.  
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action offers the possibility 
of an additive  to synergistic  response,  and therefore  represents  an attractive  therapeutic  option  that 
has proven  to be effective in several  cancer  types1In advanced  HCC,  data from  CA209040  shows 
promising results of the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab as 2L therapy, with durable 
antitumor activity  and an acceptable and manageable  safety  profile and led to the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  accelerated  approval  of nivolumab  in combination  with ipilimumab  for the 
treatment of  HCC patients who have been previously treated with  sorafenib.3 These data provide 
support  for evaluation  of nivolumab  and nivolumab  and ipilimumab  in an earlier  stage  of HCC  (ie, 
intermediate -stage HCC).  
3.1.1  Research Hypothesis  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
Treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab in combination with trans -arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) will improve time to TACE progression (TTTP) and/or overall 
survival (OS) compared to TACE in participants with intermediate stage HCC.  
3.1.2  Changes Per Protocol Amendment 01 
 
 
Therefore,  a 
decision was made by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) in September 2021 to stop the study. 
Importantly,  there  is no change  to the understanding  of the safety  profile  of nivolumab  alone  or in 
combination with ipilimumab and TACE for the treatment of patients with intermediate -stage 
HCC.  
As of 22-Sep-2021,  the following  measures  were  put into effect:  
• Enrollment  of new participants  was closed.  
• Participants  who signed  study  consent  prior  to this notification  and were  undergoing 
screening were permitted to be randomized to study treatment.  
• Participants  currently  on treatment  were  allowed  to continue  study  treatment.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  44 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 • For participants currently in survival follow -up, it is at the discretion of the investigator 
and participant whether to continue follow -up until Protocol Amendment 01 is approved 
by the relevant Health Authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent 
Ethics Committees (IECs) at the site.  
 
Protocol  Amendment 01 describes the modification to study  procedures. All participants must be 
re-consented  upon  approval  and implementation  of Protocol  Amendment  01. These  changes  affect 
all participants and should be implemented when Protocol  Amendment 01 is implemented at  the 
site. 
Key changes  in Protocol  Amendment  01 include:  
• Details  of closure of  the study, with  provision for participants  currently  on treatment  or in 
the follow -up period to continue in the study  per the current protocol amendment.  
• The study  will be unblinded.  
• Removal  of placebo  infusions  for participants  in Arms  B and C. 
• Removal of pha rmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity (IMG), biomarker, and patient - 
reported outcome (PRO) assessments. Only safety assessments will be conducted . 
• Removal  of on-study  imaging  assessments.  Sites  should  continue  imaging  assessments  per 
local standard of care.  
• Removal  of study -related  efficacy  assessments.  Sites  should  continue  efficacy  assessments 
per local standard of care.  
• Align  dose modification  criteria  and immuno -oncology  agent  management  algorithms  with 
the current National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
• Add the collection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) 
infection -related adverse events (AEs) and serious  adverse events (SAEs) to evaluate the 
impact  of SARS -CoV -2 on participant safety  and add coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID - 
19) vaccine information for study participants.  
• Incorporate country -specific information for France, Czech Republic, and China; 
incorporate  additional  updates  to improve  alignment  across  protocol  sections  and/or  clarify 
expectations for assessments, sample collections, and treatment administration.  
 
Changes  instituted  in Protocol  Amendment  01 should  override  any existing  protocol  requirements 
in the event of any apparent discrepancies.

 3.2 Background  
3.2.1  The Unmet  Need  in Intermediate -Stage  Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  
HCC is the seventh most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of 
cancer -related death. There are more than 800,000 new cases a year and HCC causes 
approximately  700,000  to 800,000  deaths  annually.  Furthermore,  its incidence  and prevalence  are 
increasing  worldwide.  The disease  shows  wide  regional  variations  in incidence  rates  and etiology. 
HCC  is particularly  prevalent  in Asian  countries  relative  to Western  countries.  Over  80% of HCC 
cases occur in Africa and Asia. China alone accounts for more than 50% of cases worldwide.4,5 
Age-standardized  (world)  incidence  rates  in South -Eastern  to Eastern  Asia range  from  21.0 to 26.8 
per 100,000, distinctly higher than the rates in Northern Europe (EU) and North America, which 
range from 6.6  to 10.1 per 100,000. Age -standardized (world) mortality  rates are similarly much 
higher  in South  and North  Eastern  Asia (17.2  to 34.0 per 100,000)  than in Northern  EU and North 
America (3.1 to 4.4 per 100,000).6 
Virtually any cause of liver damage that leads to cirrhosis can predispose an individual to HCC. 
The main  risk factors  for primary  liver cancer  (PLC)  are chronic  infection  with hepatitis  B 
virus  (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), aflatoxin B1 -contaminated foodstuffs, heavy alcohol 
intake, obesity, and type  2 diabetes mellitus.7 Once cirrhosis is established, the annual incidence 
of HCC is 3% to 5% and one -third of these individuals will develop HCC over their lifetime.8 
Most cases of HCC arise in eastern Asia and sub -Saharan Africa, where the dominant risk factor 
is chronic  HBV  infection, together with  exposure to aflatoxin B1.9 In contrast, in North America, 
EU, and Japan, HCV infection is the main risk factor, together with alcohol use.10 
Intermediate -stage HCC patients belong to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage B. 
The stage consists of patients with preserved liver function and performance status who are not 
eligible for curative treatments, such as surgery and liver transplantation. It includes a 
heterogeneous patient population that presents with a wide range of tumor extension and liver 
function (Child -Pugh compensated A5 cirrhosis to decompensated B9).11 
Chemoembolization  is recommended  for the treatment  of intermediate -stage  HCC  (BCLC 
Stage B).  Transcatheter  arterial  therapies  for HCC  were  first described  in the 1970s12 and include 
a variety of techniques (eg, TACE, bland embolization, trans -arterial embolization [TAE]). The 
use of TACE was adopted into practice guidelines based on 2 meta -analyses13,14 and 2 seminal 
placebo -controlled  randomized  clinical  trials  (RCTs)15,16 published  in 2002.  TACE  has since  been 
widely  used,  with conventional  TACE  being  the most  widely  practiced  embolotherapy  for HCC.12 
The largest global HCC observational study (GIDEON) suggests that nearly half of all HCC 
patients receive TACE at some timepoint in the course of the disease.17 Real-world data and 
clinical experience demonstrate TACE to be the method of choice for the treatment of 
intermediate -stage HCC, applied in about 50% to 60% of patients.18,19 
However, TACE is considered a palliative treatment. Significant tumor response is achieved in 
17-61.9%  in individuals  administered  TACE,  but TACE  often  fails to induce  complete  necrosis  of 
the lesion.  Even  in cases  where  complete  ablation  is achieved,  tumors  commonly  recur  post-TACE

 liver, it may be detrimental in cancer -bearing host, as it might prevent an adequate immune 
response against malignant cells.36,37,38 Moreover, the intrahepatic immunosuppressive 
environment  is exacerbated  by the chronic  inflammation  that underlies  the development  of fibrosis 
and cirrhosis. This chronic inflammation, characterized by the continued expression of different 
cytokines  and recruitment  of immune  cells to the liver,  may contribute  to HCC  carcinogenesis  and 
disease progression by further activating immunosuppressive mechanisms, which results in an 
inability to escalate a meaningful antitumor response.36,39 Indeed, immune changes reported in 
HCC, such  as tumor -associated  antigen -specific  CD8+  T-cell immune responses, T -cell infiltration 
after loco-regional  therapy,  T regulatory  cell (Treg)  intratumoral  accumulation,  and 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulation have been correlated with disease 
progression and poor survival.40,41,42 Overcoming this immune tolerance is thus an important 
challenge in the search for an effective immunotherapy against HCC.  
Given the unique immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, HCC is an attractive target for 
immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. In HCC, the negative regulatory 
target -immune  checkpoints,  such as CTLA -4, PD-1, and its ligand  PD-L1, are often  overexpressed 
to escape the host immune surveillance, and thus, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
can reactivate tumor -specific  T cells and develop  an antitumor  effect  by suppressing 
checkpoint -mediated signaling.38,43,44 
The administration  of CTLA -4 inhibitor  has been  demonstrated  to increase  antitumor  immunity  in 
a murine  HCC  model, with  a tumor rejection  rate of 90% and a curative  rate of 50% in metastatic 
HCC.45 Additionally,  the clinical  benefit  of anti-CTLA -4 as a single -agent  has been  demonstrated 
in a Phase 2, non -controlled, open -label, multicenter trial.46 In this trial, tremelimumab, a 
monoclonal  antibody  that blocks CTLA -4, was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously  
(IV) every  90 days in 20 participants  with HCV -associated  HCC  with Child -Pugh  Stage  A (57%) 
and Stage  B (43%)  who failed  traditional  HCC  therapy.  In terms  of antitumor  responses,  this study 
reported a partial response (PR) rate of 17.6%, a disease control rate (DCR) of 76.4%, a time to 
progression (TTP) of 6.48 months, and a median OS of 8.2 months. Regarding safety, 
tremelimumab  was generally  well tolerated,  with few participants  experiencing  Grade  3 disabling 
adverse events (AEs), being the most common side effects observed fatigue and anorexia, which 
occurred in almost one -half of participants. A remarkable rise in serum transaminases was 
observed after the first dose in more than half of the participants (Grade 3 or higher in 45% of 
cases), but with no other signs of liver dysfunction.  
Similar to the role of CTLA -4 pathway inhibition, the role of PD -1/PD -L1 pathway in HCC has 
been  investigated.  PD-1 expression  on effector  phase  cluster  of differentiation  (CD)  8-positive  (+) 
T cells is increased in patients with HCC compared to cirrhotic patients or healthy controls.47 
Indeed,  patients  with HCC  and higher  numbers  of tumor  infiltrating  and circulating  PD-1+, CD8+ 
T cells showed  earlier  and more  frequent  disease  progression  after hepatic  resection.  PD-L1 is also 
highly  expressed  on peritumoral  stromal  cells (Kupffer  cells,  liver sinusoidal  endothelial  
cells [LSECs],  and monocytes) as well as  cancer  cells, promoting a PD -L1/PD -1 pathway -driven 
inhibition of antitumor T -cell responses.48 These preclinical findings are further supported by 
results from CA209040, the first trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy of  an anti -PD-1 agent in 
advanced  HCC.  This Phase  1/2 study included  262 participants with unselected  PD-L1 tumors,

 including both treatment -naive and pretreated participants. Following confirmation of  safety and 
tolerability in the dose -escalation phase, all participants in the dose -expansion phase received IV 
nivolumab  3 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  (Q2W) until  disease  progression  or limiting toxicity. This trial 
showed  convincing  signs  of efficacy,  with objective  tumor  responses  ranging  from  15-20% in the 
escalation and expansion cohorts. Notably, responses were observed regardless of PD -L1 
expression and were similar across different etiologies, and both in sorafenib -naive and  
sorafenib -exposed participants. Remarkably,  responses were meaningful and durable (lasting for 
a median  of 17 months)  and the median  OS in the sorafenib -treated  group  was 15.6 months  in the 
expansion cohort, which compares favorably with sorafenib historical data (10.7 months)49 and 
with results  of the recently  approved  2L molecular -targeted  agents  (median  OS ranging  from  8.5 to 
10.6 months).50,51,52 Overall, nivolumab was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety 
profile.  Hepatic  toxicity,  consisting  primarily  of transaminase  elevations,  was generally  mild,  with 
Grade 3 or 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations 
observed in 7 (9%) and 7 (4%) of sorafenib -naive and pretreated participants, respectively; 
bilirubin  elevations were infrequent (7 participants overall)  and mostly mild, with  only 1 Grade 3 
or 4 elevation reported. In addition to nivolumab, other immune checkpoint inhibitors as single 
agents are being evaluated in HCC. Durvalumab (an anti -PD-L1 antibody) has shown clinical 
activity  in a small  Phase  1/2 study  (N = 40), with response  rates  of 10% and a median  OS of 
13.2 months.53 Similarly, most recently, pembrolizumab (an anti -PD-1 antibody) has also 
demonstrated  clinical  activity  as 2L therapy  with response  rates  of 17% and a median  OS of 
12.9 months  in a Phase  1/2 including  104 participants  with advanced  HCC.54 
Thus, there is a substantial body of scientific evidence that supports the rationale for the use of 
immune -based approaches to treat HCC. This theoretical rationale is further supported by a 
growing amount of clinical evidence, which indicates that immune checkpoint inhibitors are 
effective treatments for patients with advanced HCC.43,44 
3.2.3  Rationale for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Combinations  
While the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors as single agents in HCC is promising, the 
majority of the patients remain refractory, due to the immunosuppressive mechanisms of HCC, 
comprising multiple humoral mediators and suppressive checkpoint molecules. Combination 
therapies may improve antitumor efficacy, and a number of studies evaluating different 
combination strategies are currently ongoing in the HCC field.38,55 
Owing to the multiplicity of mechanisms used by tumors to evade the immune response, 
combining different immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action is an 
appealing approach to treat HCC, which offers the possibility of an additive to synergistic 
response. The most relevant example is dual CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 blockade. PD -1 and 
CTLA -4 are both co-inhibitory  molecules,  but evidence  suggests  that they use distinct  mechanisms 
to limit  T cell activation.  Preliminary  indirect  data from  peripheral  T cell assessments  suggest  that 
a given T -cell checkpoint inhibitor may modulate host immune cell phenotypes, rendering them 
more susceptible to alternate checkpoint inhibitors and thereby enhancing antitumor 
activity.38,43,55

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Preclinical  data indicate  that the combination  of PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptor  blockade is  synergistic 
and may improve antitumor activity:  
• In vitro, combinations of nivolumab and ipilimumab increase interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) 
production 2 - to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).53 
• Several  preclinical  syngeneic  tumor  models  showed  that combined  treatment  with anti-murine 
PD-1 and anti-murine  CTLA -4 monoclonal  antibody  resulted  in increased  antitumor  responses 
over either monoclonal antibody alone, which were greatest when the antibodies were given  
together  rather  than sequentially.53 In some  instances,  combined  treatment  resulted  in 
tumor -free mice that exhibited long -lived tumor immunity when re -challenged with tumor 
cells.53 
• In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or PD -1 antibodies 
increased  the proportion  of CTLA -4 and PD-1-expressing  CD4/CD8  tumor -infiltrating 
T effector  cells,  and dual blockade  increased  tumor  infiltration  of T effector  cells and decreased 
intratumoral Tregs, as compared to either agent alone, suggesting a synergistic effect.56 
 
In the clinic, combination therapies with monoclonal antibodies blocking PD -1 or PD -L1 and 
CTLA -4 have resulted in higher response rates and improved outcomes over monotherapy in a 
number of solid tumors.1 In HCC, both durvalumab and tremelimumab57 and nivolumab and 
ipilimumab3 combinations were evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials as 2L therapy in advanced 
HCC.  While  data are still limited,  preliminary  results  demonstrate  the antitumoral  activity  of these 
combinations, and show an acceptable safety profile, providing scientific rationale to further 
evaluate the role of dual checkpoint blockade in the treatment of advanced HCC.  
Please  see Section  3.2.7  (Nivolumab  Combined  with Ipilimumab  Clinical  Activity)  and 
Section  3.2.8  (Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab in HCC) for information on the clinical 
activity and safety of the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab.  
3.2.4  Nivolumab  Mechanism  of Action  
Cancer immunotherapy  rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized  as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immunosurveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses.58,59,60 
Current immunotherapy  efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system  to 
tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating  regulatory  checkpoints  of the immune  system.  T-cell stimulation  is a complex  process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negative co -stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by  the T -cell receptor (TCR).61 Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T -cell activation and tolerance.  
PD-1 is a member  of the CD28  family  of T-cell co-stimulatory  receptors  that also includes  CD28, 
CTLA -4, inducible  T cell co-stimulator  (ICOS),  and B- and T-lymphocyte  attenuator  (BTLA).62

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  50 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 PD-1 signaling  has been  shown  to inhibit  CD28 -mediated  upregulation  of interleukin  (IL)-2, 
IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ, and B-cell lymphoma -extra  large  (Bcl-xL). PD-1 expression  also been  noted 
to inhibit T cell activation and expansion of previously activated cells. Evidence for a negative 
regulatory role of PD -1 comes from studies of PD -1 deficient mice, which develop a variety of 
autoimmune phenotypes.63 These results suggest that PD -1 blockade has the potential to activate 
anti-self T-cell responses,  but these  responses  are variable  and dependent  upon  various  host genetic 
factors.  Thus,  PD-1 deficiency  or inhibition  is not accompanied  by a universal  loss of tolerance  to 
self-antigens.  
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558) is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMab; 
immunoglobulin  G4 [IgG4] -S228P)  that targets  the PD-1 CD279  cell surface  membrane  receptor. 
Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, PD -L1 and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD -L2), results in the 
downregulation of lymphocyte activation.  
In vitro,  nivolumab  binds  to PD-1 with high affinity  (half -maximal  effective  concentration  [EC50] 
0.39-2.62 nM) and inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 (half -maximal 
inhibitory  concentration  [IC50] ±  1 nM).  Nivolumab  binds  specifically  to PD-1 and not to related 
members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTLA. Blockade of the PD -1 
pathway by nivolumab results in a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN -γ 
release  in the MLR.  Using  a cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  re-stimulation  assay  with human  peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs), the effect of nivolumab on antigen -specific recall response 
indicates  that nivolumab  augmented  IFN-γ secretion  from  CMV  specific  memory  T cells in a dose- 
dependent manner vs isotype -matched control. In vivo blockade of PD -1 by a murine analog of 
nivolumab  enhances  the anti-tumor  immune  response  and results  in tumor  rejection  in several  
immunocompetent  mouse  tumor  models  (MC38,  SA1/N,  and PAN02).64 
3.2.5  Ipilimumab Mechanism  of Action  
CTLA -4, an activation -induced T -cell surface molecule, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin  (Ig) superfamily  that competes  with CD28  for B7. CTLA -4 mediated  signals  are 
inhibitory  and turn off T cell-dependent  immune  responses.65 Ipilimumab  (BMS -734016)  is a fully 
human  monoclonal  IgG1 κ that binds  to the CTLA -4 antigen  expressed  on a subset  of T cells from 
human  and nonhuman  primates.  The proposed  mechanism  of action  for ipilimumab  is interference 
of the interaction  of CTLA -4 with B7 molecules  on antigen -presenting  cells,  with subsequent  
blockade  of the inhibitory  modulation  of T-cell activation  promoted  by the CTLA -4:B7 
interaction.  
3.2.6  Nivolumab  Monotherapy  for Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  
Nivolumab  is currently  being  evaluated  in 3 settings  for HCC  in BMS -sponsored  studies  for HCC 
(refer  to the nivolumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  [IB]1 for additional  details).  CA209040  is a Phase 
1/2 non -comparative study of nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab or 
cabozantinib)  in participants  with advanced  HCC  with or without  chronic  viral hepatitis.  For first- 
line (1L) advanced  HCC,  CA209459  is a Phase  3 randomized study  of nivolumab  vs sorafenib  as 
1L treatment in participants with advanced HCC.  For early -stage HCC, CA2099DX is a Phase 3

 randomized,  double -blind  study  of adjuvant  nivolumab  vs placebo  for participants  with HCC  who

CA209040 showed that monotherapy with nivolumab in participants with advanced HCC 
produced  durable  responses  and disease  stabilization,  irrespective  of HCC  etiology  and regardless 
of prior therapy with sorafenib. Updated data from a 16 -Nov-2017 database lock (minimum

objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

who received  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  IV Q2W.  Responses  were  observed  across  participants  with both 
viral and non-viral HCC.  
despite the longer follow -up, a median DOR was not yet reached (95% CI: 9.69 months, not

participants is promising, with  a median OS of  15.15 months (95% CI: 13.04, 18.23). In addition 
to the clinical  benefit  observed  in 2L participants,  efficacy  data in sorafenib -naive  (1L) participants 
(n = 80) are even more compelling: ORR, 20% (95% CI: 11.9, 30.4) by BICR -confirmed 
RECIST v1.1;  median  DOR,  not yet reached  (95%  CI: 11.1 months,  NA);  and median  OS, 
26.68 months (95% CI: 16.56, 35.48). Safety data support an acceptable and manageable safety 
profile (data on file).  
These data indicate that nivolumab monotherapy has clinically meaningful antitumor activity in 
patients with advanced HCC with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. The observed 
durable  responses  and substantially  longer OS relative to OS data from  targeted  agents,  including 
historical   data  for  sorafenib   (10.7   months),49  regorafenib   (10.6   months),50 
lenvatinib  (13.6 months),66 and cabozantinib (10.2 months),67 provide persuasive evidence to 
further evaluate nivolumab in HCC.  
3.2.7  Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab Clinical  Activity  
Multiple clinical studies have evaluated nivolumab combined with ipilimumab at different doses 
and schedules.  The following  information  describes  the results  of initial  early  phase  clinical  studies 
that were the basis for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination regimens that have been 
explored in late -phase clinical development. Additional information as well as a detailed 
description of  the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab is 
provided in the IB.1 
In the Phase 1 study  CA209004, ascending doses of  nivolumab have been studied concomitantly 
with ascending  doses  of ipilimumab in  participants  with unresectable  or metastatic melanoma. In 
each arm in this  multi -arm study,  ipilimumab  was administered  once  every 3  weeks  (Q3W)  for 
4 doses  with nivolumab  administered  once  Q3W  for 8 doses.  Starting  at week  24, ipilimumab  and 
nivolumab  were  administered  once  every  12 weeks  (Q12W)  for 8 doses.  The 3 initial 
dose-escalation  cohorts  consisted  of Cohort  1 (nivolumab  0.3 mg/kg  + ipilimumab  3 mg/kg; 
n = 14), Cohort  2 (nivolumab  1.0 mg/kg  + ipilimumab  3 mg/kg;  n = 17), and Cohort  3 (nivolumab 
3 mg/kg + ipilimumab  3 mg/kg;  n = 6).  Later,  the study  was amended  to include  Cohort  2a which

 evaluated  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  (n = 16). The primary  objective  was to assess 
safety/tolerability; the secondary objective was to assess preliminary efficacy.  
Of the 52 participants  evaluable  for response  as of the 15-Feb-2013  clinical  cut-off in CA209004, 
21 participants  (40%)  had an objective  response  by modified  World  Health  Organization  (mWHO) 
criteria. In an additional 2 participants (4%), there was an unconfirmed objective response. In 
Cohort  1 (0.1 mg/kg  nivolumab  + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab),  3 out of 14 evaluable  participants  had an 
objective  response  by mWHO  (21%),  including  1 complete  response  (CR)  and 2 PRs. In Cohort  2 
(1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipilimumab), 9  out of 17 (53%) evaluable participants had an 
objective response by mWHO, including 3 CRs (18%) and 6 PRs (35%). In Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg 
nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab), 6 out of 15 (40%) evaluable participants had an objective 
response by mWHO, including 1 CR (7%) and 5  PRs (33%). In Cohort 3  (3 mg/kg nivolumab +  
3 mg/kg ipilimumab), 3 out of 6 (50%) evaluable participants had an objective response by 
mWHO, all 3 of which were PRs (50%).  
Preliminary analysis revealed 16 of  the 52 evaluable participants (31%) had > 80% reduction in 
the size of target  tumor lesions  by the week  12 evaluation.  This is compared to < 2% for 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab monotherapy based on CA184020 (N = 540) and < 3% for nivolumab monotherapy 
based on CA209003 (N = 94, 0.1 -10 mg/kg).  
The following dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed: in Cohort 1, Grade 3 elevated 
AST/ALT  (1 participant);  in Cohort  2, Grade  3 uveitis  (1 participant)  and Grade  3 elevated  
AST/ALT (1 participant) and in Cohort 3, Grade 4 elevated lipase (2 participants), and Grade 3 
elevated lipase (1 participant). Based on these data, Cohort 2 was identified as the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohort 3 exceeded the MTD.  
A total of 53 melanoma participants were treated with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in 
CA209004  across  Cohorts  1, 2, 2a, and 3. At least 1 AE, regardless  of causality,  has been  reported 
in 98% of participants  treated.  The most  common  (reported  at > 10% incidence)  treatment -related 
AEs  (any  Grade   93%;   Grade   3-4  53%)   are  rash  (55%;   4%),   pruritus   (47%;   0%), 
vitiligo  (11%;  0%), fatigue  (38%;  0%), pyrexia  (21%;  0%), diarrhea  (34%;  6%), 
nausea  (21%;  0%),  vomiting  (11%;  2%),  ALT  increased  (21%;  11%),  AST  increased  (21%;  13%),  
lipase  increased  (19%;  13%),  amylase  increased  (15%;  6%),  headache  (11%;  0%),  and cough  
(13%; 0%). 
The majority of AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were Grade 3 or 4 
(reported  in 11 of 53 participants,  21%).  Grade  3 events  included  lipase  increased,  ALT  increased, 
AST increased, troponin I increased, colitis, diverticular perforation, pancreatitis, tachycardia, 
renal failure acute, choroiditis, autoimmune disorder, and pneumonitis. One participant each 
discontinued  due to Grade  4 events  of blood  creatinine  increased  and AST  increased.  No 
drug-related  deaths  were  reported.53 
The combination  of nivolumab  with ipilimumab  is being  studied  in the Phase  1 study  CA209016. 
Participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC; Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80%; 
untreated or any number of prior therapies) were randomized to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg +

 IV Q3W for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV Q2W until progression/toxicity. The 
primary objective was to assess safety/tolerability; secondary objective was to assess antitumor 
activity.  
Participants  were  randomized  to N3 + I1 (n = 47) and N1 + I3 (n = 47). Approximately 
half (n = 46; 51%) had prior systemic therapy  (N3 + I1: 22; N1 + I3: 26).  
After  a median  follow -up of 22.3 months,  the confirmed  ORR  per RECIST  v1.1 was 40.4% 
(N = 47) in both arms N3 + I1 and N1 + I3; 42.1% (n = 8) and 36.8% (n = 7) had an ongoing 
response,   with  a  median   DOR   of  88.7  weeks   (95%   CI:  37.14,   NA)  and 
85.9 weeks  (95%  CI: 35.14,  NA), respectively.  Median  progression -free survival  (PFS)  was 
7.7 months (95%  CI: 3.71, 14.29) and 9.4 months (95%  CI: 5.62, 18.63) in Arms N3  + I1 and 
N1 +  I3, respectively. OS at 12 months was 80.9% and 85.0% in arms N3 + I1 and N1 + I3, 
respectively, and at 24 months was 67.3% and 69.6%, respectively.  
The safety of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab was assessed in study CA209016. 
Treatment -related  AEs were  seen in 88  of 94  participants  (94%),  including  43 of 47  (92%)  in 
N3 + I1 and 45 of 47 (96%)  in N1 + I3. The most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs in N3 + I1 
included fatigue  (66%), cough (53.2%), and arthralgia (51.1%), the majority of which were 
Grade  1-2. The most frequently reported drug -related AEs in N1 + I3 included fatigue (74.5%), 
nausea (55.3%), and diarrhea (53.2%). The majority were Grade 1 -2. 
Treatment -related  AEs leading  to discontinuation  (31.9%  vs 10.6%),  and treatment -related  serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs;  34% vs 23.4%)  occurred  more  commonly  in participants  in the N1 + I3 arm 
than in the N3 + I1 arm, respectively.3 
CA209012 was a multi -arm Phase 1b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in 
participants with chemotherapy -naive advanced non -small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as either a 
monotherapy or in combination with other agents including ipilimumab, at different doses and 
schedules. The primary endpoint of the study was safety with secondary endpoints of ORR per 
RECIST  v1.1 and 24-week  progression -free survival  (PFS).  Participants  were  assigned  to receive 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q12W (n  = 38), nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W; n = 39) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n  = 52). The 
confirmed  ORR  was 47% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q12W),  39% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q6W),  and 23% (N3 Q2W).  
The median DOR  was not  reached in any  of these  groups.  
The rate of treatment -related  AEs in the Q12W (82%) and Q6W (72%) arms were comparable to 
monotherapy  (72%).  In the study,  Grade  3 to 4 AEs 37%,  33%,  and 19% for the Q12W,  Q6W,  and 
nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment -related Grade 3 to 4 AEs led to 
discontinuation in 5% and 8% of participants in the Q12W and Q6W cohorts, respectively, and 
were  similar  to nivolumab  monotherapy.  There  were  no treatment -related  deaths.  The 
treatment -related  select  AEs in participants  administered  the optimized  dosing  schedule  (3 mg/kg 
of nivolumab Q2W plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab Q6W) were skin related (36%), gastrointestinal 
(23%),  endocrine  (20%),  and pulmonary  (5%)  and there  were  ≤ 5% treatment  related  Grade  3 and

3.2.8  Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab in HCC  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab  combination is currently being evaluated as 2L therapy for advanced 
HCC in CA209040, a Phase 1/2 non -comparative, multi -cohort study of nivolumab (alone or in 
combination with ipilimumab or  cabozantinib) as 1L/2L treatment in participants with advanced 
HCC with or without chronic viral hepatitis and in CA2099DW, a Phase 3 randomized study of 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab vs sorafenib or lenvatinib as 1L treatment in 
participants with advanced HCC.  
CA209040 was initially designed as a Phase 1 dose -escalation study to investigate the safety, 
immuno -regulatory activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of 
nivolumab monotherapy in advanced HCC. Dose escalation occurred in 3 parallel cohorts by 
etiology  (uninfected, HBV -infected, and HCV -infected). Participants (n = 48) with histologically 
confirmed advanced HCC and Child -Pugh score ≤ 7, who previously failed or were intolerant  of 
sorafenib,  received  nivolumab  at doses  ranging  from  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  for up to 2 years. Following 
preliminary data showing responders in all cohorts, the study  was expanded to confirm  the safety 
and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in a diverse group of participants with advanced HCC.  
In this phase (EXP Cohort), 214 participants were enrolled in 4 parallel cohorts (uninfected 
sorafenib -naive/intolerant, uninfected sorafenib progressors, HCV -infected, and HBV -infected),  
and received  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  IV Q2W.3 Please  refer  to Section  3.2.6  (Nivolumab  Monotherapy 
for Hepatocellular Carcinoma) for information on the clinical activity and safety of nivolumab 
monotherapy in HCC.  
Once the safety  and efficacy  of nivolumab monotherapy  was established, the study  was amended 
to add a cohort aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  as 2L therapy.  A total of 148 participants  with histologically  confirmed  advanced  HCC 
(87.8%  had vascular  invasion  [VI] or extrahepatic  spread  [EHS];  and 43.9%  had alpha -fetoprotein 
[AFP] ≥ 400 ng/mL) and Child -Pugh score ≤ 6, who had previously failed or were intolerant of 
sorafenib, were randomized to 1 of the following 3 dose arms:  
• Arm A (N1+I3  Q3W):  nivolumab  1 mg/kg  and ipilimumab  3 mg/kg  Q3W  for 4 doses,  followed 
by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (n = 50)  
• Arm B (N3+I1  Q3W):  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  Q3W  for 4 doses,  followed 
by nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (n = 49)  
• Arm C (N3 QW2+I1  Q6W):  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  Q2W  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  Q6W  (n = 49) 
 
Results  from  CA209040  (interim  analysis;  database  lock,  22-Mar-2019)3 show  that treatment  with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab in participants with advanced HCC produced durable responses and 
prolonged survival, irrespective of HCC etiology. Overall, the confirmed ORR by BICR 
assessment (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) was 31.0%, with response rates fairly comparable, 
regardless  of dose arm (32%  for Arm A, 31% for Arm B, and 31% for Arm C). However,  a higher

 rate of CR was observed  with N1+I3  QW3 (4 [8%] CR  for Arm A, 3 [6%] CR  for Arm B, and no 
CR for Arm C). An additional 26.4% of participants had PR (24%, 24%, and 31% in Arm A, 
Arm B, and Arm C, respectively).  
Responses  were  meaningful  and durable  with a median  DOR  of 17.5 months  (range: 4.6, 30.5)  in 
Arm A, 22.2 months (range: 4.2, 29.9) in Arm B, and 16.6 months (range: 4.1, 32.0) in Arm  C. 
Of note, responses were observed across all HCC etiologies (overall ORR of 15.2%, 30.7%, and 
39.4% for uninfected [n = 33], HBV -infected [n = 75], and HCV -infected [n = 33], respectively) 
and regardless of dosing arm. Participants who received treatment with N1+I3 Q3W (Arm A) 
showed a more consistent response rate across etiological subgroups (30.8%, 32.1%, and 28.6% 
for uninfected [n = 13], HBV -infected [n = 28], and HCV -infected [n = 7]) but the small size of 
some subgroups in other treatment arms precludes drawing any definitive conclusion.  
With regards to OS, with a minimum follow -up of 28.0 months, participants treated with N1+I3 
Q3W  had longer  OS (22.80  months  [95%  CI: 9.4, N.A])  compared  to those  randomized  to Arm B 
(12.48 months [95% CI: 7.6, 16.4]) or Arm C (12.75 months [95% CI: 7.43, 33.0]), with 2 -year 
survival  rates  of 48.2%,  30.2%, and 42.3%,  respectively.  
The preliminary safety data from CA209040 (n = 146) indicate that nivolumab and ipilimumab 
was generally well  tolerated, with a safety  profile similar to  the observed in other tumor types in 
terms of type of reported events; no new safety concerns were identified for nivolumab and 
ipilimumab. One death (reported in Arm A) was attributed to study drug by Investigator 
(pneumonitis, which occurred 79 days after last dose of study drug). Overall, as previously 
reported in other tumor types, the frequency of treatment -related AEs for the combination 
nivolumab and ipilimumab was higher compared to nivolumab monotherapy. By dosing arm, a 
higher  frequency  of treatment -related  AEs (any grade  or high grade)  were  reported  in 
Arm A (93.9%;  53.1%)  compared  to Arm B (69.4%;  28.6%)  and Arm C (79.2%;  31.0%).  
Similarly,  the frequency  of AEs leading  to discontinuation  was slightly  higher  in 
Arm A (n = 11;  22.0%)  relative  to Arm B (n = 3; 6.1%)  and Arm C (n = 1; 2.1%),  with 
diarrhea  (n = 2) and liver test abnormalities (n = 2) being the most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation.  Across  the 3 arms,  treatment -related  AEs of increased  AST  (20.4%  of participants 
in the N1+I3 Q3W and N3+I1 Q3W arms, and 13.0% in the N3+I1 Q6W arm) and increased 
ALT (16.3%,  14.3%,  and 8.3%  of participants  in the N1+I3  Q3W,  N3+I1  Q3W,  and N3+I1  Q6W 
arms,  respectively)  were  observed.  These  AEs were  infrequently  associated  with treatment -related 
increased bilirubin (11.6% of participants across all arms; 6.1%, 0%, and 4.2%  of participants in 
Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C, respectively),  and infrequently  led to treatment 
discontinuation (n = 2), being most of them manageable with established algorithms.  
Therefore, data from CA209040 demonstrate that nivolumab and ipilimumab has clinically 
meaningful antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile.  
3.2.9  Immunotherapy  and Loco -regional  Therapy  for HCC  
3.2.9.1  Impact  of Loco -regional  Therapy  on the HCC  Immune  Environment  
Loco -regional therapy has been shown to modulate the immune environment. Tregs are the 
dominant  cells inducing  tumor  immune  tolerance  and thus have  a significant  role in the 
Clinical  Protocol

 development of HCC. An increased quantity of circulating Tregs in patients with HCC is 
associated with  a high mortality  rate and reduced  survival.40 Spontaneous  regression  of untreated 
lesions has been reported after loco -regional treatment of liver tumors (“abscopal effect”). The 
latter  is attributed  to the induction  of antitumor  immunity  by the loco-regional  therapy.71,72,73 Data 
on the effect of TACE on immune function are limited but suggest that TACE results in immune 
environment change. In a study on the impact of TACE on immune function in 47  participants, 
significant increases in CD4+ T cells  and decreases in CD8+ T cells  were  seen post-TACE, with 
a significant  change  in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+  T cells from  1.03 ± 0.14 vs 1.29 ± 0.14 (p < 0.05). 
The percentage  of CD4+,  CD25+  Tregs  in CD4+  T cells and CD4+,  CD25 -high T cells post-TACE 
was reduced  from  11.12 ±  3.58%  prior  to TACE  to 7.58 ±  2.65%  following  TACE  (p < 0.05)  and 
from  3.34 ± 0.79%  prior  to TACE  to 2.11 ± 0.67%  following  TACE  (p < 0.05),  respectively.  This 
indicates  that the proportion  of Tregs  following  TACE  treatment  decreased  with a reduction  in its 
immunosuppressive function,74 and suggests a partial restoration of cellular immune function 
post-TACE. In another study in 51 participants, CD4+ cells and CD4/CD8 ratio decreased but 
CD8+  cells increased  post-TACE  in the subset  of participants  treated  only with TACE  (p < 0.05). 
This, in turn, suggested that TACE lowered immunologic function to a certain extent.75 
Despite variable reports, the data suggest immune environment modulation post -TACE and 
support clinical interest in  combining loco -regional therapies with immune checkpoint blockade. 
Local tumor destruction via ablation, chemoembolization, or radioembolization all have the 
potential  to differentially alter and enhance tumor -specific antigen presentation. Therefore, there 
exists  a synergistic  potential  for immunotherapy  and TACE  and it will be of critical  importance  to 
assess how different methods of local tumor destruction and their timing can augment or be 
augmented by checkpoint blockade.76 
3.2.9.2  Data  on the Combination  of Loco -regional  Therapy  with Checkpoint 
Inhibitors  
Preliminary clinical data for loco -regional therapy in combination with checkpoint inhibitors 
demonstrates a good safety profile and promising efficacy. In a study to evaluate whether 
tremelimumab  could  be combined  safely  and feasibly  with TACE,  radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA), 
or chemoablation  in participants  with advanced  HCC,  no DLTs  were  encountered.  Of the 
19 evaluable  participants,  5 (26.3%  [95%  CI: 9.1, 51.2])  achieved  a confirmed  PR. Six- and 
12-month probabilities of  tumor PFS for this refractory  HCC population were 57.1% and 33.1%, 
respectively,   with  median  TTP of 7.4  months  (95%   CI: 4.7, 19.4).  Median  OS was 
12.3 months (95% CI: 9.3, 15.4). The authors concluded that tremelimumab in combination with 
tumor ablation is a potential new treatment for patients with advanced HCC and leads to the 
accumulation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells.77 
3.2.9.3  Nivolumab  in Combination  with TACE  
CA209731 is a multicenter study designed to test the hypothesis that nivolumab is safe in

 participants to define the safety and tolerability of nivolumab given at different times related to 
DEB -TACE. DEB -TACE was performed on Day 0. Nivolumab at 240 mg/m2 was administered 
every  14 days,  but at 3 different  schedules  related  to DEB -TACE  (Cohort  1-sequential; 
Cohort  2-interrupted;  and Cohort  3-continuous)  for up to 1 year.  DLTs  were  monitored  for 4 weeks 
after combination treatment.  
As of 18 -July-2019,  10 participants have  been  accrued  on the study:  4 participants to  Cohort  1, 
3 participants to Cohort 2, and 3 participants to Cohort 3. One participant was withdrawn from 
study  due to the combination  of mixed  HCC -cholangiocarcinoma  on pretreatment  biopsy. 
Five participants have been removed from study due to progression of disease, and 2 remain on 
active  treatment,  while  2 remain  on study  in surveillance.  Evaluable  participants  (9) were  a median 
65 years  of age (range:  54-76), male  (89%),  with a mixture  of etiologic  factors  (viral  [44%,  1 HBV, 
3 HCV]  and non-viral [55.6%]),  and all with Child -Pugh  A liver function.  HCC  substage  included 
3 B1 (33%), 4 B2 (44%), and 2 C (22%). Most participants received prior surgery (44%) and/or 
regional  therapy  (44%),  while  3 (33%)  were  treatment  naive.  Median  AFP for the study  population 
was 22.5 (range:  6-5914)  ng/mL.  No cases  of treatment -related  liver failure  or DLT  in the 3 cohorts 
have occurred.  There were no Grade 4 or higher AEs. Grade 3 events at least possibly related to 
nivolumab,  DEB -TACE,  or both,  included:  transaminases  (AST  or ALT)  elevation  (n = 4), 
post-embolization syndrome (PES; n = 1), lipase increase (n = 1), hypothyroidism (n = 1), and 
post-procedural  groin  hematoma  (1). Regarding  4 AEs of Grade  3 increase  in AST/ALT, 
2 occurred immediately post -embolization and were attributed to DEB -TACE; the other 2 AEs 
occurred  outside  the DLT  window  and were  attributed  to be possibly  related  to nivolumab. 
All Grade 3 events resolved with appropriate medical management. The efficacy data is still 
immature at the time of reporting.  
In summary, current data support the potential of immunotherapy for HCC therapy. Immune 
checkpoint inhibitors have clinical activity and are tolerable in advanced HCC, supporting their 
potential for use in other stages of  the disease. Data on loco -regional therapy indicate that these 
procedures  induce  changes  in the immune  environment  that suggest  a synergistic  potential  for the 
combination of loco -regional therapy with immunotherapy. The preliminary data from 
tremelimumab in combination with ablation and from nivolumab in combination with TACE 
indicate that the combinations are feasible and tolerable. The combination of TACE with 
nivolumab  and ipilimumab has the  potential  to address  the need for  better  therapeutic options for 
intermediate -stage HCC and support further investigation of nivolumab and ipilimumab in 
combination with TACE in this setting.  
3.3 Benefit/Risk  Assessment  
The current  standard  of care (SOC)  for intermediate -stage  HCC  patients,  unsuitable  for potentially 
curative therapy, is  loco-regional therapy with TACE.79,80,81 Although significant tumor response 
can be achieved,  TACE  often  fails to induce  complete  necrosis  of the lesion.  Even  in cases  where 
complete ablation is achieved, tumors commonly  recur post -TACE. Thus,  TACE is considered a 
palliative  treatment  and preventing  tumor  recurrence  in this population  remains  a significant  unmet 
medical need, as there are no other established therapeutic options available.

 The overall benefit -risk of nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab in combination with TACE 
over TACE  in patients  with intermediate -stage  HCC  is not yet known.  However,  in clinical  trials, 
nivolumab and ipilimumab and nivolumab alone have demonstrated an acceptable benefit -risk 
ratio with  clinical  activity  and a tolerable  AE profile  across  multiple tumor types including  HCC.  
Non-live COVID -19 vaccination  is considered  a simple  concomitant  medication  within  the study. 
However,  the efficacy  and safety  of non-live vaccines  (including  non-live COVID -19 vaccines)  in 
participants receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab alone are unknown.  
3.3.1  Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Safety  Profile  
Extensive details on the safety profile of nivolumab and nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab in multiple tumors are available in the IBs.1,82 
Overall,  the safety  profile  of nivolumab monotherapy  as well as in combination with ipilimumab 
is manageable  and generally  consistent  across  completed  and ongoing  clinical  trials  with no MTD 
reached  at any dose tested  up to 10 mg/kg.  Most  AEs were  low-grade  (Grade  1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.1 
The recently reported clinical trial CA209040 Cohort 4 characterized the safety and efficacy of 
different  doses  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab  in participants with  advanced  HCC  who progressed 
on sorafenib.  The overall  frequency  of AEs (any Grade,  Grade  3-4) were  similar  in all 3 treatment 
arms. Frequencies of drug -related AEs (any Grade, Grade 3 -4) were numerically higher in the 
N1+I3 Q3W arm relative to the N3+I1 Q3W, and N3+I1 Q6W arms. The overall frequencies of 
SAEs were consistent between the N1+I3 Q3W, N3+I1 Q3W, and  N3+I1 Q6W arms, but a trend 
for higher  drug-related  SAEs  was seen in the N1+I3  Q3W  arm. The overall  frequencies  of 
all-causality  AEs leading  to discontinuation  and drug-related  AEs leading  to discontinuation  were 
also numerically  higher  in the N1+I3  Q3W  arm relative  to the N3+I1  Q3W  and N3+I1  Q6W  arms. 
The most frequent drug -related AEs across the 3 dose arms were in the skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (48 -61%), investigations (31 -49%), and GI disorders (35 -37%) system organ 
classes;  however,  these  infrequently  led to discontinuations  due to drug-related  AEs.  Drug -related 
AST/ALT increases were observed in 20.4%/16.3%, 20.4%/14.3%, and 12.5%/8.3%, in the 
N1+I3 Q3W, N3+I1 Q3W, and N3+I1 Q6W arms, respectively. However, drug -related  increases 
in bilirubin were typically not associated with aminotransferase increases and occurred in 
6.1%/0%/4.2%,  respectively,  and were  all low-grade.  Drug -related  hepatic  discontinuations  within 
30 days of last dose of study  drug were infrequent and occurred in 3 of  49 (6.1%), 2 of  49 (4%), 
and 0 of  48 (0%) subjects in the N1+I3 Q3W, N3+I1 Q3W, and N3+I1 Q6W arms, respectively. 
Please refer to Section 3.2.8  (Nivolumab  Combined  with Ipilimumab  in HCC) for further  details.  
A pattern  of immune -related AEs has  been  defined,  for which  management  algorithms  have  been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6 . Most high -grade events were manageable with  the 
use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these 
algorithms.1 Additional  details  on the safety  profile  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab,  including  
results  from  other  clinical  studies,  are also available  in the nivolumab  and ipilimumab  IBs.1,82

 3.3.2  Clinical Experience with Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab in HCC  
In HCC, the clinical activity of nivolumab monotherapy observed to date includes data from the 
Phase 1/2 study CA209040, which demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity in the 
advanced setting, regardless etiology and prior therapy with sorafenib.3 The observed durable 
responses and substantially longer OS relative to historical data is particularly remarkable 
considering the unfavorable characteristics of the study population. Additionally, safety data 
showed a safety profile similar to that observed in other tumor types, in terms of the type, 
frequency, and severity of reported events, with no new safety concerns. Treatment -related AEs 
most  frequently  reported  (mostly  Grade  1 or 2) were  fatigue,  pruritus,  rash,  and diarrhea.  
Of particular interest in the context of HCC is the observed hepatic toxicity. Treatment -related 
AST,  ALT,  and bilirubin  elevations  were observed  at a slightly increased frequency  as compared 
to the nivolumab  program  overall,  but were  generally  mild,  manageable  with established  treatment  
algorith ms, and reversible, with very few discontinuations due to hepatic events. In addition, 
AST/ALT  increases  typically  occurred  without  change  in other  hepatic  parameters  and were  more 
frequently observed in participants with higher values at baseline. Taken together, these results 
suggest the potential for improved clinical outcomes with nivolumab in the intermediate -stage 
setting, without impacting the overall safety profile.  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in participants with 
advanced HCC in the 2L or higher setting after sorafenib treatment.  The ORR was 32%, 30.6%, 
and 30.6%  and DOR  was 17.48,  22.21,  and 16.59  months  by BICR  for N1+I3  Q3W,  N3+I1  Q3W, 
and N3+I1 Q6W arms, respectively. This compares favorably with other approved therapies for 
post-sorafenib 2L advanced HCC: 14.3% with nivolumab monotherapy, 7% with regorafenib,  
5% with ramucirumab, and 4% with cabozantinib.  
In summary, based on the high unmet medical need in this clinical setting, the robust clinical 
activity  demonstrated  by nivolumab  and ipilimumab  in advanced  HCC,  and the manageable  safety 
profile,  the overall  potential  benefits  of a combination  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab  or nivolumab 
with TACE in this population outweigh the potential clinical risks. Nevertheless, in order to 
mitigate potential risks, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be involved in the study to 
periodically evaluate the emerging data and trends (see Section 5.1.5.1  [Data Monitoring 
Committee]).

5 STUDY  DESIGN  
5.1 Overall Design  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, randomized Phase 3 study of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in  combination with TACE  and nivolumab in combination with  TACE vs  placebo in 
combination with TACE in patients with intermediate -stage HCC. Participants must have tumor 
characteristics that exceed the Beyond Milan and Up -to-7 (BMU7) criteria, no EHS, no  regional 
lymph  node involvement, no portal  vein thrombosis, and no macrovascular invasion (MVI) must 
be present. As of 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment for new participants was closed. The number of 
participants randomized was 26 as of 14 -Oct-2021. Per Protocol Amendment 01, there are no 
formal hypotheses or efficacy objectives for CA20974W. Only safety assessments will be 
conducted. Following unblinding, study participants who are currently receiving nivolumab ± 
ipilimumab and tolerating study  treatment may continue to receive study  drug; however, placebo 
infusions will no longer be administered.  
The study  will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow -up. For a complete list of 
study required procedures, please see Section 2  (Schedule of Activities).  
After signing an informed consent form (ICF), participants who have not previously received 
TACE will be evaluated for eligibility. If participants are eligible for receiving TACE and meet 
other eligibility criteria, they will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive nivolumab and 
ipilimumab plus TACE (Arm A), nivolumab and ipilimumab placebo plus TACE (Arm B), or 
nivolumab placebo and ipilimumab placebo plus TACE (Arm  C). Since TACE is the only 
recommended SOC in clinical practice guidelines for the intended population, TACE plus 
nivolumab placebo and ipilimumab placebo will be used as a control. Both conventional TACE 
and DEB -TACE are acceptable treatment modalities in this study (see  Section  7.1.2  [TACE 
Procedure] for restrictions on TACE use) and will be administered 7 days (+3 days) after study 
drug administration. Randomization will be stratified by ALBI grade (Grade 1 vs Grade  2), 
baseline AFP level (<  400 ng/mL vs ≥ 400 ng/mL), and Region (West [EU, Americas, and 
Australia] vs Japan vs rest of Asia).  
Participants  will receive  blinded  treatment  with 1 of the following  regimens:  
• Arm A: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  Q6W  plus TACE  
• Arm B: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipilimumab  placebo  Q6W  plus TACE  
• Arm C: Nivolumab  placebo Q2W  and ipilimumab  placebo  Q6W  plus TACE

 Per Protocol Amendment 01, this study will be unblinded and participants randomized to 
Arm B and Arm C will no longer receive placebo infusions following unblinding.  
All randomized participants will receive treatment until progression as assessed by investigator, 
unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal, for a maximum duration of treatment of 2 years. 
Participants  will also receive  on-demand  TACE  during  the trial and can continue  to receive  TACE 
until they are not eligible  for further  TACE (see  Section  7.1.2  [TACE  Procedure]).  Participants  in 
any arm may be treated with study  therapy beyond progression as  assessed by investigator under 
protocol -defined conditions (see Section 5.1.4  [Treatment Beyond Progression]).

 5.1.1  Screening  Period  
The screening  assessments  are shown  in Table  2-1. 
• Screening procedures are to occur within 28 days prior to first dose.  
• Screening  begins  by establishing  the participant’s  initial  eligibility  and signing  of the ICF. 
• Participant  is enrolled  using  the interactive  response  technology  (IRT) system.  
• Participant is assessed for study eligibility according to the inclusion ( Section 6.1 ) and 
exclusion ( Section 6.2 ) criteria.  
• Sufficient,  recent  tumor  tissue  obtained  within  3 months  prior  to randomization from  a lesion 
from  an unresectable  primary  tumor  lesion  that has not been  previously  irradiated 
(formalin -fixed,  paraffin -embedded  [FFPE]  block  or minimum  of 20 slides,  obtained  from  core 
biopsy,  punch  biopsy,  excisional  biopsy,  or surgical  specimen)  will be submitted  to the central 
laboratory. Fine needle aspirates or other cytology samples are not acceptable. If despite best 
efforts, a minimum of 20 slides are not obtainable, submission of fewer slides may be 
acceptable  in some  circumstances  following  discussion  with BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical 
Scientist. The central laboratory must provide IRT with confirmation of receipt of evaluable 
tumor tissue prior to randomization. Participants should not have received any systemic 
anticancer therapy after the date that the submitted tumor tissue was obtained. Please see 
Appendix 9  for country -specific criteria for the collection of tumor tissue samples in China.  
• Images  must  be submitted  for BICR  to confirm  eligibility.  
• The Screening Period either ends with confirmation of full eligibility and randomization for 
the participant, or with the confirmation that the participant is a screen failure.  
• This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a 
pretreatment failure prior to randomization (ie, participant has not been randomized/has not 
been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be re -consented. A new participant 
identification number will be assigned by IRT at  the time of re -enrollment (see Section 6.4.1  
[Retesting During Screening or Lead -in Period]).  
 
5.1.2  Treatment Period  
The on-treatment procedures  are shown  in Table  2-2. 
• The Treatment  Period  begins  with the randomization  call to the IRT system.  The participant  is 
randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms:  
− Arm A: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg  Q6W  plus TACE  
− Arm B: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipilimumab  placebo  Q6W  plus TACE  
− Arm C: Nivolumab  placebo Q2W  and ipilimumab  placebo  Q6W  plus TACE  
Note:  The study  will be unblinded  per Protocol  Amendment  01. After  unblinding, 
participants in Arms B and C will no longer receive placebo.  
• Administration of  study  treatment must  begin  within  3 calendar  days after randomization.  
• First TACE  will be administered  7 days (+3 days)  after study  drug administration.  Participants 
will receive study treatment until progression as defined by investigator (unless treatment 
beyond  progression  is permitted),  unacceptable  toxicity,  or consent  withdrawal  for a maximum 
duration of treatment of 2 years. See Section 5.1.4  (Treatment Beyond Progression).

 • On-demand  TACE is  allowed and should be given with  at least a 7 -day window for systemic 
therapy. See Section 7.1.2  (TACE Procedure) for further details on TACE.  
• Specific  requirements  for participants  treated  in any arm, including  dose delays  or interruptions 
and treatment  discontinuation  criteria,  are described  in Section  7.4 (Dosage  Modification)  and 
Section 8.1.1  (Treatment Discontinuation Criteria), respectively.  
• Women  of childbearing  potential  (WOCBP)  must  have  a documented  negative  pregnancy  test 
within 24 hours prior to the start of  study  treatment. For additional assessments, see Table 2 - 
2. 
• On-study vital sign assessments should be performed at each on -treatment visit (see Table 2 - 
2). 
• On-study laboratory assessments should be performed at each on -treatment visit and will be 
assessed at the local laboratory (see Table 2 -2). 
• Efficacy assessments will  occur in accordance with Table 2 -2 per local standard of care until 
progression as  assessed  by investigator (unless treatment beyond progression is permitted) or 
treatment discontinuation (including treatment beyond progression), whichever occurs later.  
• Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01: Biomarker sample collection will be done 
according to the schedule in Table 9.8 -1. Please see Appendix 9  for country -specific criteria 
for the collection of biomarker samples  
 . 
• Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01: PK and immunogenicity  (IMG)  samples  are to 
be collected predose and according to Table 9.5 -1. 
• Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01: Outcomes research assessments instruments 
(EuroQol -5 Dimensions -5 Levels [EQ -5D-5L] and Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy -Hepatobiliary [FACT -Hep]) will be completed prior to treatment at the start of  each 
cycle for  the first 6 months,  and then every  third cycle  thereafter during the  Treatment Period 
(see Table 2 -2). 
• The Treatment Period ends when the participant is discontinued from study therapy for any 
reason, or a maximum of 2 -years total duration of study medication (if treatment not 
discontinued before). Please see Section 8  (Discontinuation Criteria) for a complete list of 
possible reasons for discontinuation.  
 
5.1.3  Follow -up Period  
The follow -up procedures  are shown  in Table  2-3. 
• The Follow -up Period  begins  when  the decision  is made  to discontinue  a participant  from  study 
therapy  (eg, due to toxicity  or progression)  or after study  drug discontinuation  (due to toxicity 
or progression) or treatment completion (2 -years total duration), whichever comes first.  
• Participants  will have  2 follow -up visits, follow -up visit 1 (FU1) and follow -up visit 2 (FU2) 
for safety within approximately 30 and 100 days from the last dose of study treatment, 
respectively. Both follow -up visits should be conducted in person, according to Table 2 -3. 
− Follow -up visits include targeted physical examination, laboratory tests, tumor 
assessments (if applicable), and AE and concomitant medication assessments. Additional 
details and requirements are outlined in Table 2 -3.

 • Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiographic disease 
progression  (as assessed  by investigator)  will continue  to have  tumor  assessments  (if clinically 
feasible), according to the schedule in Table 2 -3. 
• After completion of the first 2 follow -up visits, participants will be followed for ongoing 
treatment -related AEs until these events have resolved, returned to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible. All toxicities will be documented for a minimum of 100 days after the last dose 
of study medication. Please refer to Section 9.2.4  for further details regarding follow -up of 
AEs and SAEs.  
• Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01: Participants  will be followed  for survival  status

or end of study.  
− Survival  status  may be ascertained  by telephone  contact  if the participant  is unable  to return 
to the site for a visit.  
− If new antitumor  therapy  is initiated  for disease  progression  or for a secondary  malignancy 
at any time during  this period,  this and all other  pertinent  data obtained  should  be recorded 
on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 
5.1.4  Treatment Beyond Progression  
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of participants treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progressive disease .83 
Participants will be permitted to continue treatment beyond progression (as assessed by 
investigator) up to a maximum of 24 months from the date of randomization, as long as the 
following criteria are considered:  
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit.  
• Tolerance  of study  drug(s).  
• Stable  performance  status.  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases).  
• Participant provides written informed  consent  prior  to receiving  additional treatment with  the 
study  drug regimen.  All other  elements  of the main  consent  including  description  of reasonably 
foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options will still apply.  
• Should  be documented  in the study  records.  
 
Radiographic assessment/scan(s) should continue in accordance with Section 2  (Schedule of 
Activities) for the duration of the treatment beyond progression.  
If the Investigator feels that the study participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by 
continuing  treatment,  the participant  should  remain  on the trial and continue  to receive  monitoring 
according to the Section 2  (Schedule of Activities).

5.1.5  Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
5.1.5.1  Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC will be established to provide oversight and safety and efficacy considerations in the 
CA20974W study. On 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment was closed and a total of 26 participants have 
been randomized. The DMC will provide advice to  the Sponsor  regarding actions the committee 
deems necessary for the continuing protection of participants enrolled/treated in the study. The 
DMC  will be charged  with assessing  such actions  in light  of an acceptable  benefit -risk profile  for 
nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab in combination with TACE. A safety review will be 
conducted  by the DMC after all  participants have been  randomized  and have  been followed for a 
minimum  of 6 weeks,  unless  decided  otherwise  by the DMC  chair.  After  participants  are unblinded 
as per Protocol Amendment 01, the Sponsor will continue safety monitoring of remaining 
participants  on the study.  No subsequent  DMC  meeting  will occur  after the first safety  monitoring 
meeting.  
The BMS clinical study leadership will have responsibility for the overall conduct of the study, 
including  managing  the communication  of study  data.  The group  will be responsible  for promptly 
reviewing the DMC recommendations, providing guidance regarding the continuation or 
termination of  the study, and determining whether amendments to  the protocol or changes to the

In addition  to local  tumor  assessments  by mRECIST,  images  from  this study  will undergo  a BICR 
to assess  TTTP  and to assess  response  based  on the modified  RECIST  assessment 
criteria  (mRECIST) and  RECIST  v1.1 criteria.  The centrally  reviewed  response  data will be used 
in the analyses of TTTP, ORR, PFS, DOR, DCR, and time to response. All final determinations 
on centrally  reviewed  image -based  endpoints  will be made  based  on the independent  assessments, 
for a uniform and unbiased assessment  of outcome. Details of  the procedures and the criteria for 
the central review are defined in a separate Imaging Charter.

5.4 Scientific  Rationale  for Study  Design  
5.4.1  Rationale  for Study  Population  
In clinical  practice,  TACE  is used not only as a palliative  therapy  for patients  with 
intermediate -stage  HCC,  but also a preoperative  adjuvant  therapy  in patients  with HCC  to improve 
survival, and as a bridging therapy for the purposes of downstaging prior to liver transplantation 
or as bridging  therapy  while  on the transplant  waiting  list.84,85,86,87 In addition,  TACE  is also used 
in clinical  practice  for advanced -stage  HCC.  This is premised  on the fact that more  than two-thirds 
of patients with advanced HCC die of liver failure or intrahepatic tumor progression, rather  than 
from  progression  of metastatic  disease.88,89,90 Investigations  on the use of TACE  in advanced  HCC 
report a survival benefit in patients with vascular involvement or extrahepatic metastasis who 
underwent TACE instead of receiving best supportive care (BSC).90,91,92,93,94 The participant 
inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  (see Section  6 [Study  Population])  are intended  to specify inclusion 
of only patients whose disease falls into the BCLC B category for intermediate -stage HCC, for 
whom TACE is recommended in treatment guidelines.  
Tumor characteristics must exceed the BMU7 criteria. The Milan criteria identify early -stage 
patients who are eligible for liver transplantation. There are, however, patients who present with 
HCC beyond the Milan criteria and can be downstaged for transplantation using loco -regional 
therapy.  The tumor  characteristics  of the latter  patients  fulfill  the Up-to-7 criteria  and are therefore 
currently considered for transplantation and not the subject of this research.  
5.4.2  Rationale  for TTTP  as a Dual  Primary  Endpoint  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
Long OS in the TACE setting necessitates the use of a dual primary endpoint for an earlier 
assessment of clinical benefit.  
TACE  treatment  affords  patients  with long survivals.  A 2016  meta -analysis  review  of conventional 
TACE in a large sample size of patients with HCC  reported  survivals in line with those from the 
seminal  RCTs.  Median  OS was 19.4 months  (95%  CI: 16.2,  22.6).95 A 2017  network  meta -analysis 
projected a similar median survival of 18.1  months  (95% CI: 15.6, 21.6) for conventional TACE 
and a reduction in the hazard of death in the range of 24%.96 These data are aligned with the 
expected median survival of 20 months quoted in the 2012 European Society for Medical 
Oncology and the European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESMO -ESDO) guidelines.80 
However, a clear trend of progressively improving survival outcomes over the years has been 
observed.97 Various clinical studies and TACE analyses have reported median OS values higher 
than 19.4 months,  ranging from 26.1  to 61 months.15,23,98,99,100,101,102 
The long OS poses  challenges  for demonstrating  OS in the intermediate -stage  TACE  setting.  This 
is not an uncommon challenge for earlier -stage cancer studies, given the relatively long survival  
Clinical  Protocol

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 relative to later disease stages. The evaluation of OS in settings with long baseline survival 
commonly requires very long study durations and large numbers of participants.  
In addition, there has been an advent of new drug options for the treatment of advanced HCC; 
including atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab, cabozantinib, lenvatinib,  nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, ramucirumab and  regorafenib. 
These options are now available for HCC patients (in clinical studies or in clinical practice) after 
they migrate  from  an intermediate  to an advanced  stage.  This raises  concerns  that efficacy  of drugs 
administered in conjunction with TACE, as measured by OS, may be confounded by subsequent 
therapy in the advanced setting, thereby underestimating their true clinical benefit.103 Available 
data from studies using TACE in combination with systemic agents reflects the fact that both 
systemic and non -systemic therapies are used after patients discontinue from TACE studies and 
progress to the advanced stage of the disease.23,26 
The situation for TACE is not dissimilar to the challenges faced by earlier -stage cancer studies, 
where demonstration of OS is difficult given the relatively long OS relative to later stages  of the 
disease. In the adjuvant setting for early stage HCC, alternative endpoints, such as relapse -free 
survival (RFS) and disease -free survival (DFS), have become increasingly important surrogate 
endpoints  that have  been  broadly  used and accepted  by Investigators  and regulators  as meaningful 
primary endpoints.104,105,106,107 In a TACE setting, however, these exact endpoints do not have  
the same relevance and carry fundamental issues.  
Treatment  with TACE  follows  a different  paradigm  for discontinuation  of treatment.  For systemic 
therapies, treatment is generally stopped when disease recurs or progresses. TACE treatment, 
however,  can continue in  the case of tumor  progression  (ie, in  cases  where  there  is regrowth  of an 
initially  responsive tumor or the appearance of a new lesion). In actual  clinical practice, repeated 
TACE sessions are felt to increase the efficacy of TACE. Patients commonly receive multiple 
TACE treatments.25,108,109,110,111,112 The continued use of TACE in the face of progression raises 
the question of the suitability of endpoints such as DFS, RFS, and PFS in a TACE setting.  
Furthermore, the relevance of traditional tumor assessment -based endpoints, such as ORR and 
TTP, is questionable in a TACE setting. The application of  RECIST -assessed ORR and TTP in a 
TACE setting is complicated by the nature of  the TACE procedure and its continued application 
in the presence  of disease  progression  or recurrence.  In RECIST  v1.1,  target  lesions  are designated 
at participant entry into a clinical study and a sum of the diameters for all target lesions are 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters then 
serves as the comparator for subsequent measurements. A CR is based on disappearance of all 
target  lesions.  A PR is based  on a ≥ 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters.113 
This poses a dilemma in a TACE study setting because TACE destroys tumor tissue each time it 
is administered.  TACE  responses  can be complete  or partial,  and is complete  in as many  as 
one-third of patients (28.2%).114,115 Pathology studies have shown that palliative trans -arterial 
lipiodol -based treatments may achieve > 90% tumor necrosis in 26 -70% of the treated nodules, 
depending  on technique,  lesion  size, and arterial  anatomy.116,117 In a TACE  setting,  therefore,  a

 response soon after TACE (ie, CR or PR) is mainly attributable to the TACE treatment. An 
objective response post -TACE is the norm  and the highest quality  studies of  conventional  TACE 
show a clear trend of progressively improving ORRs over a 15 -year period.95 In this setting, a 
systemic agent administered concurrently will not have sufficient time to further improve ORR. 
This is particularly true for immunotherapy agents that require time to stimulate the immune 
system  and are known for  their delayed cure effect.118,119 Even  in a setting  where  immunotherap y 
agents are administered as monotherapy, there are advocates for a change in the established 
paradigm of response assessment and reconsideration of conventional efficacy endpoints for 
monotherapy immuno -oncology (IO) studies.118,119,120,121,122 A traditional RECIST -defined 
response  may therefore  not capture  the effect  of a systemic  IO treatment  appropriately,  particularly 
in a TACE setting.  
These challenges have been observed in clinical studies. Two Phase 3 TACE studies in 
intermediate -stage  HCC  reported  no correlation  of ORR  by RECIST  or mRECIST  with OS. In the 
exploratory  analysis  of the brivanib  Phase  3 BRISK -TA study, the ORR was 48% in the brivanib 
group  and 42% in the placebo  group,  with an odds  ratio favoring  brivanib  (odds  ratio, 
1.28 [95% CI:  0.90,  1.83]).23 Although  sorafenib  demonstrated  improved  OS in the 1L setting, in 
the sorafenib  Phase  3 TACE -2 study,  response  assessments  by both RECIST  v1.1 and mRECIST 
showed no difference in participants treated with TACE + sorafenib vs TACE + placebo. The 
definition  of an endpoint  needs  to have  a biological  rationale  for its use and must  take into context 
the setting in  which it is  applied.  The RECIST  guidelines for solid tumors were developed in the 
context  of the ability  of anticancer  cytotoxic  agents  to generate  varying  degrees  of tumor  shrinkage 
and that a change in tumor burden was an important feature of the clinical evaluation of these 
drugs.113 In a TACE setting, the TACE treatment destroys tumor and changes the tumor burden 
independent  of the effects  of a systemic  agent.  Evaluating  the added  benefit  of systemic  agents  to 
TACE  therefore  requires  special  considerations. In addition,  the added  benefit of  systemic  agents 
is best assessed in patients who can receive a series of TACE treatments.  
The relevance of TTP, PFS, and ORR in a TACE setting are not established. While applicable to 
studies using only systemic agents, these endpoints do not take into account the impact of the 
TACE procedure and raise the question  of their suitability  as an endpoint in a TACE study. This 
is an important  consideration  because  surrogates  may fall short  in their ability  to predict  outcomes 
in hard endpoints  (eg, OS) for 2 broad  categories  of reasons:  (1) technical  factors  in measuring  the 
surrogate  introduce  such uncertainty  that their association  with the hard endpoints  becomes  weak; 
and (2) factors  in the relationship  between  the surrogate,  hard endpoint,  and drug weakens  a direct  
causal link between the surrogate and the hard endpoint.123 The destructive effects of TACE, 
coupled with  continued TACE with  tumor  regrowth  or the appearance  of new lesions,  challenges 
the conventional approach to assessing ORR, TTP, and PFS.  
This study will utilize TTTP, which is based on the time to tumor progression. The elements of 
the TTTP endpoint take into consideration: (1) the impact of TACE on tumor lesions; and (2) its 
application in a clinical study that includes participants that can receive more than 1 TACE 
treatment.  TTTP  is defined  as the time from  randomization  to the appearance  of evidence  of tumor 
progression  that is characterized  by the first of any of the following:  (1) A 20% increase  in dynamic  
Clinical  Protocol

 tumor burden over baseline scan (see Section 9.1.1  [Imaging Assessment for the Study] for the 
operational  elements  of a dynamic  tumor  burden  assessment);  (2) development  of MVI;  
(3) development  of EHS;  and (4) death.  
TTTP has been retrospectively evaluated in 3 TACE datasets. Arizumi and colleagues evaluated 
592 Japanese participants treated with conventional TACE.124 Correlation analysis showed a 
moderate positive correlation between OS and TTTP for both B1 (R2 = 0.6563; p  = 0.0045) and 
B2 (R2 = 0.6433; p = 0.0052) substages. The authors concluded that TTTP showed a moderate 
correlation with OS after TACE therapy, where participants with short TTTP represented short 
OS, indicating  that TTTP  is a potential  alternative parameter  for benefit  analysis  of HCC  patients 
undergoing TACE. Izumoto and colleagues subsequently evaluated 192  Japanese participants 
treated with conventional TACE.125 Similarly, their data showed a modest correlation between 
TTTP and OS (r = 0.527; 95% CI:  0.416, 0.622; p < 0.001). The third evaluation was conducted 
on the placebo arm  of the brivanib TACE study.23 To evaluate whether TTTP could be used as a 
survival predictor, landmark analyses of TTTP and OS were conducted that showed that TTTP 
was correlated with  OS. Notable differences were seen in the probability of  survival at 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 10 months  relative  to whether  or not participants  had reached  TTTP.  Participants  who did not 
reach  TTTP  at the specified  timepoints  had longer  survivals  than those  who had reached  TTTP.  In 
addition, participants who  took longer to progress  by TTTP had longer survivals than those who 
reached TTTP earlier.  
A fourth  evaluation  is ongoing  in collaboration  with TARGET -HCC126 to assess  TTTP  in a 
real-world population. Preliminary  data indicate a median TTTP for BCLC Stage B of 366 days. 
A majority  (80.9%)  of the participants in the TARGET -HCC database achieved TTTP due  to an 
increase  in tumor  burden,  as defined  by TTTP  parameters.  The study  was started  in Dec-2016  and 
the data are currently  too immature  to provide  a correlation  with OS. Essentially,  only participants 
who had their first TACE around the time of enrollment could be included for an initial OS 
analysis. The study is ongoing and a robust analysis of OS could be possible in another year.  
Improvement  in TTTP  may also lead  to a clinical  benefit  in these  participants,  as defined  by EFS. 
If study  treatment leads to a delay in development of EHS/VI,  these participants do not progress 
to advanced stage and start subsequent 1L systemic  therapy. In addition, they may require fewer 
TACE procedures, which limits damage to the liver and may prevent hepatic decompensation. 
This could lead to prolongation in EFS, which is a key  secondary  endpoint of the study.  
In summary, TTTP differs from previous TACE -specific endpoints as it takes into consideration 
the impact  of the TACE  procedure  on tumor  lesions,  is an endpoint  based  on tumor  lesion  changes, 
is applicable to the population of intermediate -stage HCC that can be treated with a series of 
TACE,  and can potentially  reflect  the added  effect  of a systemic  agent.  It also differs  from  previous 
TACE -specific  endpoints  in that it has been  evaluated  in different  TACE  populations  and datasets. 
This is in contrast  to previous  TACE -specific  endpoints  that were  applied  in TACE  clinical  studies 
without prior evaluation of their relevance. Of note, the 3 evaluations presented used varying 
approaches to assess whether there is a correlation of TTTP with survival, and yet the results 
showed  similar  trends.  The data are of special  significance  in light of the absence  of data

 supporting the relevance of TTP, PFS, and ORR in a TACE setting. The TTTP data provide 
support for the utilization of TTTP as a more relevant endpoint for assessment of tumor burden 
changes in a TACE setting.  
The TTTP  endpoint  reasonably  reflects  both the impact  of TACE  on tumor  lesions  and the added 
effect of a systemic agent. Based on the evaluation of TTTP in intermediate -stage HCC TACE 
datasets, TTTP can be considered as a reasonable tumor assessment -based endpoint for a  TACE 
study.  Therefore,  TTTP  as a dual  primary  endpoint  in the proposed  study  can provide  insight  into 
the benefit  of ipilimumab  and nivolumab  or nivolumab  alone  added  to TACE  prior  to subsequent 
therapies.  
TTTP  is defined  as the time from  randomization  to the first  occurrence  of any  of the following:  
• A 20% increase  in dynamic  tumor  burden  (see Section  9.1.2.2 ) over baseline  scan 
• Development  of MVI  
• Development of EHS 
• Death  
 
5.4.3  Rationale  for OS as a Dual  Primary  Endpoint  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from  any cause, is a dual  primary endpoint 
for this study.  As an endpoint,  OS is easily  measured,  unambiguous,  objective,  and unaffected  by 
the timing of assessment. It is considered the gold standard among efficacy  endpoints (clinically 
and regulatory  accepted),  and an appropriate  measure  of treatment  benefit  for immune  checkpoint 
inhibitors.  
5.4.4  Rationale  for EFS as a Secondary  Endpoint  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
EFS is defined as the time from randomization to initiation of first -line systemic therapy or the 
date of progression of cirrhosis from Child Pugh A to Child Pugh C score,  or death, whichever 
occurs  first. Prolongation  of EFS may lead to clinical  benefit  since  it takes  into consideration  liver 
decompensation,  as measured  by Child -Pugh  score,  which  is a composite  of clinical  and laboratory 
factors. Delaying  start of 1L systemic  therapy may also lead to  a clinical benefit in a patient, due 
to shorter survival and significant AEs seen with 1L systemic therapy in HCC.  
5.4.5  Rationale  for PFS as a Secondary  Endpoint  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression as 
assessed  by BICR, using  mRECIST or  death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS was

 chosen  as a secondary  endpoint  in order  to support  extrapolation  of this study  with other  completed 
and ongoing studies using PFS in the intermediate stage HCC.  
5.4.6  Rationale  for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab  Dose  and Schedule  
The nivolumab and ipilimumab  combination dosing  regimen  selected  for evaluation in this  study 
is nivolumab 240 mg (flat dose) Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W. The combination dosing 
and schedule was selected based on the overall benefit -risk observed in CA209040, a Phase 1/2 
study evaluating safety and efficacy of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipilimumab or 
cabozantinib, in participants with advanced HCC.3 
Exposure -response  (E-R) analysis  of nivolumab  monotherapy  across  dose ranges  of 1 mg/kg  to 10 
mg/kg revealed similar clinical activity regardless dose, while E -R analysis of  different doses of 
ipilimumab monotherapy (0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) in the Phase 2 study CA184022 
have demonstrated an increase in antitumoral activity by increasing ipilimumab dose.1,82 The 
combination of dual checkpoint blockade with both of these agents administered together has 
demonstrated an efficacy advantage over either single agent alone.  
In HCC,  results  from  CA209040  demonstrate  antitumor  activity  of the combination  of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab as 2L therapy in the advanced setting, with a manageable safety profile. In this 
trial, participants were  treated  with nivolumab in  combination  with either  high-dose (3 mg/kg)  or 
low-dose (1 mg/kg) ipilimumab at different schedules. Efficacy outcomes were mostly similar 
between  the different  regimens;  however,  the nivolumab  3-mg/kg Q2W  and ipilimumab 1 -mg/kg 
Q6W  arm was associated  with the most  favorable  safety  profile.  Treatment -related  AEs leading  to 
discontinuation, treatment -related elevations in AST and ALT, and the incidence of hepatic 
immune -mediated adverse events (IMAEs) occurred less frequently in the nivolumab 3 -mg/kg 
Q2W and ipilimumab 1 -mg/kg Q6W arm compared to the other 2 arms. Most of the AEs were 
Grade  1-2 and manageable  with treatment  algorithms,  leading  to treatment  discontinuation  in 2 out 
of 49 participants  (~ 4%) randomized  to this arm; none  of the participants  discontinued  due to liver 
function  abnormalities  (AST/ALT  elevation).3 
A flat  nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W was selected for Arm A  and Arm  B in this trial, based on 
a less than 15% difference in exposures of nivolumab after 3 mg/kg and 240 mg Q2W dosing, 
using simulations conducted in an HCC population that used 80 kg as a reference body  weight.  
Taken together, these data suggest that combination therapy with nivolumab 240 mg and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg may provide the most appropriate benefit -risk and support the further 
development of this combination in intermediate -stage HCC.  
5.4.7  Rationale  for Shorter  Infusion  Times  (30 minutes)  of Nivolumab  and 
Ipilimumab  
Nivolumab  has been  approved  for the shorter  30-minute  infusion.69,127 
Long infusion times place a burden on patients and treatment centers. Thus, establishing that 
nivolumab and ipilimumab can be safely administered using shorter infusion times of 30 -minute 
duration will diminish the burden, provided that there is no change in the safety profile.

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Establishing that nivolumab and ipilimumab can be safely administered using a shorter infusion 
time (30 minutes) is still under investigation. Previous clinical studies have used a 60 -minute 
infusion duration for nivolumab and 90 -minute infusion duration for ipilimumab (1 -3 mg/kg 
dosing for both). However, both nivolumab and ipilimumab have been safely  administered at up 
to 10 mg/kg with the same infusion duration with no safety concerns:  
• Nivolumab has been safely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment periods, and 
infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions, have been uncommon 
across  the nivolumab clinical program. In study  CA209010, a dose association was observed 
for infusion  site reactions  and hypersensitivity  reactions  (1.7%  at 0.3 mg/kg,  3.7%  at 2 mg/kg 
and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1 -2 and were manageable. An infusion 
duration  of 30 minutes  for 240 mg and 3 mg/kg  nivolumab  (30%  of the dose provided  at 
10 mg/kg) or for 480 mg of nivolumab (~ 60% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not 
expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg 
nivolumab dosing infused over a 60 -minute duration. The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
administered  as a 30-minute  infusion  was assessed  in CA209153  in participants  (n = 322) with 
previously  treated  advanced  NSCLC.  Overall,  there  were  no clinically  meaningful  differences 
in the frequency  of hypersensitivity/infusion -related  reactions  (of any cause  or 
treatment -related)  in participants  administered  nivolumab  over a 30-minute  infusion  compared 
with that reported for  participants with  the 60 -minute infusion. Additionally, preliminary safety 
data from  310 participants  who received  480 mg Q4W  over a 30-minute  infusion  have  showed 
no substantive differences in the safety profile compared to nivolumab 3 mg/kg or 240 mg 
given IV over 60 minutes, further supporting that nivolumab 3 mg/kg or nivolumab 480 mg 
(flat dose) can be safely infused over 30 minutes.  
• Similarly, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In 
participants with advanced Stage II or Stage IV melanoma (CA184022), where ipilimumab 
was administered up to a dose of 10 mg/kg, on -study drug -related hypersensitivity events 
(Grade  1/2) were  reported  in 1 participant  (1.4%)  in the 0.3 mg/kg  group and  in 2 participants 
(2.8%) in the 10 mg/kg  group.  There  were  no drug-related  hypersensitivity  events  reported  in 
the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment groups, no Grade 3/4 drug -related  hypersensitivity 
events were reported and there were no reports of infusion reactions. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg 
monotherapy  has also been  safely  administered  as a 90-minute  infusion  in a large  Phase  3 study 
in prostate cancer (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy for Stage III melanoma (CA184029), 
with infusion reactions occurring in participants. Administering 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab 
represents approximately one -third of the 10 mg/kg dose, and thus, a shortened infusion 
duration of 30 minutes for ipilimumab is not expected to present additional safety concerns.  
 
Overall,  infusion  reactions,  including  high-grade  hypersensitivity  reactions,  have  been  uncommon 
across  clinical  studies  of nivolumab,  ipilimumab,  and nivolumab/ipilimumab  combinations.  
A change in safety  profile is not anticipated with  30-minute infusions of  nivolumab, ipilimumab, 
or nivolumab and ipilimumab. Furthermore, a 30 -minute break after the first infusion for the 
combination will ensure appropriate safety monitoring before the start of the second infusion. 
Similar infusion times are currently being used in trials evaluating nivolumab and ipilimumab at 
similar dosing schedules in several tumor types and no safety concerns have been identified.

Differences in patient populations and clinical practice patterns in the different regions are well 
known  and can impact  OS outcomes.  The systematic  review  of the literature  on lipiodol  TACE  for 
HCC  reported  significantly  higher  median  OS in Japan  (31.3  months  [95%  CI: 22.9,  39.8])  than in 
the West (18.3 months [95% CI: 13.7, 22.9]) or Asia -Pacific (15.6 months [95% CI: 13.7, 22.9]) 
regions (Japan vs West region, p = 0.007; Japan vs Asia -Pacific region, p  = 0.0007; West vs 
Asia-Pacific  regions:  p = 0.3632).95 As such,  the impact  of differing  HCC  patient  populations  and 
different  approaches  to clinical  practice  in the different  regions  is still important  to consider.  This 
study will therefore stratify by region.  
5.4.8.2  Alpha -fetoprotein  
Higher  AFP levels  are related  to more  aggressive  cancer  phenotypes  and linked  with hepatic  cancer 
cells that have stem/progenitor features. Depending on the clinical setting, AFP cutoff levels of 
20, 200, 400, and 1000 ng/mL have been examined to assess the prognostic effect of AFP on 
long-term survival, mostly in a retrospective setting. A prospective propensity model study 
analyzed the prognostic ability of 4 different cutoffs of AFP in 2,579 unselected HCC patients. 
The study  showed  the independent predictive ability  of baseline serum AFP levels. Patients with 
baseline AFP levels ≥ 400 ng/mL had notably lower survivals than patients with lower values. 
The researchers  recommended  AFP cutoff  levels  of 20 and 400 ng/mL  as feasible  cutoffs  to predict  
long-term survival outcome in unselected patients.128 The lower cut -off of 20 ng/mL is the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) for AFP  and is more relevant to studies in early -stage HCC. Patients with 
intermediate -stage  disease  are more  likely  to have  elevated  AFP levels.  This study  will use a cutoff 
level of 400 ng/mL for stratification.  
5.4.8.3  Albumin -bilirubin  Grade  
Assessment of liver function is particularly important in HCC trials because cirrhosis is a 
competing cause of death. The ALBI grade129 was developed to assess liver function in patients 
with HCC that involved serum bilirubin and albumin levels. Data from a global database of  
3,887 patients demonstrated that objective measures of liver dysfunction, as measured by the 
ALBI grade, influence survival in patients with HCC in the Japan, US/EU, and China cohorts. 
Patients in the US/EU cohort with an ALBI Grade 1 had a median survival of 24.5 months 
compared  to 14.7 months  for those  with ALBI  Grade  2 and 4.7 months  for those  with 
ALBI Grade  3. Similarly, patients with ALBI Grade 1 in the Japan and China cohorts had better 
median  survival  than those  with ALBI  Grade  2 and 3.130 These  data show  that ALBI  grade  can be 
used to stratify  patients with  HCC into 3 risk categories.  This study  will use  ALBI Grade  1 and 2 
as a stratification factor. Participants with Grade 3 ALBI are not eligible for TACE and therefore 
these patients are excluded.

 5.4.9  Rationale  for 2 Year  Duration  of Treatment  with Nivolumab  ± Ipilimumab  
The optimal  duration  of immunotherapy  is an important  question  and continues  to be investigated. 
Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and ipilimumab development 
program  indicate  that most  of the responses  occur  early,  with a median  time to response  of 
2-4 months,  and emerging  data suggest  that benefit can  be maintained  in the absence  of continued 
treatment. A retrospective pooled analysis of two melanoma studies suggests the majority of 
patients  who discontinue  nivolumab  and/or  ipilimumab  for toxicity  maintain  disease  control  in the 
absence of further treatment.131 Furthermore, a limited duration of ipilimumab, including only  4 
induction doses, resulted in long -term survival in patients with metastatic melanoma, with a 
sustained plateau in survival starting around 2 years after the start of treatment.132 
Accumulating data suggest that 2 years of  PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be sufficient 
for long -term benefit. CA209003, a dose -escalation cohort expansion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivolumab in participants with previously treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 participants with NSCLC), specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. 
Among 16 participants with NSCLC who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of 
treatment, 12 participants were alive > 5 years and remained progression -free without any 
subsequent  therapy.  In the CA209003  NSCLC  cohort,  the OS curve  begins  to plateau  after 2 years,  
with an OS rate of  25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.133 These survival outcomes are similar to 
Phase 3 studies in previously  treated NSCLC, in which nivolumab treatment was continued until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity (2 -year OS rates of 23% and 29%, and 3 -year OS rates of 
16-18% for squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, respectively).134 
Taken together,  these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 years is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically  meaningful  benefit  and that the risk of progression  after discontinuing  treatment  at 
2 years is low.  
In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of  only 1 year was associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously  treated patients with NSCLC, suggesting that treatment beyond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, participants with previously treated advanced NSCLC who 
completed  1 year of nivolumab  therapy  were  randomized  to either  continue  or stop treatment,  with 
the option of retreatment upon progression. Among 163 participants still on treatment at 1 year 
and without progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant 
improvement  in PFS compared  to those  who were  randomized  to stop treatment,  with median  PFS 
(post -randomization) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively (HR, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.71). 
With a median follow -up of 14.9 months post -randomization, there also was a trend for patients 
on continued  treatment  to live longer  (OS HR, 0.63 [95%  CI: 0.33,  1.20]).  Of note,  the PFS curves 
in both groups plateau approximately 1 year after randomization (ie, 2 years after treatment 
initiation),  suggesting  that there  may be minimal benefit in extending  treatment beyond a total  of 
2 years.135 
Collectively, these data suggest  that there is minimal, if any, benefit derived from  continuing IO 
treatment  beyond  2 years  in advanced  tumors.  Even  though  immunotherapy  is well tolerated,

 patients will be at risk for additional toxicity  with longer -term treatment.  Therefore,  in this study, 
treatment will be given for a maximum of 2 years from  the start of study  treatment.  
5.4.10  Rationale  for Unblinding  
 
 
Therefore,  a 
decision  was made by  BMS  in September  2021  to stop  the study.  
Upon  implementation  of Protocol  Amendment  01, participants  will be unblinded  to allow  BMS  to 
continue safety monitoring the remaining participants on study without blinding while 
streamlining other study procedures. All investigators, ethics committees, and health authorities 
have been informed.  
5.5 Justification for Dose  
The doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab in this study were based on the overall clinical 
pharmacology  profile  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab  and clinical  assessment  of the combination  in 
HCC.  
5.5.1  Nivolumab  Clinical  Pharmacology  Summary  
The PK of nivolumab were studied in participants over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 
administered  as a single  dose or as multiple  doses  of nivolumab  every  2 or 3 weeks.  The geometric 
mean (coefficient of variation [%CV], %) CL was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume  of 
distribution  at steady  state (Vss)  was 8.0 L (30.4%),  and geometric  mean  elimination 
half-life (t1/2) was 26.7  days (101%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 
12 weeks  when  administered  at 3 mg/kg Q2W,  and systemic  accumulation was  approximately 
3-fold. The exposure  to nivolumab  increased  dose-proportionally  over the dose range  of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg  administered  Q2W.  The CL of nivolumab  increased  with increasing  body  weight.  The PPK 
analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of 
nivolumab:  age (29 to 87 years),  gender,  race,  baseline  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  and PD-L1. 
A PPK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor 
type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment.  
Although  ECOG  performance  status,  baseline  glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR),  albumin,  and body 
weight  had an effect  on nivolumab  CL, the effect  was not clinically  meaningful.  When  nivolumab 
was administered in combination with ipilimumab, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 24%, 
whereas there was no effect  on the CL of ipilimumab. Additionally, PPK and E -R analyses have 
been performed to support use of 240 -mg Q2W  dosing in addition  to the 3 mg/kg  Q2W  regimen. 
Using  the PPK model,  exposure  of nivolumab  at a 240-mg flat dose was identical  to a dose of 
3 mg/kg for participants weighing 80 kg, which was the approximate median body weight in 
nivolumab clinical trials.

 5.5.2  Ipilimumab  Clinical  Pharmacology  Summary  
The PPK of ipilimumab, when administered alone or in combination with nivolumab, to 
participants with melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), HCC, and CRC has 
been assessed previously. The PK of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab was well 
described  by a linear  2-compartment  model  with time-varying  CL. Ipilimumab  CL decreased  with 
time and the decrease was ~ 22% in participants receiving ipilimumab in combination with 
nivolumab.  The CL of ipilimumab  was higher  when  administered  in combination  with nivolumab 
1 mg/kg  Q2W,  1 mg/kg  Q3W,  or 3 mg/kg  Q2W  compared  to ipilimumab  monotherapy;  however, 
the magnitude  of these  differences  are not considered  to be clinically  relevant  (< 20%).  Ipilimumab 
CL, when  given  in combination  with nivolumab  0.3 mg/kg  or 3 mg/kg  Q3W,  was not significantly 
different  from  that seen with ipilimumab  monotherapy.  The CL of ipilimumab  in participants  with 
NSCLC, RCC, HCC, and CRC was not significantly different relative to participants with 
melanoma. The CL of ipilimumab was lower in participants with SCLC relative to participants 
with melanoma; however, the magnitude of the difference was not considered to be clinically 
relevant. Ipilimumab CL was not significantly different in the presence of anti -ipilimumab 
antibodies.  
Full details  on the clinical  pharmacology  aspects  of ipilimumab  can be found  in the IB.82 
5.5.3  Justification for Dose of Nivolumab  
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W was selected based on clinical data and modeling and 
simulation approaches using population PK (PPK) and E -R analyses of data from studies in 
multiple  tumor  types  (melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC)  where  body  weight  normalized 
dosing  (mg/kg)  has been  used.  (See Section  5.4.6  [Rationale  for Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Dose 
and Schedule] for additional clinical data in HCC for justification of the selected treatments.)  
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proportional exposure over a 
dose range  of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and no differences in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance (CL) and volume of distribution were found to increase as the 
body  weight increases, but less than proportionally with increasing weight, indicating that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over -adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model  previously  developed  using  data from  NSCLC  participants  has recently  been  updated,  using 
data from  1,544  participants  from  7 studies  investigating  nivolumab  in the treatment  of melanoma, 
NSCLC,  and RCC. In this dataset,  the median  (minimum  - maximum)  weight  was 
77 kg (35-160 kg), and thus,  an approximately  equivalent  dose of 3 mg/kg  for an 80 kg participant, 
nivolumab  240 mg Q2W,  was selected  for future  studies.  To predict  relevant  summary  exposures 
of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, the PPK model  was used to  simulate nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
240 mg Q2W.  In the simulations,  the simulated  patient  populations  consisted  of 1,000  participants 
per treatment arm randomly sampled from the aforementioned pooled database of cancer 
participants. Because no differences in PK were noted across ethnicities and tumor types, these 
simulated melanoma and NSCLC data will be applicable to participants with other tumor types. 
The simulated measure of exposure of interest, steady -state average concentrations (Cavgss) for

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 240 mg Q2W are predicted to be similar for all participants in reference to 80 -kg participants 
receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W.  
Nivolumab is safe and well tolerated up to a 10 mg/kg Q2W dose level. AEs have been broadly 
consistent  across  tumor  types  following  monotherapy  and have  not demonstrated  clear 
dose-response or E -R relationships. Additionally, the simulated median and 95th  prediction 
interval of  nivolumab summary  exposures across body  weight range (35 -160 kg) are predicted to 
be maintained  below the corresponding observed highest exposure experienced  in nivolumab  
(ie, 95th percentile following nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W from clinical study CA209003). Thus, 
while  participants  in the lower  body  weight  ranges  would  have  greater  exposures  than 
80-kg participants, the exposures are predicted to be within the range of observed exposures at 
doses  (up to 10 mg/kg  Q2W)  used in the nivolumab  clinical  program  and are not considered  to put 
participants at increased risk. For participants with greater body  weights, the simulated ranges of 
exposures are also not expected to affect efficacy, because the exposures predicted following 
administration  of a 240 mg Q2W  are on the flat part of the E-R curves  for previously  investigated 
tumors,  melanoma  and NSCLC.  Given  the similarity  of nivolumab  PK across  tumor  types  and the 
similar  exposures  predicted  following  administration  of 240-mg flat dose compared  to 3 mg/kg,  it 
is expected  that the safety  and efficacy  profile  of 240 mg  nivolumab  will be similar  to that of 
3 mg/kg nivolumab. Thus, nivolumab 240 mg Q2W over 30 minutes will be used in this study.  
5.5.4  Justification for Dose of Ipilimumab  
The preliminary safety data from CA209040 cohort 4, which evaluated 3 dosing schedules of 
nivolumab  + ipilimumab  (N1+I3  Q3W,  N3+I1  Q3W, and  N3+I1  Q6W)  in advanced  HCC, shows 
a lower  rate of drug-related  AEs,  SAEs, and  AEs leading  to discontinuation  with the N3+I1  Q6W 
dose compared  with the N1+I3 Q3W  dose.3 The response  rate and DOR  are similar  for all dosing 
arms. Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W dosing is being chosen for this 
study  to be combined  with TACE  as it has a lower  rate of AEs  with comparable  efficacy.  Please  
see Section  5.4.6  (Rationale  for Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Dose  and Schedule)  for further  details.

 5) Other  Exclusion  Criteria  
a) Prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated. (Note: under certain specific 
circumstances,  and only in countries  where  local  regulations  permit,  a person  who has been 
imprisoned may be included or permitted to continue as a participant. Strict conditions 
apply and BMS approval is required.)  
b) Participants  who are compulsorily  detained  for treatment  of either  a psychiatric  or physical 
(eg, infectious disease) illness.  
 
Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of  the study 
participants and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that participants fully 
meet all eligibility criteria.  
6.3 Lifestyle  Restrictions  
Not applicable.  No restrictions  are required.  
6.4 Screen  Failures  
Screen  failures  are defined  as participants  who consent  to participate  in the clinical  study  but who 
are not subsequently randomized in the study/included in the analysis population. A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and 
any serious AEs.  
6.4.1  Retesting  During  Screening  or Lead -In Period  
This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a 
pretreatment  failure  (ie, participant  has not been  randomized  / has not been  treated).  If re-enrolled, 
the participant must be re -consented  
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening or  
Lead -in Period  will be permitted  (in addition  to any parameters  that require  a confirmatory  value).  
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.  
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2 -1 (Screening Procedural 
Outline) may  be repeated  in an effort  to find all possible  well-qualified  participants.  Consultation 
with the Medical Monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular 
parameter is clinically relevant.  
7 TREATMENT  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study 
randomization or treatment allocation.

 Study  treatment  includes  both Investigational  [Medicinal]  Product  (IP/IMP)  and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non -IMP) and can consist of the following:  
• Nivolumab  
• Ipilimumab  
• Nivolumab -Placebo  (0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  or 5% Dextrose  Injection)  
• Ipilimumab -Placebo  (0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  or 5% Dextrose  Injection)  
 
The normal  saline or  dextrose to  be used  as placebo will  not be  provided by  the Sponsor.  
Per Protocol  Amendment  01, participants  will no longer  receive  placebo  infusions  following 
unblinding.  
An IP, also known as an IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already  with a marketing  authorization  but used or assembled  (formulated  or packaged)  differently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form.  
Other  medications  used as support  or escape  medication  for preventative,  diagnostic,  or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of  the SOC for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non -IPs. In this 
study, the TACE procedure is not considered to be a study treatment.  
Premedications used to treat infusion reactions should be sourced by the investigative sites if 
available and permitted by local regulations.

7.1.1  Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Administration  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, participants in Arm B (nivolumab + placebo + TACE) and 
Arm C (placebos + TACE) will no longer receive placebo following unblinding.  
Participants should receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg Q2W) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg 
Q6W),  or their matching  placebos,  as an approximately  30-minute  infusion  on Cycle  1 Day 1 until 
progression as assessed by investigator (unless treatment beyond progression was allowed), 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, completion of 2 years of study medication, or the 
study ends, whichever occurs first.  
Participants should begin study treatment within 3 calendar days after randomization. Dosing 
calculations for ipilimumab should be based on the body weight assessed at baseline. It is not 
necessary  to re-calculate  subsequent  doses  if the participant’s  weight  is within  10% of the baseline 
weight  or the weight  used to calculate  the previous  dose.  All doses  should  be rounded  to the nearest 
milligram per institutional standard.  
After  the first cycle,  subsequent  dosing  should  be based  on the actual  date of administration  of the 
previous  cycle.  Participants  may be dosed  no less than 12 days and no more  than 18 days between 
nivolumab  or matching  placebo  doses  and no less than 36 days and no more  than 60 days between 
ipilimumab or matching  placebo doses. Doses may be administered within 3 days before or  after 
the scheduled date, if necessary. All  TACE related toxicities must have resolved to baseline or 
Grade 1 before study treatment is resumed.  
When study treatments (nivolumab and ipilimumab or their matching placebos) are to be 
administered  on the same  day, nivolumab  is to be administered  first. Nivolumab  infusion  must  be 
promptly followed by a saline flush of diluent to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the 
ipilimumab  infusion.  The second  infusion  will always  be the ipilimumab  study  drug and will start

 after the infusion  line has been  flushed,  filters  changed,  and participant  has been observed  to ensure 
no infusion  reaction  has occurred.  The time in between  infusions  is expected  to be approximately 
30 minutes but may be more or less depending on the situation.  
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of treatment. Participants should be 
carefully monitored for infusion reactions during administration. If an acute infusion reaction is 
noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.4.2  (Nivolumab and Ipilimumab 
Dose Delay Criteria).  
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of study treatment allowed. Doses of nivolumab 
and/or ipilimumab and their matching placebos may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued, 
depending  on how well the participant tolerates  the treatment.  Dosing  visits  are not skipped,  only 
delayed. If dosing is delayed, all study treatments planned to be administered on the same day 
should  be delayed  at the same  time.  If dosing  is resumed  after a delay,  all study  treatments  planned 
must  be resumed  on the same  day. For more  details,  see Section  7.4.2  (Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab 
Dose Delay Criteria) and Section 8.1.1.1  (Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Treatment 
Discontinuation).  
Nivolumab injection, 10 mg/mL is to be administered as an IV infusion through a 0.2 -micron to 
1.2-micron  pore size, low-protein binding in -line filter  at the protocol -specified  doses.  It is not to 
be administered  as an IV push  or bolus  injection.  Nivolumab  infusion  must  be promptly followed 
by a flush of  diluent to clear the line. Instructions for preparation of nivolumab infusion may be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual or IB. Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared 
solution as the product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent.  
Separate  infusion bags  and filters  should  be used when  administering  nivolumab  and ipilimumab 
on the same day.  
Ipilimumab is to  be administered  as an approximately  30-minute  IV infusion and may be infused 
using  a volumetric  pump with  a 0.2-micron  to 1.2-micron, low -protein  binding  in-line filter  at the 
protocol -specified dose. Care must be taken to assure sterility  of the prepared solutions, since the 
drug product  does not contain  any antimicrobial  preservatives  or bacteriostatic  agents.  At the end 
of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of diluent.  
Please  refer  to the current  version  of the IBs1,82 and/or  Pharmacy  Manual  for complete  preparation, 
storage, and handling information for nivolumab and ipilimumab.  
7.1.2  TACE Procedure  
No significant  differences  in efficacy  and safety  have  been  observed  between  conventional  TACE 
and DEB -TACE.137,138 This trial allows the use of conventional TACE and DEB -TACE and the 
choice of procedure to use is left to the Investigator’ s discretion. However, once the participant 
starts receiving either conventional TACE or DEB -TACE, the same TACE procedure must be 
followed throughout the study for that participant. Switching to conventional TACE for 
participants  that started  the trial with DEB -TACE  and to DEB -TACE  for participants  who received  
conventional  TACE  is not permitted.  Additionally,  once conventional  TACE  has been 
administered  with a select  chemotherapy  agent,  switching  to a different  chemotherapy  agent  is not

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 permitted. For participants receiving DEB -TACE or conventional TACE, the TACE technique 
should be maintained consistently throughout the study.  
First TACE  should  be administered  no later than 7 days (+ 3 days)  after study  drug administration. 
All drug-related  toxicities  must  have  resolved  to Grade  1 or baseline  before  TACE  is administered. 
TACE sessions can be continued until all  the liver lesions are adequately treated. Evaluation for 
additional  on-demand  TACE  will occur  at each imaging  as per Section  2 (Schedule  of Activities). 
In general, imaging is repeated 4 -8 weeks  after TACE  to assess the need for repeat TACE.  Since 
scheduled imaging occurs every  6 weeks for the first 48 weeks, imaging on study  will fall within 
the 4 - to 8-week window. Ad -hoc imaging can be performed if clinically necessary at any time. 
TACE can be repeated if the dynamic tumor burden is at least 50% of the total tumor burden at 
baseline or earlier, as per Investigator discretion, if it is felt to be in the best interest of the 
participant or as per local practice and guidelines (see Figure 7.1.2 -1). Once a determination is 
made to perform TACE, it should be performed within 4 weeks.

Burden  
 
Abbreviations:  mm = millimeter;  TACE  = trans -arterial  chemoembolization.  
 
Once randomized, participants should receive first TACE in 7 days (+3 days) after study drug 
administration  and then TACE  as needed,  until participant  is no longer  eligible  for further  TACE, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever occurs first. Once 
progression has been met  as assessed by  the investigator, the participant may  continue to receive

 additional TACE until the participant is no longer eligible for further TACE, per Investigator 
discretion, if it is felt to be in the best interest of the participant.  
TACE should be administered as per local  practices and guidelines. TACE should be given with 
at least a 7 -day window of systemic therapy. All drug -related toxicities must have resolved to 
Grade  1 or baseline  before  TACE  is administered,  and participants  must  be evaluated  as per Table  
2-2 prior to TACE procedure.  
Premedications for  TACE, such  as analgesics,  antiemetics,  sedatives,  etc, are allowed  and are left 
to the discretion  of the Investigator;  however,  the use of corticosteroids  for the prophylaxis  of PES 
is not permitted (see Section 7.7  [Concomitant Therapy] for additional details).

7.2 Method  of Treatment  Assignment  
CA20974W is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial. Participants with 
intermediate -stage  HCC  whose  tumor  characteristics  exceed  the BMU7  criteria  will be eligible  to 
participate.  All participants  will be randomized  using  an IRT system.  Before  the study  is initiated, 
each user will receive log -in information and directions on how to access the IRT.  
After  the participant’s  initial  eligibility  is established  and informed  consent  has been  obtained,  the 
participant  must  be enrolled  into the study  by calling  the IRT to obtain  a participant  number.  Every 
participant  that signs the ICF must be assigned a participant  number in  IRT. Specific instructions 
for using  IRT will be provided  to the investigational  site in a separate  document.  The Investigator 
or other delegated and trained site personnel will register the participant for enrollment by 
following the enrollment procedures established by BMS.  
The following  information  is required  for enrollment:  
• Date that informed consent was obtained  
• Date  of birth,  where  applicable  by local  regulations  
• Gender at birth 
 
Once  enrolled  in IRT, participants  who have  met all eligibility  criteria  will be ready  to be 
randomized through IRT. The following information is required for participant randomization:  
• Participant  number  
• Date  of birth,  where  applicable  per local  regulations  
• ALBI  grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2) 
• Baseline  AFP level  (< 400 ng/mL  vs ≥ 400 ng/mL)  
• Region  (West [EU,  Americas,  and Australia]  vs Japan  vs rest of Asia)  
• Confirmation  of tumor  tissue  sample  receipt  and acceptability  at the central  laboratory  
• Confirmation  of eligibility  by BICR

 Participants meeting all  eligibility criteria  will be randomized into one of  the treatment arms in a 
1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by the following factors:  
• ALBI  grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2) 
• Baseline  AFP level  (< 400 ng/mL  vs ≥ 400 ng/mL)  
• Region  (West [EU,  Americas,  and Australia]  vs Japan  vs rest of Asia)  
 
Blinded  study  treatment  was dispensed  at the study  visits  as listed  in Schedule  of Activities 
(Section 2 ). The exact procedures for using the IRT will be detailed in the IRT Manual.  
As of 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment for new participants was closed and the study will be unblinded 
per Protocol Amendment 01.  
7.3 Blinding  
The Sponsor, participants, Investigator, and site staff will be blinded to the study therapy 
administered. Each investigative site must assign an unblinded pharmacist/designee, and an 
unblinded site monitor will be assigned to provide oversight of drug supply and other unblinded 
study documentation.  
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical  study. However, in the 
event  of a medical  emergency  or pregnancy  in an individual  participant  in which  knowledge  of the 
IP is critical to the participant's management,  the blind for that participant may be broken by the 
Investigator.  The participant’s  safety  takes  priority  over any other  considerations  in determining  if 
a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment, the Investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary (ie, that it will alter the participant's 
immediate  management).  In many  cases,  particularly  when  the emergency  is clearly  not related  to 
the IP,  the problem  may be properly  managed by assuming that the participant is receiving active 
product.  It is highly  desirable that  the decision  to unblind  treatment assignment  be discussed  with 
the BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical  Scientist,  but the Investigator  always  has ultimate  authority 
for the decision  to unblind.  The actual  task of unblinding  can be delegated  by the Investigator  to a 
designee  assigned  the task on the Delegation  of Authority. The  Principal  Investigator  should  only 
call in for emergency  unblinding  AFTER  the decision  to discontinue  the participant  has been  made.  
For this study,  the method  of unblinding  for emergency  purposes  is through  the IRT. 
For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT Manual.  
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical Scientist and 
ensure every attempt is made to preserve the blind.  
Any request to unblind a participant for non -emergency purposes should be discussed with the 
BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical Scientist.  
Designated staff of BMS Research & Development (R&D) may be unblinded prior to database 
lock to facilitate the bioanalytical  analysis  of pharmacokinetic  samples  and IMG. A  bioanalytical 
scientist  in the Bioanalytical  Sciences  department  of BMS  R&D  (or a designee  in the external

 central bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to the randomized treatment assignments in 
order to minimize unnecessary bioanalytical analysis of samples.  
As of 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment for new participants was closed. Per Protocol Amendment 01, 
the objectives of this study have been amended to safety only . The study  will be unblinded to 
facilitate ongoing safety monitoring.  
7.3.1  Unblinding at the Time of Disease Recurrence/Progression  
As of 22 -Sep-2021, enrollment for new participants was closed. Per Protocol Amendment 01, 
the objectives of this study have been amended to safety only. The study  will be unblinded to 
facilitate ongoing safety monitoring.  
If a participant is assessed by the Investigator to have HCC disease recurrence/progression 
(Section  9.1.1  [Imaging Assessment for the Study]), and unblinding is considered necessary to 
inform the appropriate subsequent anti -cancer therapy, the study treatment assignment for the 
participant  can be obtained  by the Investigator  through  IRT for non-emergency  unblinding. 
The Investigator should follow the procedures outlined in the IRT Manual to obtain the 
participant’s study  treatment assignment. The BMS central  study  team  (including, but not limited 
to, clinical, statistics, and data management) will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
Investigators  must  wait for confirmation  of recurrence/progression  from  the BICR  prior  to 
non-emergency unblinding for the purpose of initiating subsequent anti -cancer therapy, unless 
clinical  considerations  require  immediate  intervention  (eg, symptomatic  brain  metastases). 
If subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  (including  systemic  cancer  therapy,  radiotherapy,  or 
tumor -directed surgery) is planned prior to BICR confirmation of recurrence/progression, the 
Investigator  must  contact  the BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical  Scientist to  discuss  the case prior 
to the start of any of such therapy.  
If a participant is diagnosed with a non -HCC secondary cancer, blinding should be preserved 
unless  specific  circumstances,  to be discussed  with the BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical  Scientist, 
require that the blind be broken (eg, participant  has metastases and could enroll on a clinical  trial 
but would be ineligible if he or she had prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy).  
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT. For 
information on how to unblind in an emergency, please see Section 7.3  (Blinding).  
7.4 Dosage Modification  
7.4.1  Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Dose  Modifications  
No dose modifications  for nivolumab  or ipilimumab  are allowed.  
7.4.2  Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Dose Delay  Criteria  
Dose delay criteria summarized in Table 7.4.2 -1 apply for all drug -related AEs, regardless of 
whether  the event is attributed to nivolumab or ipilimumab or both. Delay administration of  both 
nivolumab and ipilimumab if any of the delay criteria in Table 7.4.2 -1 are met.

 Delay nivolumab and ipilimumab for any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness 
which,  in the judgment  of the Investigator,  warrants  delaying  the dose of study  medication.  Delay 
study therapy also in cases of confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Participants receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab who have drug -related  toxicities that meet the 
criteria for dose delay should have both drugs (nivolumab and ipilimumab) delayed until 
retreatment criteria are met, regardless of  whether or not the event is attributed to 1 of  the drugs. 
Tumor assessments for all participants should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.  
Participants who require delay of nivolumab and ipilimumab should be re -evaluated weekly, or 
more frequently if clinically  indicated, and  resume study  treatment  when  re-treatment criteria are 
met (see Section  8.1.3  [Post  Study Treatment  Study Follow -up]).  Please  see also  Appendix  6 
(IO Management Algorithms) for guidance on appropriate management and follow -up of AEs.

 7.4.3  Treatment  of Nivolumab - or Ipilimumab -related  Infusion  Reactions  
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contains only human Ig protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic  and induce  infusion  or hypersensitivity  reactions.  However,  if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like reactions. All Grade  3 or 4 
infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical 
Scientist and reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded 
according to National  Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0 guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below based on NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grading 
definitions  and may be modified  based  on local  treatment  standards  and guidelines,  as appropriate.  
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):  
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional study treatment administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, IV 
fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours):  
• Stop the study treatment infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol  325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted,  then restart the infusion at 50% of 
the original  infusion  rate when  symptoms  resolve;  if no further  complications  ensue  after 
30 minutes,  the rate may be increased  to 100%  of the original  infusion  rate. Monitor  participant 
closely. If  symptoms  recur,  then no further  study  medication  will be administered  at that visit.  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before study treatment infusions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [eg, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic  medication  and/or  brief  interruption  of infusion];  recurrence  of symptoms  following 
initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated).

 • Immediately discontinue infusion of study treatment. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline 
and treat the participant  as follows:  Recommend  bronchodilators,  epinephrine  0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored 
until the Investigator  is comfortable  that the symptoms  will not recur.  Study  treatment will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the 
symptoms.  
 
In case of late -occurring  hypersensitivity  symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The IP should be stored in a secure area according  to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator  to ensure  that IP is only dispensed  to study  Participants.  The IP must  be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study  treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental  conditions  (temperature,  light,  and humidity)  as determined  by BMS. 
If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment 
should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately.  
Study  treatment  not supplied  by BMS  will be stored  in accordance  with the package  insert.  
IP documentation  (whether  supplied  by BMS  or not) must  be maintained  that includes  all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of  drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study  treatment are provided in 
Appendix 2  and the CA20974W Pharmacy Manual.

 7.7.1  Prohibited  and/or  Restricted  Treatments  
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to treat drug -related 
AEs):  
• Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]), within 30 days prior to randomization, during treatment, 
and until 100 days after the last dose.  
• Immunosuppressive  agents.  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 6.2  
[Exclusion Criteria] criterion 1) subcriterion 1) and Section 7.7.3  [Permitted Therapy]).  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, 
locoregional  therapy,  hormonal  therapy,  immunotherapy,  palliative  or non-palliative  radiation 
therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of HCC). TACE on demand is 
allowed as per protocol -defined criteria.  
• Any botanical  preparation  (eg, herbal  supplements  or traditional  Chinese  medicines)  intended 
to treat the disease  under  study  or provide  supportive  care.  Use of marijuana  and its derivatives 
for treatment of  symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment are permitted if obtained by 
medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical prescription) has been legalized 
locally.  
• Concurrent  use of antiviral  therapy  containing  interferon  (IFN).  
 
7.7.2  Other Restrictions and Precautions  
• Participants  with a condition  requiring  systemic  treatment  with either  corticosteroids  (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of 
randomization  are excluded.  Inhaled  or topical  steroids,  and adrenal  replacement  steroid  doses  
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune 
disease.  
• Investigators  are strongly  encouraged  to wait for confirmation  of recurrence/progression  from 
the BICR prior to initiating subsequent systemic cancer therapy, loco -regional therapy, or 
tumor -directed surgery for suspected recurrence/progression unless clinical considerations 
require immediate intervention (eg, symptomatic brain metastases). If subsequent systemic 
cancer therapy, loco -regional therapy, or tumor -directed surgery is planned prior to BICR 
confirmation of recurrence/progression, the Investigator must contact the BMS Medical 
Monitor or Clinical Scientist to discuss the case prior to the start of any of these procedures.  
 
7.7.2.1  Imaging Restriction and Precautions  
It is the local  imaging  facility’s  responsibility  to determine,  based  on participant  attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be 
considered  in this assessment.  Participants  with renal  insufficiency  are to be assessed  as to whether 
or not they  should receive contrast and if so, which contrast agent and dose is appropriate.

 Specific  to MRI,  participants  with severe  renal  insufficiency  (ie, eGFR  < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are 
at increased  risk of nephrogenic  systemic  fibrosis;  therefore,  MRI  contrast  is contraindicated. 
In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, 
pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.  
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local  SOC. The ultimate decision  to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the 
Investigator, and standards set by the local IEC.  
7.7.3  Permitted Therapy  
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less -than-3-weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis  (eg, contrast  dye allergy)  or for treatment  of non-autoimmune  conditions  
(eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. 
Immunosuppressive doses (eg, prednisone > 10 mg/day or equivalent) in the context of treating 
AEs are permitted.  
Supportive  care for disease -related  symptoms may  be offered  to all participants  on the trial. 
COVID -19 vaccines  that are NOT  live (not replication  competent)  are permitted  during  the study 
and after the last dose of IP. No data are available on the response to COVID -19 vaccines. The 
efficacy  and safety  of vaccination in  participants  who are receiving  nivolumab  and ipilimumab  or 
nivolumab  alone  are unknown.  Please  contact  the BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical  Scientist  with 
any questions related to COVID -19 vaccines.  
7.7.3.1  Antiviral Therapy  
Participants  on antiviral  therapy  for hepatitis  B or C should  continue  the treatment  during  the study, 
providing the regimen is IFN -free. Changing of dosage and regimens of antiviral  therapy  will be 
at the discretion of  the Investigator. If a participant has a > 1 log IU/mL increase in HBV DNA, 
then virologic  breakthrough  should  be considered  and HBV  DNA  confirmed.  Adherence  to current 
antiviral  therapy  should  be assessed,  and resistance  testing  performed  according  to local  practices. 
If a participant  has documented  virologic  breakthrough  due to antiviral  resistance,  then this should 
be managed based on standardized regional guidelines and treatment with study treatment 
temporarily held. The participant may resume study treatment once virologic control is 
reestablished  . 
For any participant  who continues  to be HCV  RNA  positive  after receiving  study  treatment,  current 
guidelines  for management  of chronic  HCV  infection,  including  those  from  American  Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), European Association for the Study of the Liver 
(EASL), or Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) may be consulted. 
Initiation  of direct -acting  antivirals  (DAAs)  for HCV  is allowed  at the discretion  of the Investigator 
after discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical Scientist.

At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS -supplied study treatment for the maximum treatment duration 
specified in Section 7.1  (Treatments Administered) . Study treatment will be provided via an 
extension of the study, a rollover study requiring approval by responsible health authority and 
ethics committee, or through another mechanism at the discretion of BMS.  
BMS  reserves  the right to  terminate  access  to BMS -supplied  study  treatment  if any of the following 
occur:  
• The study  is terminated due to safety  concerns.  
• The development  of nivolumab/ipilimumab  is terminated  for other  reasons,  including, but  not 
limited to, lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives.  
• The participant  can obtain  medication from  a government -sponsored  or private  health  program.  
 
In all cases,  BMS  will follow  local  regulations.  
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment  
Participants  MUST  discontinue IP (and  non-IP at the discretion  of the Investigator)  for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Participant’s request to stop study treatment. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified 
follow -up procedures.  The only exception  to this is when  a participant specifically  withdraws 
consent  for any further  contact  with him/her  or persons  previously  authorized  by the participant 
to provide this information.  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
Investigator,  indicates  that continued  participation  in the study  is not in the best interest  of the 
participant.  
• Termination  of the study  by BMS.  
• Loss of ability  to freely  provide consent  through imprisonment  or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific  circumstances,  and only in countries  where  local  regulations  permit,  a participant  who 
has been  imprisoned  may be permitted  to continue  as a participant.  Strict  conditions  apply  and 
BMS approval is required.)  
• Criteria  listed  in Section  8.1.1  (Treatment  Discontinuation  Criteria).  
• Participants meeting progression as assessed by investigator, unless eligible to continue with 
treatment beyond progression (see Section 5.1.4  [Treatment Beyond Progression]).

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  105 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 • Disease  progression  or occurrence  of a secondary  malignancy  which  requires  systemic  therapy 
or radiotherapy for treatment.  
• Pregnancy,  if locally  mandated  (see Appendix  9 for country -specific  requirements).  
 
Refer to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that can be completed.  
In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator  must  immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist of this event. In most cases, the 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary  for participant  safety).  Study  treatment  must  be permanently  discontinued  where  locally 
mandated. See Section 9.2.6  (Pregnancy).  
All participants  who discontinue  study  treatment  should  comply  with protocol -specified  follow -up 
procedures  as outlined in  Section  2 (Schedule  of Activities). The  only exception to  this requirement 
is when a participant withdraws consent for all study  procedures, including post -treatment study 
follow -up, or loses  the ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned  or involuntarily  incarcerated  for 
the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study  treatment is  discontinued  prior  to the participant’s  completion  of the study,  the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  
8.1.1  Treatment Discontinuation Criteria  
8.1.1.1  Criteria  for Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab  Treatment  Discontinuation  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment must be permanently discontinued per criteria in Table  
7.4.2 -1 in Section 7.4 . Discontinue nivolumab and i pilimumab for any adverse event, laboratory 
abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a 
substantial clinical risk to the participant with  continued nivolumab  and ipilimumab  dosing. Any 
event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose requires 
discontinuation, with the following exceptions:  
• Dosing  delays  to allow  for prolonged  steroid  tapers  to manage  drug-related  AEs are allowed.  
• Dosing  delays  lasting  > 8 weeks  from  the previous  dose that occur  for non-drug-related  reasons 
may be allowed if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor (or Clinical Scientist).  
 
Tumor  assessments  should  continue  as per protocol,  even  if dosing  is delayed.  Periodic  study  visits 
to assess  safety  and laboratory  studies  should  also continue Q6W, or more frequently if  clinically 
indicated during such dosing delays.

 8.1.2  Criteria to Resume Treatment  
Participants may resume treatment with study drug if they have completed AE management (ie, 
corticosteroid taper) or are on < 10 mg prednisone or equivalent and meet the requirements per 
Table 7.4.2 -1. 
Participants with SARS -CoV -2 infection (either confirmed or suspected) may resume treatment 
after all of the following conditions are met:  
• At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical  illness)  have  passed  since  symptoms  first appeared 
or positive test result (eg, reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction [RT -PCR] or viral 
antigen), and  
• Resolution  of acute  symptoms  (including  at least 24 hours  have  passed  since  last fever  without 
fever -reducing medications), and  
• Evaluation by the Investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would place 
the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment  
 
For suspected cases, treatment may also resume if SARS -CoV -2 infection is ruled out and other 
criteria to resume treatment are met.  
When criteria to resume treatment are met,  resume both nivolumab and ipilimumab on the same 
day. 
Prior to re -initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 8 weeks, the BMS 
Medical  Monitor  (or designee)  must  be consulted  (see Section  8.1.1.1  [Criteria  for Nivolumab  and 
Ipilimumab Treatment Discontinuation]). In addition, see Appendix  6 (IO Management 
Algorithms) for guidance on appropriate management and follow -up of AEs.  
8.1.3  Post  Study  Treatment  Study Follow -up 
Per Protocol Amendment 01, survival follow -up is not required. However, participants in 
the follow -up period  at the time  of Protocol  Amendment  01 implementation  are permitted  to 
continue  in the study.  Participants  will be followed  for assessment  of safety  through  100 days 
after the last dose of study treatment. Participants will not be followed for survival.  
The following information refers to the original study design: In this study, OS is a key 
endpoint of  the study. Post -study follow -up is of critical  importance  and is essential  to preserving 
participant  safety  and the integrity  of the study.  Participants  who discontinue  study  treatment  must 
continue  to be followed  (in this study  or a rollover  study)  for collection  of outcome  and/or  survival 
follow -up data,  as required  and in line with Section  5 (Study  Design)  until death  or the conclusion 
of the study.  
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all randomized participants outside of the 
protocol -defined  window  (see Section  2 [Schedule  of Activities]).  At the time of this request,  each 
participant  will be contacted  to determine  their survival  status  unless  the participant  has withdrawn 
consent for all contacts or is lost to follow -up.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  107 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Participants who discontinue study  treatment may continue to be followed. Subsequent  therapies 
received by the participant will also be reviewed and recorded.  
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study  
Participants  who request  to discontinue  study  treatment  will remain  in the study  and must  continue 
to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The  only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this information.  
• Participants should notify the Investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow -up in writing , whenever possible.  
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
Investigator,  as to whether  the withdrawal  is from  further  treatment  with study  treatment only 
or also from study procedures and/or post -treatment study follow -up, and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  
• In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information should be used to  determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
 
8.3 Lost  to Follow -Up 
• All reasonable  efforts  must  be made  to locate  participants  to determine  and report  their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the participant.  
• Lost to follow -up is defined by  the inability  to reach the participant after a minimum  of three 
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered  mail letter.  All attempts  should  be documented  in the participant’s medical  records.  
• If it is determined that  the participant has died,  the site will use permissible local methods  to 
obtain the date and cause of death.  
• If the Investigator’s use of third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of  the 
study  has been  included  in the participant’s informed  consent,  then the Investigator  may use a 
Sponsor -retained third -party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining the participant’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up 
portion of the study.  
• The site staff  and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information.  
• If after all attempts,  the participant  remains  lost to follow -up, then the last known  alive  date as 
determined  by the Investigator  should  be reported  and documented  in the participant’s  medical 
records.  
 
9 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES  
• Study  procedures  and timing  are summarized  in the Schedule  of Activities  (Section 2).

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 • Protocol  waivers  or exemptions  are not allowed.  
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 2 ), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet  all eligibility  criteria  before  randomization.  The Investigator  will maintain  a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm  eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures  conducted  as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical  management  (eg, blood  count, 
baseline  scans)  and obtained  before  signing  of informed  consent  may be utilized  for screening 
or baseline  purposes, provided  the procedure  meets  the protocol -defined  criteria  and has been 
performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ). 
• Additional measures, including non -study -required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected 
drug-induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the Follow -up Period via 
on-site/local laboratories until all study drug -related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or 
are deemed irreversible.  
• If a participant  shows  pulmonary -related  signs  (eg, hypoxia,  fever)  or symptoms  (eg, dyspnea, 
cough, fever) consistent with  possible pulmonary AEs, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS -936558 (nivolumab) IB.1 
• Some of  the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They  are intended  to be used as safety  monitoring  by the treating  physician.  Additional  testing 
or assessments may be performed as clinically  necessary or where required  by institutional  or 
local regulations.  
 
9.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
Study  evaluations will take place in accordance with the Schedule of Activities in Section 2 . Per 
Protocol Amendment 01, efficacy assessments will be conducted per the local standard of 
care.  
9.1.1  Imaging Assessment for the Study  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, imaging should continue per local standard of care. The 
following information refers to the original study design.  
Images  will be submitted  to a central  imaging  vendor  for BICR  on a rolling  basis  during  the study. 
Prior to scanning the first participant, sites should be qualified and understand the image 
acquisition guidelines and submission process, as outlined in the CA20974W Imaging Manual 
provided by the central imaging vendor.

 Section 9.1.2.1 [Definition of Baseline Tumor  Burden], no EHS [including regional lymph node 
involvement],  no portal  vein thrombosis,  and no VI), prior  to randomization.  Randomization  must 
occur within 4 weeks from screening imaging.  
9.1.1.4  BICR  Determination  of Progression  or Recurrence  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. Tumor assessments will be conducted by the 
investigator per local standard of care. The following information refers to the original study 
design.  
Sites should submit all scans to the central imaging vendor on a rolling basis, throughout the 
duration  of the study.  BICR  of scans  will occur  on a rolling  basis,  blinded  to treatment  arm, clinical 
data,  and Investigator  assessment  of submitted  scans.  The BICR  will be completed  and the results 
(TTTP  reached  or not) provided  to the site, as specified  in the imaging  vendor  documents,  provided 
there  are no pending  imaging  queries  to the site. All details  on the timelines  and associated  process 
requirements will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.  
Participants whose progression by TTTP criteria is not determined by the BICR will be required 
to continue  tumor  assessments  (if clinically  feasible)  according  to the protocol -specified  schedule, 
or sooner if clinically indicated. Also, if participants discontinue treatment without radiographic 
progression (TTTP as assessed by BICR), tumor assessments will continue according to the 
protocol -specified schedule, as noted in Section 2  (Schedule of Activities), until progression 
(TTTP as assessed by BICR), has been confirmed by BICR.  
9.1.2  Efficacy Assessments for TTTP  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. Tumor assessments will be conducted by the 
investigator per local standard of care. The following information refers to the original study 
design.  
9.1.2.1  Definition  of Baseline  Tumor  Burden  
The baseline  tumor  burden  in this design  will be the tumor  burden  recorded  on imaging  at the time 
of screening. The 5 largest (arterially enhancing portion measuring at least 10 mm) liver lesions 
will be selected for the calculation of tumor burden at baseline.  
9.1.2.2  Dynamic  Assessment  of Tumor  Burden  
During screening (see Section 9.1.2.1 [Definition of Baseline Tumor Burden]) and at each 
prescribed  imaging  timepoint  the 5 largest  liver lesions  will be selected  for the calculation  of tumor 
burden. These may be lesions exhibiting regrowth or any new (arterially enhancing portion 
measuring  at least 10 mm) liver lesions. This assessment of tumor burden is therefore a dynamic 
one and is more clinically relevant in a TACE setting, particularly when compared to a static 
assessment  where  tumor  burden  continues  to be assessed based  on the initial  target  lesions  selected, 
which may no longer  be there  after a TACE  procedure. Figure 9.1.2.2 -1 illustrates  the concept  of 
a dynamic assessment of tumor burden.

Abbreviations:  SLD  = sum of longest  diameters;  TACE  = trans -arterial  chemoembolization.  
 
Finally,  intermediate -stage  HCC  does not include  patients  with lesions  outside  of the liver.  So the 
recorded measurable lesions will be solely defined based on liver lesions. The development of 
lesions outside of the liver will be captured as an EHS.  
9.1.2.3  Definition  of TTTP  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. Progression will be assessed by the investigator 
per local  standard of care. The following information refers to the original study  design.  
TTTP by imaging will be defined as a 20% increase in dynamic tumor burden over the baseline 
tumor  burden,  development  of macroscopic  evidence  of MVI,  extrahepatic  tumor  spread,  or death 
(see Figure 9.1.2.3 -1).

9.1.3  Efficacy  Assessments  using  mRECIST  
As with traditional  tumor  assessment -based  endpoints,  a baseline  tumor  burden  is needed  in order 
to have a reference to compare changes in tumor burden during treatment. Tumor burden 
quantification  should  also follow  the basic  principles  defined  by mRECIST  (refer  to Appendix  10). 
As such, liver lesions will be categorized as “measurable” if the arterially enhancing portion can 
be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension, with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT or MRI 
scan.  
9.1.4  Outcomes  Research  Assessments  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
The evaluation  of patient -reported  outcomes  (PROs)  is an increasingly  important  aspect  of clinical 
efficacy in oncology trials. Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from 
the participant’s perspective and offer insights into patient experience that may not be captured 
through  physician  reporting.  Additionally,  generic  health -related  quality  of life (HRQL)  measures 
provide data needed for calculating utility values to inform health economic models.  
Participants  will be asked  to complete  the both the EQ-5D-5L and FACT -Hep in the participant’s 
preferred  language when  available. Participants will complete both  measures prior  to any other

The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used to measure self -reports of health status and 
functioning.140 The instrument’s  descriptive system  consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels, reflecting 
no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A 
dimension for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, while a dimension for which 
there are extreme problems is said to be at level 5. Thus,  the vectors 11111 and 55555 represent 
the best health state and the worst health state, respectively, as described by the EQ -5D-5L. 
Altogether, the instrument describes 55 = 3,125 health states.  
Empirically derived weights can be applied to an individual’s responses to the EQ -5D-5L 
descriptive system to generate an index measuring the value to society of his or her current 
health.141 Utility index values range from a 1 (full health) to 0 (dead) with negative values 
indicating a state considered worse than being dead. In addition, the EQ -5D-5L includes  a visual 
analog  scale  (VAS)  that allows  respondents  to rate their own current  health  on a 0-100 point  scale 
ranging from “the worst health you can imagine” to the “best health you can imagine.”  
The EQ-5D-5L uses a recall  period  of “today.”  
9.1.4.2  FACT -Hep 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
The FACT -Hep questionnaire  will be used to assess  the effects  of HCC  and its treatment  HRQL.142 
The FACT -Hep includes the FACT -G generic cancer -related core questionnaire to assess 
symptoms and treatment -related effects impacting physical well -being (PWB; 7 items), 
social/family well -being (SWB; 7 items), emotional well -being (EWB; 6 items), and functional 
well-being (FWB; 7 items). In addition, the FACT -Hep includes an 18 -item disease -specific 
hepatobiliary cancer subscale (HCS) that assesses back and stomach pain, gastrointestinal 
symptoms,  anorexia,  weight  loss, and jaundice.  A subset  of items  from  the FACT -Hep can also be 
scored as the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) -FACT  Hepatobiliary -Pancreatic Symptom 
Index  (FHSI).143 The GP5 item of the FACT -Hep can  also be used to assess  the bother  associated 
with the side effects of treatment. Each item  is rated on a 5 -point  scale  ranging  from  0 (not at all) 
to 4 (very much).

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Scores for the PWB, FWB, SWB, and EWB subscales can be combined to produce a FACT -G 
total score, which provides an overall indicant of generic HRQL, while the FACT -G and HCS 
scores can be combined to produce a  total score for  the FACT -Hep, which provides a composite 
measure  of general  and targeted  HRQL.  Higher  scores  indicate  better  HRQL.  Minimally  important 
differences (MIDs) have been estimated for the various FACT -Hep subscale and total scores. 
These  are as follows:  2-3 points  for the PWB,  FWB,  SWB,  and EWB  subscales;  5-6 points  for the 
HCS subscale; 6 -7 points for the FACT -G total score; 8 -9 points for the FACT -Hep total score;  
and 2-3 points  for the FHSI -8.144 
The FACT -Hep uses a recall  period  of the “past  7 days”.  
9.2 Adverse  Events  
Use the NCI CTCAE  version  5.0 definitions  and grading  for safety  reporting  of all AEs and SAEs 
on the CRF.  
The definitions  of an AE  or SAE  can be found  in Appendix  3. 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events  that meet  the definition  of an AE or SAE  and remain  responsible  for following  up AEs that 
are serious,  considered  related  to the study  treatment  or the study,  or that caused  the participant  to 
discontinue before completing the study.  
Contacts  for SAE  reporting  specified  in Appendix  3. 
9.2.1  Immune -mediated  Adverse  Events  
IMAEs  are AEs consistent  with an immune -mediated  mechanism  or immune -mediated  component 
for which non -inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection, tumor progression) have been ruled out. 
IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology that were exacerbated by the induction of 
autoimmunity.  Information  supporting  the assessment  will be collected  on the participant’s  eCRF.  
9.2.2  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All non -serious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected 
continuously  during  the treatment  period  and for a minimum  of 100 days following  discontinuation 
of dosing, at the timepoints specified in Section 2  (Schedule of Activities).  
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those thought to be 
associated with  protocol -specified procedures and for a minimum of  100 days of  discontinuation 
of dosing. For participants randomized/assigned to treatment and never treated with study drug, 
SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of randomization.  
All AEs (SAEs and non -serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV -2 
infection must be collected from the time of signing the consent until 100 days following 
discontinuation of dosing.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  115 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 The Investigator must report any SAE that occurs after  these  time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy).  
• Medical  occurrences  that begin  before  the start of study  treatment  but after obtaining  informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.  
• All SAEs  will be recorded  and reported  to the Sponsor  or designee  within  24 hours,  as indicated 
in Appendix 3 . 
• The Investigator  will submit  any updated  SAE  data to the Sponsor  or designee  within  24 hours 
of the updated information being available.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged  from  the study,  and he/she  considers  the event  reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.  
9.2.3  Method  of Detecting AEs  and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when 
collecting AEs and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement 
in the context of known AEs, when appropriate for the program or protocol.  
Every  AE must  be assessed  by the Investigator  with regard  to whether  it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events that are potentially immune -mediated, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s CRF.  
9.2.4  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Non-serious  AEs should  be followed  to resolution  or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (refer to Appendix 3).  
• Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment, as appropriate.  
•  All identified  non-serious  AEs must  be recorded  and described  on the non-serious  AE page  of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.  
 
All SAEs and AEs (SAEs and non -serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS - 
CoV -2 infection will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise  explained, the  event  is deemed irreversible, until the  participant is lost  to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 8.3  [Lost to Follow -up]), or for suspected cases, until SARS -CoV -2 infection 
is ruled out.  
Further  information  on follow -up procedures  is given  in Appendix  3.

 9.2.5  Regulatory  Reporting  Requirements  for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An Investigator  who receives  an Investigator Safety  Report  describing SAEs  or other  specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local  applicable laws, including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal  Regulations  21 CFR  Parts  312 and 320. A suspected,  unexpected  serious  adverse  reaction 
(SUSAR) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.  
9.2.6  Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is 
pregnant  or may have  been  pregnant  at the time of study  exposure,  including  during  at least 
5 half-lives after product administration, the Investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form to the BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event, and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 . 
If the Investigator  determines  a possible favorable benefit -risk ratio  that warrants  continuation of 
study  treatment, or re -initiation of  study  treatment, a discussion between the Investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has 
ended, confirmed by negative serum  pregnancy test, treatment may be resumed (at least 3 weeks 
and not greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of 
participant/Sponsor/IRB/EC, as applicable. Study treatment must be permanently discontinued 
where locally mandated; see Appendix 9  for country -specific requirements.  
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
the Sponsor  or designee.  In order  for the Sponsor  or designee  to collect  any pregnancy  surveillance 
information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of this 
information.  Information  on this pregnancy  will be collected  on the Pregnancy  Surveillance  Form.  
In cases where a study  drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause  fetal toxicity,  and if any sexual  activity  (eg, vaginal,  anal,  oral)  has occurred  between  a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information should be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a successful vasectomy. In order for the 
Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner,

 the female partner(s) must sign an ICF for disclosure of this information. Information on the 
pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
9.2.7  Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following  laboratory  test result  abnormalities  should  be captured  on the non-serious  AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back -up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.  
• Any laboratory  test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets  the definition  of an SAE.  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted.  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy.  
 
9.2.8  Potential  Drug  Induced  Liver  Injury  (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur  prior  to the reporting  of a potential  DILI  event.  All occurrences  of potential  DILIs,  meeting 
the defined  criteria,  must  be reported  as SAEs  (see Section  2 and Appendix  3 for reporting  details).  
Potential  DILI  is defined  as: 
• Concurrent  ALT  ≥ 10  ULN,  AND  
• Total  bilirubin  ≥ 2  ULN  or baseline  value  (if elevated  bilirubin  at study  entry),  AND  
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including,  but not limited  to, tumor  progression,  acute  viral hepatitis,  cholestasis,  pre-existing 
hepatic disease or the administration of other drug(s), herbal medications, and substances 
known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
9.2.9  Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -ray filming, and any other potential safety assessment required or not 
required by protocol  should also be recorded as a non -serious or serious AE, as appropriate, and 
reported accordingly.  
9.2.10  Management  Algorithms for  Immuno -oncology Agents  
IO agents  are associated  with IMAEs  that can differ  in severity  and duration  from  AEs caused  by 
other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are considered IO agents in this protocol. 
Early recognition and management of IMAEs associated with IO agents may mitigate severe 
toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed from extensive experience with 
ipilimumab  and nivolumab  to assist  Investigators  in assessing  and managing  the following  groups 
of IMAEs:  
• Gastrointestinal

 • Renal  
• Pulmonary  
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathies  
• Skin 
• Neurological  
• Myocarditis  
 
The algorithms  recommended  for the management  of IMAEs  in this protocol  are in Appendix  6. 
• Checkpoint inhibitor molecules have been uncommonly associated with ocular drug -related 
AEs. Inflammation of components within the eye (eg, episcleritis, uveitis) are uncommon 
events of nivolumab monotherapy (< 1% of cases). These events are usually of low or 
intermediate grade, reversible, detected early in the course of therapy, and manageable with 
topical or systemic steroids.  
− Routine e ye examinations should be performed in participants receiving immune 
checkpoint inhibitors ( Section 2  [Schedule of Activities]). Upon clinical suspicion of an 
ocular event, consider ophthalmic consult, dose omission, or dose discontinuation.  
− Permanently discontinue for clinically significant or severe immune -mediated adverse 
reactions.  Initiate  systemic  corticosteroids  for severe  immune -mediated  adverse  reactions.  
− Permanently  discontinue  for immune -mediated  ocular  disease  that is unresponsive  to local 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
− Administer corticosteroid eye drops to participants who develop uveitis, iritis, or 
episcleritis.  
 
9.3 Overdose  
An overdose  is defined  as the accidental  or intentional  administration  of any dose of a product  that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses that meet the regulatory 
definition of SAE will be reported as an SAE (refer to Appendix 3 ). 
9.4 Safety  
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are listed in Section 2  (Schedule of Activities). 
Additional  procedures  and assessments  may be performed  as part of SOC;  however,  data for these 
assessments  should  remain  in the participant’s  medical  record  and should  not be provided  to BMS, 
unless  specifically  requested.  Both  AEs and laboratory tests  will be graded  according  to the 
NCI CTCAE version 5.0.

Upon  implementation  of Protocol  Amendment  01, PK and immunogenicity  sample  collection 
is no longer necessary for any participant who is on study treatment. In the event samples 
are collected following implementation of Protocol Amendment 01, samples do not need to 
be analyzed.  
The following information refers to the original study design and is not applicable per 
Protocol Amendment 01 . 
Samples for  PK and IMG assessments  will be collected  for all participants, as  described in Table  
9.5-1. Only samples collected from nivolumab - and ipilimumab -treated participants will be 
analyzed; samples collected from placebo participants will not be analyzed. All timepoints are 
relative to the start of study  treatment administration. All  on-treatment timepoints are intended to 
align  with days on which study  treatment is administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be 
delayed,  then the predose  sample  should  be collected  just prior  to the delayed  dose.  However,  if a 
predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample 
should not be collected. Further details of sample collection, processing, and shipment will be 
provided in the Laboratory Procedures Manual.  
Serum concentration analyses for nivolumab will be performed by a validated immunoassay 
bioanalytical  method  for participants  treated  with nivolumab.  Samples  collected  from  participants 
treated with nivolumab will be evaluated for the development of anti -drug antibody (ADA) to 
nivolumab by validated immunoassays. Samples with a positive ADA response may also be 
analyzed for nivolumab neutralizing ADA characterization by a validated cell -based assay.  
Serum concentration analyses for ipilimumab will be performed by a validated immunoassay 
bioanalytical  method  for participants  treated  with ipilimumab.  Samples  collected  from  participants 
treated  with ipilimumab  will be evaluated  for the development  of ADA  to ipilimumab  by validated 
immunoassays. Samples with a positive ADA response may also be analyzed for ipilimumab 
neutralizing ADA characterization by a validated cell -based assay.  
In addition, selected serum samples may be analyzed by exploratory methods that measure 
nivolumab or ipilimumab, or detect ADAs for technology exploration purposes; exploratory 
results will not be reported. The corresponding serum  samples designated for either PK, IMG, or 
biomarker assessments may also be used for any of those analyses, if required (eg, insufficient 
sample volume to complete testing or to follow up on suspected IMG -related AE).

a Predose: All pre -dose samples  for nivolumab  and ipilimumab should be taken just  before  the start of nivolumab  infusion  (preferably  within  30 minutes).  If it is 
known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predose sample should be collected just prior to the delayed dose. However , if a predose sample is collected 
but the dose is subsequently  delayed, an additional predose sample should not be collected.  
b End of infusion samples for both nivolumab and ipilimumab should be collected at the end of (preferably within 2 minutes prio r to the end of) ipilimumab 
infusion.  
c On days where nivolumab and ipilimumab will be administered sequentially, the End of infusion sample collection for both nivo lumab and ipilimumab at the

 9.8.1  Tumor -based  Biomarker  Measures  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
Tumor  tissue  will be obtained  at baseline  and upon  TTTP  by BICR  or end of treatment  (if clinically 
feasible) to characterize immune cell populations, expression of selected tumor markers, 
expression of inflammatory  genes, and genetic  analyses mentioned below in detail. Tumor block 
(preferred) or  slides must  be sent to the central  laboratory  prior  to randomization.  Biopsy  samples 
should be excisional, incisional, or core needle. Fine needle aspirates or other cytology samples 
are not acceptable.  A tumor  block  is preferred,  but if a block  is not feasible,  a minimum  of 
20 unstained slides is required. Slides should be unstained, have a recommended tissue section 
thickness  of 4 microns,  and must  be positively  charged.  Tumor  tissue  must  contain  adequate  tumor 
content ( ≥ 100 tumor  cells), as  determined  by hematoxylin  and eosin  (H&E) review  at the central 
laboratory. If  the initial  tumor  sample  submission  does not meet  this criterion,  an additional  tissue 
submission  (if available)  is allowed.  Participants  must  have  an evaluable  tumor  tissue  specimen  to 
be eligible for randomization. A tumor biopsy upon TTTP by BICR or end of treatment is also 
highly recommended, if clinically feasible.  
Tumor samples may be used for the assessments described below. Please see Appendix 9  for 
country -specific criteria for the collection and analyses of tumor -tissue samples in China.

composition  of immune  infiltrates  in order  to define  the immune  cell subsets  present  within  FFPE 
tumor tissue before therapy and upon TTTP by BICR or end of treatment. IHC analyses may 
include,  but not necessarily  be limited  to, the following  markers:  major  histocompatibility  complex 
(MHC) class I/II, CD8, PD -1, PD -L1, PD -L2, and lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3).  
9.8.1.2  Tumor  Genomic  Analysis  Including  Tumor  Mutational  Burden  and Gene 
Expression Analysis  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
DNA from  tumor samples will be analyzed  using  platforms, including, but  not limited to, whole - 
exome sequencing to identify and quantify somatic mutations by using the whole blood DNA 
sample as a germline reference. Mutations that are detected may be analyzed for their ability to 
bind the MHC  class  I and MHC  class  II proteins  using  prediction  algorithms.  Evaluating  the ability 
of tumor  mutations  to bind MHC  molecules  may provide  evidence  that these  mutations  are serving 
as antigens  that are recognized  by the immune  system  and are potential  rejection  antigens.  MSI or 
MSI status  may be derived  from  whole -exome  sequencing  data if MSI status  is not already  known. 
Lastly,  RNA  expression  within  tumor  biopsies  may be examined  using  RNAseq,  whole -

academic/institutional  requirements. Where  1 or more  of these  exceptions  occurs,  participation in 
the AR should be encouraged but will not be a condition of overall study  participation.  
• If the IRB/ethics committees and site agree to  the mandatory  AR retention and/or collection, 
then the study participant must agree to the mandatory AR as a requirement for inclusion in 
the study.  
• If optional participation is permitted and approved, then the study  participants may opt out of 
the additional AR and/or collection.  
 
For non-US Sites  
AR is  optional  for all study  participants,  except  where  retention  and/or  collection  is prohibited  by 
local laws or regulations, ethics committees, or institutional requirements.  
This collection for AR is intended to expand the translational R&D capability at BMS, and will 
support  as yet undefined  research  aims  that will advance  our understanding  of disease  and options 
for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority requests for analysis, and

 Sample  Collection  and Storage  
All requests  for access  to samples  or data for AR will be vetted  through  a diverse  committee  of the 
study  Sponsor’s senior leaders in R&D (or designee) to ensure  the research supports appropriate 
and well -defined scientific research activities.  
• Residual PK/IMG, tumor tissue, and serum, plasma, whole blood, and stool samples from 
collections  (see Table  9.8.4 -1 [Residual  Sample  Retention  for Additional  Research  Schedule]) 
will also be retained for AR purposes.  
 
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Biorepository in  or 
an independent, BMS -approved storage vendor.  
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly  used throughout their usable life and 
will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by  applicable law.  
Transfers of samples by the research Sponsor to third parties will be subject to the recipient’s 
agreement to establish similar storage procedures.  
Samples  will be stored  in a coded  fashion,  and no researcher  will have  access  to the key. The key 
is securely  held by the Investigator  at the clinical  site, so there  is no direct  ability for a researcher 
to connect a sample to a specific individual.

10.1 Sample  Size Determination  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, sample size will be limited to the participants randomized as 
of 22 -Sep-2021. The following information refers to the original study design.  
For the comparison  of nivolumab  and ipilimumab  plus TACE  (Arm  A) vs nivolumab  placebo  and 
ipilimumab placebo plus TACE (Arm  C), both TTTP and OS are primary endpoints. For sample 
size determination purpose, the family -wise error rate of 5% will be controlled using Bonferroni 
split: comparison of TTTP with alpha of 1% and comparion of OS with alpha of 4%.  
Approximately 765 participants will be randomized to 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio in 
approximately 36 months. Approximately 94% and 89% power will be achieved for TTTP and 
OS, respectively,  under  the detailed  assumptions  described  in following  subsections.  EAST  v6.4.1 
was used to conduct simulations for sample size calculation.  
10.1.1  Sample  Size Justification  for Primary Endpoint  of TTTP  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
Assumpations  for sample  size justification  for TTTP  include:  
• Exponential  distribution  in Arm C, with  a median  of 
 . 
• Piecewise -exponential  distribution  in Arm A as determined  by a 2-piece  HR with a delay  effect 
of HR of 1 in the first  , followed by a constant HR of   (see Table 10.1.1 -1). 
This results in an averaged target HR of  
  at the TTTP final analysis.  
• Anticipated  dropout  rate of    by month  3 and by month  24.

 • Piecewise -exponential  distribution  in both control  and experimental  arms.  
• When viewing the OS data from the BRISK -TA study, the TACE arm  was considered as the 
most relevant to this study’s control arm, Arm C. Based on such data, a  exponential 
distribution is assumed for OS of Arm C. The assumed piecewise -exponential model fits the 
OS data of TACE in the BRISK -TA study up to   months. Starting from month 26, the tail 
of the control OS curve rose to have higher OS rates, with a 5 -year OS of   (see Figure 
10.1.2 -1). The flattened  tail of the OS curve  intends  to indicate  that the longer -term OS should 
be improved with current and future available 1L, 2L, and later lines of therapies.  
• The median  OS of the control  arm is 
  based  on above  assumptions.  
• Anticipated  dropout  rate of 
  by month  3 and 
  by month  
 
 
The target  average  HR of is assumed  for Arm A  vs Arm C and  is modeled as  an HR 
with a delay  effect  of HR of in the first months,  followed  by multiple  pieces  of HR. These  HRs 
start with 
 after separation, and  HRs are gradually  increased thereafter  to reflect  the belief  that 
the overall treatment effect will be compromised when participants who progress in the control 
arm have  a higher  chance  to select  immunotherapies  as their subsequent  therapies  (see Table  
10.1.2 -1).

time of TTTP final analysis, when approximately 72% of OS events (267 events) are expected. 
The second OS interim analysis will be conducted when 88% of OS events (326 events) are 
expected. The alpha allocation for the interim and final analyses is based on Lan -DeMets alpha 
spending  function  approach  using  an O’Brien -Fleming  stopping  boundary,  controlling  for a 
2-sided overall type I error of 4%. The stopping boundary will depend on the actual number of 
deaths at the time of the interim analyses and the final analysis (see Table 10.1.2 -2).

OS between nivolumab plus TACE (Arm B) vs placebo plus TACE (Arm C) will be tested 
following  a hierarchical  procedure. This comparison will be tested when  the primary  objective  of 
OS of Arm A vs Arm C meets statistical significance. The testing will be conduced at the same 
significance level of 4%. At the time of OS final analysis for Arm A and Arm C, it is projected 
376 events  will be observed  in Arm B and Arm C. Under  the piecewise  HR assumption  for Arm B 
(see Table  10.1.3 -3), the comparison  will have approximately  83% (see Table  10.1.3 -4). 
A graphical approach will  be used to control  the overall  alpha of 4%  among the primary endpoint

 10.3 Statistical  Analyses  
The SAP will be developed and finalized before the first database lock and will describe the 
selection  of participants  to be included  in the analyses,  and procedures  for accounting  for missing, 
unused, and spurious data.  
10.3.1  Efficacy Analyses  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, formal efficacy analyses will not be conducted . Descriptive 
summary statistics may be provided for internal dissemination only.  
A Bonferroni -based graphical approach145 will be used for primary and key secondary endpoint 
analyses. Details will be provided in the SAP. The following secondary endpoints will be tested 
sequentially in the following order at the allocated alpha inherited from the primary endpoint of 
TTTP:  
• TTTP  in Arm B vs Arm C 
• EFS in Arm A vs Arm C 
• EFS in Arm B vs Arm C 
• PFS in Arm  A vs Arm C 
• PFS in Arm B vs Arm C 
 
Statistical  analyses  for efficacy  are shown  in Table  10.3.1 -1.

Endpoint  Statistical  Analysis  Methods  
Primary  
TTTP nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus TACE  vs placebo  plus TACE  TTTP  is defined  as the time from  the date of randomization  to appearance 
of any of the following: a 20% increase in dynamic tumor burden over 
baseline scan; development of MVI; development of EHS; or death.  
Participants  who are alive  and with no HCC  tumor  progression  by TTTP 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to or on first 
subsequent therapy date.  
The distribution of TTTP of nivolumab and ipilimumab plus TACE and 
placebo  plus TACE  will be compared  via a 2-sided,  log-rank test stratified 
by the stratification factors. The HR and corresponding 99% CI will be 
estimated  in a stratified  Cox proportional  hazards  model  using  randomized 
arm as a single  covariate.  The TTTP  curves  for each arm will be estimated 
using the Kaplan -Meier produce limit method. The 2 -sided 95% CIs for 
median TTTP will be computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method 
(using log -log transformation).

Endpoint  Statistical  Analysis  Methods  
OS nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus TACE  vs placebo  plus TACE  OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death  due to any cause  in all randomized  participants. Participants  who are 
alive will be censored at the last known alive dates.  
The distribution of OS of nivolumab and ipilimumab plus TACE and 
placebo plus TACE will be compared via a 2 -sided, log -rank test stratified 
by the stratification factors. The HR and corresponding 100 (1-adjusted 
alpha)%  CI will be estimated  in a stratified  Cox proportional  hazards  model 
using randomized arm as a single covariate. The OS curves for each arm 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier produce limit method. The  
2-sided 95% CIs for median OS will be computed by Brookmeyer and 
Crowley  method  (using  log-log transformation).  In addition,  survival  rates 
at select  milestones  will be computed  as well as the corresponding  2-sided 
95% CIs using the log -log transformation.

Endpoint  Statistical  Analysis  Methods  
EFS nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus TACE  vs placebo  plus TACE 
and nivolumab plus TACE vs 
placebo plus TACE  EFS is defined as the time from randomization to initiation of first -line 
systemic therapy  or the date of progression of cirrhosis from Child Pugh A 
to Child Pugh C score, or death, whichever occurs first. Participants who  
are alive  and received  no first-line systemic therapy  or are  not progressed  to 
Child  Pugh  C will be censored  at the last Child -Pugh  score  assessment  date.  
The distribution  of EFS in randomized  arms  will be compared  via a 
2-sided, log -rank test stratified by the stratification factors. The HR and 
corresponding 99% CI will be estimated in a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards  model  using  randomized  arm as a single  covariate.  The EFS curves 
for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier produce limit 
method. The 2 -sided 95% CIs for median EFS will be computed by 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using log -log transformation).  
Hierarchical testing of EFS will be performed upon demonstration of 
superiority  in TTTP.  Descripti ve analysis  will be performed  if superiority  is 
not demonstrated in TTTP.  
PFS nivolumab and ipilimumab 
plus TACE  vs placebo  plus TACE 
and nivolumab plus TACE vs 
placebo plus TACE  PFS is defined as the time from the randomization date to the first 
documented  disease  progression  as assessed  by BICR  using  mRECIST  or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participant who are alive 
and not progressed will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment 
prior to or on first subsequent therapy date.  
The distribution  of PFS in randomized  arms  will be compared  via a 2-sided, 
log-rank test stratified by the stratification factors. The HR and 
corresponding 100 (1-adjusted alpha)% CI will be estimated in a stratified 
Cox proportional hazards model using randomized arm as a single 
covariate. The PFS curves for each arm will be estimated using the  
Kaplan -Meier  produce  limit  method.  The 2-sided  95% CIs for median  PFS 
will be computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using log -log

10.3.4  Interim Analyses  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
Two interim analyses and 1 final analysis of OS are planned for this s tudy. The first interim 
analysis of OS is planned at the time of final TTTP analysis (with approximately 267 OS events 
expected  in Arm A and Arm C). TTTP  final analysis  is expected  to occur  when  there  are 
418 events (approximately 55 months after the first participant’s randomization date) in Arm A 
and Arm C. First OS interim analysis will be conducted at the same time (with approximately  
267 OS events expected in Arm A and Arm C). The second OS interim analysis is expected to 
occur  when  there  are 326 OS events  in Arm A and Arm C (approximately  68 months  after the first 
participant’s randomization date). These formal  comparisons of  OS will allow for early stopping 
for superiority.  Lan-DeMets  alpha  spending  function  with O’Brien  and Fleming  type of boundary 
will be used.  The stopping  boundary  will depend  on the actual  number  of deaths  at the time of the 
interim analyses. An independent statistical group supporting the DMC, external to BMS, will 
perform  the analyses. Formal interim analyses for OS and final analysis for TTTP in Arm  B and 
Arm C will be performed  at the same  time of TTTP  and OS analysis  in Arm A and Arm C. EFS and 
PFS analysis  will also be conducted  at the TTTP  final analysis  if TTTP  is superior  in both Arm  A 
and Arm B.  
The SAP will further  describe  the planned  interim  analyses.

 APPENDIX  2 STUDY  GOVERNANCE  CONSIDERATIONS  
The term ‘Participant’ is  used in the protocol  to refer to a person  who has consented  to participate 
in the clinical research study. The term  ‘Subject’ used in the CRF is intended to refer to a person 
(Participant) who has consented to participate in the clinical research study.  
REGULATORY  AND  ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
This study  will be conducted in accordance with:  
• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
International Ethical Guidelines Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  
• as defined  by the International  Council  on Harmonisation  (ICH)  
• in accordance  with the ethical  principles  underlying  European  Union  Directive  2001/20/EC  
• United  States  Code  of Federal  Regulations,  Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
• applicable  local  requirements.  
 
The study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol  and any amendments 
and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opinion by Institutional 
Review  Board/Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC),  and regulatory  authorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately. A 
potential serious breach is defined as a Quality  Issue (eg, protocol  deviation, etc) that is likely to 
affect, to a significant degree one or more of the following: (1) the physical, safety or mental 
integrity  of one or more  subjects/participants;  (2) the scientific  value  of the trial (eg, reliability  and 
robustness  of generated  data).  Items  (1) or (2) can be associated  with either  GCP  Regulation(s)  or 
Trial protocol(s).  
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study  will not use the services  of study  personnel  where  sanctions  have  been  invoked  or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD/INDEPENDENT  ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC  for the protocol,  consent  form, participant  recruitment  materials 
(eg, advertisements),  and any other  written  information  to be provided  to subjects/participants.  The 
investigator  or BMS  should  also provide  the IRB/IEC  with a copy  of the Investigator  Brochure  or 
product labeling information to be provided to subjects/participants and any updates.  
The investigator,  Sponsor  or designee  should  provide  the IRB/IEC  with reports,  updates  and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE PROTOCOL  AND  PROTOCOL  REVISIONS  
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects/participants.  
If a deviation  or change  to a protocol  is implemented  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard(s)  prior  to 
obtaining  relevant  approval/favorable  opinion(s)  the deviation  or change  will be submitted,  as soon 
as possible to:  
• IRB/IEC  
• Regulatory  Authority(ies),  if applicable  by local  regulations  (per national  requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from 
subjects/participants  currently  enrolled  in the study  if they  are affected  by the amendment;  and 
(3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects/participants prior to 
enrollment.  
If the revision  is done  via an administrative  letter,  investigators  must  inform  their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE  
Investigators and sub -Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators  are responsible for providing information  on financial interests  during  the course  of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
INFORMED  CONSENT  PROCESS  
Investigators must ensure that subjects/participants are clearly and fully informed about the 
purpose,  potential  risks,  and other  critical  issues  regarding  clinical  studies  in which  they volunteer 
to participate.  
In situations where consent cannot be given by subjects/participants, their legally acceptable 
representatives (as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant 
volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor  or designee  will provide  the investigator  with an appropriate  (ie, Global  or Local)  sample 
informed consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form  will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Investigators  must:  
• Provide  a copy  of the consent  form  and written  information  about  the study  in the language  in 
which  the participant  is most  proficient  prior  to clinical  study  participation.  The language  must 
be non -technical and easily understood.  
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent  signed  and personally  dated  by the participant or the participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable  opinion  of the written  informed  consent  form 
and any other  information  to be provided  to the subjects/participants,  prior  to the beginning  of 
the study, and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian,  and the participant  subsequently  becomes  capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent  during  the study,  consent  must  additionally  be obtained  from  the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator,  or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/participants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the 
subjects’/participants’ signed ICF and, in the US, the subjects’/participants’ signed HIPAA 
Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
Subjects/participants unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects/participants with 
or severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable 
representative. The participant must also be informed about the nature of  the study to the extent 
compatible with his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she 
should personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a 
participant who is unable to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an 
opinion  and assessing  information  to refuse  participation  in, or to be withdrawn  from,  the clinical 
study at any time should be considered by the investigator.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects/participants are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.

 SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous,  original  and attributable,  whether  the data are hand -written  on paper  or entered 
electronically.  If source  data are created  (first  entered),  modified,  maintained,  archived,  retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatures. 
Such  systems  may include,  but are not limited  to, electronic  medical/health  records  (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments, and/or drug accountability 
records).  
When  paper  records  from  such systems  are used in place  of electronic  format  to perform  regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a copy of 
original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all of the same attributes and information as the original.  
STUDY  TREATMENT  RECORDS  
Records  for study  treatments  (whether  supplied  by BMS,  its vendors,  or the site) must  substantiate 
study treatment integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, and through 
destruction or return. Records must be made  available for review at the request of BMS/designee 
or a Health Authority.

of Authority Form.  
Sourced by site, and not supplied by 
BMS  or its vendors  (examples  include  IP 
sourced from the sites stock or 
commercial supply, or a specialty 
pharmacy)  The investigator or designee accepts responsibility 
for documenting traceability and study treatment 
integrity  in accordance  with requirements  applicable 
under law and the SOPs/standards of the sourcing 
pharmacy.  
BMS or designee will  provide forms to facilitate inventory  control if  the investigational site does 
not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
 
CASE  REPORT  FORMS  
An investigator  is required  to prepare  and maintain  adequate  and accurate  case histories  designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported  on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or  the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort  to enhance 
understanding  of product  safety. CRFs may  be requested  for AEs and/or  laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.  
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be 
prepared  for all data collection  fields  except  for fields  specific  to SAEs  and pregnancy,  which  will

 be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively. If 
electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank 
only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF completion guidelines provided by 
Sponsor or designee.  
The confidentiality  of records  that could  identify  subjects  must  be protected,  respecting  the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The investigator  will maintain  a signature  sheet  to document  signatures  and initials  of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.  
The completed  CRF,  SAE/pregnancy  CRFs,  must  be promptly  reviewed,  signed,  and dated  by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator and who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of  Authority  Form.  Subinvestigators  in Japan  may not be delegated the CRF approval 
task. For  electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the

remote, or on -site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan.  
Representatives  of BMS  must  be allowed  to visit all study  site locations  periodically  to assess  the 
data quality  and study  integrity.  On site they  will review study  records  and directly  compare  them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study  with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source 
documents:  
In addition,  the study may be  evaluated  by Sponsor or designee internal  auditors  and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.  
The investigator  must  notify  BMS  promptly  of any inspections scheduled by regulatory  authorities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor or designee.  
RECORDS RETENTION  
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or

If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another investigator, study  site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee.  
RETURN  OF STUDY  TREATMENT  
For this study, study  treatments  (those  supplied  by BMS,  a vendor  or sourced  by the investigator) 
such as partially used study  treatment containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed on site.  
 
If.. Then  
Study  treatments supplied by BMS (including 
its vendors  Any unused  study  treatments  supplied  by BMS 
can only be destroyed  after being inspected  and 
reconciled by the responsible Study Monitor 
unless study treatments containers must be 
immediately destroyed as required for safety, 
or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or 
biologics).  
If study  treatments will be returned, the return 
will be arranged by the responsible Study 
Monitor.  
Study  treatments sourced by  site, not supplied 
by BMS (or its vendors) (examples include 
study treatments sourced from the sites stock 
or commercial supply, or a specialty 
pharmacy)  It is the investigator’s or designee’s 
responsibility to dispose of all containers 
according to the institutional guidelines and 
procedures.  
 
It is the investigator’s  or designee’s  responsibility  to arrange  for disposal,  provided  that procedures 
for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and

 APPENDIX 3  ADVERSE  EVENTS  AND  SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse Event Definition:  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition  in a clinical  investigation  participant  administered  study  treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of study  treatment,  whether  or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements),  including  those  that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available.  Once  the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic  or intermittent  pre-existing  condition  including  either  an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New  conditions  detected  or diagnosed  after study  intervention  administration  even  though  it 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs,  symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae  of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs,  symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae  of a suspected  overdose  of either  study  intervention 
or a concomitant  medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported  by the investigator), 
should  not be reported  as an AE/SAE  unless  it is an intentional  overdose  taken  with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. Such  overdoses should be reported  regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term.  
Events NOT  Meeting  the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations  in which  an untoward  medical  occurrence  did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 DEFINITION  OF SAE 
If an event is not  an AE per definition above,  then it cannot  be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.  
SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results  in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event;  it does not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it were 
more severe)  
Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or causes  prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
The following  hospitalizations  are not considered  SAEs  in BMS  clinical  studies:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours,  that does not  result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery,  planned  prior  to signing  consent  
• admissions  as per protocol  for a planned  medical/surgical  procedure  
• routine  health  assessment  requiring  admission  for baseline/trending  of health  status  
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
• admission  encountered  for another  life circumstance  that carries  no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy  in the absence  of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical  event(s) that may not  be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one  of the other  serious  outcomes  listed  in the definition  above.)  Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.8  for the definition of potential DILI.)  
 
Pregnancy  and potential  drug induced  liver injury  (DILI)  must  follow  the same  transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.6  for reporting pregnancies).  
 
EVALUATING  AES AND  SAES  
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study intervention and  each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility”  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The investigator  will use clinical  judgment  to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors,  as well as the temporal  relationship  of the event  to study  intervention  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information  to include  in the initial  report  to Sponsor.  However,  it is very important  that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality  assessment is one of  the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new 
information  becomes  available,  the SAE  report  must  be updated  and submitted  within  24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs  must  be followed  to resolution  or stabilization.  
 
REPORTING  OF SAES  TO SPONSOR  OR DESIGNEE  
 
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must  be recorded  on the SAE  Report  Form.  
− The required  method  for SAE  data reporting  is through  the eCRF.  
− The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back -up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for  transmission of  the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee).  
 In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission  
 When  paper forms  are used,  the original  paper forms  are to  remain  on site 
• Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission

 APPENDIX 4  WOMEN  OF CHILDBEARING  POTENTIAL  DEFINITIONS  AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Appendix 4 provides general information and definitions related to Woman of Childbearing 
Potential  and methods  of contrac eption  that can be applied  to most  clinical  trials.  For information 
specific to this study regarding acceptable contraception requirements for female and male 
participants, refer to Section 6.1  of the protocol. Only  the contraception methods as described in 
Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman  of Childbearing  Potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Women  in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented  hysterectomy  
− Documented  bilateral  salpingectomy  
− Documented  bilateral  oophorectomy  
 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records , medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal  female  
− A postmenopausal  state is defined  as 12 months  of amenorrhea  in a woman  over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females 
under  the age of 55 years  must  have  a serum  follicle  stimulating  hormone,  (FSH)  level  
> 40 mIU/mL  to confirm  menopause.  
 
Note:  Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of  the washout period is a function of  the type of HRT used.  The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels.  
• 1 week  minimum  for vaginal  hormonal  products  (rings,  creams,  gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.  
 
End of Relevant  Systemic  Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in 
context  of safety  margins  from  the no-observed -adverse -effect  level  or the time required  for 5 half- 
lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
One of the highly  effective  methods  of contraception  listed  below  is required  during  study  duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the end of study 
treatment.*  
Local  laws and regulations may  require use  of alternative and/or  additional  contraception  methods.  
 
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive  Methods  That  Are User  Dependent  
Failure  rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently  and correctly.a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal  contraception associated with 
inhibition  of ovulation  and/or  implantation  (These  methods  of contraception  cannot  be used 
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)b 
− oral (birth  control  pills)  
− intravaginal  (vaginal  birth  control  suppositories,  rings,  creams,  gels)  
− transdermal  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception  must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy.  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. This 
method of contraception can only be used by WOCBP participants in studies where 
hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol.b 
− oral 
− injectable  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of

• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation and/or implantation (This method of contraception cannot be used by WOCBP 
participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)b 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c 
• Intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system  (IUS) (This  method  of contraception  cannot  be used 
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)b,c 
• Bilateral  tubal  occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effe ctive contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male  sexual  partner  of the WOCBP  and the absence  of sperm  has been  confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual  abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual  intercourse  during  the entire  period  of risk associated  with the study  treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
• Continuous  abstinence  must  begin  at least 30 days prior  to initiation  of study  therapy.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2 . 
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to: calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from failure rates when contraceptive methods are used consistently and 
correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants participating in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would  be ineffective  or result  in increased  exposures  that could  be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to Sections 6.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.  
c Intrauterine devices and IUSs are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug 
interaction  studies  when  hormone  exposures  from  intrauterine  devices  do not alter contraception  effectiveness. 
For information specific to this study  regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to Sections 6.1 
INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1 PROHIBITED AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.

CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential  are eligible to participate if they 
agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to 
comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator.  
• Male participants are required to use a condom for study duration and until end of relevant 
systemic exposure defined as 7 months after the end of study treatment.  
• Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods of 
contraception  until the end of relevant  systemic  exposure,  defined  as 7 months  after the end of 
study treatment in the male participant.  
• Male  participants  with a pregnant  or breastfeeding  partner  must  agree  to remain  abstinent  from 
penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration 
during the treatment and until 7 months after the end of study treatment.  
• Refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study  treatment and until 7 months after

 APPENDIX 6  MANAGEMENT  ALGORITHMS  FOR  STUDIES  UNDER  CTCAE 
VERSION 5.0  
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology agents and regimens.  
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated.  
Corticosteroids  are a primary  therapy  for immuno -oncology  drug-related  adverse  events.  The oral 
equivalent  of the recommended  IV doses  may be considered  for ambulatory  patients  with 
low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
procedure, is recommended.  
The frequency  and severity  of the related  adverse  events  covered  by these algorithms  will depend 
on the immuno -oncology agent or regimen being used.

Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. 
The following information refers to the 
original study design.  
Tumor tissue will be obtained at baseline and 
upon TTTP by BICR or end of treatment (if 
clinically feasible) to characterize immune cell 
populations, expression of selected tumor 
markers,  expression  of inflammatory  genes,  and 
genetic analyses mentioned below in detail.  
Tumor block (preferred) or slides must be sent 
to the central  laboratory  prior  to randomization. 
Biopsy samples should be excisional, 
incisional,  or core needle.  Fine needle  aspirates 
or other  cytology  samples  are not acceptable.  A 
tumor block is preferred, but if a block is not 
feasible, a minimum of 20 unstained slides is 
required. Slides should be unstained, have a 
recommended tissue section thickness of 4 
microns, and must be positively charged.  
Tumor tissue must contain adequate tumor 
content ( ≥ 100 tumor cells), as determined by 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) review at the 
central laboratory. If the initial tumor sample 
submission does not meet this criterion, an 
additional tissue submission (if available) is 
allowed. Participants must have an evaluable 
tumor tissue specimen to be eligible for 
randomization.  A tumor  biopsy  upon  TTTP  by 
BICR or end of treatment is also highly 
recommended, if clinically feasible.  
Tumor samples may be used for the 
assessments described below. Please see 
Appendix 9 for country -specific criteria for the 
collection  and analyses  of tumor -tissue  samples 
in China.  9.8.1  Tumor for PD -L1 Analysis  
Tumor tissue will be obtained at 
baseline to assess PD -L1. Tumor 
block (preferred) or slides must be 
sent to the central laboratory prior to 
randomization. Biopsy samples 
should be excisional, incisional, or 
core needle. Fine needle aspirates or 
other cytology samples are not 
acceptable. A tumor block is 
preferred,  but if a block  is not feasible, 
a minimum of 5 unstained slides is 
required. Slides should be unstained, 
have a recommended tissue section

Evaluating  the ability  of tumor  mutations  to bind 
MHC molecules may provide evidence that 
these mutations are serving as antigens that are 
recognized by the immune system and are 
potential rejection antigens. MSI or MSI status 
may be derived from whole -exome sequencing

 APPENDIX 10  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA MODIFIED FOR 
HEPATOCELLULAR  CARCINOMA  (mRECIST)  WITH  BMS 
ADAPTATIONS  
1 EVALUATION  OF LESIONS  
In this protocol,  the response  criteria  modified  for the assessment  of HCC  (mRECIST),  published 
in the Journal  of the National  Cancer  Institute  (JNCI  2010)  will be applied.  This modified  RECIST 
for HCC criteria is based on RECIST v1.1 but introduces the concept of  the longest diameter of 
the viable  tumor  tissue  for “typical”  intrahepatic  HCC  lesions.  Intrahepatic  lesions  are considered 
“typical” if they  display hypervascularity in the arterial  phase and a wash -out in the portal  or late 
venous  phase  in dynamic  contrast -enhanced  CT or MRI.  Differentiating  between  viable  vs necrotic 
liver tumor  tissue  may allow  a more  accurate  representation  of anti-cancer  treatment  effects.  In the 
context of  this protocol, these criteria will be termed ‘Modified RECIST for HCC (mRECIST)’. 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
2 MEASURABLE  
Liver lesions: Must be well -delineated, arterially enhancing lesions that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be 
recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• contrast  enhancement  at least 10 mm by CT/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness  no greater than 
5 mm).  
 
Extrahepatic  lesions:  Must  be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  in 
the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by CT/MRI scan  (scan  slice thickness  no greater  than 5 mm),  or ≥2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.  
 
Malignant  lymph  nodes:  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node 
must  be  15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by CT/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness  recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging, even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable  and may be identified  as target  lesions  must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
 15 mm by  CT/MRI scan.  Only  the short axis of  these  nodes  will contribute  to the baseline  sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved  by solid tumor. Nodal  size is normally  reported  as two dimensions  in the plane  in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial,  sagittal  or coronal).  The smaller  of these measures is  the short  axis. For 
example,  an abdominal  node  which  is reported  as being  20 mm  30 mm has a short  axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies  as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the

 node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
Note:  Lesions  on X -ray are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
3 NON -MEASURABLE  
All other  lesions  are considered  non-measurable,  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  
< 10mm,  liver lesions  with atypical  enhancement,  or pathological  lymph  nodes  with  10 to 
< 15 mm  short  axis)  as well as truly  non-measurable  lesions.  Lesions  considered  truly 
non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
Note:  Lesions  on X -ray are not  to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
3.1 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability  
3.1.1  Bone lesions  
• Bone scan, PET scan, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic  bone  lesions  or mixed  lytic-blastic  lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components , that 
can be evaluated  by cross  sectional  imaging  techniques  such as CT or MRI,  can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.  
• Blastic  bone  lesions  are non-measurable.  
 
4 BASELINE  DOCUMENTATION  OF ‘TARGET’  AND  ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS  
The selection  of target  lesions will  be initially guided  by the presence  of ‘typical’  intrahepatic 
lesions.  
‘Typical’  intrahepatic  lesions  MUST  meet  the following  criteria:  
• Lesions  can be classified  as measurable  lesion  
• Lesions  are suitable  for repeated  measurements  
• Lesion  shows  typical  vascular  pattern  of HCC  in contrast -enhanced  spiral  CT or MRI  studies, 
defined as:  
− Well  delineated  intrahepatic  lesions  
− Hypervascularity  in the arterial  phase  
− Contrast  agent  wash -out in the portal  and late venous  phase

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Measurable lesions in  the liver meeting  the criteria for ‘typical’  target  lesions  present  at baseline, 
should be chosen as the sole intrahepatic target lesions. Up to five ‘typical’ intrahepatic lesions 
will be selected  as target  lesions.  Measurement  of the longest  viable  diameter,  which  is the longest 
diameter of the viable tumor lesion, will be applied to these lesions.  
HCC lesions that show local recurrence and/or residual disease after loco -regional therapy and 
have typical hypervascular patterns of HCC can be selected as target lesions. All other ‘atypical’ 
intrahepatic lesions will NOT be considered as target lesions.  
If measurable extrahepatic lesions are present in addition to the ‘typical’ intrahepatic lesions at 
baseline, up to five lesions (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), representative of all 
involved organs, will be identified as target lesions.  
Note: Outside of the liver, a maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system. For 
example, a maximum of two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesion 
from  each).  A maximum  of two lymph  nodes  can be selected  at baseline,  as the lymphatic  system 
is considered one organ.  
All measurable  intrahepatic  lesions  (up to a maximum  of five lesions)  and extrahepatic  lesions  (up 
to five lesions and a maximum of  two lesions per  organ) should be identified as target lesions to 
be measured and recorded at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in addition  should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which 
circumstance, the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions, up to ten total, will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph 
nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then as noted  above,  only the short  axis is added  into the sum. 
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of  disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions may include:  
Intrahepatic  lesions:  
• Poorly  delineated  HCC  lesions  including  infiltrative -type and diffuse  HCC  
• HCC  lesions  with atypical  contrast -agent  enhancement  patterns  
• HCC  lesions  showing  local  recurrence  after previous  loco-regional  treatment  without  meeting 
the criteria  for ‘viable’  lesions  (ie, lack of clear -cut hypervascular  recurrence  and/or  
well-delineation from the surrounding liver tissue)  
• Portal  vein tumor  invasion  and/or  thrombosis  
• Intrahepatic  viable  lesions  in excess  to the 5 lesions  in the liver selected  as target  lesions

 Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in 
rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details  to follow). In addition, it is possible to  record 
multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form  
(eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
5 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
5.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): For typical intrahepatic target, complete disappearance of any 
intratumoral  contrast -agent  enhancement  in the arterial  phase  of CT or MRI.  For atypical  intra- 
and extrahepatic target, disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate 
an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also 
considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
• Not Evaluable  (NE):  If one or more  target  lesions  cannot  be measured  or adequately  assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to measure (due to missing or poor quality images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above.  
 
5.1.1  Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
5.1.1.1  Lymph  Nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress  to below  10 mm on study.  This means  that when  lymph  nodes  are included  as target  lesions, 
the ‘sum’  of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph  node  is defined  as having  a short  axis of < 10 mm. Case  report  forms  or other  data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate section 
where,  in order  to qualify  for CR, each node  must  achieve  a short  axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD, and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
5.1.1.2  Target  Lesions  That  Become ‘Too Small  to Measure’  
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them  as being ‘too small to measure’.  When this occurs,  it is important  
Clinical  Protocol 
BMS -936558  CA20974W  
nivolumab  
Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  206 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 that a value  be recorded  on the case report  form.  If it is the opinion  of the radiologist  that the lesion 
has likely  disappeared,  the measurement  should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present  and is faintly  seen but too small  to measure,  a default  value  of 5 mm should  be assigned 
as the reference  diameter. (Note:  It is less likely that this  rule will be used for lymph nodes  since 
they usually  have  a definable  size when  normal  and are frequently  surrounded  by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well.) This 
default  value  is derived  from  the 5 mm CT slice thickness  (but should  not be changed  with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing  this default  value  will prevent  false  responses  or progressions  based  upon  measurement 
error.  To reiterate,  however,  if the radiologist is able to provide  an actual measure,  that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
5.1.1.3  Lesions  That  Split  or Coalesce  on Treatment  
When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’ , the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be 
added together  to calculate  the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.  
5.2 Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of  the criteria used to determine the tumor  response for the 
group  of non-target  lesions.  While  some  non-target  lesions  may actually  be measurable,  they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only  qualitatively at  the time points specified in 
the protocol.  
• Complete Response (CR): For typical intrahepatic non -target lesions, complete 
disappearance of any intratumoral contrast -agent enhancement in the arterial phase of CT or 
MRI. For atypical intra - and extrahepatic non -target lesions, complete disappearance of all 
lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  
 
5.2.1  Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression  of Non-Target Disease  
The concept  of progression  of non-target  disease  requires  additional  explanation  as follows:  
5.2.1.1  When  the Participant  also has Measurable  Disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’  on the basis of the non -target disease, there 
must  be an overall  level  of substantial  worsening  in non-target  disease  such that, even  in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target lesions is 
usually not sufficient  to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial

Date: 01 -Dec-2021  207 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 effusions  and ascites  will not  be followed  as target  or non-target  lesions  and will not contribute  to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
5.2.1.2  When  the Participant  has Only  Non-measurable  Disease  
This circumstance  arises  in some  trials  when  it is not a criterion  of study  entry  to have  measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable  disease  assessment  to factor  into the interpretation  of an increase  in non-measurable 
disease  burden.  Because  worsening  in non-target  disease  cannot  be easily  quantified  (by definition: 
if all lesions  are truly  non-measurable)  a useful  test that can be applied  when  assessing  patients  for 
unequivocal  progression  is to consider  if the increase  in overall  disease  burden  based  on the change 
in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare  PD for measurable  disease:  ie, an increase  in tumor  burden  representing  an additional  73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should  be considered  to have  had overall  PD at that point.  While  it would  be ideal  to have 
objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.  
5.2.2  New Lesions  
The appearance  of new malignant  lesions  denotes  disease  progression;  therefore,  some  comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable  to differences in  scanning  technique,  change in imaging modality  or findings  thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing  or flare of pre-existing lesions).  This is particularly  important  when  the patient’s baseline 
lesions  show  partial  or complete  response.  For example,  necrosis  of a liver lesion  may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’  cystic lesion, which it is not.  
New hepatic lesion with the longest diameter of at least 10 mm with the vascular pattern 
characteristic for HCC (ie, hypervascularization) in the arterial phase with  wash -out in the portal 
venous (or late venous) phase of contrast -enhanced CT or MRI imaging denotes disease 
progression.  
New hepatic lesions larger than 10 mm without the vascular pattern characteristic for HCC but 
evidence of growth of at least 10 mm in subsequent scans will also denote disease progression.  
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered  new lesions  and will not contribute  to response  or progression.  In the event  a new fluid 
collection is seen  on a post-baseline imaging  exam,  a comment  may be made,  but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessment  of progressive disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered  a new lesion  and will indicate  disease  progression.  An example  of this is the patient 
who has visceral  disease  at baseline  and while  on study  has a CT or MRI  brain  ordered  which

 reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X -Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in PD.  
If a new lesion  is equivocal,  for example  because  of its small  size, continued  follow -up evaluation  
5.3 Response Assessment  
5.3.1  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from  the start of the study  treatment until 
disease progression or the last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation  and censoring  rules  regarding  subsequent  therapy.  The patient’s  best overall  response 
assignment  will depend  on the findings  of both target  and non-target  disease  and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.  
5.3.2  Time Point Response  
At each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 5.3.2 -1 provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable  disease  at baseline.  When  patients  have  non-measurable  (therefore  non-target)  disease 
only, Table 5.3.2 -2 is to be used.

a Non-CR/non -PD is preferred  over SD for non-target  disease  since  SD is increasingly  used as endpoint  for

5.3.3  Best Overall Response  
Best response determination of complete or partial response requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial  responses  may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each are met at a subsequent  time point  of 
 4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 5.3.3 -1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol -specified 
minimum time from the date of first treatment or randomization date.  
For example, if the first scheduled follow -up imaging visit is Week 6 (  7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a  best response of SD can only be  made after the subject is on -study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on -study of 35 days from the 
reference  start date (reference  date is considered  Day 1 on study).  If the subject  is not on-study  for 
at least this amount  of time,  any tumor  assessment  indicating  stable  disease  before  this time period 
will have a best response of NE, unless PD is identified.  
Special  note on response  assessment:  When  nodal  disease  is included  in the sum of target  lesions 
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported 
on scans.  This measurement  should  be recorded  even  though  the nodes  are normal  in order  not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

SD = stable disease.  
a If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria  relative  to baseline,  makes  the disease  PD at that point  (since  disease  must  have  reappeared  after CR).  Best 
response  would  depend  on whether  minimum  duration  for SD was met. However,  sometimes  ‘CR’  may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

 APPENDIX 11  FRANCE -SPECIFIC  GENERAL  GUIDANCE  FOR  TRANS - 
ARTERIAL CHEMO -EMBOLIZATION  
1 PURPOSE  
This guidance provides information regarding the Trans -arterial Chemo -Embolization (TACE) 
procedure and is based on TACE procedure commonalities worldwide. For CA20974W, it is 
required  that the same  procedure  technique,  chemotherapy  agent(s),  and embolizing  agent  are used 
for each patient enrolled in this study.  
2 PROCEDURE  
TACE will be performed following a standard procedure in each investigational site. The same 
chemotherapy agent(s) must be used for all TACE procedures on a patient.  
The general  recommendation  of TACE  procedures  are as follows:  
1) Confirm  tumor  enhancement  and feeding  artery  by abdominal  angiography.  
2) Insert  a catheter  into the feeding  artery  of the HCC,  which  is technically  accessible,  as close  to 
the lesion as possible.  
3) EITHER  
a) Inject  the emulsion  of the anticancer  agent(s)  with lipiodol  or another  contrast  agent.  Drugs 
that may be considered include doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin 
and mitomycin (see Table 2 -1). 
4) Embolize  the feeding  artery  with an embolization  agent  (eg, gelatin  sponge),  and complete  the 
therapy.  
OR 
a) Inject Drug Eluting Beads (DEB). Only DEBs with single -agent chemotherapy, are 
allowed.  The use of DEBs  must  be in accordance  with the registered  indication  (see Table  
2-2). 
5) The end of TACE  procedure  is the cessation  of arterial  blood  flow to the  tumor.

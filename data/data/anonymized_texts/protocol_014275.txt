Document History 
With respect to v1.0, in v1.1 minor typing errors have been corrected in the numbering 
sequence of Inclusion criteria in the Synopsis and in Section 4.3.2 Inclusion criteria. 
With respect to v1.1, in v1.2 the study procedure has been modified allowing screening 
activities to be performed / completed on Day 1 (and consequently the date of Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 may coincide). Screening period is now therefore defined as the period from Day -14 to Day 1. The text has been modified throughout the protocol where applicable accordingly.  
The number of planned study sites was updated from “approximately 45 sites in the US” to “approximately 50 to 75 sites in the US”. 
In addition, some wording has been slightly improved throughout the protocol, as well as 
some minor err ors have been corrected.  
With respect to v1.2, in v2.0 the number of planned study countries and sites was updated from “approximately 50 to 75 sites in the US” to in addition “approximately 33 sites distributed in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia”.  
An additional CRO, i.e., PSI CRO AG, has been added for activities related to EU region.  A dedicated Section 4.1.1 Definition of patients naivety/non- naivety has been added to 
further improve definition of naivety/non- naivety to any chemotherapy.  
The facto r “region” has been added to the list of stratification factors having an impact on 
Primary efficacy analysis.  
In addition, some wording related to these changes has been slightly improved 
throughout the protocol, i.e., in Section 5.5 Packaging and Shipment, 5.7 Drug Depots, 5.9 Administration of Study Treatment, 5.11. Randomization- Use of IWRS, 5.14 Prior 
and Concomitant Medications. 
With respect to v2.0, in v3.0 the study design has been modified from a non- inferiority 
efficacy study to a safety study. The primary objective is now to assess safety of IV 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron combination (IV NEPA FDC), and the secondary objective is to describe the efficacy. As a result, there will be no formal inference testing included in the analysis and data will b e subject to descriptive analysis only. 
The number of chemotherapy cycles was increased from one cycle to the first 4 chemotherapy cycles (as maximum). Visit 4 will be the end of each “Study Cycle”, and Visit 5 (HEOR Extension) has been deleted.   
Sample s ize was also lowered to 400 patients equally randomized to each arm. Study 
drug assignment for Cycles 2 to 4 will be closed 7 days after the last (400
th) patient is 
randomized, in order to permit patients already screened for a subsequent study cycle to 
be administered study drug. Patients still participating in the study at this time should 
complete their current cycle and will not be allowed to enter in a subsequent study cycle.

Inclusion #4 has been changed to enrol patients naïve to moderately or highly  emetogenic 
antineoplastic agents, rather than only naïve to AC chemotherapy. This change also 
eliminates the stratification by naivety to any emetogenic antineoplastic agent. Inclusion #5 has also been updated to specify that patients must be scheduled to receive at least 4 
consecutive cycles of an AC regimen, in line with the change in study design to include repeated cycles. Additional clarifications were also added regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria to be checked prior to each repeated cycle.  
In terms of safety, laboratory assessments have been added at Visit 1 and Visit 3 of each 
cycle, where select parameters will be measured and assessments ( below, within and 
above normal range) will be summarized. The urine pregnancy test at Visit 3 was delete d. 
The definitions of treatment -emergent adverse events, the reporting periods for adverse 
events, and the planned summaries for adverse events, have all been updated to account for repeated cycles.  
For efficacy assessments, the patient diary will be administered during each cycle, while 
the FLIE questionnaire will only be administered during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Complete protection (CP) has been removed as an efficacy endpoint. All efficacy analyses will now be descriptive only. 
For the exploratory HEOR evaluations, information on emergency department and in-
patient admissions, as well as chemotherapy, will be collected during each cycle, while WPAI questionnaire will only be administered during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. CINV prophylaxis will no longer be c ollected as all patients will remain on  either IV 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron or oral netupitant/palonosetron during each cycle in this study. 
Belarus has been removed as potential country for this study, and approximate numbers 
of study sites have been adjusted accordingly. Updates to Study Drug Mananagment procedures have also been made. In addition, the General Information section has been updated with appropriate CRO contacts. 
Wording related to these changes has been implemented throughout the protocol.  
With respect to v3.0, in v3.1 minor typing errors have been corrected in the numbering 
sequence of Exclusion criteria in Section 4.3.3 Exclusion criteria, steps in Section 5.4 Dose and Administration, and reasons for discontinuations in Section 6.4 Prem ature 
Discontinuation. Study title on coverpage was also corrected as “nausea” was inadvertently omitted, and the main phone number for George Clinical was updated on the coverpage and in the General Information section. Detail about study drug administration was added to Section 5.9 Administration of Study Treatment.

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  A multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, 
active-controlled, parallel group phase 3b study to assess the 
safety and to describe the efficacy of IV 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) combination 
(IV NEPA FDC) compared to oral netupitant/palonosetron 
(300 mg/0.5 mg) combination (Akynzeo®) for the prevention 
of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting in initial and 
repeated cycles of anthracycline -cyclophosphamide (AC)  
chemotherapy in women with breast cancer  
Study Number  NEPA-17-05 
Sponsor Helsinn Healthcare SA, Via Pian Scairolo 9, 6912 Lugano, 
Switzerland  
Countries and Sites Approximately 50 sites in the US and approximately 30 sites 
distributed in Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. If needed, 
additional sites and countries may be involved as well.  
Clinical Phase  Phase 3b 
Indication Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
Anthracycline- Cyclophosphamide ( AC) based emetogenic 
cancer chemotherapy.  
Study Design Multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, 
parallel group, stratified study assessing the safety and 
describing the efficacy of a single dose of intraveneous (IV) fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) infusion [test] versus oral net
upitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) 
combination [control]; each administered with oral 
dexamethasone prior to initial and repeated cycles of AC 
chemotherapy in female breast cancer patients.  
Objectives  Primary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 
IV dose of fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) 
combination administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion with 
oral dexamethasone on Day 1 for the prevention of AC 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting in initial and 
repeated cycles.  
Secondary: To describe the efficacy of a single IV dose of 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) combination 
(IV NEPA FDC)  administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion 
versus a single oral dose of netupitant/palonosetron 
(300 mg/0.5 mg) combination (oral NEPA FD C)

administered as one capsule, during the acute (0 -24 hours), 
delayed (>24 -120 hours) and overall (0 -120 hours) phases of 
initial and repeated cycles of AC chemotherapy.  
Exploratory: To evaluate the impact on economics and 
resource utilization through collection of Health Economics 
Outcomes Research (HEOR) parameters in initial and 
repeated cycles of AC chemotherapy.  
Treatment Groups Group 1 / Test group – intravenous fosnetupitant/ 
palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed- dose combination, 
administered as a 30 -minute infusion of a 50 mL solution, 
on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Group 2 / Control group – oral netupitant/palonosetron 
(300 mg/0.50 mg) fixed- dose combination on Day 1 of each 
cycle.  
Oral dexamet hasone will be administered on Day 1 of each 
cycle (12 mg) to both test and control groups.  
Drug Administration  The administration of test and control drugs will be double -
blinded.  
Oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) fixed-dose 
combination capsule (or matching placebo capsule) will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, 60 minutes prior to the start of AC chemotherapy.  
The 30- minute IV fosnetupitant/palonosetron  
(260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed- dose combination infusion (or 
matching placebo infusion) w ill start 30 minutes prior to the 
start of the AC chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. The 
IV infusion will be completed before starting chemotherapy 
administration.  
Administration of dexamethasone will not be blinded as the dosage and schedule are identical in both treatment groups, i.e., 12 mg on Day 1 of each cycle as a unique dose. On Day 
1 of each cycle, oral dexamethasone will be taken 30 
minutes prior to the start of the AC chemotherapy, 
immediately before the start of the 30 -minute IV 
fosnetupitant /palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) fixed-dose 
combination or placebo infusion.  
Study Duration  Each randomized patient is planned to participate in a 
maximum of 4 consecutive chemotherapy cycles assessed in this study. A total of 400 patients will be randomized. Study 
drug assignment for Cycles 2 to 4 will be closed 7 days after

the last (400th) patient is randomized, in order to permit 
patients already screened for a subsequent study cycle to be 
administered study drug. Patients still participating in the 
study at this time should complete their current cycle and 
will not be allowed to enter in a su bsequent cycle.   
For each cycle, patients will undergo a screening visit 
(Visit 1) up to 7 days (up to 14 days for Cycle 1 only) before 
study drug administration (Day 1; Visit 2). After receiving a single dose of active treatment on Day 1, patients will e nter 
an efficacy evaluation period of 120 hours and then return to the clinical site on Day 6  
(+2) for Visit 3. Patients will  
undergo a follow -up visit or  telephone call (Visit 4) either 
on Day 15 (+3 days) or Day 22 (±3 days) depending on the next chemo
therapy cycle schedule (this Visit 4 will be 
considered as the end of each “Study Cycle”). Visit  4, or the 
corresponding telephone contact, either on Day 15 (+3 days) or on Day 22 (±3 
days) is to be performed prior to 
administering the chemotherapy relevan t to the next cycle 
and prior to any further moderately or highly emetogenic 
chemotherapeutic treatment administration.  
Total number of visits per patient: For each cycle, there will 
be a maximum of 4 visits or 3 visits plus 1 telephone 
contact. For all cycles, the screening visit and the study drug administration visit can be performed on the same day. The screening visit of a subsequent cycle can also coin cide with 
the follow -
up visit of the previous cycle. If all these visits 
are merged, Visit 4 of the previous cycle as well as Visit 1 
and Visit 2 of the next cycle are all three performed on the same day.  
Total number of cycles per patient:  Each patient m ay 
participate in a maximum of 4 consecutive chemotherapy cycles, as long as they continue to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the repeated cycles and as long as the study remains open.  
Maximum total study duration per patient is approxima tely  
14 weeks. This maximum total study duration per patient is 
based on the assumption that the patient participates in 4 
consecutive study cycles (maximum number of cycles 
allowed in the study) with 21 days interval between the Day 1 of two consecutive cycles, and that follow -up visits of one 
cycle coincide with screening visits of the subsequent cycle. A minimum of 14 days and maximum of 35 days is allowed 
between the Day 1 of two consecutive cycles.

Efficacy Analysis  Analysis Population 
Population for efficacy analyses is defined as follows: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized 
patients who received the AC chemotherapy  regimen and 
active study drug (including partial infusion). Following the 
intent-to-treat principle, patients will be assigned to the 
treatment group to which they were randomized. FAS will be used for demography, other baseline characteristics and 
all descriptive efficacy analyses.  
Efficacy Analysis  
At each cycle, for each phase (acute, delayed, and overall), numbers and proportions (including 95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients with CR, with n o emetic episodes, with no 
rescue medication, with no nausea, and with no significant nausea will be descriptively summarized.  
Difference between groups in response rate and 95% CI will be presented without strata adjustment using the Newcombe -
Wilson 
method and with strata adjustment using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method with region and 
age class as strata.  
The severity of nausea will be descriptively summarized including difference between groups. 
For Cycles 1 and 2, numbers and proportions o f patients 
with NIDL for total FLIE score and for domain scores in the 
overall phase will be descriptively summarized and 
difference between treatment groups presented without strata 
adjustment and with strata adjustment using the CMH 
method as mentioned a bove.The domain (nausea and

descriptively summarized including difference between 
groups.   
Safety Analysis  
 
   Analysis Population 
Population for safety analyses is defined as follows: 
The Safety population  includes all patients who received 
active study drug (including partial infusion). Patients will 
be assigned to treatment groups according to the actual 
treatment received. Safety population will be used for 
demography, other baseline characteristics and for all safety 
analyses.

 Safety Analysis  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be listed and 
summarized by frequency tables. Summaries will be made 
with respect to the number and proportion of patients with events and the total number of events. A  similar summary 
will be presented for Cycle 1 only. In addition, TEAEs of 
special interest, i.e. the ones related to local tolerability (e.g. 
injection site reaction, pain at injection site, 
thrombophlebitis) will be presented for each cycle. 
Vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for observed values,  change from baseline, and change from pre-dose assessment, in addition to being listed. 
Proportion of laboratory values below, within and above 
normal range will be presented by frequency table for each 
timepoint. Shift table (below, within and above normal 
range) comparing baseline assessment with on -treatment 
assessment and comparing pre -dose assessment with Visit 3 
assessment of each cycle will also be presented.  
HEOR Analysis  The HEOR analysis will be managed and conducted 
separately. Relevant patient data and results will be 
presented in a separate report. Further details (including

Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
a) Screening activities for Cycle 1 may be performed or completed between Day -14 and Day 1, included. In repeated 
cycles (i.e., cycles no. 2, 3 or 4), Visit 1 may be performed from Day -7 up to study Day 1 inclusive. For all cycles, 
Visit 1 and Visit 2 may o ccur on the same day (on study Day 1). In that case, the assessments planned at both Visit 1 
and Visit 2 have to be performed only once.  
b) Visit 3 (Day 6 [+ 2 days]) is to be scheduled on Day 6, not earlier than 120 hours after start of AC chemotherapy 
administration on Day 1. If Day 6 is a holiday or a weekend day, or in case Visit 3 cannot be performed on Day 6 after 
the end of the 120 hours period for any reason, Visit 3 may be scheduled within the two forthcoming days.  
c) Visit 4, follow -up visit, either as on-site visit or telephone contact, is to be performed either on Day 15 (+3 days)  or on 
Day 22 (±3 days) depending on the next chemotherapy cycle schedule. The patient’s follow -up visit or contact is to be 
performed prior to administering the chemotherapy relevant to the next cycle and prior to any further moderately or 
highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic treatment administration to the patient.  Visit 4 of a previous cycle, as well as 
Visit 1 and Visit 2 of the next cycle, can all coincide and be performed on the same day.  
d) Only at Cycle 1  
e) Some inclusion / exclusion criteria are to be verified at Screening visit (Visit 1) and confirmed at the Day 1 visit (Visit 
2); if Visit 1 and Visit 2 are performed on the same day (Day 1), a unique assessment of these crite ria is sufficient; 
please refer to inclusion / exclusion criteria section for details.  
f) To be performed for females of childbearing potential within 24 hours prior to the IMP administration at each cycle 
(oral netupitant/palonosetron combination or placebo capsule) on Day 1. If the screening visit urine pregnancy test has 
been done within the 24 hours before the IMP administration, no urine pregnancy test is to be performed at Visit 2 (Day 
1). 
g) Complete PE (general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, neck, lungs, cardiovascular, breast, lymph nodes, 
abdomen, musculoskeletal and neurological) to be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 3 of each cycle. At Visit 3 and at 
subsequent cycles, only the general question “Was PE performed?” will be asked on the  eCRF. Any new or worsening 
of pathological findings noted since previous examination should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF form.  
h) Vital signs assessments include: pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (on Day 1 
at pre-dose, i.e., within 30 minutes before the oral netupitant/palonosetron combination or placebo capsule 
administration) and Visit 3 of each cycle. Pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure have to be measured after 
the patient has been  in semi-supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
i) Height has to be measured only at Visit 2 (Day 1) of Cycle 1. Weight has to be measured at Visit 2 (Day 1) of each 
cycle, and should occur prior to the start of the AC chemotherapy administration.  
j) Local laboratories will be used for haematology and blood chemistry analysis throughout the study.  
k) Patients will receive 12 mg dexamethasone on Day 1 of each cycle. Dexamethasone is to be administered 30 minutes 
prior to the start of the AC chemotherapy ad ministration (immediately before IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion).  
l) The patient’s diary,  referring to the 0 -120 hour period, will be distributed to the patients at the Day 1 Visit of each 
cycle. Patients will be asked to report date and time of onset of e metic episodes (episodes of retching or vomiting), 
date and time of intake of rescue medication, name of the rescue medication taken, and daily nausea intensity assessed 
by VAS on their diary. The patient’s completed diary will be retrieved and checked by the Investigator or designated 
responsible person during study Visit 3 of each cycle.  
m) FLIE questionnaire, referring to the 0 -120 hour period, will be distributed to the patients at the Day 1 Visit, with 
explanations on how to perform the requested assessments; the patient’s completed FLIE will be retrieved and checked 
by the Investigator or designated responsible person during study Visit 3. FLIE questionnaire will only be 
administered during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.  
n) The WPAI questionnaire, referring to  the 0-120 hour period, will be distributed to the patient at the Day 1 Visit, with 
explanations on how to complete the questionnaire; the patient’s completed WPAI will be retrieved and checked by 
the Investigator or designated responsible during study Vis it 3. WPAI questionnaire will only be administered during 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. 
o) Hospitalization information (including ED, IP and LOS, and initiation dates thereof), referring to the interval from Visit 
2 (Day 1) through Visit 4 of each cycle, will be recor ded.  
p) Starting at Cycle 2 Visit 2 (Day 1), the Investigator will document if changes in chemotherapy administration from the 
previous cycle occurred and will note any delays in treatment for the current cycle.   
q) Adverse events will be collected from Inform ed Consent signature until end of the study (completion/discontinuation), 
as a minimum. If the patient exit the study less than 15 days after last study drug administration, the patient should be 
followed-up for AE recording up to 15 days after last study drug administration. All non -resolved AEs (including 
SAEs) beyond this date will be documented on the eCRF as “ongoing”. For SAE follow -up requirements, see Section

1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background Information 
Cancer chemotherapy is often associated with nausea and vomiting, which are among the 
most unpleasant and distressing subjective side effects [1, 2]. Chemotherapy -induced 
nausea and vomiting (CINV) reduces patient’s health related quality of life and may cause non -compliance or refusal of potentially life -saving chemotherapeutic regimens 
[2]. The severity and pattern of nausea and vomiting induced by a chemotherapeutic 
regimen depend on the agents used and the doses employed [1]. In this respect, 
chemotherapeutic regimens are classified as highly, moderately, low, and minimally emetogenic [1].  
Palonosetron hydrochloride is a specific 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT
3) receptor 
antagonist used to prevent CINV when subjects receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), and is a known chemical entity currently registered in the oral and intravenous (IV) forms in several countries [ 3, 4, 5]. 
In the US, in July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved palonosetron 0.25 mg IV given as a 30 -second bolus, for the prevention of acute CINV associated with 
highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and for prevention of delayed CINV associated with MEC (initial and repeat courses).  In Europe, in March 2005, the 
European Medicine Agency (EMA) approved the product via the Centralized Procedure 
for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cisplatin -based cancer chemotherapy and moderately emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy  
The oral palonosetron formulation (0.50 mg capsule) is approved in the US (August 2008) and in the EU (January 2010) for the prevention of moderately emetogenic CINV. 
At present, the product is registered in more than 70 countries with different trademarks  
(Aloxi
®, Onicit®, Paloxi®). 
Netupitant is a new, highly efficient, selective neurokinin- 1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist 
that blocks receptors located in the central nervous system (in the putative vomiting 
center in the nucleus tractus solitarii) and in the gastrointestinal tract wall (peripheral abdominal vagal afferents), and is a new chemical entity. [6] 
Helsinn developed an oral combination (NEPA FDC), which includes a 5- HT
3 receptor 
antagonist (palonosetron, 0.5 mg) and an NK 1 receptor antagonist (netupitant, 300 mg) in 
the form of a hard -gelatin capsule to be administered as a single dose 1 hour prior to 
chemotherapy.  
In the US oral NEPA FDC (Akyn zeo®) was approved in October 2014, for the prevention 
of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeated courses of chemotherapy, including but not limited to  HEC [6].

Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
Oral NEPA FDC (Akynzeo®) is currently officially recommended for MEC and HEC 
acute and delayed emesis prevention by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  
(NCCN) guidelines. [ 7] 
Since netupitant is not water -soluble and, as such, early parenteral formulations did not 
show a satisfactory local tolerability profile, the Sponsor developed fosnetupitant, a water-soluble phosphorylated pro- drug of netupitant, which is rapidly converted to 
netupitant in vivo following IV administration. Fosnetupitant proved to overcome tolerability issues that were observed with former IV netupitant formulations [6]. 
Fosnetupitant was administered as a single dose by IV route at dosages of 19.5 mg up to 
390 mg to a total of 179 healthy male and female volunteers, showing a good safety profile.  
An IV formulation of fosnetupitant/palonosetron, IV NEPA FDC, was developed [ 8]. The 
fosnetupitant component dose in this formulation is 260 mg, which showed to be 
equivalent in exposure (Area Under the Curve, AUC) to the netupitant dose used in oral NEPA FDC (300 mg netupitant) (study PNET -12-23 [9]). The selected dose for the 
palonosetron component in the IV NEPA FDC is 0.25 mg, i.e., the registered dose of Aloxi
® IV.  
Helsinn recently completed a phase 3, active -controlled, double -blind, randomized, 
multi-cycle safety study with IV NEPA FDC versus oral NEPA FDC in more than 
400 cancer patients mainly receiving HEC. Study patients  were allowed to receive the 
study drug in up to 4 consecutive repeated chemotherapy cycles. Study results confirmed the good safety profile and the satisfactory antiemetic efficacy of IV NEPA FDC in cancer patients (Study NEPA -15-18, [13]). 
The sponsor also recently completed an open label pharmacokinetic (PK) study in cancer patients treated with IV NEPA FDC as a 30 -minute infusion and receiving cisplatin based 
HEC (Study NEPA-15-19, [10]). The PK results obtained in cancer patients confirmed 
the rapid conversion of fosnetupitant into netupitant after IV administration previously shown in healthy volunteers. Study results in cancer patients also show that an IV dose of 260 mg fosnetupitant/0.25 mg palonosetron yields a netupitant exposure equivalent to that of 300 mg netupitant oral dose, previously evidenced in healthy volunteers. With regards to palonosetron, the PK profile was superimposable to that observed in a previous PK study in healthy volunteers receiving 0.25 mg palonosetron IV bolus (Study PALO -
03-05), with the obvious exception of maximum concentration (C
max) which was lower 
after 30-min infusion as compared to the IV bolus.   
NEPA-17- 05 study will evaluate the safety and describe the efficacy of IV NEPA FDC 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) combination, given as a 30- minute infusion 
compared with oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) combination (oral NEPA FDC) in female breast cancer patients receiving AC chemotherapy, allowing to complete the information on the antiemetic efficacy and safety of IV NE PA FDC in the AC 
chemotherapy setting.  
In addition to the described oral or IV combination, study patients will also receive a regimen of oral dexamethasone as part of the anti- emetic treatment.

1.2 Pre-clinical and Clinical Data of Palonosetron 
1.2.1 Pre-clinical Data 
As described above, palonosetron is a well -known chemical entity that has been on the 
world market for more than 12 years as an IV formulation and for more than 5 years as an 
oral agent. For pre -clinical data on palonosetron, reference is made to the dedicated 
Investigator’s Brochure [ 4]. 
1.2.2 Summary of Phase 1 Clinical Data (Human Pharmacokinetics)  
1.2.2.1  Absorption  
Following IV administration, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by slow elimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half -life of 
approximately 40 hours which is substantially longer than other 5- HT
3 antagoni sts, i.e., 
ondansetron (4- 6 h), granisetron (5- 8 h), tropisetron (7 h) and dolasetron (7 h). Mean 
plasma C max and area under the concentration -time curve (AUC 0-∞) are generally dose -
proportional over the dose range of 0.3- 90 µg/kg in healthy subjects and i n cancer 
patients. 
Following oral administration, palonosetron is well absorbed with its absolute 
bioavailability reaching 97% mean plasma C max and AUC are generally dose-proportional 
over the dose range of 0.3-90 μg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer pa tients. The mean 
time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) after oral solution administration was 
generally 4 -6 hours. [ 4] 
1.2.2.2  Distribution  
Following both oral and IV administrations, palonosetron is widely distributed in the 
body (volume of distribution of approximately 8.3±2.5 L/kg) and approximately 62% is bound to human- plasma proteins. Age, hepatic dysfunction or mild to moderate renal 
impairment has no clinically significant effect on the PK of palonosetron, although total 
systemic exposure increases by 28% in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. [4] 
1.2.2.3  Metabolism  
Palonosetron is eliminated by dual routes, about 40% is eliminated through the kidney and approximately 50% is metabolized to form two primary metabolites: M9 N -
oxidepalonosetron (AUC approximately 12%  of that of the parent drug) and M4 6 -S-
hydroxypalonosetron (AUC approximately 3.8% of that of the parent drug). These metabolites have less than 1% of the 5- HT
3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. 
In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that palonosetron is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A and CYP1A2. Palonosetron does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Metabolite profiling demonstrated that the metabolism of p alonosetron following oral administration 
was consistent with the metabolism following IV administration. [4]

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
1.2.2.4  Elimination  
After a single IV dose of 10 μg/kg [14C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose is 
recovered within 144 hours in the urine, with palonosetron as unchanged active substance 
representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. After a single IV bolus 
administration in healthy Caucasian subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron is 173±73 mL/min and renal clearance is 53±29 mL/min. The  low total body clearance and 
large volume of distribution results in a terminal elimination half -life of approximately 
40 hours, which is substantially longer than that of other 5- HT
3 antagonists, i.e., 
ondansetron (4- 6 hours), granisetron (5- 8 hours), tropisetron (7 hours) and dolasetron 
(7 hours).Ten percent of patients revealed a mean terminal elimination half -life greater 
than 100 hours. Quantifiable concentrations of palonosetron following oral administration of a single dose (0.75 mg) of radiolabeled [
14C]-palonosetron were reported for all 
subjects until at least 120 hours and between 192 and 216 hours post -dose in plasma and 
urine, respectively. Quantifiable concentrations of M9 metabolite were reported for all subjects until at least 24 hours and between 120 and 144 hours post -dose in plasma and 
urine, respectively. [ 4] 
1.2.3 Clinical Data  
In clinical studies, adverse events (AEs) considered by Inve stigators to be related to 
palonosetron were consistent with those observed for other 5- HT
3 receptor antagonists as 
a class, or with those expected in a cancer or surgical population, with occasional very minor, non- clinically relevant differences between palonosetron and active comparators 
[4]. Constipation and headache were the most frequently observed AEs in patients 
receiving IV or oral palonosetr on. These AEs are frequently reported in patients receiving 
5-HT
3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with 
cancer chemotherapy or for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
For further information about palonosetron, including PK, pharmacodynamics, clinical 
efficacy and safety, please refer to the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure [4]. 
1.3 Pre-clinical and Clinical Data of Fosnetupitant and Netupitant  
Fosnetupitant is the water -soluble phosphorylated pro- drug of netupitant. Fosnetupitant is 
rapidly converted to netupitant in vivo following IV administration. Fosnetupitant  proved 
to overcome tolerability issues that were observed with former IV netupitant formulations and was therefore used as the “netupitant component” in the IV netupitant/palonosetron combination formulation. [ 8] 
1.3.1  Pre-clinical Data  
1.3.1.1  Fosnetupitant  
A pre-clinical development program for fosnetupitant, in addition to specific pre -clinical 
studies with the combination of fosnetupitant and palonosetron, has been performed.

Safety Pharmacology 
Central nervous system 
An Irwin test study in rats (PNET -12-01) was performed to evaluate the possible effects 
of fosnetupitant on general behavior parameters. A single IV administration of 
fosnetupitant at 13.16 and 39.47 mg/kg corresponding to 10 and 30 mg/kg of netupitant, respectively, did not induce any changes in behavioral, neurological or autonomic functions of rats. No clinical signs were observed on the day of dosing or during the subsequent 6- day observation period in animals of low and mid- dose groups. Pro-
convulsant (PNET-13-69) and anticonvulsant (PNET -13-70) activity were also assessed 
in rats with fosnetupitant. Fosnetupitant did not show any pro -convulsant nor 
anticonvulsant activity up to 79 mg/kg/day. 
Cardiovascular system  
The effects of fosnetupitant on the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) encoded by human ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG) were studied at a stimulation frequency of 
6 pulses/min (0.1 Hz) in stably transfected Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells (PNET-12-06). A vehicle group (1 period with extracellular solution) was included in the 
study for comparison and terfenadine (1 µM) was used as reference substance.  The 
results suggest that fosnetupitant up to 30 µM  would possess no l iability for  prolonging 
QT interval (QT) in this model.  
A study assessing the cardiovascular functions in dogs (PNET -12-35) following 2- week 
IV fosnetupitant administration up to 13.2 mg/kg/day showed no effects on PR -, QT-, 
ST-, QTcV-, QTcF -, or RR- intervals or QRS complex duration.  
Respiratory, Renal, Urinary, and Gastrointestinal Systems  
Specific studies were planned and performed to evaluate possible effects on respiratory, renal, urinary, and gastrointestinal systems for fosnetupitant. No changes of toxicological relevance were detected in renal function at 13.2 mg/kg fosnetupitant dose level. Transient decrease in urine volume output and moderate significant decrease of electrolyte excretion were observed at 39.5 and 79.0 mg/kg (PNET -13-34). No cha nges 
of toxicological significance in respiratory parameters were observed with fosnetupitant up to 79.2 mg/kg (PNET -14-19). No effects on gastrointestinal motility (PNET -13-67) 
were observed in rats at doses up to 39.5 mg/kg. A statistically significant decrease in GI transit of the charcoal meal versus vehicle control was noted at 79.0 mg/kg. [ 8] 
Toxicology 
Several repeat dose toxicity studies with  fosnetupitant were performed in rats and dogs 
following IV administration up to 4 weeks.  
In the 2-week study, the repeated IV administration of fosnetupitant to rats (PNET -11-21) 
at the doses of 3.95, 13.16, and 39.47 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 3, 10, and 30 mg of 
netupitant, respectively) resulted in slight toxic effects mainly affecting the liver of the rats receiving the highest dose. These effects were reversible after a 2 -week recovery 
period.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
In the 4-week IV toxicity study in rats (PNET -13-18) at the  same doses of the 2 -week 
study, the repeated administration of fosnetupitant resulted in a liver centrilobular 
hypertrophy in high dose and mid- dose groups. These changes correlated with increased 
liver weight. No significant differences were observed in liver weights after the 2 week 
recovery period. Liver changes observed were not associated with any other alteration and were not considered as adverse. On the basis of the results obtained in the study, the dose level of 13.16 mg/kg/day was considered as the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) 
for systemic and local effects, and the dose level of 39.47 mg/kg/day was defined as the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for local effects.  
In a 2-week study in dogs, the repeated daily IV administration of fosnetupitant (PNET -
11-22) at the same doses resulted in no toxic effects after 14 days of treatment. No 
statistically significant increments in QTc were observed.  
In the 4-week IV toxicity study in dogs (PNET -13-27) at dose levels 1.316, 3.95 and 
13.16 mg/kg/ day, there were no changes in electrocardiographic parameters, hematology, 
coagulation, clinical chemistry or urinalysis. Decreases in body weight were noted in both sexes at the high -dose level during the dosing phase, associated with a decrease in 
food consumption. However, these changes were not considered as adverse and showed reversibility after the 2 -week recovery period. At the microscopic examination, changes 
were noted in thymus of the high- dose group, in addition, minimal increases in multifocal 
necrotic lymphocytes were noted in the same group.  
No changes were noted in thymus weight and at microscopic observations after a 2 -week 
treatment -free period. The NOAEL was 13.16 mg/kg/day for systemic and local effects 
and the NOEL was 3.95 mg/kg/day. Fosnetupitant did not show mutagenic activity in the Ames test (PNET -12-04). In the 
Chromosome aberrations test no structural aberrations were observed in human 
lymphocytes (PNET-12-05). 
The assessment of the ability of fosnetupitant to induce chromosomal da mage was 
performed in the micronucleus test in rats following IV administration up to 
118.4 mg/kg/day (PNET -13-49). The study showed no clastogenic effect and no 
micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes.  
In general, studies showed that fosnetupitant had no hemolytic effect and showed a good tolerability profile when injected IV in rats and dogs daily for up to 14 days. 
Pharmacokinetics and metabolism in animals  
In rats and dogs, fosnetupitant is rapidly converted into netupitant after IV administration. 
In vitro metabolic stability data in lung, kidney, intestine and liver S9 and in vivo PK data 
suggest that the hydrolysis of fosnetupitant to netupitant occurs in multiple tissues and not only in the liver. The exposure (AUC) of netupitant in rats after equi molar 
administration of IV fosnetupitant and netupitant was comparable, which indicates a 1:1 conversion. 
Three major circulating metabolites of netupitant have been identified: M1 (desmethyl  
derivative), M2 (N-oxide derivative), and M3 (OH- methyl derivative). In the 2 preclinical 
 
Page 38 of 120

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
species dosed IV with fosnetupitant, the exposure to netupitant and to the 3 main 
circulating metabolites, M1, M2 and M3, are comparable with the exposures measured after direct IV or oral administration of netupitant following single and multiple doses. In the 14-day toxicity study in rats (PNET -11-21), females seemed to be more exposed than 
male rats suggesting that the kinetics of the drug may be gender dependent. An 
accumulation of metabolite M1 and, in minor proportion, of metabolites M2 and M3 was observed. A 4th metabolite (M4) has been recently detected and studies aiming at better characterization of M4 showed that it is present in much smaller proportion than the other 3 metabolites.  
The high fosnetupitant in vivo clearance in rats and dogs, which is higher than hepatic blood flow, and the high to moderate volume of distribution suggest that the fast hydrolysis of fosnetupitant to netupitant occurs in multiple  tissues and not only in the 
liver. The subsequent in vivo elimination of netupitant is due to biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism (mainly mediated by cytochrome P450[CYP]3A4 and lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 in humans). Possible in vivo drug -drug interactions are 
predicted only with netupitant and not with its pro- drug. 
Fosnetupitant has a very short half-life of 12 to 28 min in rats and dogs. 
An overview of the PK parameters of fosnetupitant and netupitant after single IV 
administration, as well as a detailed description of the animal data on fosnetupitant, is 
provided in the current IB of IV NEPA FDC. [ 8] 
1.3.1.2  Netupitant  
A detailed description of the netupitant animal data is provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure for the oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) fixed dose combination (oral NEPA FDC). [ 6] 
1.3.1.3  Fosnetupitant in combination with Palonosetron  
Safety Pharmacology 
A 2-week IV cardiovascular functions study in dogs has been performed (NEPA -13-76). 
Alterations in atrio -ventricular conduction, ventricular depolarization and repolarization 
characterized by increases in PR, PQ, QT interval and QRS complex durations, ST 
segment as well as in corrected  QT (QTc) and QT shift were observed at the top dosed 
group with fosnetupitant – palonosetron at 13.2/6 mg/kg/day. These effects  tended to 
appear after 7 days of dosing and disappeared on the 14th dosing day. 
Toxicology 
A 4-week IV toxicity study in rats followed by a 2 -week recovery period has been 
performed (NEPA -13-51). Assessment of fosnetupitant toxicity in combination with 
palonosetron was performed in rats after daily IV administration for 4 weeks including a 
2-week recovery period at the following doses: fosnetupitant/palonosetron 0, 3.95/1, 
13.16/3 and 39.47/10 mg/kg/day. The mortality evaluation showed that there was 
1 female in the high dose group, and 4 animals in the satellite groups (2 males in the high 
dose group, 1 female in the mid- dose group and 1 female in the high dose group). No

Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
cause of death was identified for these animals. No relevant changes were observed in  
ophthalmoscopy, hematology, coagulation and urinalyses. In high dose group, increases 
of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and cholesterol were detected. In addition, females from the same treated group showed a decrease of urea. The ab ove 
changes could be related to the liver centrilobular hypertrophy observed at histopathological examination (centrilobular hypertrophy associated with increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, being of moderate degree in the males and of mild degree in the females). Since it was not associated with any other alteration (i.e., necrosis or inflammation), it was not considered as an adverse effect. Changes recorded during the dosing phase showed complete reversibility, with a partial recovery for aspartate aminotransferase in males. All treated animals were exposed to fosnetupitant. The pro -
drug was highly distributed in the tissues and rapidly converted to netupitant which tended to accumulated after 28 days of treatment. M1 was the major metabolite present in plasma and brain and accumulate more than netupitant. All animals were exposed to 
palonosetron. There was a slight accumulation, however it was rapidly eliminated. The dose level of 13.16/3 mg/kg/day of fosnetupitant/palonosetron was the NOEL for systemic and  local effects, and the dose level of 39.47/10 mg/kg/day the NOAEL for 
local and systemic effects.  
A 4-week IV toxicity study in dogs followed by a 2- week recovery period has been 
performed (NEPA -13-52). The potential toxicity of fosnetupitant was assessed when 
administered once daily to dogs by IV route for 4 weeks including a 2- week recovery 
period. The doses were fosnetupitant/palonosetron 0, 1.316/1, 3.95/3 or  13.16/10-6 mg/kg/day (the dose level of palonosetron was decreased to 6 mg/kg/day from dosing day 15 for males and dosing day 14 for females). No mortality was observed over 
the course of this study. Transient clinical signs were observed (convulsive episodes, vocalization and startle movements) in 1/5  male and 2/5 females during the second week 
of dosing at the highest dose combination. Palonosetron in this combination was decreased from 10 to 6 mg/kg/day. Transient tremors and salivation, and indurations/swellings at the injection sites in the high dose group were also observed. Treatment -related decreased body weight gain occurred in males and females at all the 
three dose levels with the most severe effects in females at the highest dose level. These body weight effects were associated with a decrease in food consumption at both high and middle dose levels mainly observed during the two first weeks of the dosing phase. All these changes in body weight and food consumption were reversible after a 2- week 
treatment -free period and none of these changes were considered to be adverse. No 
treatment -related changes were recorded in ophthalmoscopy, clinical chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis evaluations. ECG evaluations disclosed transient and reversible increased heart rate at mid dose (females only) and at high dose (both sexes) levels. These changes were associated with a transient and reversible increase (without dose -related effect) in QTc (QTcF and QTcV) intervals at the high dose level 
(male and female animals) and at the mid dose (males only). No treatment -related 
changes were noted  in organ weights and no macroscopic findings were noted at the 
terminal or recovery sacrifice. Changes were noted at the injection sites of the females treated at the highest dose combination. Specifically, in some injected sites, subchronic inflammation of the blood vessels, as well as subchronic inflammation and necrosis at the

perivascular area, were noted. All treated animals were exposed to the combination 
fosnetupitant and palonosetron, in a quite proportional manner. Data indicated a quite rapid conversion of the fosnetupitant to netupitant. M1 was the main metabolite present in plasma, with an exposure which exceeded that of netupitant on Day 28. Accumulation was also observed in heart tissues for M1. No measurable levels of fosnetupitant and metabolite M2 were detected in heart samples of all treatment groups analyzed at 
termination. Mean heart concentration of netupitant in low dose animals was approximately 5 -fold higher, when compared to plasma C
max on Day 28. After 14 days 
treatment -free period,  heart level of netupitant was reduced by 83% for males and 66% 
for females compared to Day 30. In addition, the presence of M1 was decreased almost completely in male animals. After a repeated administration of palonosetron in combination with fosnetupitant, no significant sex differences in exposure were noted. The NOEL was 1.316/1 mg/kg/day for fosnetupitant/palonosetron. 
1.3.1.4  Summary  
Overall, the non -clinical safety profile of the IV NEPA FDC is comparable to that of the 
registered oral NEPA FDC (Akynzeo
®).  
1.3.2 Summary of Phase 1 Clinical Data (Human Pharmacokinetics) of 
Fosnetupitant and Netupitant  
1.3.2.1  Absorption  
Fosnetupitant IV administration 
Fosnetupitant is rapidly converted to netupitant in vivo following IV administration in 
humans. The biotransformation of fosnetupitant to netupitant in vivo is almost completed (more than 99%) within 30- 60 min after the end of the fosnetupitant infusion (study 
PNET-12-23 [9]). Residual fosnetupitant plasma concentrations lower than 5 ng/mL were 
still observed in plasma up to 3 to 6 hours after administration of the highest doses of 325 and 390 mg fosnetupitant. Concentrations of netupitant released from its pro- drug raised 
progressively in plasma after IV fosnetupitant administration reaching peak plasma concentrations 0.5 – 0.8 hours after the end of the fosnetupitant infusion. [ 8] 
The recently completed PK study in cancer patients (NEPA -15-19, [10]) showed that 
maximum concentrations of fosnetupitant were achieved at the end of the 30- min IV 
NEPA FDC infusion. Unchanged fosnetupitant disappeared rapidly from the systemic circulation. H alf-an-hour after the end of the infusion, the mean plasma concentration of 
fosnetupitant was less than 1% of the mean end -of-infusion concentration. Netupitant 
maximum concentrations were achieved in most of the patients at the end of the fosnetupitant infusion (median t
max 0.56 h), indicating fast formation of netupitant from 
its pro-drug.  
Netupitant exposure in patients after 260 mg IV fosnetupitant administration as IV NEPA FDC was similar to that reported in healthy volunteers after a single 260 mg IV  
fosnetupitant infusion (study PNET-12-23) [ 9]).

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
Netupitant oral administration 
In single dose oral studies conducted with the administration to healthy volunteers, 
measurable plasma netupitant concentrations were detected between 45 minutes and 3 hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations followed a first order absorption process and reached C
max in approximately 5 hours. [ 6] 
1.3.2.2  Distribution  
The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of netupitant in humans generally ranged from 850 L to over 2000 L, indicating substantial distribution to tissues. The drug is highly 
bound to plasma proteins (> 99%) with apparently no large differences in free fraction between healthy subjects and patients with hepatic failure.  [6] 
1.3.2.3  Metabolism  
Netupitant is primarily excreted via hepatic/biliary routes, with renal clearance (CLr) accounting for less than 5% of CL. Netupitant is metabolized by CYP3A4 to several 
metabolites. The PK of a single 300 mg dose of netupitant were not affected by co -
administration of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin (500 mg) or midazolam (7.5mg). However, netupitant appears to inhibit the metabolism of both these substrates, r esulting 
in an increase in exposure of erythromycin and midazolam proving that netupitant inhibits CYP3A4. Other CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6) are not inhibited by netupitant. Netupitant is not an inducer of any CYP450 isoform including CYP2C9. In human liver microsomes, netupitant competitively inhibited the CYP3A4 
mediated hydroxylation of testosterone and midazolam (apparent Ki of 1.1 and 2.2 µM, 
respectively). Therefore, interactions of netupitant with drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 we re evaluated, in addition to other agents likely to be co -administered with 
netupitant, in the treatment of highly or moderately emetogenic CINV. [ 8] 
A possible interaction between dexamethasone (when given in a conventional dosing regimen) and netupitant was investigated in humans. An increase in the mean plasma concentrations of dexamethasone in the presence of orally administered netupitant was shown. This increase suggests that dexamethasone doses need to be reduced when given with netupitant. [ 8, 11] 
For interaction between dexamethasone and IV administered fosnetupitant, reference is made to Section  1.3.3 Clinical Data  (PNET-13-63 [12]). 
Four metabolites have been identified in human plasma at netupitant doses ≥ 30mg; metabolites M1, M2, and M3 are considered major metabolites. In a human radio- labeled 
ADME study on oral netupitant, M1, M2 and M3 accounted for 29%, 14% and 33%, respectively, of total plasma radioactivity exposure (AUC). Exposure for M4 accounted for <10% of the parent. Median t
max for metabolite M2 was 5 hours and was about 17-32 
hours for M1 and M3. Oral netupitant and its 3 major metabolites are extensively bound (> 97%) to plasma protein and all metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically active.

Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
1.3.2.4  Elimination  
The mean apparent terminal half -life of fosnetupitant ranges from 0.4 (at 65 mg 
fosnetupitant) to 1.2 hours (at 390 mg fosnetupitant).  
The apparent mean elimination half -life of netupitant generally ranged from 30 to 
approximately 100 hours (for oral doses of 30 mg to 450 mg). There was a slightly supra -
proportional increase in C max and AUC parameters for doses from 10 mg to 300 mg with 
dose proportional increases between 300 mg and 450 mg. No trends of CL or Vd changes 
were seen with increases in dose. [8] 
1.3.3 Clinical Data  
1.3.3.1  Fosnetupitant  
Fosnetupitant has been tested in human volunteers in two studies. The first study (PNET -
12-23 [9]) assessed the safety of IV fosnetupitant and determined the dose of IV 
fosnetupitant yielding equivalent exposure (in terms of netupitant AUC) as 300 mg oral 
netupitant from the oral NEPA FDC. PK data of fosnetupitant, netupitant and its metabolites M1, M2 and M3 in humans as well as safety data following IV fosnetupitant infusion at increasing doses and infusion rates were obtained. The second study (PNET -
13-63 [12]) evaluated the potential drug -drug interaction between netupitant from the 
infused pro- drug fosnetupitant and oral dexamethasone. This study was performed to 
determine the dosing of dexamethasone when co -administered with the IV NEPA FDC.  
Two studies have been performed in humans with fosnetupitant and, because fosnetupitant is rapidly converted to netupitant, an overview of netupitant clinical safety is additionally provided with the data of the two studies hereafter. 
1.3.3.2  Netupitant Alone or in Combination w ith Palonosetron  
The oral formulation of netupitant, as single agent or in combination with other 
compounds including palonosetron, has been investigated in 27 studies; 20 of them were conducted in healthy volunteers. A total of 1,939 subjects received net upitant in 
combination with palonosetron and 206 subjects received oral netupitant alone. [ 6] 
Oral netupitant was generally well tolerated at all dose levels tested . In healthy 
volunteers, the most frequently reported treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) related to 
netupitant alone (not in combination) were headache, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, asthenia, lethargy, diarrhea and abdominal pain. In phase 2 and phase 3 studie s in cancer 
patients, the oral NEPA FDC showed a good safety profile and proved to be effective for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeated courses of MEC and HEC. [ 6] 
In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies leading to oral Akynzeo
® approval, the type, 
frequency and intensity of AEs were comparable across treatment groups. There was no apparent dose -response effect and the safety profile of the oral NEPA FDC was similar to 
that of other dose combinations, to that of palonosetron alone and to that of aprepitant in combination with ondansetron or palonosetron (comparators in the Phase 2 and 3 studies). The re were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters. No

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
clinically significant changes in vital signs were reported across all studies. All data 
regarding electrocardiograms (ECGs) and QT intervals suggest no clinically relevant effects for QT prolongation in the Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies and in a thorough 
QTc study.  
Further details are provided in the in the current IB of oral NEPA FDC [ 6]. 
A recently completed phase 3, active -controlled, double -blind, randomized, multi -cycle 
safety study assessed IV NEPA FDC versus oral NEPA FDC in more than 400 cancer patients receiving HEC who were chemotherapy -naïve at study entry (NEPA -15-18, 
[13]). Study patients were allowed to receive the study drug in up to 4 consecutive 
repeated chemotherapy cycles. Study results confirmed the good safety profile and the satisfactory antiemetic efficacy of IV NEPA FDC in cancer patients receiving HEC.  
An additional 36 chemotherapy -naïve or non- naïve cancer patients undergoing HEC were 
treated wi th IV NEPA FDC in an open label, single cycle, PK study (NEPA -15-19, [10]). 
The study confirmed the good safety profile of IV NEPA FDC.  
1.4 Conclusions  
Based on clinical and nonclinical data, the safety profile of the IV NEPA FDC product in humans was shown to be similar to that of oral NEPA FDC. 
1.5 Study Rationale  
5-HT
3 and NK 1 receptor antagonists are among the drugs of choice for an optimal 
antiemetic prophylaxis in cancer patients undergoing emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. 
The concomitant use of these agents is currently recommended for patients receiving chemotherapy of high emetic risk, and recent NCCN version 2. 2017 guidelines classify 
the combination of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide in patients with breast cancer as highly emetogenic [7].  
As mentioned, Helsinn recently completed a development program where the safety and tolerability of IV NEPA FDC was demonstrated in a phase 3 study in cancer patients receiving HEC in repeated chemotherapy cycles (NEPA -15-18). Despite various HEC 
regimens being allowed in this study, the majority of patients received cisplatin based chemotherapy.  
Given that according to NCCN guidelines, prevention of AC chemotherapy -induced 
nausea and vomiting also calls for treatment with 5 -HT
3 + NK1 receptor antagonist prior 
to chemotherapy administration, NEPA -17-05 study is now performed with the aim to 
assess the safety and describe the efficacy of IV NEPA FDC formulation in the AC chemotherapy setting.  
The dose of fosnetupitant and palonosetron to be used in the present study is the same as administered in the pivotal phase 3, double- blind, active -controlled, randomized, repeated 
cycle safety study NEPA -15-18 in cancer patients receiving HEC, as well as in the open 
label PK study in HEC cancer patients  NEPA-15-19.  
The present study will evaluate the safety and describe the efficacy of IV NEPA FDC (fosnetupitant/palonosetron, 260 mg/0.25 mg), given as a 30- minute infusion, in

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
comparison with oral NEPA FDC (netupitant/palonosetron, 300 mg/0.5 mg), given as one 
capsule. Target population is female breast cancer patients, who are naïve to moderately or highly emetogenic antineoplastic agents and are scheduled to receive at least 4 cycles of an AC chemotherapy regimen starting on Day 1. In addition to the or al or IV 
combination, study patients will also receive a regimen of oral dexamethasone as part of the anti-emetic treatment on study Day 1 of each cycle. Similar to the design of NEPA -
15-18, patients will be allowed to receive the study drug in up to 4 consecutive AC 
chemotherapy cycles.  
This study also includes exploratory assessment of the impact of dosing IV NEPA FDC and oral NEPA FDC products on resource utilization and economics.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a s ingle IV dose of fosnetupitant/palonosetron 
(260 mg/0.25 mg) combination administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion with oral 
dexamethasone on Day 1 for the prevention of AC chemotherapy -induced nausea and 
vomiting in initial and repeated cycles.  
2.2 Secondary  
To describe the efficacy of a single IV dose of fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 
mg) combination (IV NEPA FDC)  administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion versus a 
single oral dose of netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) combination (oral NEPA 
FDC) administered as one capsule, during the acute (0 -24 hours), delayed (>24-120 
hours) and overall (0- 120 hours) phases of initial and repeated cycles of AC 
chemotherapy.  
2.3 Exploratory  
To evaluate the impact on economics and resource utilization through collection of Health Economics Outcomes Research (HEOR) parameters in initial and repeated cycles of AC chemotherapy.

3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
Time-related efficacy study parameters assessment will start at “time 0” defined as the 
start time of the AC chemotherapy administration on Day 1 of each cycle.  
Efficacy parameters will be evaluated at each cycle in the acute, delayed and overall 
phases (time intervals 0 to 24 hours, >24 to 120 hours and 0 to 120 hours after the start of 
the AC chemotherapy administration, respectively), if not otherwise noted. 
The efficacy endpoints are defined as follows: 
• The proportion of patients with CR (defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue 
medication) during the acute, delayed and overall phases; 
• the proportion of patients with no emetic episodes during the acute, delayed and 
overall phases;  
• the proportion of patients with no rescue medication during the acute, delayed and 
overall phases;  
• the proportion of patients with no nausea (defined as maximum nausea intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) < 5mm) during the acute, delayed and overall 
phases; 
• the proportion of patients with no significant nausea (de fined as maximum nausea 
intensity on a 100-mm VAS < 25mm) during the acute, delayed and overall phases; 
• the severity of nausea (defined as the maximum nausea intensity on the 100- mm 
VAS) in the acute, delayed and overall phases;  
• the proportion of patients with no impact on daily life (NIDL) activities in the overall 
phase of Cycle 1 and 2, only as assessed by the Functional Living Index -Emesis 
(FLIE) questionnaire. NIDL is defined as a score greater than 108 points, 54 points, 
and 6 points for total FLIE sc ore, domain score, and single item score, respectively;  
• the domain (nausea and vomiting) FLIE scores and the total FLIE score in the overall 
phase of Cycle 1 and 2, only. 
3.2 Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed in each Study Cycle, primarily by means of  treatment -emergent 
AEs. See Section  8 ADVERSE EVENTS  for specific definitions. 
Additionally, t he assessment of safety will be based on:  
• Physical examination (PE)  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory assessments ( hematology and blood chemistry) 
3.3 Health Economics Outcome Research (HEOR) Assessments  
The following exploratory HEOR assessments will be obtained:  
• Emergency Department (ED), Inpatient Admissions (IP) and length of stay (LOS)  
 
Page 47 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
• Lost work time and productivity assessed by the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire (Cycles 1 and 2 only) 
• Disruptions in initiation and dosing of intended next cycle of chemotherapy  
Additional data collected from patient diary or electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) 
may also be used for HEOR -related analysis. All parameters of interest, endpoints and 
analysis methods will be specified in a separate Health Economics Analysis Plan.

4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
Multicenter, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, parallel group, stratified study 
assessing the safety and describing the efficacy of a single dose of IV 
fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) infusion versus oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) combination; each administered with oral dexamethasone prior to initial 
and repeated cycles of AC chemotherapy in female breast cancer patients.  
The study is planned to be performed in approximately 50 investigational sites in the US and in approximately 30 sites distributed in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia. If necessary, additional sites and countries may be involved as well. 
The present study will include female patients naïve to moderately or highly emetogenic 
antineoplastic agents (see secti on below). Adult female patients satisfying this naivety 
criterion, diagnosed with breast cancer and requiring treatment with an AC based chemotherapy regimen on Day 1, will be considered for enrollment in this study. 
Eligible patients, stratified by regio n (US, non- US) and age class (age < 55 years, age ≥ 
55 years), will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 fashion to receive one of the two treatment 
regimens (IV fosnetupitant/palonosetron 260 mg/0.25 mg administered as a 30- minute IV 
infusion [test] or oral netupitant/palonosetron 300 mg/0.5 mg combination) [control], before the start of AC chemotherapy on study Day 1 of Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, patients will continue with the same study treatment they received in Cycle 1, while the dosage and components of the AC regimens administered in the repeated cycles may be different compared to Cycle 1, provided the regimen remains classified as AC. 
4.1.1 Definition of naïve / non- naïve patients to moderately or highly 
emetogenic antineoplastic agent  
Protocol Appendix 1 provides a list of oral and IV antineoplastic agents divided into 4 
groups considering their emetogenic potential based on NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in  Oncology [ 7]. 
A patient is considered “naïve to moderately or highly emetogenic antineoplastic agents” based on protocol  Appendix 1 if she was never previously treated with any of 
the antineoplastic agents listed in  Appendix 1 that fall within the high or moderate 
emetogenic levels for IV medications or that fall in the moderate to high emetogenic levels for oral medications. Previous antineoplastic treatment categorized as low or minimal emetogenic levels will be permitted.  
4.2 Study Duration  
Each randomized patient is planned to participate in a maximum of 4 consecutive AC chemotherapy cycles assessed in this study.  
For each cycle, the study will include a screening visit (Visit 1) up to 7 days (up to 14 days for Cycle 1 only) before study drug administration (Day 1, Visit 2). After receiving 
 
Page 49 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
a single dose of active treatment on Day 1, patients will enter an efficacy evaluation 
period of 120 hours and then return to the clinical site on Day 6 (+2) for Visit 3. Patients will undergo a follow -up visit or  telephone call (Visit 4) either on Day 15 (+3 days) or 
Day 22 (±3 days), depending on the next chemotherapy cycle schedule (this Visit 4 will 
be considered as the end of  each “Study Cycle”). Visit  4, or the corresponding telephone  
contact, either on Day 15 (+3 days) or on Day  22 (±3 days) is to be performed prior to 
administering the chemotherapy relevant to the next cycle and prior to any further moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic treatment administration.  
Total number of visits per patient: For each cycle, there will be a maximum of 4 visits or 
3 visits plus 1 telephone contact. For all cycles, the screening visit and the study drug administration visit can be performed on the same day. The screening visit of a subsequent cycle can also coincide with the follow -up visit of the previous cycle. If all 
these visits are merged, Visit 4 of the previous cycle as well as Visit 1 and Visit 2 of the next cycle are all three performed on the same day. Therefore,  actual number of visits in 
repeated cycles will depend on the number of combined visits. 
Total number of cycles per patient:  Each patient may participate in a maximum of 4 
consecutive chemotherapy cycles, as long as they continue to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion c riteria for the repeated cycles and as long as the study remains open (see 
below for details). 
Maximum total study duration per patient is approximately 14 weeks. This maximum 
total study duration per patient is based on the assumption that the patient par ticipates in 
4 consecutive study cycles with 21 days interval between the Day 1 of two consecutive cycles, and that follow -up visits of one cycle coincide with screening visits of the 
subsequent cycle. A minimum of 14 days and maximum of 35 days is allowed between 
the Day 1 of two consecutive cycles. 
A total of 400 patients will be randomized.  Study drug assignment for Cycles 2 to 4 will be closed 7 days after the last (400
th) patient is randomized, in order to permit patients 
already screened for a subseq uent study cycle to be administered study drug. Patients still 
participating in the study at this time should complete their current cycle and will not be allowed to enter in a subsequent cycle. 
A patient will be defined as having completed a Study Cycle i f she completes the follow -
up visit (Visit 4) of that cycle.  
A patient will be defined as “completed” if she completes Visit 4 (either as on -site visit or 
telephone contact) of Cycle 4. A patient will be defined as “completed cycle, not 
continuing” if she  completes Visit 4 (either as on -site visit or telephone contact) of any 
cycle before Cycle 4 without continuing in the subsequent cycle. Study termination at a different time point other than Visit 4 of any cycle (including screening visit for one of the repeated cycles) will be considered as premature study discontinuation. 
The overall study completion date is defined as the date of last patient’s last visit or telephone contact.

5.3 Treatment Groups  
Patients eligible for the study will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio, stratified by region 
and age class) to one of the two treatment groups: 
Group 1 / Test group – IV fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) combination (IV 
NEPA FDC) administered as a 30 -minute infusion of a 50 mL solution on Day 1 of each 
cycle. 
Group 2 / Control group – oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.50 mg) (oral NEPA 
FDC) on Day 1 of each cycle. Oral dexamethasone (12 mg) will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle to both test and 
control groups. 
5.4 Dose and Administration 
Test drug:  The 30-minute (+/- 5 minutes) IV NEPA FDC infusion will start 30 minutes 
prior to the start of AC chemotherapy administration at each cycle. The IV infusion will 
be completed before starting chemotherapy administration.  
To minimize the loss of investigational medicinal product (IMP) remaining in the 
infusion line after the end of IMP infusion, the following process is to be followed: 
1. At the end of the 30 +/ -5 min IMP or placebo infusion, the infusion line drip 
chamber is to be empty.  
2. The Investigator or designated responsible person will ensure completeness of IV infusion administration by rinsing the infusion line with 20 to 30 ml sterile 5% glucose solution or sterile 0.9% saline solution. Calcium or magnesium containing solutions (e.g., Lactated Ringer solution, etc) are not allowed. The infusion line rinsing process is to be performed immediately after the end of IMP or placebo infusion and is to be completed before to start the AC chemotherapy administration.  
Control drug:  Oral NEPA FDC (Akynzeo
®) capsule will be administered 60 minutes 
prior to the start of AC chemotherapy administration at each cycle.  
For blinding purposes, the double -dummy technique will be applied. Patients will be 
administered with placebos for test and control drugs, as applicabl e (see Section 5.10 
Blinding). 
Additional non-investigational study drug (administered to both treatment groups):  
Oral dexamethasone administration will be performed in open fashion since dose and 
schedule are identical between test and control treatments.  
On Day 1 of each cycle, oral dexamethas one (3 tablets of 4 mg, for a total dose of 12 mg) 
will be taken 30 minutes prior to the start of the AC chemotherapy administration (immediately before the start of the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion).

Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
5.5 Packaging and Shipment  
The IMPs will be provided in a sealed, blinded and appropriately labeled study kit. Each 
study kit is patient-specific and will provide the necessary supply for one study cycle. 
Each study treatment kit will contain: 
• 1 capsule of oral treatment (oral NEPA FDC capsule or matching plac ebo capsule)  
• 1 vial for IV treatment (IV NEPA FDC or matching placebo vial) with lyophilized 
powder 
• 3 blistered dexamethasone 4 mg tablets  
• 1 container with 50 ml 5% glucose solution for infusion  
• 1 single use plastic device for reconstitution process (Ecoflac® Connect)  
The infusion line and the infusion line rinsing solution (either 5% glucose or 0.9% saline 
solution) will not be provided in the study kit. 
Sealed treatment kits, all identical in appearance and identified by a kit number, will be 
supplied i n a blinded fashion. The first kit will be assigned to the patient at the time of 
randomization, after confirmation of eligibility criteria, by the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). At each subsequent cycle, the IWRS will automatically allocate to th e 
patient a kit of the same treatment group.  
Study kits may be either manufactured with single panel label in English only for exclusive use in US, or with multilanguage booklet labels intended for use in any of the study countries.  
The study drugs and their placebos will be identical in color, smell, size and appearance 
thereby enabling a double-blind design.  
The treatment kit’s outer box and all components contained will carry a label with the 
information in accordance with applicable rules.  
Study kit packaging will be performed by Catalent Germany Schorndorf GmbH. Local 
depots under control of Catalent will be considered for storage and distribution of the study kits to the sites in US, Russia, and Ukraine, while drug will be directly deliver ed 
from Catalent Schorndorf to Georgian sites. 
The study kits, together with relevant documentation, will be supplied from the depots  to 
a designated pharmacist at the hospital site or directly to the Investigator or designee, as applicable.  
Relevant labels will carry a removable portion (peel-off) to be applied on study records in order to certify the correct distribution, preparation and administration of the study drugs.  
The hospital pharmacist or a designated responsible person from the site staff wil l be 
requested at each cycle to select the IWRS -determined study kit, prepare and provide the 
study drugs and other materials to the Investigator or designee. At the time of preparing 
the study drug for dispensing to the Investigator or designee, the pharm acist or designated 
responsible person will fill in the blank space on the relevant label with the patient 
number appearing on the IWRS randomization confirmation.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
All the necessary detailed information relative to the characteristics of the study drugs, 
their receipt, storage, preparation, administration and return is reported on the Study Drug Manual that will be provided to the sites prior to the start of the study. 
5.6 Storage  
The study drug will be delivered and stored between 2 and 8°C (between 35.6 and 
46.4°F), in a secure area with limited access and protected from direct light. At the study site, the designated responsible person for storage of the investigational product (the site pharmacist or the Investigator or a designee) should also make sure tha t study drugs are 
kept separately from the other medications available on site and in no circumstance should be mixed up with any other medications used at the trial site.  
5.7 Drug Depots  
The study kits are shipped from the Catalent central depot of Schorndorf  (Germany) to 
local depots and, from there to the study sites. The study kits will be stored at the local depots until shipments to the investigational sites are triggered via IWRS.  
5.8 Accountability  
Once the study kits are received at the study site, the pharmacist or designated responsible person will sign the drug receipt form and notify via IWRS the clinical supplies receipt. Adequate records of the receipt, dispensation and return of study kits must be maintained throughout the study. Used study kits will  be retained until the drug 
accountability forms have been checked by a designated monitor. Unused study kits remaining at investigational sites at the end of the study will be destroyed by returning to the drug depots or using a local vendor for disposal. At the end of the study, delivery 
records will be reconciled with those of used and returned stocks. Any discrepancy will be accounted for. Destruction of unused medication will be documented in writing according to FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) regu lation 21CFR312.59, ICH Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and the drug depot Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Any destruction of remaining study medication material by the study sites is to be first approved in writing by the study Sponsor.  
5.9 Administration  of Study Treatment 
At Day 1 (Visit 2) of Cycle 1, after confirming patient’s eligibility, the Investigator or 
designee will get connected to the IWRS to randomize the patient. The IWRS will assign a kit number to the patient and the Investigator (or Inves tigator’s designee) will receive 
the IWRS notification mentioning the kit number assigned to the patient for which the request was made. The hospital pharmacist, or designated responsible person, will select from the study kits stored at the site pharmacy the corresponding kit as indicated by the 
IWRS and fill -in the blank space(s) on the outer study kit label with the patient’s 
identification number which was assigned by IWRS during screening.  
In the case the pharmacist or designated responsible person is  only involved in the site 
storage of the study kits but not in the preparation of the investigational products, the 
pharmacist or designated responsible person will:

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
• select the study kit 
• fill in the outer study kit box label with the patient identificatio n number 
• document the selection and distribution of the entire and still sealed kit to the 
Investigator or Investigator’s designee for preparation by attaching the outer study kit 
box label peel -off onto the Study Drug Inventory log.  
In the case the pharm acist or designated responsible is involved in both the site storage of 
the study kits and in the preparation of the investigational products, the pharmacist or designated responsible person will: 
• select the study kit 
• fill in the outer study kit box label and the peel -off portions from the other study kit 
components with the patient identification number 
• document the selected kit by attaching the filled in outer study kit box label peel- off 
onto the Study Drug Inventory Log 
• open the kit and prepare the investigational products as detailed in the Study Drug 
Manual documenting the preparation by completing and attaching the study drug (or 
placebo) vial peel -off label onto the Study Drug Preparation & Administration Log 
• provide the ready to use study medication to the Investigator or designated person.  
The IV infusion prepared by the pharmacist or designated person (or Investigator’s designee) is to be kept at room temperature, protected from direct sunlight and is to be administered within 3 hours from end of preparation (reconstitution process). The end time of preparation and the end time of infusion are to be considered with respect to this requirement.  
Once the IV study drug (or placebo) and the wallet with oral study drug (oral Akynzeo
® 
or placebo capsule)  and dexamethasone tablets are ready, they will be provided to the 
Investigator or designee for patient’s administration.  
At each subsequent cycle (Cycles 2 to 4), the Investigator or designee will get connected 
to the IWRS to obtain a kit number for the repeated cycle and the same above described 
procedure will apply. 
Adequate written instructions (in form of a Study Drug Manual) for use for the 
pharmacist or designated person will be provided to him/her for the preparation of the study medication at each  study site.  
The relevant labels on the study drug will be filled in according to the provided instructions.

Administration process and relevant times:  
One (1) capsule of blinded study drug (either of netupitant/palonosetron combination or 
matching placeb o) is to be taken with a glass of non carbonated water 60 minutes prior to 
the scheduled start of AC chemotherapy administration on Day 1. 
Thirty minutes prior to the scheduled AC chemotherapy administration start, the 
3 dexamethasone tablets (each containing 4 mg dexamethasone) are also to be taken by the patients with a glass of non carbonated water.  
Immediately after the administration of the oral dexamethasone on Day 1, the 30- minute 
(+/- 5 minutes) blinded IV infusion (either of fosnetupitant/palonosetron combination or 
matching placebo) solution will be started.  The IV NEPA FDC or placebo vial content, previously reconstituted with 50 mL glucose 
5% solution for IV infusion, will be started as a 30- minute (+/- 5 minutes) infusion.  
At the end of the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion, the Investigator or designated person will ensure that the infusion line drip chamber is empty. The Investigator or responsible person will then immediately proceed with rinsing the infusion line with 20 to 30 ml of sterile 5% glucose solution (or sterile 0.9% saline solution), to ensure 
complete administration of the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion. Calcium or magnesium containing solutions (i.e., Lactated Ringer solution, etc) are not allowed. The infusion line rinsing process is to be completed before to start the AC administration.  
The infusion of the scheduled AC chemotherapy will then be started immediately after 
the infusion line rinsing process is completed, and the starting time of AC will be considered as “time 0” for the antiemetic efficacy assessments (see Section  7.1 Efficacy 
Assessments).  
The administration of the AC components is to be performed according to local standard practice. 
Treatment administration schedules in chronological order and inclusive of the allowed time windows are provided below, including the infusion line rinsi ng process. For all 
time windows, reference is made to the start of AC chemotherapy infusion.

the end of IMP or placebo infusion and is to be completed before the start of AC administration.  
5.10 Blinding 
The blinding of the study drugs is guaranteed by the use of identical placebos to the 
respective active drugs (double -dummy technique). 
5.10.1 Emergency Unblinding Procedure  
The Investigator has the possibility to unblind the study treatment in case of an 
emergency situation, when he/she considers essential to know what treatments the patient has received. Any unblinding of the study treatment will be performed by IWRS (24 -hour 
7-day coverage). If the code is broken by the Investigator, the patient should be 
discontinued from the study. The date and reason for unblinding are included in eCRF. The IWRS will promptly notify, in a blinded fashion, the Sponsor and the CRO Clinical Monitor when a treatment code has been unblinded by the Investigator. 
The unblinding procedure is described in detail in a specific docume nt (IWRS User 
Manual) that will be provided separately to the Investigator. 
5.11 Randomization - Use of IWRS  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in assigning treatments to patients. 
Randomization tends to produce treatment groups in which the distributions of prognostic 
 
Page 63 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
factors, known and unknown, are similar; it also enhances the validity and the efficiency 
of statistical comparisons between the treatment groups.  
Treatment assignment will be managed through a static central blocked randomization 
stratified by region (US, non- US) and age class (age < 55 years, age ≥ 55 years).  
Randomization scheme will be reproducible and will be prepared prior to start of the study via a computerized system by the IWRS vendor. A master randomization list copy will be filed  securely by this vendor and the Sponsor in a manner that ensures that 
blindness is properly maintained throughout the trial. The biostatistician involved in the creation of randomization lists will not take part in any study activities.  
Considering the st rata, eligible patients will be assigned to one of the two arms, in a 
balanced ratio (1:1), according to specific procedures using the IWRS.  
Separate lists (packaging list and patient’s randomization list) will be prepared for 
patients’ randomization and study medication packaging. Sealed cartons (kits) containing the study medications will be prepared according to the packaging list. An appropriate amount of treatment kits will be supplied to the designated person at the investigational sites at the begin ning of the study, with further re -supplies scheduled once the number of 
available treatment kits decrease to a pre- set threshold at each site.  
At Day 1 (Visit 2) of Cycle 1, after confirmation of patient eligibility, the Investigator will get connected to  the IWRS for randomization and communicate to the system the 
unique patient identification number (assigned by IWRS at the screening visit) and the 
patient’s date of birth.   
The system will then assign to the patient the treatment that corresponds to the  first free 
treatment available in the relevant list and the IWRS will randomly select a kit number 
among the kits available at the site and containing the selected treatment. The IWRS notification form will be sent by e -mail to the Investigator, describin g the kit number to 
be dispensed to the patient. The unique patient identification number, the kit number assigned to the patient, the patient randomization number as well as the other patient characteristics, are stored in the system. In particular, the p atient randomization number 
is stored in the system but is not communicated to the Investigator. The randomization procedure only proceeds if kits of both treatments are available at site.  
The hospital pharmacist or designated responsible person will select the appropriate 
carton of study medication based on the kit number supplied by the IWRS.  
Relevant carton box peel -off label from the selected study kit will be attached to the 
Study Drug Inventory Log by the pharmacist or designated person to document the 
correct kit’s assignment. The peel -off labels from the other study kit component will then 
be applied on the Study Drug Preparation & Administration log by the Investigator as a 
proof that the correct medication has been prepared and administered to the patient.  
On Day 1 of each repeated cycle (i.e., Cycles 2 to 4), the Investigator will get connected to the IWRS to access the kit number to be assigned to the patient (i.e., a kit containing the same treatment as assigned in the first cycle will be automatically selected). An IWRS form will be sent by the system to the Investigator, communicating the selected kit number for the repeated cycle.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol 
  
 
Due to the blinded study design, neither the Sponsor, nor the pharmacist, the Investigator, 
the patient or the Contract Research Organization ( CRO) will know which treatment is 
administered. The monitor who will check the drug accountability forms (the Study Drug Inventory Log with the peel -off from the carton box attached by the pharmacist and the 
Study Drug Preparation & Administration log with the peel- offs attached by the 
Investigator) will also be blinded with regard to the treatment administered.  
The Investigator has the possibility to unblind the study treatment in case of an emergency situation, when he/she co nsiders essential to know what treatments the patient 
has received. For details, see Section 5.10.1 Emergency Unblinding Procedure . The 
IWRS will promptly notify, in a blinded fashion, the Sponsor and the CRO Clinical Monitor when a treatment code has been unblinded by the Investigator. 
5.12 Over -dosage  
In the unlikely event of overdose, the patient should be managed with supportive care. In 
case of symptomatic overdose, conservative management of signs and symptoms is advised. No case of over -dosage has been reported with netupitant/palonosetron to date. 
No antidote for palonosetron or netupitant overdose is known. 
5.13 Occupational Safety  
No studies have been performed on the ability to drive vehicles and operate machinery 
while receiving agents being evaluated in this study. If patients experience somnolence or 
tiredness, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.   
5.14 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Information on prior and concomitant medications will be collected beginning 14 days prior to Day 1 of the first cycle up to Visit 4 (Day 15+3 days or Day  22 +/-3 days follow -
up visit) of the last cycle.  
Inclusion / exclusion criteria are to be carefully checked with reference to prohibited medications and relevant time periods. 
5.14.1 Prior and Concomitant Medications for the Prevention of Nausea 
and Vomiting or With Potential Anti -emetic Effect  
With the exception of study medication and planned dexamethasone as per current 
protocol, the use of any medication for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, or to increase the expected preventive effects of the study medication, or any medication with 
potential anti- emetic effects within 24 hours prior to the start of AC chemotherapy 
administration on Day 1 of each cycle and for the following 120 hours is prohibited.  
The list of prohibited medications includes, but is not limited to:  
• 5-HT
3 receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, tropisetron, 
ramosetron, palonosetron) 
• NK1 receptor antagonists (e.g., fosaprepitant, aprepitant, rolapitant or any other new 
drug of this class)

6 STUDY CONDUCT  
6.1 General Instructions  
In this study, each patient may participate in a maximum of 4 consecutive chemotherapy 
cycles. A minimum of 14 days and maximum of 35 days is allowed between the Day 1 of two consecutive cycles.  
Each “Study Cycle” will include Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2 (Day 1 Visit), Visit 3 
(Day 6 +2 days Visit) and Visit 4 follow -up (either as a visit or telephone contact) on Day 
15 (+3 days) or Day 22 (±3 days), depending on the chemotherapy cycle schedule. For all cycles, the screening visit and the study drug administration visit can be performed on the same day. The screening visit of a subsequent cycle can also coincide with the follow -up 
visit of the previous cycle. Therefore, Visit 4 of a previous cycle, as well as Visit 1 and Visit 2 of the next cycle, can all coincide and be performed on the same day.  
The study visits and contacts, and the main activities characterizing them are detailed by visit / contact here below (please, also see the study Flow Chart):  
Cycle 1 
• Visit 1, screening visit up to 14 days prior to Day 1, during which patients will be 
assessed for eligibility;  
• Visit 2, randomization visit at Day 1, during which patients fulfilling selection criteria will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups and will be treated; 
patient diary, FLIE questionnaire and the WPAI questionnaire will be dispensed; 
• Visit 3, routine visit at Day 6 (+2), during which patients will be assessed for 
safety and patient diary and questionnaires will be ret rieved; 
• Visit 4, follow -up visit on Day 15 (+3 days) or on Day 22 (+/ -3 days) on -site or 
phone contact for AEs and concomitant medications data collection; HEOR -
related information on ED/hospitalization will also be collected.  
Cycles 2 to 4 
• Visit 1, screening visit up to 7 days prior to Day 1, during which patients will be 
assessed prior to receiving each repeated cycle of chemotherapy;  
• Visit 2, Day 1, during which patients will be administered the same treatment assigned on Cycle 1 Day 1, patient diary, FLIE questionnaire and the WPAI 
questionnaire will be dispensed at Cycle 2 only; HEOR -related information on 
chemotherapy will also be collected;  
• Visit 3, routine visit at Day 6 (+2), during which patients will be assessed for 
safety and patient diary retrieved; FLIE questionnaire and the WPAI 
questionnaire will be retrieved at Cycle 2 only; 
• Visit 4, follow -up visit on Day 15 (+3 days) or on Day 22 (+/ -3 days) on -site or 
phone contact for AEs and concomitant medications data collection. HEOR -
related inf ormation information on ED/hospitalization will also be collected.

6.2 Study Procedures by Time Point  
6.2.1 Cycle 1 - Visit 1 (screening, Day -14 to Day 1)  
If the Investigator considers a patient to be potentially eligible for the study, written 
informed consent for  participation in the study must be obtained before any study -related 
procedures. The patient will be screened within 14 days prior to randomization and study drug administration; the following procedures will be performed and data collected during this vi sit: 
• Informed consent 
• Eligibility criteria  
• Demographic data (gender, race, date of birth)  
• Alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug consumption 
• Reproductive status 
• Significant medical history, including surgery, based on Investigator assessment. 
• Histologically or  cytologically confirmed breast cancer, including recurrent or 
metastatic (current cancer history)  
• ECOG Performance Status  
• Urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential  
• Prior and concomitant medications 
• Complete physical examination (general a ppearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
skin, neck, lungs, cardiovascular, breast, lymph nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal and neurological) 
• Vital signs (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure after at least 5 minutes 
rest in semi-supine position) 
• Laboratory tests, including hematology and blood chemistry 
• Patient identification number assignment through IWRS  
• AE assessment  
Based on the relevant above mentioned assessments outcome, the Investigator will decide 
if the patient is eligible for the study. 
6.2.2 Cycle 1 - Visit 2 (randomization, Day 1)  
The following procedures will have to be completed: 
• The relevant inclusion / exclusion criteria will be assessed for patient’s eligibility 
confirmation (for details, see Section 4.3.2 Inclusion Criteria  and Section 4.3.3 
Exclusion Criteria ); 
• The patient will undergo pre -dose assessments, incl uding predose vital signs (pulse 
rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure after resting in semi -supine position for at 
least 5 minutes; weight and height);  
• Urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential: in case the screening urine 
pregnancy test was performed less than 24 hours prior to the administration of the 
first (oral capsule) investigational product, the test is not to be repeated at Visit 2); 
After confirmation of patient eligibility, the patient will be randomized to one of the two 
treatment groups using the IWRS.  
Page 70 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
The IWRS will provide the kit number to be dispensed to the patient. The study treatment 
administration schedule is the following (please also refer to Section 5.9 Administration 
of Study Treatment  for relevant time windows): 
• 60 minutes prior to the start of AC chemotherapy infusion, the patient will receive 
1 capsule of study drug (oral Akynzeo®) or matching placebo; 
• 30 minutes prior t o the start of AC chemotherapy infusion, the patient will receive 
3 tablets of 4 mg dexamethasone;  
• immediately after the oral dexamethasone administration (30 minutes prior to the start of AC chemotherapy infusion), the patient will receive a 30- minute (+/- 5 minutes) 
infusion of study drug (IV NEPA FDC) or matching placebo;  
At the end of the IV infusion, and before to start AC administration, the infusion line 
used for the IMP infusion is to be rinsed with 20 to 30 ml sterile 5% glucose solution, or sterile 0.9% saline solution, to ensure complete IMP administration. See details below. 
The date and the precise time (hh:mm) of the study drug (oral capsule) and additional 
study drug administration (dexamethasone tablets) must be recorded in the source records  
as well as on the relevant eCRF page.  
For the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion, start and stop times (including any interruptions and re- start, if applicable) are to be collected.  
The relevant tear -off labels from the study drug kit will be attached to t he Study Drug 
Inventory Log  (by the pharmacist or designated responsible person) and drug 
administration form (by the Investigator) (see Section 5.9 Administration of Study 
Treatment ).  
For the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion, information on the patient’s arm where the infusion will be applied, or any other information regarding  infusion location will also be 
collected in the eCRF.  
Infusion Line rinsing process after the end of IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion:  
The infusion line rinsing at the end of the IMP or placebo infusion is to be performed with 20 to 30 ml of either sterile  5% glucose solution or sterile 0.9% saline solution. 
Calcium or magnesium containing solutions (i.e., Lactated Ringer solution, etc) are not allowed. The line rinsing is to start immediately after the end of the IV NEPA FDC or placebo infusion, following verification that the drip chamber is empty. The rinsing process is aimed at ensuring the complete IMP administration. The infusion line rinsing process is to be completed before to start the AC administration. Confirmation of the performed rinsing process and the type of solution used will be documented in the eCRF.  
• One (1) hour after the administration of the oral capsule, after the end of the 30-
minute (+/- 5 minutes) IV infusion and after completion of the infusion line 
rinsing process, the AC chemothe rapy will be administered to the patient. 
Information on the infusion arm or any other infusion location selected for the 
AC chemotherapy administration will be collected in the eCRF. The starting time of AC administration on Day 1 is the “time 0” for the time related efficacy 
assessments; the starting time of AC administration will be collected in source records and in the eCRF.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
• Before the start of the AC chemotherapy administration, the Investigator will 
provide the patient with the patient’s diary and instruct her on how to complete 
it. The patient will start completing the diary from the start of AC chemotherapy infusion on Day 1 (time 0 for the time related efficacy assessments) and will maintain it through the following 5 days, i.e., until Day 6, 120 hours after the start of AC chemotherapy administration. The patient will be instructed to bring the diary back to the site at Visit 3.  
• Concomitant Medications check and recording. 
• AE assessment.  
• The Investigator will provide the FLIE and WPAI questionnaires to the patient, 
instructing her on how to complete them and reminding the patient to bring the completed questionnaires to Visit 3. 
6.2.3 Cycle 1 - Visit 3 (Day 6 [+2 days])  
This visit is to be planned on Day 6, not earlier than 120 hours after st art of AC 
chemotherapy on Day 1. In the case the visit day would fall during the week end, or in case Visit 3 cannot be performed on Day 6 after the end of the 120 hours period for any reason,
 a +2 days time window is allowed for the execution of this visi t. The patient will 
return to the site to undergo the following study procedures/assessments: 
• Concomitant medications  
• AE assessment  
• Complete physical examination (general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
skin, neck, lungs, cardiovascular, breast, lymph nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal and 
neurological). Any new or worsening of pathological findings noted since previous  examination are to be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF form. 
• Vital signs (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure aft er resting in semi-
supine position for at least 5 minutes) 
• Laboratory tests, including hematology and blood chemistry 
• Check and retrieval of the completed patient diary  
• Check and retrieval of the completed FLIE  
• For HEOR -related assessments:  
o Check and retrieval of the completed WPAI questionnaire  
At this visit, the Investigator will schedule Visit 4 (follow -up Visit), either as on site visit 
or telephone contact. Visit 4, follow -up visit, is to be performed either on Day 15 +3 days 
or on Day 22+/-3 days, depending on the next chemotherapy cycle schedule. The 
patient’s follow -up visit or contact is to be performed prior to administering the 
chemotherapy relevant to the next cycle and prior to any further moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic treatment administration.  
If, for any reason, no further chemotherapy cycle is planned, Visit 4 follow -up should be 
performed on Day 22 (+3 days).

6.2.4 Cycle 1 - Visit 4 (follow -up visit, Day 15 [+3 days] or Day 22 ( ± 3 
days])  
Visit 4, follow -up visit, can be performed either as on site visit or telephone contact.  
During Visit 4, the patient will be questioned about any new AEs appeared since the last 
visit or about any ongoing AE at last visit; concomitant medications, either new or ongoing will be verified and relevant data collected. For HEOR -related assessments, 
ED/IP/LOS information for events occurring since Day 1 will be documented. 
The follow-up visit for Cycle 1 and the screening visit for Cycle 2 may coincide. 
6.2.5 Cycles 2 to 4 - Visit 1 (screeni ng, Day -7 to Day 1)  
If the Investigator considers a patient to be suitable to continue the subsequent cycle of 
AC chemotherapy in the study, the patient will be re -assessed within 7 days prior to Day 
1 of the subsequent (repeated) cycle: inclusion/exclusion criteria verification, complete physical examination, ECOG performance status, vital signs, and laboratory tests will be performed as for Visit 1 of Cycle 1. Females of childbearing potential will have to perform a urine pregnancy test.  
The study Visit 1 may be performed f rom Day -7 up to study Day 1 inclusive (i.e., Visit 1 
and Visit 2 may occur on the same day on study Day 1). In that case, the assessments 
planned at both Visit 1 and Visit 2 have to be performed only once. In addition, the follow-up visit of one cycle and the screening visit of the subsequent cycle may coincide. 
6.2.6 Cycles 2 to 4 - Visit 2 (Day 1)  
After patient has been re -evaluated for eligibility, the Investigator will get connected to 
the IWRS for the assignment of a new treatment kit number. The patient wi ll be 
administered the same treatment assigned at Cycle 1 (Day 1, Visit 2). The procedures to 
be completed are the same as for Cycle 1 (Day 1, Visit 2), except for (a) randomization, i.e., for repeated cycles IWRS will only provide a new kit number for the  patient, 
according to the patient’s randomization at Cycle 1, and (b) the FLIE questionnaire and the WPAI questionnaire will be dispensed in Cycle 2, but not in Cycle 3 or Cycle 4. In addition, starting at Cycle 2 Visit 2 (Day 1), the Investigator will do cument if changes in 
chemotherapy administration from the previous cycle occurred and will note any delays in treatment for the current cycle.  
6.2.7 Cycles 2 to 4 - Visit 3 (Day 6 [+2 days])  
On Day 6 (+2), the patient will return to the site and will undergo the same study procedures/assessments as for Visit 3 of Cycle 1. However, the FLIE questionnaire and the WPAI questionnaire will not be administered during Cycle 3 and Cycle 4.

6.2.8 Cycles 2 to 4 - Visit 4 (follow -up visit, Day 15 [+3 days] or Day 22 
(± 3 days])  
Visit 4, the follow -up visit, can be performed either as on site visit or telephone contact, 
and the patient will undergo the same study procedures/assessments as for Visit 4 of 
Cycle 1. 
The follow -up visit of one cycle and the screening visit of the subs equent cycle may 
coincide. 
6.3 Definition of Study Completion 
A patient will be defined as having completed a Study Cycle if she completes the follow -
up visit (Visit 4) of that cycle.  
A patient will be defined as “completed” if she completes Visit 4 (either a s on-site visit or 
telephone contact) of Cycle 4. A patient will be defined as “completed cycle, not 
continuing” if she completes Visit 4 (either as on- site visit or telephone contact) of any 
cycle before Cycle 4 without continuing in the subsequent cycle. Study termination at a 
different time point other than Visit 4 of any cycle (including screening visit for one of the repeated cycles) will be considered as premature study discontinuation . 
Overall study end date is defined as the date of last patient’s l ast visit or telephone 
contact. 
6.4 Premature Discontinuation  
Patients may discontinue the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
1. An AE occurs that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes it unsafe for the patient 
to continue in the study. 
2. The patient is lost to follow -up. 
3. The patient dies.  
4. The patient withdraws consent. 
5. The Investigator, for any reason, terminates his/her participation in the study, or terminates the study for that patient; or the attending physician requests that the patient be withdrawn for any medical reason.  
6. The Sponsor or the Regulatory Authorities or the Ethics Committee(s), for any reason, terminates the entire study, or terminates the study for this trial site or this particular patient.  
Additionally to the above mentioned reasons, patients who successfully completed any of the study cycles may not continue to a subsequent study cycle for any of the following reasons: 
• The patient is unwilling to participate in further chemotherapy cycles.  
• The patient is no longer scheduled to receive any additional chemotherapy. 
Page 74 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
• The inclusion/exclusion criteria are no more satisfied for performing a repeated cycle  
• The whole study is closed as per protocol definition. 
If a patient is discontinued from the study after treatment with the investigational 
medicinal product, the Investigator must try his/her best to contact the patient 15  days 
after Day 1 of the last performed cycle in view of completing the study safety assessment by collecting information that may be suggestive of AEs.  
Patients discontinued after randomization will not be replaced.

7 METHODS OF ASSESSMEN T 
7.1 Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy evaluations will be primarily based on the patients’ documentation of emetic 
episodes (episodes of retching or vomiting), intake of rescue medication  and nausea 
severity assessed daily by VAS during the period from 0 to 120 hours after the start of the AC chemotherapy administration on Day 1 of each cycle . To collect these data, a patient 
paper diary covering the 0- 120 hours period after the start of AC chemotherapy, will be 
used. 
In addition FLIE questionnaire covering the 5 days after start of AC chemotherapy will 
be collected during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 only. 
Given the precisely defined starting timepoint for the efficacy assessment period ( i.e., the 
starting time of AC administration on Day 1) and the duration of such period (120 hours), 
the starting time and date of the AC chemotherapy infusion are to be carefully and precisely collected in the eCRF and reported on the patient diary to remi nd patient the 
correct time -frame of data to be collected in the diary.  
The date of AC chemotherapy administration will determine study Day 1 and the starting time of its administration will define the study “time 0” for the assessment of time -related 
efficacy parameters.  
Efficacy parameters will be evaluated in the overall, acute and delayed phases (time intervals 0 to 120 hours, 0 to 24 hours and >24 to 120 hours after the start of the AC chemotherapy administration, respectively). 
For the detailed descr iption of the efficacy endpoints see Section 3.1 Efficacy Endpoints .  
7.1.1 Emetic Episodes  
An emetic episode is defined as one or more continuous vomits (expulsion of stomach 
contents through the mouth) or retches (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Emetic episodes are considered distinct if separated by absence of vomiting and retching for at least 1 minute. All patients will be asked to document in the patient diary all details about their emetic episodes occurring during the 120 hours after the start of AC chemotherapy ad ministration.  
These details will include: - Each episode of retching or vomiting  
- Date of each retching or vomiting episode 
- Exact time of onset of each retching or vomiting episode. 
Each emetic episode, as well as date and time of occurrence, will then be d ocumented on 
the eCRF in accordance with the patient diary records.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
7.1.2 Rescue Therapy  
Rescue medication is defined in Section 5.15 Rescue Medication . 
Rescue medication will be permitted on an as -needed basis. The pat ient will record in the 
patient diary the drug name, dosage and date/time of intake for each medication taken for 
the treatment of nausea and vomiting during the 0- 120 hour interval (Day 1 to Day 5). 
Each rescue medication trade or generic name, dosage and  route of administration, as 
well as the time and date of intake, will then be documented on the eCRF in accordance with the patient diary records. 
7.1.3 Severity of Nausea  
Severity of nausea will be evaluated by the patient in the patient diary for each day of the 
0-120 hour interval (Days 1 to 5, inclusive), using a 100- mm horizontal VAS. The left 
end of the scale (0 mm) will be labeled as ‘no nausea’ and the right end of the scale 
(100 mm) will be labeled as ‘nausea as bad as it could be’.  
Each day starting fr om Day 2 and up to Day 6 of each cycle, the patient will be asked to 
record her assessment of the average degree of nausea during the preceding 24 hours (“How much nausea did you experience on average during the last 24 hours?”). The patient’s assessment o f the average severity of nausea in the preceding 24 hours will be 
performed by placing a vertical mark on the scale. Severity of nausea will then be documented on the eCRF in accordance with the patient diary records. 
7.1.4 Functional Living Index -Emesis (FLIE)  Questionnaire  
The FLIE is a nausea and vomiting specific self report instrument comprised of two domains (nausea and vomiting) with nine identical items in each domain. FLIE was originally developed and validated to assess the impact on patient’s daily life over the three days following chemotherapy. The measurement characteristics of the FLIE are also acceptable when administered with a 5 -day recall period [14]. 
The items assess the impact of nausea and vomiting on multiple aspects of a patient’s 
daily life. Each item is answered using a 100 -mm (1 to 7 points) VAS with anchors 
corresponding to “none”/”not at all” and “a great deal”. Items within the domain are weighted equally, reversed as required for some items (items with the scale anchors in the opposite direction) and summed to create the domain score according to the FLIE Scoring and Administration Manual. The two domain scores are then summed to create the total FLIE score. Higher FLIE scores indicate less impairment on daily life as a result 
of nausea and vomiting. 
The FLIE questionnaire will be provided on paper to the patient during Visit 2 (Day 1) of 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, with adequate instructions on how t o fill it. The patient will 
complete the FLIE questionnaire reflecting the impact of nausea and vomiting during the 5-day recall period after AC chemotherapy administration on Day 1.

Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
The FLIE will then be collected and checked by the Investigator at Visit 3 (Day 6+2) of 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 and answers documented on the eCRF in accordance with the paper 
patient copy.  
7.2 Safety Assessments  
Safety is the primary objective of this study and will be assessed primarily by means of 
AEs collection and reporting. See S ection 8 ADVERSE EVENTS  for specific definitions. 
Additionally, details of other safety assessments are decribed in detail below.  
7.2.1 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (screening) and at Visit 3 (Day 6 +2 days) of each cycle. This evaluation will include an examination of general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, neck, lungs, cardiovascular, breast, lymph 
nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal and neurological. At Visit 3 and at subsequent cycles, only the  general question “Was the physical examination performed?” will be asked  on 
the eCRF.  
Information about the physical examinations will be recorded in the source documentation at the site and any abnormalities at screening will be recorded in the eCRF. After signing the informed consent, any new or worsening of existing patholo gical 
findings noted since previous examination performed under the present protocol should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF form. 
7.2.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs assessments will include: pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (at 
Visit 1, Visit 2  predose and Visit 3 of each cycle), height (Visit 2 of Cycle 1 only) and 
body weight (Visit 2 [Day 1 visit] of each cycle, at predose). Pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured after the patient has been resting in the semi -
supine position for at least 5 minutes at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (pre -dose i.e., before 
the oral NEPA FDC or matching placebo capsule administration) and Visit 3 (Day  6 + 2 
days). 
The following time windows will be applied for the measurement of vital sig ns:  
• Visit 2 (Day 1 Visit), predose: within 30 minutes before oral NEPA FDC capsule 
or matching placebo capsule administration. 
• Visit 3 (Day 6 +2 days visit): between 120 hours and 168 hours from start of AC administration on Day 1. 
7.2.3 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
At the screening visit for each cycle, the Investigator will be responsible to assess the 
adequacy of the patient to receive AC chemotherapy (see inclusion criteria), including laboratory parameters assessments.  The following laboratory parameters will be assessed 
at Visit 1 and Visit 3 of each cycle using local laboratories:  
• Hematology: hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets  
Page 78 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
• Blood Chemistry: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (AL T), 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and 
creatinine clearance (derived from blood creatinine value by application of the 
Cockcroft- Gault formula).  
Females of childbearing potential will have to perform a urine ( dipstick) pregnancy test at 
the Screening Visit and within 24 hours prior to the first dose (oral NEPA FDC or matching placebo capsule) of investigational drug administration at Day 1 of each cycle. In case the Screening Visit urine pregnancy test was perf ormed within 24 hours prior to 
IMP, the urine test is not to be repeated on Day 1. 
See Section 6.2 Study Procedures by Time Point  and Study Flow Chart for additional 
details.  
Upon receipt and after review, the Investigator must sign and date each local laboratory 
report and document in the relevant EDC form if the parameter is below, within or above normal ranges. The Investigator will review the values outside the normal range and repeat the test, if needed. In case clin ically significant laboratory abnormalities are 
detected, the etiology of the abnormality should be identified and the diagnosis should be recorded as an AE. Otherwise, if the etiology cannot be identified, the laboratory abnormality as such should be recorded as AE.  
Similarly, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities detected at Cycle 1 screening, if 
not justified by an underlying disease already recorded in the medical history, are to be recorded as AEs.  
7.3 Health Economics Outcome Research (HEOR) Assessments  
HEOR assessments in this study will include hospitalization information, lost work time, and details related to any changes in chemotherapy administration during the repeated cycles. Details of each are described in the sections below.  
Additiona lly, other data collected from patient diary or eCRFs may also be used for 
HEOR-related analysis. All parameters of interest, endpoints and analysis methods will 
be pre-specified in a separate Health Economics Analysis Plan.  
7.3.1 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire  
The WPAI is a questionnaire used to document lost work time [15]. Actual lost work 
time (hours) will be recorded by  patients on the WPAI and returned at Visit 3 
(Day 6 +2 days), referring to the past five days since start of AC chemotherapy 
administration on Day 1. WPAI questionnaire will only be administered during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.  
7.3.2 Emergency Department (ED) Use an d In-Patient (IP) Admissions  
Patients will be asked dates of ED events and IP events. For each IP event, the length of stay in number of calendar days will be documented (i.e., minimum of 2). This information, referring to the interval from Visit 2 (Day 1)  through Visit 4 of each cycle, 
will be recorded at Visit 4 of each cycle.

7.3.3 Subsequent Cycle Start Date and Changes from Initial Schedule 
Starting at Cycle 2 Visit 2 (Day 1), the Investigator will document if changes in 
chemotherapy administration from the previous cycle occurred and will note any delays in treatment for the current cycle. If a subsequent cycle is not yet initiated by Visit 4, that 
shall be noted as well.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS 
AE recording will begin at the time the informed consent form is signed until end of the 
study (completion/discontinuation), as a minimum. If the patient exit the study less than 15 days after last study drug administration, the patient should be followed- up for AEs 
recording up to 15 days after last study drug administration. AEs will be ascertained by asking the patient how she has been since the last visit.  
8.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE)  
As defined by the current ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice [16, 17] an Adverse 
Event (AE) is:  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigati on subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disea se 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
Within the scope of this study, such untoward medical occurrences would be considered 
as “AEs” even if the subject was not administered the study drugs but had already signed the Informed Consent Form. 
AEs include the following types of occurrences:  
− Suspected adverse drug reactions  
− Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship to the study drugs, such as 
injury, surgery, accidents, increased severity of pre -existing symptoms, apparently 
unrelated illnesses, and significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, 
physiological testing, or physical examination findings  
− Reactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, hypersensitivity, or toxicity. 
Planned procedures, surgical interventions or planned hospitalizations scheduled prior to the informed consent but performed during the study (study procedures, chemotherapy cycles, etc.) should not be considered (serious) AEs.  
Signs and symptoms considered as lack of efficacy (nausea and vomiting) and occurring 
during the study up to 5 days after the study drugs administration, will not be recorded on the AEs section of the eCRF, except on the  condition that, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
nausea and vomiting are caused by any reason different from lack of efficacy of study treatment or meet the definition of serious AE.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs that start after the 
first study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cycle 1 until Visit 4 of the last study 
cycle.

Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is any event that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, 
side effect, or precaution , whether or not it is considered to be associated with the study 
product. A SAE is an AE that meets any of the following criteria: 
− Results in death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a 
clinical study, including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study 
drugs (e.g., car accident). 
− Is life-threatening. This includes any AE during which the subject is, in the view 
of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs. This definition does not include events that may have caused death if they had 
occurred in a more severe form.  
− Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
− Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
− Is a congenital anomaly or bi rth defect  
− Other medical events that based upon appropriate medical judgment are thought 
to jeopardize the patient and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes defining a SAE. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An Unexpected Adverse Event is any experience not previously reported (in nature, 
severity or incidence) in the current Investigator’s Brochure for IV NEPA FDC. [8] 
Pre-existing Condition  
A pre-existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A pre -existing 
condition is to be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. 
8.1.1 Classificati on of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will classify AEs based on their severity and relationship to IMP and 
dexamethasone. Every effort must be made by the Investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity (see Section 8.1.1.1 Severity), and its relationship  
(see Section 8.1.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Medicinal Product and  
Dexamethasone).  
8.1.1.1  Severity  
The severity of an AE will be rated by the Investigator according to the descriptions and grading scales of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (for details please refer to the integral document Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s 
(CTCAE, Version 4.0, published: May 28, 2009 [v4.03: June 14, 2010]); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute) [18], as summarized below:

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
Severity of AE according to CTC Grading Scale and related Guideline 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated; 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*;  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicate d; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL**;  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
(*) Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
(**) Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.  
8.1.1.2  Relationship to Investigational Medicinal Product and 
Dexamethasone  
For this trial, an AE cause and effect relationship to the study drug and dexamethasone 
will be classified by the Investigator as reported hereafter.  
Definitely related  
The event:  
− Follows, in a reasonable temporal sequence, the administration of the drug or the drug 
level that has been establis hed in body fluids or tissues. 
− Follows a known or expected response pattern of the suspected drug. 
− Is confirmed by improvement after de-challenge or dosage reduction of the drug. 
− Reappears after repeated exposure (re- challenge).  
Probably related  
The event:  
− Follows, in a reasonable temporal sequence, the administration of the drug. 
− Follows a known or expected response pattern of the suspected drug. 
− Is confirmed by improvement after de-challenge or dosage reduction of the drug. 
− Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical 
state. 
− No re-challenge test or laboratory confirmation is available.  
Possibly related  
The event:  
− Follows, in a reasonable temporal sequence, the administration of the drug. 
− Follows a known or expected response pattern of the suspected drug but could have 
been easily produced by a number of other etiologies. 
Page 83 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
Unlikely related  
There is no reasonable temporal association between the drug and the AE or the event 
could have been related to the subject’s clini cal state or concomitant treatment(s), or 
another cause adequately explaining the AE is known or is much more probable. 
Not related / None 
Sufficient information exists indicating that the etiology is unrelated to the drug.  
Unassessable  
The data are insufficient or contradictory to make a meaningful medical assessment. This 
criterion should be used only in case of insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor 
documentation. Every effort should be done by the Investigator to make appropriate 
assessment of causal relationship (i.e., either related to the IMP, dexamethasone or both). 
8.1.2 Reporting Adverse Events  
AE reporting has to be in accordance with the ICH E6 Guidance on GCP and ICH E2A 
Guidance on Clinical Safety Management. [16, 17] 
During the study, all AEs (including SAEs), irrespective of the relatedness  to the study  
drugs, must be recorded in detail in the source records and transcribed onto the AEs pages of the eCRF. During each monitoring visit, the Investigator and the site monitor will review all AEs and perform Source Data Verification (SDV). The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the correct information concerning all AEs is entered on the appropriate eCRF pages.  
In case clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are detected, the etiology of the abnormality should be identified and the diagnosis should be recorded as an AE. Otherwise, if the etiology can not be identified, the laboratory abnormality as such should be recorded as the AE.  
Similarly, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities detected at the screening visit (before any ad ministration of the investigational medicinal product or additional non-
investigational drug), if not justified by an underlying disease already recorded in the medical history, are to be recorded as AEs.  
The reporting period for AEs during the Study is the period starting from the time of Informed Consent signature and lasting until end of the study (completion/discontinuation), as a minimum. If the patient exit the study less than 15 days after last study drug administration, the patient should be followe d-up for AEs 
recording up to 15 days after last study drug administration. All unresolved AEs (including SAEs) at the end of the reporting period will be documented on the eCRF as “ongoing”.

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
8.1.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs occurring from the time  of signing of the informed consent until Visit 4 (either 
Day 15 +3 days or Day 22 ±3 days follow -up visit) of the last cycle, must be reported 
immediately to the CRO pharmacovigilance. Contact information is provided in the 
Investigator file as well as in  the General Information Section of the present protocol. 
The Investigator or designated study coordinator must complete the Investigational Serious AE Form and send it to the CRO within 24 hours of observation or notification of a serious AE. All of these events must also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform his or her local Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) about SAEs occurring during the Study, according to the local IRB/EC  requirements. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s 
designee) to submit applicable SAE Reports to the Competent Authorities. Reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant IRB/EC, in accordance with th e the US Code of Federal Regulations 313.32, ICH E6 Guidance on 
GCP, and ICH E2A Guidance on Clinical Safety Management, will also be the responsibility of the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designee). [ 16, 17] 
A safety contact sheet will be provided to the Investigator and will be maintained in the Investigator file at the site. Sites  will be instructed to refer to the instructions and 
definitions for completing the Investigational SAE Form for submitting all SAEs to the CRO. 
8.1.3.1  Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs occurring during the study will be followed by the Investigator until the outcome is 
resolved, has reached a stable condition in the Investigator’s opinion, or until the patient is lost to follow -up. When the investigational site receives any information about an SAE 
which changes or adds to the information on the initial investigational SAE form, the site will fill out a new investigational SAE form and tick the ”follow -up” box of the SAE 
form and email it within 24 hours to the CRO. 
8.1.4 Pregnancy Report  
Female patients who are of childbearing potential must use an effective 
contraceptive/birth control measure while participating on study and have a negative 
urine pregnancy test at study entry. In the unlikely eventuality that a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the Investigator will be requested to complete the Pregnanc y 
Report Form and any relevant document. They must be forwarded to the CRO e -mail 
address  (see Section General Information). After check of consistency, designated personnel at the CRO will then forward the information to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy. Even though pregnancy is not considered as SAE 
itself, pregnancy has to be reported within the timelines as defined for SAE. 
Pregnant patients will be followed by the Investigator and CRO / Sponsor until the fetus / 
newborn i s delivered or the pregnancy is terminated. The subject’s primary care 
physician (or obstetrician) will be requested by the Investigator to provide further information on the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Outcome Information Form. At the study end and data base closure, reports of Pregnancy Outcome will be sent by the sites 
directly to Helsinn Drug Safety.

9 STATISTICS  
This section summarizes the statistical principles and methods planned to analyze the 
data for this clinical study. The reference document is the ICH Topic E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials: Note for Guidance on Statistical Principles in Clinic al 
Trials [19]. 
Further details of the statistical analyses and data presentations to be used in reporting the study will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized 
prior to breaking the blind. Changes from analyses planned in this protocol will be documented in the  SAP and/or study report. The database will be locked after all queries 
are resolved, and a blinded review of data is performed and decisions made about study populations and handling of unused or missing data. 
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
A total of 400 patients will be randomized, equally distributed in two groups (i.e., 200 
patients/group). 
Patients will be randomized according to a randomization ratio 1:1, stratified by region 
and age class.  
The primary goal of this study is to characterize the safety profile of IV NEPA FDC over 
a reasonable duration of time consistent with the intended use of this drug. Although no formal comparison is planned with the randomized control group, the presence of a concurrent control group in the same patient population may help interpret any unexpected safety finding in the test group.  
9.2 Definition of Study Populations for Analysis  
Study populations are defined as follows: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  includes all patients who have been randomized to 
treatment and received AC chemotherapy regimen and active study drug (oral NEPA 
FDC or IV NEPA FDC, including partial infusion). Following the intent -to-treat 
principle, patients will be assigned to the study treatment group according to the treatment to which they have been randomized. 
FAS will be used for demography, other baseline characteristics, all descriptive efficacy 
analyses. 
The Safety population  includes all patients who received active study drug (oral NEPA 
FDC or IV NEPA FDC, including partial infusion). Patients will be assigned to study treatment groups according to the actual treatment received.  
Safety population will be used for demography, other baseline characteristics and for all 
safety analyses.

9.3 Statistical Analysis  
9.3.1 General Considerations  
General descriptive statistics for numeric variables will include n (number of observed 
values), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. For 
categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects will be presented.  
9.3.1.1  Missing Data  
Due to the short efficacy assessment period within each study cycle (a maximum of 120 h considering all the efficacy assess ments), a very low number of drop- outs and minimal 
missing data is expected during the cycle.  
For efficacy analyses, any patient who does not provide data about occurrence of emetic episodes and rescue medication intake is to be considered as treatment failure (i.e., non-responder) for CR in the overall phase. The same approach is to be applied also to CR in the acute and delayed phases. For consistency, the same approach for handling missing data as described for CR will also to be applied to emetic episodes and rescue medication intake. 
For safety analyses, no imputations will be performed on missing values.  
Since there might be cases where emetic episodes and rescue medications intake in the 
0-120 hours from start of AC chemotherapy are, by mistake, recorded in the eCRF Adverse Events and Prior and Concomitant medications form only (and not in the patient diary), in accordance with the definition of CR, such cases will be taken into account for efficacy analyses and patients considered as failures.  
For nausea intensity data collected daily, missing values in the 0 -24 hour interval or 
missing data preceding any available data will be replaced using the worst case principle i.e., using the highest value observed in the same treatment and time interval among all patients with the same stratifications factors (i.e., region, age class and naivety). Missing data after at least one available value will be replaced using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). The worst value will be evaluated after applying LOC F to other 
missing data.  
Patients with no nausea and with no significant nausea will be then derived from the 
complete data after imputation of missing data.  
Concerning the FLIE scores, for the purpose of calculating the score for a domain (either 
nausea or vomiting), at least 5 of the 9 FLIE items (i.e., > 50% overall item response rate) 
in the domain must be non-missing. The score, expressed in mm, of each domain will be 
calculated as:  
9
answered  items  no.)mm(in  scores item 
mm)(in  scoreDomain × =∑ 
Page 87 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
To obtain the score expressed in FLIE points, the above mentioned domain score 
expressed in mm is multiplied by 0.06, as a final step 9 will then be added. 
( )9 06 . 0 mm)(in  scoreDomain points)  FLIE(in  scoreDomain + × =  
For the calculation of the total FLIE score (i.e., sum of the nausea and vomiting domain 
scores), at least 12 out of the 18 FLIE items (i.e., ≥ 66% overall item response rate) must be non-missing and both the vomiting and nausea domains must be non- missing. 
A missing single item will not be replaced. A missing entire domain score will be replaced using the worst case principle i.e., using the lowest score observed in the same treatment among all patients with same age class. The total FLIE score will be then calculated from the complete data after imputation of missing data.  
9.3.1.2  Multiplicity  
Since no formal comparisons between trea tments are planned, no multiplicity adjustment 
is foreseen.  
9.3.1.3  Covariates, Interactions and Subgroups  
It is expected that region (US, non- US) and age class (<55 years, ≥55 years) could 
influence the study endpoints. For this reason, these factors will be taken into consideration for randomization (see Section 5.11 Randomization - Use of IWRS ) so to 
minimize possible unbalance between groups. 
Selected efficacy endpoints at Cycle 1 (CR in the acute, delayed and overall phases) will 
be also summarized by region and by age group. 
9.3.2 Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Variables  
Demographics and baseline variables will be summarized by treatment arm using 
descriptive statistics.  
9.3.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Analyses of efficacy endpoints will be performed on FAS. 
All results will be interpreted in descriptive manner only.  
At each cycle, for each phase (acute, delayed, and overall), numbers and proportions 
(including 95% CI using Wilson score method) of patients with CR, with no emetic 
episodes, with no rescue medication, with no nausea, and with no significant nausea will be descriptively summarized.  
In addition, for Cycle 1, CR in the acute, delay and overall phases will be summarized by 
region and by age group (strata).  
Since VAS is assessed daily, for no significant nausea and no nausea in the delayed and 
overall phases, the maximum VAS value in the relevant phase will be considered (i.e., the 
Page 88 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
maximum value for Day 2 to 5 for delayed phase and for Day 1 to 5 for the over all 
phase). 
For the above mentioned variables, differences between groups will be presented using 
the CMH method for the risk difference (including region and age class as strata) and relative two -sided 95% CI. The treatment difference and 95% CI for the difference will 
also be presented without strata adjustment, using the Newcombe-Wilson’s method. 
The severity of nausea in the acute, delayed and overall phase, will be descriptively 
summarized including treatment difference and relative two -sided 95% CI. 
Antiemetic rescue medications will be tabulated by treatment arm.  
In Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, only, to assess the impact of nausea and vomiting on patients’ quality of life, the FLIE with a 5 -day recall will be used. A total FLIE score (expressed in 
FLIE points) greater than 108 will be categorized as having No Impact on Daily Life (NIDL) [14]. A FLIE domain score (either nausea or vomiting, expressed in FLIE points) 
greater than 54 will be categorized as NIDL [14]. A response to an individual question on 
the FLIE will be categorized as NIDL if the score expressed in FLIE points is  greater 
than 6. 
Number and percentage (including 95% CI) of patients with NIDL (overall, by domain 
and by individual item), will be summarized by treatment. Differences between groups for total FLIE score and domain scores (nausea and vomiting) will be pr esented using the 
CMH method for the risk difference and relative two- sided 95% CI. The treatment 
difference and 95% CI will also be presented without strata adjustment. 
The mean nausea and vomiting domain FLIE scores and the mean total score will be will 
be descriptively summarized including treatment difference and relative two -sided 95% 
CI. 
9.3.4 Safety Analysis  
The safety analysis will be performed on the Safety population. 
Clinical evaluations for safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital 
signs, and laboratory tests during each cycle (Visit 1 through Visit 4), and monitoring of AEs through the study period.  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) 
dictionary (the version will be provided in the SAP and in the Data Management Plan  
[DMP]) to give a preferred term (PT) and a system organ class (SOC) for each event. The 
number and percentage of patients who experienced at least one TEAE, drug -related 
TEAE (defined as AEs with relationship classified by the investigator as definitely, probably, possibly, unassessable or missing), serious TEAE, serious related, severe 
TEAE (i.e., TEAE with CTCAE grade ≥ 3) and the number and percentage of patients 
withdrawn due to TEAE will be summarized by treatment arm. Summaries will be made 
with respect to the proportion of patients with events and the total number of events throughout the study. A similar summary will be presented for Cycle 1 only. 
Page 89 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
For each SOC and PT, summaries will be made with respect to the proportion of patients 
having at least one occurrence of that event during the study and the total number of events. The incidence of TEAEs in each treatment arm will be presented overall, by SOC and PT, and by additional grouping by severity according to the CTCAE gr ade and 
relationship to the study treatment. Tables of TEAEs will be presented by relationship to study drug and to dexamethasone. Additional tables including any relationship (either to study drug or dexamethasone) will be presented. Summary will be presented considering all the performed cycles (i.e., throughout the study) and for Cycle 1, only. 
In addition, TEAEs of special interest, i.e. the ones related to local tolerability (e.g. 
injection site reaction, pain at injection site, thrombophlebitis) will be summarized for 
each cycle.  
No formal test will be used for “between groups” comparison. All AEs will be listed. Pre-treatment AEs will be listed separately from TEAEs.  
Vital signs will be summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics for absolute  
values, change from baseline (i.e., last value before first study drug intake), and change from pre-dose assessment of each cycle in addition to being listed.  
Physical examination results at screening will be summarized in a frequency table (normal/abnorm al). Results and relevant findings will be listed.  
Proportion of laboratory values below, within and above normal range will be presented by frequency table for each timepoint. Shift table (below, within and above normal range) comparing baseline (i.e., last value before first study drug intake) assessment  with on -
treatment assessment and comparing pre- dose assessment with Visit 3 assessment of each 
cycle will also presented.  
9.3.5 HEOR Analysis  
The HEOR analysis will be managed and conducted separately. Relevant patient data and results will be presented in a separate dedicated report. Further details (including detailed description of HEOR endpoints and analyses) will be outlined in the Health Economics Analysis Plan.  
9.4 Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. 
Descriptive statistics of data elements from exploratory HEOR assessments may be 
calculated on blinded data at intervals to -be-determined based on study enrollment. Data 
from a minimum of 50 patients will be available prior to creating this summary.

11 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Ethical Considerations  
The study will be performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration 
of Helsinki [23] as amended by the World Medical Associat ion in Fortaleza in 2013, and 
the ICH GCP guidelines as well as all local laws and regulations of the countries in which the study is conducted. 
11.1.1 Laws and Regulations  
This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with all international laws and 
regulations and national laws and regulations of the countries in which the trial is 
performed, as well as any applicable guidelines.  
11.1.2 Patient’s Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form  
All patients invited to participate in the clinical trial are entitled to  make their decision 
based on all current available information provided to them by the Investigator/designee. In addition, they will be given a document in native language written in clear concise lay language for review and consideration. The document will previously have been approved by relevant independent Ethics Committee(s) (EC[s]/Institutional Review Boards [IRBs]) and may further be updated as new important information becomes available that may affect subject’s willingness to participate or continue in the trial. This document will tell potentially eligible subjects about the nature of the study drugs, their efficacy and safety profile, the route of administration, and the human experience available. It will also outline the steps of the protocol a s they will apply to the individual, 
including the number of visits and types of procedures/assessments/measurements to be performed so that the individual has a clear picture of the risks, inconveniences and benefits that may accrue from the trial. The patient must be made aware that she may refuse to join the trial or may withdraw her consent at any time without prejudicing further medical care and that she is covered by the Sponsor's indemnity insurance in the event of a trial related injury. Contact det ails to report and discuss suspected trial -related 
injuries will be provided. Patients must also know that their personal medical records may be reviewed in confidence by the Sponsor's staff or representatives and by Regulatory Authorities and IRB/EC and t hat personal information will be collected and 
retained in a confidential database. Conditions for ensuring the anonymity of data and the security and confidentiality of the database should be explained. Consent will always be given in writing after the pa tient has had adequate time to review the information and ask 
questions, if need be. The patient and the Investigator or responsible site staff member conducting the informed consent discussion will both personally write their name, sign and date the conse nt form. Patients will be given a copy of their executed informed

consent. The study is being performed in the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. 
US maintain descriptions of clinical studies in the participating countries on the internet. As required by the US FDA, the informed consent form must contain the following text: 
“A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as 
required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify y ou. 
At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.”  
11.1.3 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may only be made by means of a written amendment, which has to be approved and signed by the authorized individuals of the Sponsor and by the Investigator. The study code, the title of the study, the progressive number and the date of the amendment must be recorded on the first page of the document. Exhaustive justifications that motivate the amendment to th e protocol should clearly be addressed in 
the document. All protocol amendments must be submitted to the IRB/EC for review and approval unless it covers administrative issues only. In this case, the IRB/EC will be notified of the amendment for information purposes only. 
11.1.4 Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator has to conduct the study in accordance with the approved current 
protocol and will not be allowed to make any changes with the only exception when immediate changes are necessary to protect the safety, ri ghts, and welfare of the subjects. 
In order to obtain interpretable results, neither the Investigator nor the Sponsor/CRO will alter the study conditions agreed upon and set out in this protocol.  
In the event of an isolated, unforeseen instance resulting in a protocol deviation, the 
Investigator is to document this deviation and notify it to the CRO as soon as possible, in writing. In no instance should this increase the subject’s risk or affect the validity of the study data.  
11.1.5 Data Collection  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used for recording patient’s study data 
using a validated web -based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system . It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the eCRFs are properly and completely filled in. The eCR Fs must be completed for all patients who have been included in the 
study.  
Each authorized site personnel will be assigned a login and password to enter the EDC 
system via a secure network . Each login uniquely identifies the user and appropriate 
permissio ns will be set -up according to the user role. The access to the system will be 
granted once the user’s training will be completed and documented.  
Queries will be used to validate/clarify data entered on an eCRF page. Some queries will 
be generated automat ically by the system when the user saves data that does not meet the 
criteria pre- defined for the data field. In addition, others will be created manually in the 
Page 92 of 120

NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
system and sent either by the study monitor (as result of Source Data Verification) or by 
Clinical Data Management.  
Discrepancies raised will be reviewed online to determine the corrective action needed. Changes will be made directly by authorized site staff. The EDC system’s audit trail will keep track of any information entered, modified and dele ted. The audit trail will include, 
as a minimum, what was entered/changed/modified, who made the action and when the action was made. Any answered query will be reviewed and closed by authorized users. The Investigator will electronically sign the eCRF to validate the content.  
Patient’s source documentation (i.e., hospital charts) will be maintained at the clinic. Source data to be recorded directly onto the eCRFs will be communicated in advance. In cases where source documents are not eCRFs, the informatio n on the eCRFs must match 
the source documents. Source data verification will be regularly performed by the blinded study monitor.  
Laboratory values will be assessed according to local laboratories normal ranges. 
Assessments ( below, within and above norma l range) will be reported directly into the 
eCRF by the study personnel. All data will be checked by the monitor. 
Paper patient diaries will be used to collect emetic episodes (i.e., retching and vomiting 
episodes), rescue medication intake and daily nausea assessment. Taking into account the 
patient population, the short re -call period (i.e., 120 hours for efficacy endpoints)
 and the 
fact that rescue medication intake and emetic episodes are objective data, the paper diary is considered to be a reliable method of data collection and the most suitable for this patient population. The Investigator will review the filled in paper diary at Visit 3 (Day 6+2) of each cycle and discuss with the patient any issues or missing/incomplete data, so that the patien t makes all necessary corrections, if any, during the visit. The Investigator 
or designee will review, sign, date and collect the complete patient diaries after it is returned at Visit 3 of each cycle and will also transfer all data from the paper diary to  the 
eCRF. The paper diaries will be kept at the trial site and considered as source documents.  
A paper FLIE questionnaire with a 5- day recall period will be used to assess the impact 
of nausea and vomiting on patients’ quality of life. The FLIE questionna ire will be filled 
in by the patient on Day 6 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, covering the past 5 days and checked and retrieved by the Investigator during study Visit 3 (Day 6+2) of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. FLIE data will be then reported in the relevant eCRF page by  the Investigator . 
Additional HEOR -related assessments will also be captured. Emergency department,  in -
patient admissions and length of stay will be documented by the Investigator or designated responsible person at Visit 4 of each cycle for events occurring since Day 1 of that cycle. Additionally, starting at Cycle 2 Visit 2 (Day 1), the Investigator will document if changes in chemotherapy administration from the previous cycle occurred and will note any delays in treatment for the current cycle.  
A paper WPAI questionnaire with a 5- day recall period will be used to assess the effect 
of CINV on patients’ ability to work and perform regular activities, including 
documentation of lost work time. The WPAI questionnaire will be filled in by the patient on Day 6 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, covering the past 5 days and checked and retrieved by

the Investigator during study Visit 3 (Day 6 +2 days) of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. WPAI data 
will be then reported in the relevant eCRF page by the Investigator. 
11.1.6 Monitoring and Qua lity Assurance  
The study will be monitored by CRO’s adequately qualified and trained clinical monitors 
on a regular basis throughout the study period to ensure the proper conduct of the clinical trial. The purposes of clinical trial monitoring are to verif y that the rights and well -being 
of study patients are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete and verifiable against the source documents, and that the study is conducted in accordance with the current protocol, Good Clinical Practice guideline and applicable regulatory requirements. During the monitoring visits, monitors will verify the  following including 
but not limited to: patient informed consent, patient’s eligibility, safety data and reporting, quality of source documents and eCRF data against patient’s medical records. 
If inconsistencies are identified, the corresponding corrections to the eCRF data will have to be made by the Investigator. Monitors will also check patient compliance, accrual, drug handling, including dispensing procedures and accountability logs, delegation of responsibilities within the Investigator’s team, relevant communications with family doctors, if any, ancillary equipment and facilities, including refrigerators and freezers, local labs, etc. The Invest igator and other site staff involved in the study must allocate 
enough time to the monitor at these visits.  
Upon request by the Sponsor, or following the CRO’s audit plan, on- site study audits 
may be conducted in order to ensure the study is in compliance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the study protocol. The auditing activities may also be conducted after study completion. 
In addition, Regulatory Authorities may wish to conduct on- site inspections (during the 
study or after its completio n). If a Regulatory Authority notifies the Investigator of an 
inspection or visits the site unannounced for purposes of conducting an inspection, the 
Investigator must inform the study Sponsor and CRO immediately. The Investigator will 
make all efforts to facilitate the conduct of the audits and inspections giving access to all 
necessary facilities, data and documents.  
11.1.7 Study Documentation and Records Retention 
The medical (hospital) files of trial patients should be retained in accordance with national legislation (and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital (or institution/private practice).  
The Sponsor should ensure that it is specified in the protocol or other written agreement that the Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial- related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents. All the essential study documents should be retained at the sites until when the Sponsor informs the Investigators/institutions in writing about the date when the trial related records are no longer needed and in any case in accordance with FDA regulation 21 CFR 312.62(b) and (c) and ICH -GCP guidelines [15]. Should the Investigator wish to assign 
Page 94 of 120 
Confidential=HEI..SINN 
NEPA-17-05  
Final (v3.1) 30 NOV 2017  Clinical Study Protocol  
  
 
the study documentation to another party or move to another location, the Sponsor should 
promptly be notified. 
11.1.8 Confidentiality  
The Sponsor and the CRO must ensure that the Investigator keeps s ecret from third 
parties any confidential information disclosed or provided by the Sponsor and regarding 
the Sponsor and its study -related products. The Investigator agrees to use such 
information only to accomplish the present study tasks and not to use it for any other purposes without prior written consent by the Sponsor. Prior to the study start- up, each 
Investigator as well as each subcontractor to be involved in the study should sign a confidentiality agreement with the CRO acting for and on behalf of the Sponsor. 
11.1.9 Publication Policy  
As a general rule, the Sponsor and the Investigator(s) agree that no publications 
presenting or discussing data and/or results from clinical trials sponsored by Helsinn Healthcare SA will take place until the participating center(s) has/have completed the study, the data have been interpreted, and the final report has been issued. As a rule, the Sponsor is free to use the data collected in the sponsored study for the drug registration, world-wide scientific product documentation, and for publication. In general, the Sponsor 
has no objections if the Investigator publishes the results of the study obtained by the Investigator/Institution sponsored by Helsinn Healthcare SA; however, the Investigator is requested to provide the Sponsor with a copy of the manuscr ipt for review before 
submitting it to the publisher with a cover letter informing the Sponsor about the intention to publish the study results. Such a procedure is necessary to prevent premature disclosure of trade secrets or otherwise patent -protected material and is not intended as a 
restrictive measure concerning the study results or the opinions of the Investigators. After the review of the manuscript by the Sponsor, the Investigator will be provided with the Sponsor’s comments, if any, and the opinion of the Sponsor regarding study results 
publication. The Investigator shall however consider the Sponsor’s comments and proposed revisions. If requested by the Sponsor, the Investigator shall delay the presentation or publication of the study data in order  to allow the Sponsor sufficient time 
to obtain Intellectual Property Protection. The Sponsor is entitled to include as authors of the publication all Sponsor’s personnel who have contributed substantially to the theoretical or experimental activities and also to make a decision on the order in which 
the authors’ names will be given. Costs for publication must be regulated by written agreement between the parties. For multicenter studies, the Investigators who will be quoted as authors of the publication(s)  should be agreed upon with the Sponsor. If 
publication of the results of the study, either in part or in full, is prepared by the Sponsor, the Investigator(s) will be asked in writing if he/she/they agree(s) to be listed as one of the authors of the publication. Answers should be sent in writing to the Sponsor within a reasonable time limit (30 days).

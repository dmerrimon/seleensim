2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Study Disease  
 
High grade glioma (HGG)  is one of the most lethal forms of human cancer (1).  The 
standard of care at the time of initial diagnosis of HGG consists of surgical resection 
followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, based on 
September 29, 2022  
 2 the results of a randomiz ed controlled trial which demonstrated a significant 
improvement in overall survival with the addition of temozolomide to adjuvant 
radiation therapy alone (1).  Although this study was performed in patients with 
GBM, the results are widely applied to patie nts with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) 
who are treated with the same paradigm.  Despite recent advances in the treatment of 
HGG , the diagnosis remains essentially incurable and the tumor will recur in the vast 
majority of patients.   
 
 Management of patients with recurrent HGG remains controversial.  Accepted 
treatment options include temozolomide alone, repeat radiation therapy with 
concurrent temozolomide, or a clinical trial.  The response rate to second line 
therapies is limited and when effective the durability of response is generally poor.  
Improvements in salvage therapeutic options for HGG are therefore critical.  
 
 2.2    LDFRT Rationale  
 
 Numerous studies have shown that the slope of the cell survival curve is greater at 
very l ow doses of radiation than at the higher doses of radiation  which are 
conventionally employed in the clinic (2 -8).  The mechanism behind this phenomenon 
known as hyper -radiation sensitivity appears to be two -fold.  First, low doses of 
radiation do not indu ce cellular repair mechanisms  such as ATM and mismatch repair 
that are  typically activated  with clinically relevant doses of radiation  (2,9,10 ).  
Second, very small fractions of radiation manage to  induce pro -apoptotic pathways 
without inducing pro -surviva l cascades that are activated with higher doses  (11,12) .  
Studies have shown that hyper -radiation sensitivity  persists following multiple 
fractions of radiation (13) and that the effect is greatest in cells in the G2/M phase.  
Experiments in glioma cell li nes have suggested that the point of maximum radiation 
hypersensitivity occurs with fractions of approximately 0.4 -0.5 Gy.  
 
In spite of these data, low dose fractionated radiation therapy ( LDFRT ) is not typically 
employed in the clinic because in order to use it  as a primary modality, patients  would 
need  to be treated with multiple  fractions of radiation per day for many months , and 
this is not feasible .  However, in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that LDFRT 
may be used to potentiate full dose che motherapy, decreasing the development of 
resistance found with standard doses of radiation and chemotherapy  (11-14).  Recent 
data in U87 glioblastoma cells suggest that LDFRT may be used to sensitize cells to 
the effects of temozolomide. Specifically, Gupt a et al. (15) demonstrated that the slope 
of the cell survival curve is greater following treatment with temozolomide plus 
LDFRT (0.5 Gy x 4 fractions, 8 hours apart) compared with temozolomide plus 2 Gy 
of radiation. The mechanism behind this effect remai ns to be elucidated.  
 
 The concept of low dose fractionated radiation therapy as a chemotherapy -sensitizer 
has been previously evaluated in humans in the context of early phase clinical trials in 
other disease sites, and the results have been optimistic.  Arnold et al. (16) perf ormed 
a phase II trial in patients with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck in which they used 0.8 Gy fractions of radiation twice daily to sensitize 
patients to induction chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol.  They enrolled fo rty 
September 29, 2022  
 3 patients and report an overall response rate of 82% (13% complete response, 69% 
partial response), which is better than otherwise expected.  In addition, they performed 
a second phase II trial in the same patient population using 0.5 Gy fractions of 
radiation twice daily to sensitize cells to carboplatin and taxol, and again report a 
favorable overall response rate of 88% (38% complete response, 50% partial 
response) (16).  The authors propose further evaluation of the regimen in a 
randomized controlled  trial. 
 
Similarly positive results using LDFRT for chemotherapy sensitization were reported 
by Regine et al. (17) who performed a phase I/II trial of LDFRT plus gemcitabine in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors.  The median o verall 
survival time was 10 months, which is better than historical data might predict for 
these aggressive tumors.   
 
A recent phase 2 trial evaluated ultrafractionated radiation therapy (3 daily doses of 
0.75 Gy to a total dose of 67.5 Gy) without temozo lomide in patients with newly 
diagnosed unresectable GBM  (Beauchesne 2010).  The results of this study were 
optimistic with no grade III or IV CNS toxicity, and PFS and OS which were superior 
to conventional RT alone based on historical controls.  
 
Given t he promising preclinical and clinical data, t he purpose of this trial is to 
examine the safety and efficacy of LDFRT as a chemo -potentiator of temozolomide in 
patients with recurrent HGG .   
 
2.2  Temozolomide  
 
Temozolomide is a chemotherapeutic agent which is a standard component of 
treatment of patients with both newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG .  The drug is an 
orally administered alkylating agent that interferes with DNA replication in a 
schedule -dependent m anner.  The therapeutic benefit of the drug depends on its ability 
to alkylate or methylate DNA at the N -7 or O -6 position of guanine residues, which 
results  in DNA damage and cell death.  Some tumor cells produce an enzyme called 
O-6-methylguaninine meth yltransferase (MGMT) which repairs the DNA damage and 
decreases the therapeutic benefit of temozolomide (18).  Epigenetic silencing of 
MGMT by some tumor cells prevents synthesis of the enzyme resulting in tumors that 
are more sensitive to killing by temoz olomide.  Similarly, MGMT presence in HGG 
cells predicts for poor response to the drug.  Toxicities associated with temozolomide 
include nausea, vomiting,  infertility, teratogenicity, alopecia, fatigue, headache, 
constipation, anorexia, convulsions, rash,  hemiparesis, diarrhea, astheni as, fever, 
dizziness, coordination abnormal, viral infection, amnesia, insomnia, lymphopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leucopenia,  allergic reactions . 
 
2.3 Amendment February 2017:  
 
The hypothesis of this study is low dose radiation hypersensitivity wherein very low 
doses of radiation in the range of 0.3 -0.8 Gy actually demonstrate greater cell kill than 
more traditional radiation doses in the range of 1.8 -3 Gy, seemingly because pro -
September 29, 2022  
 4 apoptotic pathways are activated while damage repair pathways are not ( 2-8).   
 
To date, a total of 22 patients have been enrolled.  Unexpectedly, the majority of  
patients have experienced substantial increases in contrast enhancement and edema as 
a result of treatment, which have then stabilized for many months.  Figure 1 shows an 
example patient.  Note the increase in contrast enhancement and edema at 3 months 
which then stabilizes and is markedly improved at month 11.  
 
 
Figure 1 : T1 post -gadolinium MRI images at baseline, 3 months and 11 months 
following initiation of management accordingly to J11120.  
 
 
The phase 1 component of the study is completed and all pa tients are being treated 
according to cohort 1. In general patients have tolerated treatment well with 5 patients 
with SAEs  attributable to the study treatment ( fatigue in 2 patients, and 
lymphocytopenia, aphasia, cognitive disturbance each in 1 patient).  Two of 22 
patients had pathologically confirmed radionecrosis.   
 
This unanticipated pseudo -progression type response renders our original primary 
objective of response rate inappropriate.  With this amendment we wish to change the 
primary objective to one year overall survival and enroll the remaining nine patients.  
The current one year OS is 45.1% (80% CI: 28.2%, 60.9%), the median OS is 9.5 
months (median follow -up of 12.7 months) and the median PFS is 4.0 months.  Given  
that patients on this trial have  been treated without any severe toxicities, it would be 
informative to determine if it is possible that there may be a delayed treatment effect 
that would indicate further study was warranted .  Since overall survival is the most 
definitive endpoint  for a clinical trial , we would like to estimate this outcome with the 
full sample size of 31 and potentially use this information as a reference in a future

September 29, 2022  
 8 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1   Temozolomide  
 
All patients will receive temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days 
during each 28 day cycle) for a total of 1 year or until the time of disease progression.   
After one year of follow -up, further chemotherapy or biologic therapy is permitted at 
the provi der’s discretion.  Therapy will be recorded, but the patient will not be 
removed from the study.  Risks of temozolomide  include nausea, vomiting,  infertility, 
teratogenicity, alopecia, fatigue, headache, constipation, anorexia, convulsions, rash, 
hemipare sis, diarrhea, astheni as, fever, dizziness, coordination abnormal, viral 
infection, amnesia, insomnia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
leucopenia,  allergic reactions . 
 
5.1.1 Therapy Modifications  
Delay, reduction, or discontinuation of tem ozolomide  administration will be decided 
according to hematological and non -hemato logical adverse events (AE), as specified 
below. If the administration of temozolo mide has to be interrupted, radiotherapy will 
be delayed, as well . Missed doses o f temozolom ide will not be made up after the end 
of radiotherapy. Blood work will be checked weekly , based on the discretion of the 
treating Medical Oncologist.  
 
If radiotherapy has to be temporarily interrupted for tech nical or medical reasons, 
unrelated to the temo zolomide administra tion, then treatment with temozolomide may 
continue.  
 
5.2  Low Dose Fractionated Radiation Therapy (LDFRT)  
 
All patients will receive 0.5 Gy of radiation therapy twice daily  (at least 6 hrs. apart) .  
This study will include a safety run -in component.  If > 33% of patients in the initial 
cohort of 6 experience grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicity (attribution of possible 
or above) according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4, then a dose 
reduction will occur following  the schedule listed below .  Otherwise, following a 1 
month waiting period after the first cycle of ad juvant LDFRT plus temozolomide for 
the first cohort of patients, the phase 2 study  will open for full accrual.  Patients will 
receive radiation with the first six 28-day cycles of temozolomide.   
 
 
Safety Run -in Dose Reduction  Schedule  
 
Cohorts   
Radiation Schedule   
 
Cohort 1  0.5 Gy bid on days 1 -5 of temo zolomide  
 
Cohort 2  0.5 Gy bid on days 1 -4 of temo zolomide  
 
Cohort 3  0.5 Gy bid on days 1 -3 of temo zolomide  
 
Cohort 4  0.5 Gy bid on days 1 & 2 of temo zolomide  
September 29, 2022  
 9 6 patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort.  Dose reduction will occur if 
>2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.  
 
5.2.1 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Toxicity will be recorded according to t he NCI Common Toxicity version 4 .  Dose 
limiting toxicity will be considered grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicity 
(attribution of possible or above) according to this scale.  The criteria are available 
online at the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic _applications/ctc.htm#ctc_4
0 
 
5.2.2.1. Radiation Treatment Planning  
 
5.2.2.1   Simulation  
 
 All patients will undergo CT simulation preferably with intravenous contrast .  In 
addition they will undergo MRI simulation with T1 with gadolinium sequence .  
They will be treated in a supine position using an aquaplast mask system for 
immobilization.  CT image data will be reconstructed in approximately 3 mm 
slice thickness and manually co -registered with the T1 post -gadolinium MRI.   
 
5.2.2.2  Target Delineation  
 
The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be contoured using  the simulation  CT 
scan and fused T1 with gadolinium sequence MRI.  The clinical tumor volume 
(CTV) will include the GTV plus approximately 0.5-1.5 cm margin.  The 
planning tumor volume (PTV) will include  the CTV plus approximately  0.5 
cm margin.   
 
5.2.2.3  Normal Tissues  
 
Organs at risk including the eyes, lens, optic nerves, optic chiasm, brainstem,  
and spinal cord will be contoured on the planning CT scan.  Dose to adjacent 
structures will be limited as much as  possible and dose will be recorded.  All 
patients will have been previously irradiated, however the maximum dose 
deliv ered in this protocol will be 30  Gy in 0.5 Gy fractions which is below the 
radiation tolerance typically allowed in patients undergoing r epeat irradiation 
for HGG .   
 
   5.2.2.4  Equipment  
 
Patients will be treated using a megavoltage linear accelerator with nominal 
beam energy of 6 MV.  
 
5.2.2.5   Beam Verification  
September 29, 2022  
 10  
Either daily on -line cone beam CT guidance or weekly portal imaging will be 
used for  precise patient setup.  
   
5.2.3 Therapy Modifications  
 
For radiation therapy interruptions of up to and including 14 days, irradiation 
should be completed to the full prescribed dose.  On the last day, the total 
number of fractions and the reasons for interrupting therapy must be 
documented.  
 
If radiation therapy interruption goes beyond 14 days, the patient will be 
removed from the protocol treatment.  Resumption and completion of 
additional radiation or chemotherapy treatment will then be at the discr etion of 
the treating medical oncologist and radiation oncologist .  
 
Treatment may be postponed for re -evaluation of disease. Participants may 
require further biopsies to confirm disease status. If results reveal stable 
disease, participants will continue protocol intervention.  
  
5.2.4 Risks of Radiation  
 
             Short term toxicities of radiation therapy include fatigue, alopecia,    
                  erythema or irritation of the skin, dry skin, headaches, worsening of current  
                  symptoms, edema of brain requiring steroids, ear pain or discomfort, damage  
                  to the baby if patient is or becomes pregnant, seizures, neurologic deficits  
                  depending on tumor location, edema of brain req uiring surgery, death.  Long  
                  term toxicities include memory loss, cataracts, edema of the brain requiring  
                  steroids, vision loss, hearing loss, necrosis of brain  requiring surgery  
                   second tumor or can cer caused by radiation.  
 
5.3  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, LDFRT will be administered 
with the first 6  cycles of temozolomide  and temozolomide  will continue for  a total of 
1 year and or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Disease progression,  
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
September 29, 2022

      5.4          Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed until the time of death  or until circumstances prevent the 
patient from presenting for  additional follow -up.  
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.3 
applies.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be 
documented in the Case Repo rt Form.  Patients will continue to be followed for overall 
survival. Data from medical oncology, including MRI reports and additional 
chemotherapy, will be collected until time of death.  
 
6. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
Not applicable.  
 
7. STUDY CALENDAR  
See Appendix D.  Baseline evaluations  and imaging  are to be conducted within 4 week s prior 
to start of protocol therapy.  Every effort should be made to adhere to the protocol timeline as 
closely as possible, but if studies are delayed or missed as a result of unavoidable conflicts 
such as hospitalization at an outside facility, deteriorating of patient status, or other adver sity 
precluding presentation for evaluation, it will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
Toxicity assessments that cannot be done in person will be completed over the phone.  
 
In order to minimize the need for research -only in -person visits, telemedicine visits may be 
substituted for in person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determined 
to be appropriate and where determined by the investigator not to increase the participants 
risks. Prior to initiating telemedi cine for study visits the study team will explain to the 
participant, what a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the study participant is in 
agreement and able to proceed with this method. Telemedicine acknowledgement will be 
obtained in accordance  with the Guidance for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event 
telemedicine is not deemed feasible, the study visit will proceed as an in -person visit. 
Telemedicine visits will be conducted using HIPAA compliant method approved by the 
Health System a nd within licensing restrictions.  
 
8. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
Patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria.  For the purposes of 
this study, patients should be re -evaluated approximately every  8 weeks.   
 
8.1 Antitumor Effect  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international 
criteria proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology Working Group 
(RANO) (19).   
 
September 29, 2022  
 12 8.1.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with  LDFRT . 
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:   Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
8.1.2  
8.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease  
 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
evaluate patients  at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used 
to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 
MRI :  T1 with gadolinium, T2 and FLAIR sequence MRI  techniques should be 
performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.   
 
Corticosteroid use : Dosages of corticosteroids will be recorded at baseline as well 
as follow -up visits and will be incorporated into the response criteria.   
 
Clinical examination : Neurologic deficits and symptoms will be recorded at 
baseline as well as f ollow -up visits and will be incorporated into the response 
criteria.   
   
 
8.1.4 Progression -Free Survival   
 
Progression free survival will be measured from  the date of initiation of  salvage 
treatment to the date of documented progressive disease  according to the RANO 
criteria (19) .  
 
8.1.5 Overall  Survival  (OS)  
 
OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death from 
any cause . 
 
  8.1.6  Pseudo -progression  
 
September 29, 2022  
 13 Pseudo -progression will be defined and MRI changes including T1  post-
gadolinium, T2 or T2 variants such as FLAIR imaging, with or without clinical 
deterioration and/or increase in dexamethasone dose which stabilizes or reverses 
on later evaluations without a change in oncologic intervention.  
 
8.1.7 Toxicity  
 
Toxicity will be monitored according to the criteria outlined in section 5.2.1.  
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
  
   9.1.1  Study Design  
 
This is a nonrandomized , open label, single institution  phase  II trial  with a 
safety run-in to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDFRT plus temozolomide 
in patients with recurrent  HGG  previously treated with surgical resection 
followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus temozolomide.   
 
The original primary objective of this study was response rat e where a CR+PR 
rate below 10% was considered clinically insignificant whereas a CR+PR rate 
above 25% was considered clinically significant using the temozolomide re -
challenge group B3 of the Perry et al. JCO 2010 study as a comparator.  
Response rate was considered an appropriate primary objective since this was 
considered a predominantly chemotherapy based trial.  We did not anticipate 
radiation -induced MRI changes (pseudo -progression) given the very low doses 
of radiation that are prescribed in this clin ical trial.  
 
As of 2/10/2017, 22 patients had  been treated on study.  At the time of the 
interim analysis , there were no clinical responses .  Given the unexpected 
number of patients experiencing pseudo -progression on this study, and the 
possible implications of this for assessing response rate  or progression free 
survival (PFS) , the primary objective of this study is being  changed to one year 
overall survival  (OS) . The current one year OS is 45.1% (80% CI: 28.2%, 
60.9%).  The median  OS at th is tim e is 9.5 months  with a median follow -up of 
12.7 months .  When stratifying by tumor type there is no statistically 
significant difference in outcomes by group.  The 17 patients with 
glioblastoma have a 1 year overall survival of 33% (80% CI: 13% -79%) and 
the 1 year overall survival for the 5 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma is 
60% ( 80% CI: 13% -79%) .  These data suggest  that early termination of the 
study due to futility is not warranted  and support the revision of the primary 
endpoint to allow completion  of the study with the originally intended sample 
size. 
 
 
9.1.2 Endpoints  
September 29, 2022  
 14  
9.1.2.1  Safety Run-In 
 
  9.1.2.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
 
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as h ematologic toxicity 
during the month following cycle #1 of temozolomide plus LDFRT  
grade ≥3 by NCI common toxicity criteria version 4.  All patients 
who receive any amount of LDFRT will be evaluable for toxicity. 
The recommended phase II dose will be the highest dose yields ≤ 
33% DLT  rate.   
 
    9.1.2.1.2  Secondary Endpoint  
 
Radiation -associated neurologic toxicity of LDFRT plus 
temozolomide using the RTOG/EORTC acute  (≤3 months) and late  
(>3 months) radiation morbidity scoring criteria at 3, 6 and 12 
months following completion of therapy.  Since the total radiation 
dose to the brain is low and delivered in very small fractions, the 
likelihood of radiation associated toxicity is expected to be low.  
The radiation -induced necrosis rate is less than 5% in patients with 
recurrent gliomas re -irradiated to a median dose of 36 Gy using 
conventional 2 Gy fractions (Combs JCO 2005).  However, we will 
be collecting late radiation toxicity data and if there are four 
patients with radiation related  symptomatic  necro sis believed to be 
a result  of the LDFRT , the trial will be suspended to accrual and a 
safety review by the institutional DSMB will be requested.  
 
 
9.1.2.1  Phase  II 
Amended Primary Objective: Estimate one year OS in 
patients treated with LDFRT + temozolomide for recurrent 
GBM.  
 
9.1.2.1.1  Primary Endpoint : OS will be measured from initial salvage 
starting date to the date of death.  
 
 
9.1.2.1.2   Secondary Endpoints : 
 
          9.1.2.1.1.1.1  PFS-6: The definition of progression will be 
based on RANO criteria ( 19).  Progression free will be measured from 
initial salvage starting date  to the date of progressive disease is defined 
(documented).   
 
9.1.2.1.1.1.1  Occurrence of pseudoprogression  at any time point 
will be recorded as a binary variable for each patient 
(yes/no)  
September 29, 2022  
 15  
9.1.2.1.1.1.2              
Use NCI common toxicity criteria (version 4, see 
section 5.2.1) to record the toxicity of LDFRT 
plus temozolomide for each patient associated 
with the treatment .  All patients who receive any 
amount of LDFRT will be evaluable for toxicity.  
 
        1.2.1.1.1.3 Use the RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation 
morbidity scoring criteria (see appendix B and C ) to 
record the toxicity of LDFRT plus temozolomide for 
each patient with recurrent HGG .  All patients who 
receive any amount of LDFRT will be evaluable for 
toxicity.  
 
9.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
9.2.1 Sample Size   
 
9.2.1.1  Safety run-in 
 
A minimum of 6 and up to 24 patients will be enrolled for the safety run -
in study  at an accrual rate of 1 patients per month  at the starting dose 0.5 
Gy twice daily  on days 1 -5 of temo zolomide . The exact number of  
patients will depend on the number of dose levels in this phase.  
 
 
 
         9.2.1.2 Phase  II 
 
Amended Primary O bjective :  The amended primary objective of the 
study is one year OS.  The current one year OS after 22 patients have 
been enrolled and followed for a median of 12.7 months is 41.5% (80 % 
CI: 25%, 68%).   The one y ear OS for the historical reference used for 
this study, TMZ alone (Perry JCO 2010 ), was reported as 28.6%.  
Claiming improvement in one year OS within the context of a  protocol 
with a n amended primary objective would not be justified, however, the 
lower b ound of the current 80% confidence interval is fairly promising 
compared to the historical estimate.  Additional follow -up of the current 
patients and completing enrollment to the sample size of 31 will allow us 
to estimate one year OS with greater precisi on: width of current CI 0.33 
versus simulated mean width of 0.23,  Table 1 .  A one year OS with a 
lower bound of an 80% CI greater than 28% would be considered 
sufficiently promising for further study.

Original Primary Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to 
evaluate the  therapeutic efficacy of LDFRT plus temozolomide  in patient s 
with recurrent HGG .  A true (partial or complete) response rate  below 10% 
is considered clinically insignificant and a true (partial or complete) 
response rate above 25% clinically is considered clinically significant. A 2 -
stage design  will be used  to follow for early termination if there is strong  
early evidence to support the null hypothesis that the true  response rate is 
at most 10%. The alternative hypothesis is  that the true response rate is at 
least 25%.  A total of 31 patients will yield 80% power to detect a response 
rate (PR+CR) of 25% compared to a 10% rate among patients treated by 
TMZ alone (Perry JCO 2010) at a one -side alpha level of 0.1. Note that in 
this study (Perry JCO 2010) the outcomes for the “rechallenge” GBM 
group was comparable to the AA group.  
  
           In the first stage, if 2 or fewer pati ents of the first  20 accrued to the study  
show  response  (PR+CR) , the study will be  terminated. Otherwise, the 
study  will continue to  a second stage with additional 11 patients to a total 
of 31 patients . If 6 or more out of the 31 patients had PR or CR, th e 
LDFRT plus temozolomide  will be considered efficacious and 
recommended for  future comparative study.  The estimated probability of 
early stopping for null is 68%. The probability of early stopping under the 
alternative hypothesis is 9%.  The 6 patients from the selected phase II 
dose enrolled in the safe ty run-in will count towards the phase II trial, so 
that the minimum number of patient for the study is 31 and the maximum 
is 49 .  
 
Safety Monitoring:  
 
Early stopping for toxicity:  according to observed severe adverse event 
(about 5% necrosis rate) that related to RT from the study with higher RT 
dose than this study among re -radiation HGG patients ( Combs JCO 2005 ), 
it is very unlikely this low RT dose study will yield DLTs or later RT 
toxicity as necrosis. However, the study will monitor SAEs (RT related 
DLTs or Necrosis) continuously through the trial. Assuming the low dose 
RT related SAE  rate follows a binomial distribution.  In general, the trial 
enrollment will be suspend for saf ety consultation if a posterior probability 
of SAE  rate excee ding 0.2  is great than 60%.  The prior for th is monitoring 
rule is a Beta distribution assuming a mean SAE rate of 5%.  
September 29, 2022  
 17 The safety stopping rule  and the operating characteristics are shown below 
and there are based on 5 000 simulations:  
 
SAE event in 2 out of 3 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.6  
SAE event in 3 out of 6 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.7  
SAE event in 4 out of 9 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.76  
SAE event in 4 out of 12 patient s.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.62  
SAE event in 5 out of 15 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.69  
SAE event in 6 out of 18 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.74  
SAE event in 6 out of 21 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.63  
SAE event in 7 out of 24 patients.  Pr(R isk>0.2| Data) = 0.69  
SAE event in 8 out of 27 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.74  
SAE event in 8 out of 30 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.65  
SAE event in 9 out of 35 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.64  
SAE event in 10 out of 40 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2 | Data) = 0.63  
SAE event in 11 out of 45 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.62  
SAE event in 13 out of 55 patients.  Pr(Risk>0.2| Data) = 0.61

All SAEs or toxicity events will be tabulated by type and grade based on 
NCI CTC Version 4.0 fo r toxicity and adverse events.  SAEs with an 
attribution of possible or above will be evaluated for early stopping. 
Proportion of individual type of SAE event will be estimated using the 
binomial distribution along with 95% confidence interval (exact method).  
 
9.2.1.3   Accrual  
 
    We anticipate enrollment of approximately 1-2 patient s per month to the    
     protocol with accrual completed in approximately 3-4 years .   
 
        9.2.1.4    Stratification Factors  
 
        There will be no stratification factors upon initial enrollment in the protocol.   
 
9.3    Statistical Methods of Analysis  
 
9.3.1    Safety/Toxicity:   NCI CTC version 4.0 will be used for scoring the toxicity and  
      adverse event s.   The severity and frequency of the toxicity will be tabulated by  
      the tested dose or doses using descriptive statistics. The proportions of patient  
      who experienced grade 3 or above toxicities will be estimated, along with 95%  
September 29, 2022  
 18            confidence inter vals by each type of toxicity.  
 
9.3.2  Pseudo -progression:  The proportion of patients who had pseudo -progression 
will be reported with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
9.3.2  PFS-6: The definition of progression will be based on RANO criteria ( 19).  
          Progression free will be measured from initial salvage starting date  to the date of  
          progressive disease is defined (documented). The proportion of PFS -6 will be  
          estimated along with 95% confidence intervals using the exact  binomial method . 
 
9.3.3 OS: the survival time is defined from the date of treat ment start to the date of death .  
           Patients who have no t died by the analysis data cut -off date will be censored at their last  
date known to be alive. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate one        
year survival,  and median survival along with 80% confidence intervals.  
 
9.3.4  Radiation Toxicity:  descriptive statistics will be used to summarize radiation  
          toxicity based on the RTOG/EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring  
          criteria (see appendix B and C ) for all patient s who had any radiation treatment  
          in this study.    
 
10.   ADVERSE EVENTS AND RECORDING  
 
10.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
        
      An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical      
      condition or the deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition during or following           
      an exposure to a treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the      
      treatment.  An undesirable medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea),          
      signs (tachycardia, enlarged liver), or abnormal results of an in vestigation (MRI,   
      laboratory finding).  In clinical trials, from the time of signing an informed consent,   
      an AE may include an undesirable medical condition, occurring at any time, even if  
      no trial treatment has been administered.  
 
10.2      Radiation Related Adverse Events   
 
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.  
 
      10.3 Chemotherapy Related Adverse Events  
 
The adverse events (both hematologic and non -hematologic) that patients experience 
due to chemotherapy will be recorded on appropriate case report forms only if they are 
greater than or equal to grade 3, result in a delay in treatment, or are required to b e 
reported per institutional guidelines.   
 
11. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) AND REPORTING  
 
11.1    Serious Adverse Event  
September 29, 2022  
 19 11.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring at any point during a clinical trial that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 
  ● Results in death.  
 
  ● Is immediately life threatening.  
 
  ● Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization.  
 
  ● Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
● Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly related 
to the research.  Unexpected means that the event was not described in the 
consent form or the event exceeded the expected sev erity.  
 
● Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may 
require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
11.2      SAE Reporting Guidelines for Johns Hopkins Hospital  
 
All SAE, with the exception of death, must be reported to the Johns Hopkins Hospital 
Institutional Review Board (JH -IRB) within 10 working days of the principal 
investigator learning of the event.  Reporting for the death of a patient which was 
unexpected (i.e.: not related to a risk of participation that was listed in the protocol or 
the consent document, and was more likely than not to be caused by the research 
procedure/intervention, must be reported to the JH -IRB within 3 working days of 
when the princi pal investigator receives the report of the death.  Reporting for death of 
a participant that was expected due to the nature of the patient’s underlying disease or 
condition, or identified as caused by a possible risk of the study 
procedure/intervention as  described in this protocol or consent form, must be reported 
to the JH -IRB within 10 working days from the time the principal investigator learns 
of the event.  If death occurs 30 days after the participant has stopped or completed 
their study treatment, the principal investigator does not have to report the death until 
the time of continuing review.   
 
12.    DATA AND SAFETY REPORTING/ REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 12.1  Data Quality Monitoring  
 
The SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for 
JHU affiliated sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). 
The SMC Subcommittee will determine the level of patient safety risk and 
level/frequency of monitoring

 12.2   Data Safety Monitoring  Plan  
 
The SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for 
JHU affiliated sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). 
The SMC Subcommittee will determine the level of patient safety risk and 
level/frequency of monitoring  
 
12.3 Data Reportin g 
 
12.3.1 Method  
     
    Data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs). These CRFs will  be    
    completed by the study coordinator. The CRFs for each subject will be kept in  
    a separate  research binder. Along with each completed CRF there will  be    
    corresponding source documentation filed for verification. The Principal    
    Investigator, Research Study Nurse, and Study Coordinator will informally   
    meet on a regular basis to make sure that the trial is progressing as mandated   
    by the protocol. The CRO will audit this trial per their standards  to ensure    
    and verify that the protocol is be carried out according to specs as well as to   
    verify that data included on subject CRFs are accurate. Exit reports generated   
    as a result of these CRO audits will be forwarded to both the Safety     
    Monitoring Committee as well as to the adjudicating IRB of record for review.

1 Baseline evaluations and imaging are to be conducted within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy.  
2 Patients  receive temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter ) and 0.5 Gy of radiation therapy twic e daily (at least 6 hrs. apart) for 5 days during each 28 day cycle  for a total of 6 cycles  or until 
the time of disease progression.  Cycles 1 through 6 will always  start on a Monday . 
3Medical history should be a complete history at pre -study evaluation, but later histories may  be interval toxicity evaluation s only.   
September 29, 2022  
 27 4Laboratory tests will be requested and performed at the discretion of the patient’s medical oncolog ist.  
5Use RTOG Acute Toxicity Criteria during RT and for first 6 months following completion of RT.  Use RTOG Late Toxicity Criteri a at baseline and at scheduled intervals 6 months following completion 
of RT.  
6MRI imaging will be performed approximately e very 2 months during temozolomide and then according to the schedule outlined above.  MRI sequences must include at a minimum  T1 with 
gadolinium, T2 and FLAIR sequences.  Other sequences may be obtained at the provider’s discretion.  An MRI which is delaye d or missed as a result of the deterioration of the patient’s clinical 
condition or other adversity will not be considered a protocol violation.

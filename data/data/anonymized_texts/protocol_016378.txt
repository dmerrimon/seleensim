Title Fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) for the evaluation of intracranial neoplasm 
(UC-GlioFET)
Patient population Patient population 1: Patients with intracranial neoplasms (glial or 
metastatic disease) with concern for recurrence or progression on 
conventional imaging (e.g., MRI). Three sub-populations will be 
considered:
1. Recurrent metastatic lesions
2. Recurrent high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4)
3. Recurrent low-grade gliomas (Grades 1 and 2)
Patient population 2: Patients with suspected glial neoplasms (Grade 
2-4) planning to undergo biopsy or surgery prior to primary treatment 
(radiation therapy and/or surgery)
Rationale for Study FET accumulates in malignant cells within intracranial neoplasms 
and can be used to detect recurrent disease and characterize grade 
of glial neoplasms.
Primary Objectives 1) To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign 
treatment- related changes and recurrence in comparison to 
pathology in population 1 with recurrent metastatic disease 
and high-grade gliomas.
2) To determine if FET PET can differentiate between low-grade 
and high- grade gliomas in population 2.
Secondary 
Objectives1) To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign 
treatment- related changes and recurrence in comparison to 
pathology or imaging follow-up in population 1.
2) To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign 
treatment- related changes and recurrence in comparison to 
pathology in population 1 with recurrent low-grade gliomas.
Exploratory 
Objectives1) To assess relationships between serial FET PET and clinical 
outcome in population 1 with recurrent metastatic disease and 
gliomas.
2) To determine if MRI can differentiate between benign treatment- 
related changes and recurrence.
Study Design   This is a prospective, Phase 2, single center, open-label study in 
patients with intracranial neoplasms. There is a provision of Stopping 
Rules for the Pediatric patient population.

Phase II – FET PET  Page 8 of 301 Introduction
1.1 Overview
Imaging using the amino acid-based PET tracer O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) is a 
promising imaging platform for both primary and secondary brain neoplasms. However, 
widespread incorporation of FET-PET into the routine clinical management of brain tumor 
patients has not occurred within the United States. The primary issue associated with this 
promising imaging agent is the lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The goal of this protocol is to obtain prospective data and the safety and efficacy of FET for the 
detection of intracranial neoplasms with the goal to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for 
this agent. To date we are not aware of an institution on the United States who has previously 
obtained an IND for FDA or submitted an FDA application. We are aiming to achieve two 
indications with this study. The first is the ability to accurately detect recurrent disease in 
patients who have previously undergone surgery and/or radiation. The second indication is the 
ability to distinguish low-grade glial neoplasms from high-grade glial neoplasms.
1.2 Background 
Glial tumors are the most common primary neoplasms affecting the central nervous system. 
This heterogeneous group of tumors is classified as low or high grade based on histologic 
features such as the presence of increased cellularity, mitotic activity or necrosis (1). Due to 
their infiltrative nature, gliomas are rarely cured via surgical resection, contributing to a 
disproportionately high morbidity and mortality (2,3).
Imaging techniques play an important role in the clinical management of neuro-oncology 
patients. Anatomic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the mainstay for initial 
diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment follow-up of brain tumors given its widespread 
availability, high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast. However, conventional MRI 
techniques have several important limitations in brain tumor imaging, including those currently 
used to define disease progression as part of the RANO criteria (Response Assessment in 
Neuro-Oncology) (4). Contrast enhancement, a marker of blood-brain barrier permeation, is 
neither sensitive nor specific for the presence of tumor tissue. The majority of low-grade glial 
neoplasms do not enhance, while inflammatory processes common in the postsurgical/post 
treatment setting often enhance avidly. A diagnostic dilemma occurs in up to 30% of patients 
within the first 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiotherapy, whereby an enlarging area 
of contrast enhancement on MRI may represent either early tumor progression, which 
necessitates a change in the ongoing treatment regimen, versus “pseudoprogression”, which 
represents non-progressive treatment-related change that does not require alteration of the 
treatment regimen.
Positron-emission tomography (PET), which has the capability to image specific metabolic 
processes using radiolabeled endogenous molecules, is another imaging modality with high 
potential for use in neuro-oncology. The most widely used PET tracer is the glucose analogue 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, FDG is not ideal for brain tumor imaging given the high 
background uptake of normal brain parenchyma and limited specificity in distinguishing between 
progressive tumor and post-treatment inflammation. O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) is 
an amino acid-based PET tracer with high uptake in brain tumors and relatively low uptake in 
normal brain parenchyma (5). Various studies have demonstrated the ability of FET-PET to 
detect recurrent gliomas with higher sensitivity and specificity compared with conventional 
imaging techniques (6,7). Additionally, the value of using FET-PET tumor grading has also been 
shown (8).
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 9 of 30We believe that FET PET has significant promise in the imaging and characterization of patients 
with primary and secondary intra-cranial neoplasms. This protocol is intended to focus on the 
two main applications of the radiotracer in order to obtain the data required for the submission of 
an NDA application from the FDA.
Of note, we will follow-up patients without histologic correlation in order to determine the 
accuracy of imaging follow-up as a possible replacement for histology as a marker of disease 
recurrence. This will be the motivation and goal of the study’s secondary objective.
1.3 Patient Population
Patient population 1: Patients with intracranial neoplasms (glial or metastatic disease) with 
concern for recurrence or progression on conventional imaging (e.g., MRI). This population will 
be broken into three groups:
1. Recurrent metastatic lesions
2. Recurrent high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4)
3. Recurrent low-grade gliomas (Grades 1 and 2)
Patient population 2: Patients with suspected glial neoplasms (Grade 2-4) planning to undergo 
biopsy or surgery prior to primary treatment (radiation therapy and/or surgery).
2 Objectives of the Study
2.1 Primary 
To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes 
and recurrence in comparison to pathology in population 1. Two sub-populations will be 
considered for the primary endpoint:
oRecurrent metastatic lesions
oRecurrent high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4)
To determine if FET PET can accurately differentiate between low-grade and high-grade 
gliomas in population 2.
2.2 Secondary 
To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes 
and recurrence in comparison to pathology or imaging follow-up in population 1.
To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes 
and recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1 patients with recurrent 
low-grade gliomas (Grades 1 and 2).
2.3 Exploratory 
To assess relationships between serial FET PET and clinical outcome (benign 
treatment-related changes and recurrence) in patients with recurrent metastatic lesion, 
recurrent high grade gliomas and recurrent low grade gliomas.
To determine if MRI can differentiate between benign treatment- related changes and 
recurrence.

3 Study Design
3.1 Characteristics
This is a prospective, Phase 2, single center, open-label study in patients with intracranial 
neoplasms. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. All study 
participants will undergo a single FET PET study. Repeat FET PET will be offered to adult 
patients and not in pediatric patients.
3.2 Stopping Rules
For pediatric patients, patients will be reviewed after imaging, and if inappropriate patient 
management is instituted based upon the results of the 18F-FET PET imaging, then we will 
suspend enrollment of pediatric patients until the case is reviewed with the FDA and the 
neurooncology site committee.
3.3 Number of Subjects
It is anticipated that 199 patients over four years will be enrolled in this study.
3.4 Eligibility Criteria
Patients must have baseline evaluations performed prior to the administration of the 
radiopharmaceutical and must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, the patient 
must be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule 
and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written 
informed consent must be obtained from the patient prior to enrollment. The following criteria 
apply to all patients enrolled onto the study unless otherwise specified.
Patients participating in other clinical trials will be eligible for this study including patients 
undergoing surgery guided by 5-aminolevulinic acid.
3.4.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Presence or suspicion of intracranial neoplasm in two populations:
a. Population 1: patients after primary treatment (radiation therapy and/or surgery) 
with suspicion of recurrence on MRI. Three sub-populations will be considered:
i. Recurrent metastatic lesions
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 11 of 30ii. Recurrent high-grade gliomas (Grades 3 and 4)
iii. Recurrent low-grade gliomas (Grades 1 and 2)
b. Population 2: patients prior to primary treatment with planned biopsy or surgical 
resection.
2. Age > 3 years.
3.4.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Patient with known incompatibility to PET or CT/MRI scans.
2. Patient unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements and 
judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable for study participation.
a. Sedation or anesthesia can be used for patients who cannot tolerate the exam.
3.5 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Study drug will be given per protocol, unless any of the following discontinuation criteria are 
met:
Unacceptable adverse event(s);
Participant decides to discontinue study drug (with or without concurrent withdrawal of 
informed consent);
Significant participant non-compliance with protocol;
If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously; or, 
recognized) that precludes further study drug administration.
General or specific changes in the participant’s condition render the participant 
unacceptable for study drug administration in the judgment of the investigator.
Participants will be discontinued from study drug administration when any of these criteria apply.  
The reason for discontinuation, and the date the participant discontinued (defined as the later 
date of decision to discontinue drug or last dose) must be documented in the case report form 
(CRF). Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed as 
described in Section 7.3. Participants who do not receive study drug will be replaced.
3.6 Duration of Follow Up
Patients will be in follow-up up until their planned biopsy or surgery is performed to correlate 
imaging findings with histology. Follow-up will be performed off study, and there are no study 
specific related procedures that are required after the imaging study. If patients do not undergo 
biopsy or surgery, we will review imaging that was performed as clinical standard of care to 
determine if the lesion has grown as part of the secondary aims. 
3.7 Study Discontinuation/Withdrawal 
Participants will be discontinued/withdrawn from study participation when any of the following 
criteria apply:
Completion of study intervention and follow-up per protocol 
Lost to follow-up
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 12 of 30Withdrawal of consent for data submission
Death
Study termination
The reason for discontinuing study participation and the off-study date must be documented in 
the case report form (CRF).
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason at their own request or 
at the request of their legally acceptable representative. Participants will be asked for reason(s) 
of withdrawal and presence of any AEs for documentation in the CRF. If possible, the participant 
will be seen and assessed by the Investigator and AEs followed according to protocol.
The study may be terminated early for any reason, which may include, but is not limited to:  
Changes in the benefit-risk assessment
Decision to stop manufacturing study drug
In the event of early study termination, follow up medical records collection may occur, as 
described in Section 3.6, for participants who remain on study at that time. Investigators will be 
notified of any additional steps that are necessary to protect participants’ interests. Investigators 
must notify the IRB and other applicable stakeholders, in accordance with local laws and 
regulations. 
3.8 Study Timeline
3.8.1 Primary Completion 
The study will reach primary completion 48 months from the time the study opens to accrual.
3.8.2 Study Completion
The study will reach study completion 60 months from the time the study opens to accrual.
4 Study Drugs
4.1 Description, Supply and Storage of Investigational Products
4.1.1 Investigational Drug #1
O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) is a radiopharmaceutical that will be produced under 
cGMP by a research pharmacists certified and highly experienced in the Department of 
Radiology and Biomedical Engineering. 
5 Treatment Plan
5.1 Patient Preparation
Patients will fast for four hours prior to examination as per joint EANM/EANO/RANO practice 
guidelines/SNMMI procedure standards for imaging of gliomas using PET with radiolabeled 
amino acids.
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 13 of 305.2 Dosage and Administration
The imaging agent (FET) will be administered on an outpatient basis. It will be administered 
intravenously within the PET scanner at the time of imaging. The nominal injected dose will be 4 
to 7 mCi ±10% of FET per imaging time point. Pediatric doses will be adjusted based upon the 
patient’s weight (dose = [ (patient weight in kg)/70 kg ] x adult dose). The maximum dose will be 
7 mCi, adjusted by weight.
5.2.1 Other Modalities or Procedures
5.2.1.1 PET Imaging
Participants may undergo sedation as required in order to successfully undergo imaging. 
Sedation or anesthesia will be administered per institutional protocol.
Study participants will undergo the FET PET imaging after all screening and baseline 
assessments have been completed. The radiopharmaceutical will be administered while the 
patient is in the PET scanner, and imaging will last for 40 minutes. Acquired PET data will be 
reconstructed so that three time points are created:
1. Perfusion: 60-second acquisition that starts immediately when activity is noted in the 
field of view.
2. Equilibrium: 10-minute acquisition acquired between 10 and 20 minutes after injection.
3. Washout: 10-minute acquisition acquired between 30 and 40 minutes after injection.
Additionally, a 20 minute acquisition will be reconstructed between 20 and 40 minutes after 
injection to match the analysis performed in Lohmann et al (8).
Each study will be reviewed by a board-certified nuclear medicine physician and 
neuroradiologist within seven working days of the completion of the study, and a formal report 
will be dictated. This will be performed separately from the final analysis. The imaging findings 
on FET PET will be provided to the neurosurgeon and can be used in addition to MRI for 
planning of biopsy and surgery. For patients who received subsequent surgery, if possible the 
multi-parametric imaging examination will be used to target 1-4 tissue samples that have distinct 
metabolic findings for distinguishing recurrent disease from treatment effects.
If imaging is performed on a PET/MRI, a gadolinium-based contrast will be administered. The 
patient’s eGFR will be checked and gadolinium will be administered per radiology department 
guidelines. The MRI protocol will include the clinical standard MRI. The MRI protocol may also 
contain research sequences such as novel sequences used for attenuation correction on 
PET/MRI (ie ZTE or zero echo time) and MRI spectroscopy sequences.
Optional repeat FET PET imaging will be offered to adult patients.
5.3 Monitoring and Toxicity Management
Each patient receiving FET will be evaluable for safety. The safety parameters include vital 
signs (heart rate and blood pressure) as well as physical findings and spontaneous reports of 
adverse events reported to the investigator by patients.
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 14 of 306 Study Procedures and Observations
Screening assessments must be performed within 30 days prior to the first dose of 
investigational product. Any results falling outside of the reference ranges may be repeated at 
the discretion of the investigator. Treatment or visit delays for public holidays or weather 
conditions do not constitute a protocol violation.
A written, signed, informed consent form (ICF) and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be obtained before any study-specific 
assessments are initiated. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject and a copy will 
be filed in the medical record. The original will be kept on file with the study records.
REDCap will be used to collect data for this study. REDCap is a secure, HIPAA-compliant, web- 
based system.
6.1.1 Treatment Period
FET administration and adverse event evaluation
oEvaluation of adverse events 20 min after completion of imaging, ± 60 min

7 Evaluation of Safety 
7.1 Definitions
7.1.1 Evaluable for Toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of FET administration.
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 15 of 307.1.2 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related. More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.
7.1.3 Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by the use of a drug. Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
7.1.4 Suspected
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
7.1.5 Unexpected
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure. For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
7.1.6 Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 16 of 30A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life function
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
7.1.7 Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
7.2 Recording of an Adverse Event
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0. The 
Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug.
Relationship Attribution Description
Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related  to the 
intervention Unrelated to investigational 
drug/intervention Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related to the 
intervention
Possible The AE may be related  to the 
intervention
Probable The AE is likely related to the 
interventionRelated to investigational 
drug/intervention
Definite The AE is clearly related to the 
intervention
Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by the Investigator 
according to the CTCAE. When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be 
graded by the Investigator as none, mild, moderate or severe according to the following grades 
and definitions:
Grade 0 No AE (or within normal limits)
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, 
cautery) indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily 
living (ADL)
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 17 of 30Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5: Death related to AE
7.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event. For selected adverse events for which administration of the 
investigational drug was stopped, a re-challenge of the subject with the investigational drug may 
be conducted if considered both safe and ethical by the Investigator.
7.4 Expedited Reporting 
7.4.1 Reporting to the HDFCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study drug(s) 
or to a study procedure, the UCSF PI or his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair (or 
qualified alternate) within 1 business day of knowledge of the event.  The contact may be by 
phone or e-mail.
7.4.2 Reporting to Institutional Review Board
The Principal Investigator must report events meeting the UCSF CHR definition of 
“Unanticipated Problem” (UP) and the San Francisco VA Medical Center within 5 business days 
of his/her awareness of the event.
7.4.3 Expedited Reporting to the FDA
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor-Investigator) is 
responsible for determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for 
expedited reporting in accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor-Investigator) must report in an IND safety report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor needs to ensure that the 
event meets all three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in 7.1.4)
Unexpected (as defined in 7.1.5)
Serious (as defined in 7.1.6)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 18 of 30Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days  after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)). 
Please see Appendix 2 for further details on the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) policies and 
procedures.
8 Statistical Considerations and Evaluation of Results
8.1 Study Endpoints
To determine if FET PET can accurately predict the presence of recurrent tumor in 
patients previously treated with surgery and/or radiation for population 1, broken down 
by metastatic disease, high-grade gliomas and low-grade gliomas.
To determine if FET PET can accurately differentiate between low-grade and high-grade 
glial neoplasms for population 2.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size and Power Estimate
We will provide a sample size for both populations. We expect that 60% of our patients will be 
imaged for recurrent disease after surgery and/or radiation therapy, and we expect that 40% of 
our patients will be imaged prior to initial therapy for glial malignancy.
Population 1: For our primary endpoint we will use a misclassification rate as our statistical 
endpoint, defined as the percentage of patients that are classified incorrectly as either recurrent 
disease and treatment related changes (ie misclassification rate = [FP+FN]/[FP+FN+TP+TN]).
True positive (TP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology/follow-up 
demonstrates tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample.
False positive (FP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology/follow-up negative 
tumor recurrence in none of the biopsy samples.
True negative (TN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology/follow-up negative 
tumor recurrence in none of the biopsy samples.
False negative (FN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology/follow-up 
demonstrates tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample.
For our sample size analysis, we will break it down by the three subpopulations:
Recurrent metastatic disease: We estimate that there will be a prevalence of 65% for 
recurrent metastatic tumor at time of imaging. Papers that estimate misclassification rate 
have shown a misclassification rate of 24% (sensitivity of 86.7%, specificity of 68.2%, 
and a prevalence of 43%) for perfusion MRI (9), a misclassification rate of 46% 
(sensitivity of 59%, specificity of 41%, and a prevalence of 75%) for lesion quotient MRI. 
For FET PET, the literature has shown a misclassification rate ranging from 7 to 17%:
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 19 of 30oMisclassification rate of 17% with a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 85% and 
prevalence of 84% (10).
oMisclassification rate of 7% with a sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 91% and 
prevalence of 48% (11).
For our sample size analysis, we have used a binomial test for proportions. Assuming a 
misclassification rate of 35% for conventional MRI and 10% for FET PET, we will need to 
image 34 patients with pathologic correlation to demonstrate the difference with a 
significance level of 0.01 with a power of 90%, and a one-sided test. Our null hypothesis 
is that there is no difference between MRI and FET PET misclassification rates (H_null: 
MRI_misclass = FET PET misclass = 35%). The alternative hypothesis is that the FET 
PET misclassification rate is lower (H_alt: FET PET misclass < MRI_misclass = 35%). 
We estimate that 55% of patients will have pathology as a correlate, and we will replace 
all patients who do not have pathology within four weeks of imaging to fill our primary 
endpoint. Therefore the total patient population in population 1 with metastatic lesions 
will be 62 patients.
Recurrent high grade glioma (Grade 3 and 4): Based on prior data from UCSF, we 
anticipate that 70% of patients will have recurrent tumor at the time of imaging (12). 
Using this same paper as an estimate of misclassification rate using MRI for the 
characterization of recurrent tumor, results in a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 76%, 
prevalence of 70% and a misclassification rate of 19.8%. For FET PET, the first paper to 
publish the sensitivity and specificity of FET PET was Rachinger et al in 2005; they 
reported a sensitivity, specificity and misclassification rate of 100%, 93% and 2% 
respectively (45 patients with a prevalence of 69%) (13). A subsequent paper published 
in 31 patients, 26 of whom had recurrent tumor, had a sensitivity of 100% and a 
specificity of 84%, resulting in a misclassification rate of 2.6% (14). A third paper looked 
at the ability to characterize pseudoprogression after radiochemotherapy all of whom 
had an enhancing lesion on MRI, demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity and 
misclassification rate of 100%, 91% and 5% respectively (6). No meta-analysis exists for 
estimating the accuracy of FET PET, and therefore we have selected 5% as a 
reasonable goal misclassification rate. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference 
between MRI and FET PET misclassification rates (19.8% for MRI and 5% for FET 
PET). For our sample size analysis, we have used a binomial test for proportions. We 
will need to image 27 patients with pathologic correlation to demonstrate the difference 
with a significance level of 0.05 with a power of 80%, and using a one-sided t-test. Our 
null hypothesis is that there is no difference between MRI and FET PET misclassification 
rates (H_null: MRI_misclass = FET PET misclass = 19.8%). The alternative hypothesis 
is that the FET PET misclassification rate is lower (H_alt: FET PET misclass < 
MRI_misclass = 19.8%). We estimate that 40% of patients will have pathology as a 
correlate, and we will replace all patients who do not have pathology within four weeks of 
imaging to fill our primary endpoint. Therefore the total patient population in population 1 
with high grade gliomas will be 68 patients.
Recurrent low-grade glioma (Grade 1 and 2): We are including this population as a 
secondary endpoint in order to gain information on the role of FET PET in the 
characterization of low-grade gliomas. We aim to image 20 patients as part of this cohort 
to obtain preliminary information about the role of FET PET in this population.
Population 2: For population 2 we have also selected a misclassification rate for the 
characterization of tumor as either low or high grade. Most of the data on the literature for the 
effectiveness of conventional imaging (MRI) for the classification of disease is reported as 
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 20 of 30sensitivity and specificities; the best meta-analysis available suggests that MR spectroscopy 
has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70% (15). In this meta-analysis of 25 studies, there 
were 427 low-grade and 802 high-grade tumors, resulting in a prevalence of 65% for high-grade 
tumors. Assuming a prevalence of 65%, this would imply a misclassification rate of 27% for 
conventional imaging. Using a recent FET PET article that demonstrated a sensitivity and 
specificity of 100% and 73% respectively for the characterization of low-grade and high-grade 
gliomas with a prevalence of 52%, we would estimate a misclassification rate of roughly 13% for 
FET PET (16). Therefore our target misclassification rate is 13%. Our null hypothesis is that 
there is no difference between MRI and FET PET misclassification rates (27% for MRI and 13% 
for FET PET). For our sample size analysis, we have used a binomial test for proportions. We 
will need to image 49 patients with pathologic correlation to demonstrate the difference with a 
significance level of 0.05 with a power of 80%, using a one-sided test. Our null hypothesis is 
that there is no difference between MRI and FET PET misclassification rates (H_null: 
MRI_misclass = FET PET misclass = 27%). The alternative hypothesis is that the FET PET 
misclassification rate is lower (H_alt: FET PET misclass < MRI_misclass = 27%).
8.2.1 Accrual Estimates
We estimate that 50 patients with intracranial neoplasms will be enrolled each year, and we 
estimate that we will enroll 199 patients over the four years of the study.
8.3 Analyses Plans 
8.3.1 Analysis Population
There will be two analysis populations. The first population will be patients with intracranial 
neoplasm (both glial and metastatic disease) previously treated with surgery and/or radiation 
therapy where there is concern for recurrent disease. The second population will be patients 
with suspicion or known glial malignancy planning on undergoing biopsy or surgery.
The safety analysis dataset will include all patients who completed initial FET PET imaging per 
protocol. 
The efficacy analysis dataset will include all patients who completed initial FET PET imaging per 
protocol (repeat FET PET imaging is excluded). FET PET scans that are not readable due to 
data or scanner errors will be excluded from efficacy analyses. 
8.3.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
All imaging studies will be reviewed by three nuclear medicine physicians blinded to the 
patient’s history and their pathology. Each physician will undergo a reader-training course that 
will involve FET PET cases not included in the study reads.
Population 1: recurrent neoplasm versus treatment related effects. Each of the 
subpopulations will be treated separately, but the analysis will be identical for the 
recurrent high-grade glioma and recurrent metastatic lesions.
Imaging Interpretation for Population 1 will involve 1) qualitative, 2) quantitative, and 3) 
overall assessments.  For each patient, the reader will qualitatively determine the 
number of lesions present on the study to be characterized.  For each lesion, the 
following will be performed:
1) Qualitative/Visual Assessment
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 21 of 30For each lesion, readers will assess whether the lesion is consistent with recurrence or 
treatment-related changes. 
2) Quantitative Assessment
Quantitative assessments will be performed on transaxial slices showing the highest 
FET accumulation, as described by Galldiks (6). Quantitative analysis will be performed 
on the 20-40 minute imaging time point (8). First, readers will determine the SUVmean of 
background normal tissue by marking a large region of interest (ROI) on the contralateral 
hemisphere in an area of unaffected brain tissue. Second, a volume of interest will be 
placed around the lesion, and within that volume a threshold segmentation will be 
performed using a lower limit threshold of background SUVmean x 1.6. Third, a 1.6 cm 
diameter circular ROI will be centered on the qualitatively hottest portion of FET uptake. 
TBRmax will be calculated by dividing the SUVmean of the 1.6 cm diameter circular ROI 
by the SUVmean of background normal tissue. TBRmean will be calculated by dividing 
the SUVmean of the lesion volume of interest (using the background SUVmean x 1.6 
threshold) by the SUVmean of background normal tissue. Lesions will be quantitatively 
evaluated in a binary fashion as recurrence if TBRmax > 2.3 or treatment-related 
changes if TBRmax ≤ 2.3. For indeterminate lesions, readers will be allowed to use 
TBRmean to evaluate for recurrence vs. treatment-related changes. Additionally, the 
SUVmax of the lesion and the SUVpeak will also be calculated.
3) Overall Assessment
Based on qualitative and quantitative assessments, readers will make an overall 
determination whether FET uptake is most consistent with recurrence or treatment-
related changes.  For the imaging interpretation, the overall assessment will be used for 
determination of positive and negative on FET PET.
Composite Truth Standard
A composite truth standard for recurrence or treatment-related changes will be evaluated 
for each case, utilizing only pathology reports for the primary endpoint. The composite 
truth standard will be determined by a panel of physicians independent of the FET 
images, FET imaging reports or the blinded reads from the FET study.  
For analysis of the primary endpoint, only histology will be used to determine the 
composite truth standard and only patients with available histology will be included. 
Histology must be performed within four weeks of the FET PET to be considered for 
evaluation.  
oTrue positive (TP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology demonstrates 
tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample.
oFalse positive (FP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology negative 
tumor recurrence in none of the biopsy samples.
oTrue negative (TN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology negative 
tumor recurrence in none of the biopsy samples.
oFalse negative (FN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology 
demonstrates tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample.
Population 2: low-grade glioma versus high-grade glioma. Low-grade glioma is defined 
by low uptake of FET on all time-points, or progressive increase in SUVs of the lesion at 
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 22 of 30each of the three imaging time points during the dynamic PET acquisition. High-grade 
gliomas have moderate to high uptake on FET and flat SUVs between time point two 
and three, or decreased SUVs at time point three compared to time point one and two 
(18,19). Readers will have access only to FET PET images during evaluation and will 
grade the lesions in a binary fashion as having Grade II glial neoplasms or having Grade 
III/IV glial neoplasms.
oTrue positive (TP): FET PET read as positive for Grade III/IV neoplasm, 
pathology demonstrates Grade III/IV neoplasm.
oFalse positive (FP): FET PET read as positive for Grade III/IV neoplasm, 
pathology demonstrates Grade II neoplasm.
oTrue negative (TN): FET PET read as positive for Grade II neoplasm, pathology 
demonstrates Grade II neoplasm.
oFalse negative (FN): FET PET read as positive for Grade II neoplasm, pathology 
demonstrates Grade III/IV neoplasm.
For each population, misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
negative predictive value and accuracy will be calculated for the detection of recurrence 
(population 1) or Grade III/IV neoplasm (population 2). 95% percent confidence intervals will be 
created. Inter-reader variability will be calculated for both populations using the kappa statistic.
8.3.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Secondary endpoint 1: Using the same imaging interpretation described for the primary analysis 
above, the secondary analysis will include patients with available histology (performed within 4 
weeks of FET scans) or follow-up imaging (performed within 6 months of FET scan). 
A composite truth standard for recurrence or treatment-related changes will be evaluated for 
each case. In the absence of pathology, the composite truth standard will use available clinical 
information to make a determination.  Positive for tumor recurrence on follow-up imaging will be 
based on RANO criteria4 reads. Follow-up imaging has to be performed within six months of the 
FET PET imaging study to be considered for evaluation. Additionally, the composite truth 
standard may consider tumor board notes and subsequent management of the patient to make 
a determination.
True positive (TP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology/follow-up 
demonstrates tumor recurrence.
False positive (FP): FET PET read as positive for tumor, pathology/follow-up negative 
tumor recurrence.
True negative (TN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology/follow-up negative 
tumor recurrence.
False negative (FN): FET PET read as negative for tumor, pathology/follow-up 
demonstrates tumor recurrence.
Secondary endpoint 2: Using the same criteria as described in the primary endpoints we will 
determine the misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative 
predictive value and accuracy for FET PET in the evaluation of recurrence of low-grade gliomas.
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 23 of 308.3.4 Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory analysis will be performed on patients with glioma who are under suspicion for 
progression or recurrence. For these participants, standard-of-care MRI performed during the 
FET PET/MRI will undergo retrospective analysis by a panel of three blinded independent 
neuroradiologists. The neuroradiologists will classify the findings as positive (indicating 
recurrence) or negative (indicating treatment-related changes) and compare them with the 
composite standard of truth. The 3 readers will be blind to 18F-FET PET images, prior imaging 
results, clinical data, surgical reports, and histopathological results.
Exploratory analysis will also be performed to assess relationships between serial FET PET and 
clinical outcome (benign treatment-related changes and recurrence) in patients with recurrent 
metastatic lesion, recurrent high grade gliomas and recurrent low grade gliomas (Population 1).
8.4 Inter-Reader Variability 
Fleiss’ kappa statistic will be used to determine the agreement between the assessment of FET-
PET tumor targeting (tracer uptake in target lesion: yes/ no), as assessed by three independent 
blinded readers.  
8.5 Intra-Reader variability 
The percent of agreement between the two interpretations will be computed for each reader. 
Cohen’s kappa statistics will be used to determine the reproducibility of the assessment by 
individual readers when analyzing the same data repeatedly.

Phase II – FET PET  Page 28 of 30Appendix 2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan a Non-therapeutic Institutional Trial
1. Oversight and Monitoring Plan
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and participant safety 
for all HDFCCC institutional clinical trials. A summary of DSMC activities for this trial includes:
Annual auditing
Review of serious adverse events
Minimum of biennial regulatory auditing 
2. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines
Investigators will conduct a continuous review of data and participant safety at monthly site 
committee meetings where the status of each participant is discussed and documented in the 
site committee minutes. 
For “greater than minimal risk” nontherapeutic trials, the assigned DSMC Senior Monitor/Auditor 
will audit three of the enrolled participants once per year, with a maximum of ten participant 
charts audited during the entire course of auditing this trial until IRB closure. 
If blood or tissue banking trials are determined to be “greater than minimal risk”, then only 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) recorded in OnCore will be reviewed at each DSMC meeting 
for these trials. 
After completion of each auditing visit, the DSMC Monitor/Auditors will send a follow-up report to 
the study team within 20 business days after the auditing visit is complete for the PI and the 
study team to resolve all action items from this report within 20 business days. An abbreviated 
regulatory review (i.e., reviewing protocol and consent versions, SAEs, PVs, DOA logs, 1572 
forms, etc.) will occur at each participant monitoring review; however, a full regulatory review will 
occur on a biennially basis by the DSMC for regulatory compliance. 
Auditing of all enrolled participants in these trials will be complete after 10 enrolled participants 
have been audited. However, regulatory reviews of the trial, safety reviews (i.e., Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) reviews and Protocol Violation (PV) reviews), and audit/inspection 
preparation (as applicable) will continue until the trial is closed by the IRB. 
3. Review and Oversight Requirements
3.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
All Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs), whether or not considered expected or unexpected and 
whether or not considered associated with the study intervention or procedure, will be entered 
into OnCore®, UCSF’s Clinical Trial Management System. 
Adverse events are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) as developed and revised by the Common Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the 
National Cancer Institute. Adverse events are further given an assignment of attribution or 
relationship to study intervention or procedure. Attribution categories are:
Definite – clearly related to the study intervention or procedure. 
Probable – likely related to study intervention or procedure. 
Possible – may be related to study intervention or procedure. 
Unrelated – clearly not related to the study intervention or procedure. 
Version date: 05/21/2024 Protocol CC#: 171022
Phase II – FET PET  Page 29 of 30All clinically significant adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly 
basis at the Site Committee meetings
3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
By definition, an adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE) according to the 
following criteria:
Death 
Life-threatening adverse experience*, 
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
Congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or
Any other experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or 
precaution that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above, 
Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of the study
* A life-threatening adverse experience is any AE that places the patient or subject, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Serious adverse event reporting will be in accordance with all IRB regulations. For trials 
conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, the SAE will be reported in 
accordance with Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312.32 and will be reported on a Med 
Watch form. 
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events: 
https://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event 
Med Watch forms and information: 
www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm 
All serious adverse events are entered into OnCore, as well as submitted to the IRB. The SAEs 
are reviewed and monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on an ongoing basis 
and discussed at DSMC meetings, which take place every six weeks. The date the SAE was 
sent to all required reporting agencies will be documented in OnCore. 
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study and is determined to be possibly, 
probably, or definitely related either to the study intervention or procedure, the Investigator or 
his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair or Vice Chair and DSMC Director within one 
business day.
3.3 Review of Adverse Event Rates
If at any time the Investigator voluntarily holds enrollment or stops the study due to safety 
issues, the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DSMC Director must be notified within one 
business day and the IRB must be notified as per IRB reporting requirements.

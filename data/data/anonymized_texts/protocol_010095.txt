TITLE A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Insulin Treated Patients 
with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and With Hypercholesterolemia at High 
Cardiovascular Risk Not Adequately Controlled on Maximally Tolerated LDL-C Lowering Therapy (ODYSSEY DM – Insulin) 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational - Multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3b 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary Objectives 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with 
placebo in the reduction of calculated low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin and with hypercholesterolemia at high 
cardiovascular risk not adequately controlled on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy 
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin 
Secondary Objective 
x To demonstrate that alirocumab is superior in comparison to placebo in its effects on other lipid parameters at Weeks 12 and 24 
(ie, measured LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
[non-HDL-C], apolipoprotein B [Apo B], total cholesterol [TC], 
lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
triglyceride (TG) levels, triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRL), 
apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein C-III (Apo C-III), and LDL particle number and size) 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of alirocumab administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in insulin treated patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and 
with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk not adequately 
controlled on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy. 
Patients, unless they are statin intolerant, will be taking a stable, maximum 
dose/regimen of statin therapy that is tolerated by the patient, based on the 
Investigator’s judgment, with or without other lipid modifying therapies (LMT). 
Randomization will be unbalanced (2:1, alirocumab:placebo) 
The study will be a multinational, multicenter study. Patients will be stratified by diabetes type (ie, Type 1 diabetes versus Type 2 
diabetes). Recruitment of patients with Type 2 diabetes will complete when 
approximately 400 patients have been randomized. Recruitment of patients with Type 1 diabetes will continue until approximately 100 patients have been 
randomized or the end of the targeted recruitment period (summer 2016), 
whichever comes first.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 4 Alirocumab will be administered subcutaneously with a starting dose of 75 mg 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 12 weeks with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 
150 mg Q2W at Week 12 if the LDL-C at the Week 8 visit is 70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L). Patients who have an LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at the 
Week 8 visit will continue with alirocumab 75 mg every two weeks until the 
end of the double-blind treatment  period. 
The study consists of: 
x A screening period of up to 3 weeks; 
x A double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks; 
x A safety observation period (off-treatment) of 8 weeks after the end 
of the double-blind treatment period. 
Note, the Investigator will need to document in the case report form (CRF) any adverse events (AEs) that have occurred within 70 days of the last dose 
of IMP that (s)he is aware of. A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order 
to ensure documentation of any AEs occurring during this period.       
Patients should be on a stable diet for glucose and lipid management 
throughout the entire study duration from screening to the Week 24 visit. 
There shall be no significant changes in nutritional composition of the diet or in the quantity/pattern of food consumed. Patients must be receiving 
treatment for diabetes in accordance with local/regional standards of care. 
Statin dose and dose regimen as well as dose and dose regimen of other lipid 
modifying treatment(s) (if applicable) should be stable for 4 weeks prior to the 
screening period and throughout the entire study duration, including from the 
screening visit to randomization.  
The data on lipid parameters from blood samples will be masked after 
randomization. No attempts should be made by the Investigator or patient to have the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization 
until after the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient as per the 
Investigator’s judgment. At the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 24 visit), the Investigator will continue to manage the patient’s lipids in 
accordance with standard practice. Any lipid values after randomization (eg, if 
done for patient safety) should be redacted in the source documents and not 
shared with the Sponsor. 
Duration of study treatment will be 24 weeks with the last injection 
administered at Week 22.  
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work 
at each visit; in addition phone visits are scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32. Week 8 is a critical visit because it will be the only scheduled visit where an LDL-C 
value for uptitration will be available.  
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria Inclusion criteria  I 01. Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin with 
LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), not adequately controlled by a

patient for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week -3) with 
or without other LMT.  
Note:  The maximum dose/regimen of statin that is tolerated by the 
patient is the highest registered dose/regimen tolerated by the 
patient based on the Investigator’s judgment or concerns. Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower statin

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis Population: Randomized population includes any patients who have been allocated to a 
randomized treatment regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or 
not. 
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the ITT population, defined as 
all randomized patients who had an evaluable primary efficacy endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be considered evaluable when both of the 
following conditions are met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
x A least one calculated LDL-C value is available within one of the analysis windows up to Week 24. 
The mITT population (otherwise referred to as the on-treatment population) is defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose or part of dose 
of the double-blind IMP injection and had an evaluable primary efficacy 
endpoint during the efficacy treatment period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be considered evaluable during the efficacy 
treatment period when both of the following conditions are met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available

SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 11 x At least one calculated LDL-C value is available during the efficacy 
treatment period and within one of the analysis windows up to Week 
24. 
The efficacy treatment period will be defined as: 
x The time period from the first double-blind IMP injection up to 21 
days after the last double-blind IMP injection. 
Patients in the ITT and mITT populations will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization.  
The safety population consists of the randomized population who actually 
received at least one dose or partial dose of IMP. The safety population will 
be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Separate analyses will be performed for Type 1 diabetes patients on one 
hand and Type 2 diabetes patients on the other hand. However, some 
endpoints may also be analyzed on the pooled data (Type 1 and Type 2 
diabetes patients together). These analyses will be defined later in the 
statistical analysis plan. 
Primary Analysis: 
The percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 will be 
analyzed in the ITT population using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 
to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for 
by the MMRM model. 
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group 
(placebo versus alirocumab), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20, 
Week 24), treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed 
covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Alirocumab will be compared to placebo using appropriate 
contrasts, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference will be 
provided. 
Analysis of key secondary endpoints and other efficacy 
endpoints: 
A hierarchical procedure (concerning key secondary endpoints only) will be 
used to control the type I error and handle multiple endpoints. If the primary 
endpoint analysis is significant at the 5% alpha level, secondary endpoints will 
be tested sequentially, using the order defined in section “Key Secondary 
endpoints”.  
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution, will 
be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint with 
the continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline 
value-by-time point interaction. Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated 
to have a non-normal distribution will be analyzed using multiple imputation 
approach for handling of missing values followed by robust regression. Binary 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach for 
handling of missing values followed by logistic regression. 
Analysis of diabetes-related endpoints and other 
endpoints: 
Descriptive analyses will be performed concerning diabetes-related endpoints 
and other endpoints such as anti-alirocumab antibodies.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 12 Safety analysis: 
Safety analysis (TEAEs, AESIs, product complaints, laboratory parameters, 
vital signs) will be descriptive, based on the safety population. The safety 
analysis will focus on the TEAE period defined as the time from the first 
double-blind dose to the last double-blind dose of IMP +70 days (10 weeks). 
Timing of the analyses: All the efficacy data will be available for final analysis at a cut-off date 
corresponding to the Week 24 visit of the last patient.  All the safety data will 
be available at the end of the study (Week 32). If needed for the purpose of 
scientific communication, both the efficacy and safety analyses will be 
performed at the Week 24 cut-off date and an update of the safety analysis at the end of the study.  If analyses are not needed at Week 24, then there will 
be only a one time analysis at the end of the study. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  The duration of the study is approximately 9 months to include a 3-week screening period and 24-week treatment period and an 8 week safety 
observation period.
 
Patients with an SAE or an AESI should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death.

a Weeks 4 and 32 are telephone visits only 
b Physical examination and Vital signs:  Height, Weight, HR, and BP. Abnormal vital signs are to be recorded as AEs only if they are medically relevant: symptomatic, requiring corrective 
treatment, leading to discontinuation of IMP and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
c Injection-training prior to randomization is performed with placebo. Investigators will have the option of providing a second p lacebo for alirocumab for patients who require additional 
self-injection training.  The first double-blind injection is administered at the site by the patient or a trained designated p erson with double-blind study treatment kit allocated by IVRS. Further 
training with double-blind treatment can be done at an additional unscheduled visit(s), as per patient or Investigator’s judgme nt. If a designated person changes during the course of the study, 
then the person will be trained using placebo. 
d For kit dispensation:  Along with kit dispensation, the treatment administration package should be given as well as the Patient diary and injection instruction manual, as needed. 
e Patients will be asked to additionally keep a log of the daily insulin dose for 7 days prior to each visit (including daily bas al dose and daily prandial dose, as applicable). 
f Safety evaluation: Adverse Events (AEs), and product complaints regardless of seriousness or relationship to alirocumab treatme nt, will be collected from the time the patient signs the 
informed consent form (ICF) until the end of the study (Week 32). 
g LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula. If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), then the central lab will r eflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) the 
LDL-C rather than calculating it. 
h Hematology includes: complete blood cell count (CBC) including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) count, red blood ce ll distribution width (RDW), white blood cell (WBC) count with 
differential count, and platelets.  Chemistry includes: plasma glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phos phorous, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, albumin, and GGT, Hepatitis C antibody (at screening, Week 24 and in case of transaminases elevation), Hepatitis B antigen (screening only).  Note that 
any Hepatitis C antibody that returns abnormal during the study will need to be followed by confirmatory testing.  TSH values s hould be performed at screening for patients who are on thyroid 
hormone replacement only.  
i Samples to be collected only if required per judgment of the Investigator. The only exception is plasma glucose which must be c ollected at Week 0. 
j Liver panel: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin 
k Pregnancy status should be checked by serum pregnancy test at screening in women of childbearing potential only.  Pregnancy sta tus shall be assessed at Week 0 and Week 24 by urine 
pregnancy test.   
l Urinalysis and spot urine albumin: creatinine ratio: To be performed at screening and Week 24.  Additional urine testing to be repeated if needed based on Investigator judgment.

Background on Patient Populations 
This study will include adult patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy with 
hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular (CV) risk that is not adequately controlled on a 
maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid modifying therapy (LMT).   
Type 2 diabetes  
More than 380 million people worldwide have diabetes ( 1), most of whom will die from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( 2, 3, 4). Compared to people without diabetes, those with diabetes 
are at higher risk of developing CVD, develop asso ciated clinical complications and at an earlier 
age, and have shortened life expectancy by about 6 to 7 years ( 5, 6, 7). In addition to the high 
human cost of disease, CVD contributes greatly to the overall healthcare expenditure in these 
patients ( 4). 
The development of CVD in people with diabetes is a progressive process and insulin requiring patients with Type 2 diabetes are at even higher risk than those at an earlier stage of disease ( 5). 
Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for macrovas cular complications in individuals with diabetes. 
In Type 2 diabetes, the dyslipidemia includes a range of lipid abnormalities including elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglycerides (TG), and reduced high 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ( 8).While an elevation of LDL-C may be variable, 
patients often present with an elevation of sma ll, dense LDL particles which are particularly 
atherogenic. These disturbances, particularly that of LDL-C elevation, contribute to the greater 
CV risk observed in those with diabetes compared with those without ( 8). Low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol is identified as the primary target of cholesterol lowering therapy ( 9) and is accepted 
as a valid surrogate endpoint ( 10, 11, 12). 
Multiple clinical trials with statins and subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes (done primarily in patients with Type 2 diabetes) have demonstrated that significant reductions in CV 
events can be achieved through lowering of LDL-C ( 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). The benefits of 
further intensification of LDL-C lowering, which in cluded patients with diabetes, were recently 
demonstrated by adding ezetimibe to a statin ( 19).Greater reductions in LDL-C produce greater 
reduction in CV events, and comparative data of intensive versus standard statin treatment suggest that the lower the LDL-C level, the greater the benefit in patients at high CV risk ( 20, 21, 22, 23). 
Data from a meta-analyses including over 18000 patients with diabetes suggests that, for each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) decrease in LDL-C patients with diabetes experienced a 9% reduction in 
all-cause mortality and a 13% reduction in vascular mortality over a mean follow up period of 4.3 years ( 18). 
The specific LDL-C target differs depending on the guidelines consulted and the severity of risk experienced by the patient, but they generally recommend a target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes at high CV risk or at least a 50% LDL-C reduction

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 25 (4, 5, 6, 9, 24). Despite the widespread use of statin therapies, many patients with diabetes and 
dyslipidemia remain sub-optimally treated ( 25, 26,  27), or may be intolerant to statin therapy, due 
to troubling side effects,  and may go on to experience additional CV events. For example, in the 
latest EUROASPIRE survey, although 79% of those with diabetes were on a statin, 47% had an 
LDL-C above target ( 26). Similarly, in the cohort of statin-treated diabetes patients in the DYSIS 
survey, 41.3% had an LDL-C above target ( 27). 
Type 1 diabetes  
Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic autoimmune disorders with age-adjusted 
incidence from 0.1 per 100 000 people per year in China to 40.9 in Finland. In the US, around 15 000 children and a similar number of adults are diagnosed every year. Aside from the enormous psychological and health burden on the individual patients, the disease costs the health-care system an estimated US $14.9 billion annually ( 28). Type 1 diabetes is associated with 
a substantially increased risk of premature death as compared to general population. Among persons with diabetes who are younger than 30 years of age, excess mortality is largely explained 
by acute complications of diabetes, including diab etic ketoacidosis and hy poglycemia, while CVD 
is the main cause of death later in life ( 29). A recent study showed that for Type 1 diabetes 
patients with on-target glycemic c ontrol, the risk of death from CV causes was more than twice 
the risk in the general population ( 30). Type 1 diabetes may also be accompanied by dyslipidemia 
that may predispose an individual to precocious CVD, particularly when renal dysfunction is 
present. Although the majority of participants in  statin trials had Type 2 diabetes, there was no 
evidence that the effects of statin therapy on LDL- C lowering or major vascular events in people 
with Type 1 diabetes differed from that in those with Type 2 diabetes; indeed, the reduction in major vascular events in people with Type 1 diabetes was statistically significant ( 18). 
Background to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study is alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to 
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein. Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma it directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its degradation. The increased degradation of LDLRs leads to a reduced LDL particle removal and, therefore higher LDL-C circulating levels. Blocking PCSK9 binding to the LDL-R can potentially bene fit patients with hype rcholesterolemia by 
decreasing their plasma LDL-C levels ( 31, 32, 33 , 34, 35). 
Summary of select clinical studies with alirocumab 
As of 31 December 2014, 12 Phase 3 studies were completed or had a first step analysis completed, with 10 evaluating alirocumab admin istered every 2 weeks (Q2W regimen) and 2 
evaluating alirocumab administered every 4 weeks (Q4W regimen). These studies evaluated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients, patients with a range of CV risk but predominately high and very high risk, and patients not taking statins including statin intolerant 
patients.

Ten studies that were completed or had a first step analysis evaluating 75 mg Q2W (with possible 
up-titration to 150 mg Q2W at Week 12) and 150 mg Q2W as initiation dose/dose regimen were performed.  Averaged across the various studies, Alirocumab use resulted in a mean -45.6 to -
48.9% reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 in studies that investigated the up-titration 
regimen and -60.4% in studies that solely investigated 150 mg Q2W dosing, whereas control rates were 0.5 to 4.2% (placebo) and -19.3 to -22.3 (ezetimibe). Superiority in LDL-C reduction was demonstrated in all placebo-controlled studies with alirocumab administered as add-on to a maximally tolerated dose of statin. Superiority in LDL-C reduction was also demonstrated in all ezetimibe-controlled studies, with a lirocumab being administered as ad d-on to statin, or to LMTs 
other than statin, or in monotherapy. Overall, absolute reductions in LDL-C in the range of -40 to -90 mg/dL (-1.03 to -2.33 mmol/L) were observed in the alirocumab treatment arms. 
LDL-C reduction observed at Week 24 was maintained over time in all the studies including those 
up to 78 weeks. In all studies, the LDL-C reduction was observed at the first LDL-C measurement 
following the first alirocumab dose at Week 4. 
Significant and clinically meaningful reductions were also observed in pro-atherogenic 
biomarkers, including non-HDL-C, Apo B, and TC. Alirocumab was also superior to placebo, and to ezetimibe in most studies, for the reduction in lipoprotein a (Lp[a]). Modest but consistent reductions in fasting TGs and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment. 
Phase 3 studies that evaluated Q4W regimen – efficacy results 
Two studies EFC13786 and R727-CL-1308 (first-step analysis), have evaluated the 150 mg Q4W 
and 300 mg Q4W, respectively, as initiation dose regimen with a possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W. For both studies, LDL-C reduction was observe d at Week 4 was maintained over time up to 
Week 24. As with Q2W dosing, changes in Non-HDL-C, Apo B, and TC showed good correlation 
with LDL-C. 
The R727-CL-1308 (CHOICE I) study included patients with and without concomitant statin.  In 
both of these populations, there were statistically significant effects in favor of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W with possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W for both co-primary efficacy endpoints (percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 and to averaged Weeks 21 – 24). For LDL-C reduction, the least square (LS) mean treatment difference for alirocumab versus placebo at Week 24 was -52.4% and -58.7% for the no concomitant statin population and concomitant statin population, respectively.  The results obtained at Week 12 were consistent with those at Week 24 for both populations, whereby the Week 12 effect assessed the sole contribution of the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen. Approximately 15% of patients treated with Q4W dosing who received at 
least 1 injection after Week 12 were up-titrated to Q2W dosing. 
The EFC13786 (CHOICE II) study included a vast majority of statin intolerant patients with many 
on background ezetimibe therapy. At Week 24, a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference for alirocumab (150 mg Q4W with possible up-titration to 150 mg Q2W) versus placebo of -56.4% was achieved for LDL-C reduction. The results obtained at Week 12 showed a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference of -44.9%, whereby the Week 12 effect

Clinical safety  
In the completed studies, or studies with first-step analysis, 391 patients from phase 1, and 
4300 patients from phase 2 and phase 3 have been exposed to 1 or more doses of alirocumab.  
 
. 
Phase 2 and phase 3 safety results 
Safety data was analyzed from pooled phase 2 and phase 3 studies with a Q2W dosing, which 
included a total of 5234 patients, of which 3340 patients were treated with alirocumab at a dose of 75 or 150 mg Q2W.  
In the placebo-controlled and ezetimibe-controlled pooled studies, no dose relationship was noted 
for any adverse events (AEs) and there was no evidence of a pattern in the type of AEs observed. 
The percentages of patients who experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), at least 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse ev ent (SAE) and any TEAEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation were similar between the alirocumab and control groups.  
There was no safety signal observed with neurol ogic events and neurocognitive disorders, ALT 
increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, diabetes mellitus, and ophthalmologic 
disorders in the alirocumab-treated group overall, but more cataracts (2.1%) were noted in patients treated with alirocumab who achieved 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL compared to those treated with alirocumab who did not meet this criterion (0.6%). 
The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with alirocumab were local injection site 
reactions (6.2% patients in the alirocumab group versus 4.2% in control groups in the global 
pool). Injection site reactions, influenza and pruritus were identified as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions (eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis) have been reported from clinical studies in patients receiving alirocumab. 
The analysis of the safety data with Q2W dosing did not suggest a safety signal as of 
31 December 2014.  
Overall, the safety profile of the alirocumab  Q4W dosing regimen was similar to alirocumab 
Q2W regimen, except for the frequency and onset of injection site reactions. The reactions tended 
to occur sooner after the first drug injection, and last longer, in the alirocumab group.   
Further details on alirocumab are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 28 Rationale for this study 
The objective of the present study is to assess the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin 
treated patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who currently have an LDL-C 70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L) and who, at baseline, have required, in addition to lifestyle modification, statin 
treatment with or without other LMT in order to achieve their LDL-C treatment goal, or who are 
statin intolerant. There is interest  in the impact of lipid lowering therapy on measures of glycemic 
control as evidence has accumulated and suggests that  the use of statin therapy is associated with 
an increased risk of diabetes. This is particularly true for people with risk factors for diabetes. Despite an increased relative risk of diabetes with statin therapy, th e absolute risk is quite small. 
On average, it has been estimated that treatment of 255 people over a period of 4 years will result in 1 additional case of diabetes. 
When balancing the benefit of therapy, treating the same number of people would prevent 
5.4 vascular events ( 36). While this risk impacts patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes, it 
suggests that lipid lowering treatment could modu late glycemia. In fact, evidence suggests that it 
may be transmembrane cholesterol transport that imparts the added risk as a reduced prevalence 
of diabetes has been found in patients with fa milial hypercholesterolemia as compared to patients 
without the disease (37). As a result, understanding the impact of alirocumab on glycemic control in patients with diabetes is of interest. 
In the Phase 3 program, involving a total of 5293 study participants, limited information is 
available in patients with diabetes who are treated with insulin and in those patients with Type 1 diabetes. Focusing the target population on patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes treated with insulin will provide additional information on this potential treatment group, both from an 
efficacy and safety point of view (concomitant use of insulin and a monoclonal antibody). In addition, this study will provide useful information on the use of alirocumab in patients already 
familiar with self-injection. 
It should be noted that all patients, except those with statin intolerance, will be on the maximum 
dose/regimen of statin that is to lerated by the patient, based on th e Investigator’s judgment, with 
or without other LMT. Those patients who are on statins and/or other LMTs at randomization should continue the treatments unchanged throughout the study. 
Alirocumab will be evaluated at a dose of 75 mg Q2W with an increase of dose to 150 mg Q2W if 
LDL-C values at Week 8 are not <70 mg/dL.  
It is possible that some patients in the alirocumab arm may attain LDL-C levels well below 
70 mg/dL. Persons with genetic mutations such as heterozygous form of hypobetalipoproteinemia 
linked to Apo B mutations or loss of function PCSK9 mutations have very low LDL-C levels 
throughout life and have low vascular risk, and no apparent adverse effects ( 35, 38, 39, 40). 
The sample size of 500 patients with treatment duration 
of 24 weeks is intended to provide a broad safety experience in this patient population and to 
assess the impact of uptitration of alirocumab on efficacy and safety parameters. The control group is composed of patients receiving an injectable placebo of alirocumab and is appropriate for the objectives of this study since it will provide the most robust assessment of efficacy and safety

standard of care treatment including maximum dose/regimen of statins that is tolerated by the patient, based on the Investigator’s judgment, with or without other lipid modifying agents. 
Conclusion on the benefit risk assessment with alirocumab 
Based on the clinical data available to date, treatment with alirocumab has demonstrated a 
significant LDL-C lowering effect and was generally well tolerated in a population of hypercholesterolemic patients  with non-familial hypercholeste rolemia (non-FH) or with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH), including patients with a history of intolerance to statin. The efficacy on LDL-C was associated with consistent results in total 
cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and Apo B/Apo A-1 ratio. Reductions in Lp(a) and TG and increases in HDL-C were also observed with alirocumab treatment.  There was no safety signal observed with neurologic events and neurocogn itive disorders, ALT increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated 
CV events, diabetes mellitus, and ophthalmologic disorders. 
Injection site reactions, influenza (upper respiratory symptoms), and pruritus were identified as 
ADRs. Rare and sometimes serious allergic adverse reactions (eg, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis) have been reported from clinical studies in patients receiving aliroc umab. Alirocumab lowered LDL-C be low 25 mg/dL in some patients. 
 
The benefit of alirocumab on CV morbidity and mo rtality has not yet been determined and is 
under investigation in the on-going ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.  
This study is being undertaken to evaluate the risk  benefit profile of alirocumab in patients with 
diabetes treated with insulin, given the high CV risk of this population. Since no study in the 
ODYSSEY program (ie, the alirocumab clinical trial program) has specifically focused on 
patients with diabetes and that it included a limited number of patients on insulin these data 
should provide important information concerning the efficacy and safety of alirocumab when used concomitantly with insulin in this high risk group.

5.1 PRIMARY 
The primary objectives are: 
x To demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab in comparison with placebo in the reduction 
of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with diabetes treated with insulin and with hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk not adequately controlle d on maximally tolera ted LDL-C lowering 
therapy 
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab  in patients with diabetes treated with 
insulin 
5.2 SECONDARY 
The secondary objective is: 
x To demonstrate that alirocumab is superior in comparison to placebo in its effects on other lipid parameters at Weeks 12 and 24 (ie, measured LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C], apolipoprotein B [Apo B], total cholesterol [TC], lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], triglyceride [TG] levels, triglyceride rich lipoproteins [TGRL], apolipoprotein A-1 [Apo A-1], apolipoprotein C-III

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a Phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of alirocumab administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in insulin treated patients with 
Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and with hypercholesterolemia at high CV risk not adequately controlled on maximally to lerated LDL-C lowering therapy. Th e study will be multinational and 
multicenter. The study consists of a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks, and a safety observation period of 8 weeks. 
Patients, unless they are statin intolerant, will be taking a stable, maximally tolerated dose of 
statin therapy with or without other lipid modifying therapies (LMT). Statin dose and dose regimen as well as dose and dose regimen of othe r lipid modifying treatmen t(s) (if applicable) 
should be stable throughout the entire study duration including for 4 weeks prior to the screening 
period, during the screening period, and from screening to randomization. Patients should be on a 
stable diet for glucose and lipid management throughout the entire study duration from screening to the Week 24 visit. Patients should be receiving treatment for diabetes in accordance with local/regional standards of care. 
Patients will be stratified by diab etes type (ie, Type 1 diabet es versus Type 2 diabetes). 
Recruitment of patients with Type 2 diabetes will complete when approximately 400 patients have 
been randomized. Recruitment of pa tients with Type 1 diabetes w ill continue until approximately 
100 patients have been randomized or the end of the targeted recruitment period (summer 2016), whichever comes first. 
Alirocumab will be administered subcutaneously with a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W for 12 weeks 
with a blinded uptitration to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W at Week 12 if the LDL-C at the Week 8 
visit is 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). Patients who have an LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at the 
Week 8 visit will continue with alirocumab 75 mg Q2W until the end of the treatment period. 
The data on lipid parameters from blood samples will be masked after randomization. No attempts 
should be made by the Investigator or patient to have the patient’s lipid values independently evaluated after randomization until afte r the Week 24 visit, except for the safety of the patient, as 
per the Investigator’s judgment. 
Patients will visit the study site at Weeks -3, 0, 8, 12, 20, and 24 with lab work at each visit; in 
addition a phone visit is scheduled at Weeks 4 and 32. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION

x a 24-week double-blind treatment period 
x a safety observation period (off-treatment) of 8 weeks after the end of the double-blind 
treatment period 
Note, the Investigator will need to document in  the CRF any AEs that have occurred within 
70 days of the last dose of IMP that (s)he is aware of. A phone visit will take place at Week 32 in order to ensure documentation of any AEs occurring during this period. Patients with an SAE or an adverse event of special interest (AESI) should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of study is defined as bein g the last patient last visit/contact.  
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
If needed for the purpose of scientific communication, an analysis of efficacy and safety may be conducted after the last patient has completed the Week 24 visit. At that time, all the efficacy data 
will be available for final analysis. Since safety data are being collected until the end of the study 
(Week 32), if the analysis with Week 24 data is performed, an update of the safety analysis will be 
performed at the end of the study.  If analyses are not needed at Week 24, then there will be only a one time analysis at the end of the study.  
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
Steering committee 
The Steering Committee is composed of university-base d scientists (experts in lipids field, and/or 
Endocrinology/Diabetology) with clinical and study conduct expertise, working in collaboration 
with Sponsor based scientists. The committee will provide guidance on designing and conducting a scientifically sound study and ensure accurate reporting of the study. The Steering Committee will address and resolve scie ntific issues if encountered during th e study. They will also help with 
the study recruitment, as needed. The Steering Committee members and Sponsor based scientists will participate in face-to-face meetings at regular intervals throughout the study and in regularly scheduled teleconferences. Detailed activities and responsibilities of the Steering Committee will be described in the Steering Committee Charter.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
Sterile alirocumab drug product will be supplied at a concentration of 75 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL 
in an aqueous buffer, pH 6.0, containing sucrose, histidine, and polysorbate 20, both as 1 mL volume, in an auto-injector (also known as prefilled pen). 
Sterile placebo for alirocumab will be prepared in the same formulation as alirocumab without the 
addition of protein as 1 mL volume in a prefilled pen, for the patients to perform injection training, as well as for those in the placebo treatment arm. 
During the screening period, the patient (or another designated person) will have to perform a 
placebo self-injection training, using a prefilled pen, before the first administration of IMP.   
For those patients randomized to alirocumab, the initial dose is 75 mg administered 
subcutaneously once Q2W. The dose will be increased in a blinded fashion to 150 mg Q2W at 
Week 12 for patients randomized to alirocumab if the Week 8 LDL-C value is 70 mg/dL 
(1.81 mmol/L).   
Those patients randomized to place bo will be administered their injection subcutaneously Q2W 
throughout the duration of the 24-week treatment period. NOTE: in order to ensure the continuity of the study treatment without interruption (only in the 
event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the prefilled pen), contingency alternatives are: 
x in case of disruption of the 150 mg prefilled pen only, if the use of 75 mg prefilled pens is 
maintained, patients will need to administer 2 injections as follows: 
- 2 injections of 75 mg as 1 mL each in a prefilled pen for patients receiving the 150 mg 
dose 
- 1 injection of 75 mg as 1 mL in a prefilled pen plus 1 injection of placebo as 1 mL in a 
prefilled pen for patients receiving the 75 mg dose 
- 2 placebo injections as 1 mL each in a prefilled pen for patients receiving placebo 
OR 
x in case of disruption of either 75 mg or 150 mg or both prefilled pens, patients will be switched to the use of prefilled syringes of placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg, with one injection 
of 1 mL for each of these doses 
Should this occur, the alternative IMP will be maintained until the end of the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 40 8.1.1 Route and method of administration 
A prefilled pen training guide (aut o-injector training guide) w ill be provided to the sites and 
instructions for use (auto-injector for use) will be provided to the patient. Each administration of 
IMP will consist of 1mL subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of upper arm 
(ie, deltoid region). If another concomitant drug is  being injected at the same site planned for the 
IMP injection, then the patient should be advised to use an alternate location for administration of the IMP. 
The IMP could be administered by self-injection or by another designated person (such as a 
spouse, relative, etc). In case a designated person is due to inject alirocumab to a patient during 
the study, it must be ensured that this person has been adequately trained prior to administering 
the injection. Anyone that plans to administer the IMP must be trained by the study staff. 
Instructions should be provided to the patient (or another designated person [such as spouse, 
relative, etc] that will administer th e injections) at training and as needed during the course of the 
study. Close supervision and feedback should be given at the first visit, and other visits as needed.  
The used prefilled pen will be discarded in a shar ps container which will be  provided to patients. 
It is recommended that the subcutaneous IMP injections be rotated within an anatomical area (eg, 
right thigh, then left thigh or right abdomen, then left abdomen). Patients also have the option to inject in a different anatomical area (eg, thigh then abdomen or the outer area of upper arm, etc) during the study. 
Patients will be asked to store the IMP in a refrigerator. Prior to administration, the IMP should be 
set outside in a safe location at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Thereafter, the IMP should be administered as soon as possible. 
8.1.2 Timing of administration 
During the screening period, patients or the designated person will have to perform a placebo 
self-injection training using a prefilled pen, before the first IMP injection. 
At the randomization visit, the first IMP injection will be done at the site by the patient or another 
designated person (such as spouse, relative, etc) under direct site staff supervision. Patients will be monitored at the investigational site  for at least 30 minutes after this first injection in this study. If 
the designated person changes during the course of  the study, the new designated person will need 
to be trained with placebo. 
IMP subcutaneous injections will then be perform ed outside of the clinic, Q2W up to the last 
injection. If the injection is scheduled to take place on the same date as the site visit, then the IMP 
should be administered after the blood sampling has been completed. In exceptional cases, if a patient prefers to have the injection performed at the study site and provisions are able to be made 
to accommodate the administration of injections at the site, it may also be allowed.

day; however, it is acceptable to have a window period of ±3 days. The time of the day is based upon the patient’s preference. 
If by mistake or due to other circumstances an injection is delayed by: 
x more than 7 days from the missed date or completely missed, then the patient should 
return to the original schedule of IMP administration without administering delayed 
injections. 
x less than or equal to 7 days from the missed date, then the patient should administer the delayed injection and then resume the original schedule of IMP administration. 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
The following classes of drugs are identified as non-IMP because the medication is either a 
background therapy or a potential rescue medication: 
x Statins, 
x Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe), 
x Bile acid-binding sequestrants (such as cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam), 
x Nicotinic acid, 
x Fibrates (such as Fenofibrate), 
x Omega-3 fatty acids ( 1000 mg daily), 
x Insulins.  
Please see Section  8.8 for further information. All fibrates are allowed at entry if the patient has 
tolerated the medication and remained on a stable dose. Background LMT and insulin will not be provided by the Sponsor. Patients will obtain these medications in compliance with local regulations. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
Alirocumab and placebo for alirocumab will be pr ovided in identically ma tched prefilled pens and 
packaged identically, which includes labeling to protect the blind. Each treatment kit will be labeled with a number which w ill be generated by a computer  program from Sanofi. The 
treatment kit numbers will be obtained by the Investigator at the time of patient randomization 
and subsequent patient visits scheduled via IVRS/IWRS that will be available 24 hours-a-day, 
7 days-a-week. 
In accordance with the double-blind design, study patients, Investigators and study site personnel 
will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to  the randomization (treatment 
codes) except under circumstances described in the following subsections.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 42 8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
8.3.1.1 Adverse event 
The treatment code will be unblinded by the Pharmacovigilance Department for reporting to the 
Health Authority of any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), ie, any 
Serious Adverse Event that is both unexpected (per the specific section of the CIB) and 
reasonably associated with the use of the IMP acco rding to either the judgment of the Investigator 
and /or the Sponsor. 
Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected ADR unblinding by the Sponsor and Section  8.3.2 
(Randomization code breaking during the study) for unblinding an AE under exceptional 
circumstances when knowledge of the Investigational Medicinal Product is essential for treating the patient. 
8.3.1.2 Lipid parameters 
Lipid parameter values from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit, run by the central lab, will not be communicated to the sites so that they cannot deduce the treatment group of their patients based on LDL-C level attained.  The sponsor’s operational team will not have access to lipid parameters associated with patient identification un til after the final database lock 
has occurred. For safety purposes, TG alerts for TG values 500 mg/dL any time after 
randomization will be sent to the Investigator ( Section  8.8.1 and Section  9). 
At the end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 24 visit) the Investigator will continue to 
manage the patient’s lipids in accordance with  standard practice. Any lipid values after 
randomization should be redacted in the source documents and not shared with the Sponsor. 
8.3.1.3 Anti-alirocumab antibodies 
Patient anti-alirocumab antibody re sults will not be communicated to the sites while the study is 
ongoing. 
The sponsor’s operational team will not have access to anti-alirocumab antibody results associated 
with a patient identification number until afte r the final database lock has occurred. 
The lab technicians involved in the determination of patient anti-alirocumab antibody titers are 
excluded from the operations team and a pro cess will be set up to prevent any potential 
unblinding. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an AE, the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient. If possible, contact should be initiated with the Monitoring Team/Study Physician before breaking the code. All calls will be documented by the Monitoring

SAR236553-LPS14355 - alirocumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 43 Team as appropriate to include da te and time of the call, name of the person contacted within the 
Monitoring Team, patient ID, documentation of the request, and decision for unblinding or not. 
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS), depending on which system is 
used for the site, and/or by calling any other phone number provided by the Sponsor for that 
purpose. However, it is preferable to contact the Study Physician to discuss the case before unblinding the case. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking, and report this information on the appropriate page of the e-CRF.  
Note that when documenting the reason for unblinding, the Investigator must not provide any 
detail regarding the nature of the IMP. The Investigator should not divulge IMP detail to the Sponsor’s representative or to any staff members until database closure. Furthermore, when completing forms (eg, AE, SAE), the study treatment should not be disclosed on the forms.   
The code-breaking material will be also kept at the entity responsible for the “24 hour alert 
system”; but this system should be used in very exceptional cases only (ie, unavailability of 
IVR/IWR system or inability to contact Investigator and/or site staff). However, the preferred 
option is to unblind using IVRS. The Investigators will be informed by the clinical monitoring 
team about the availability of the local code-breaking material. A patient card, including the relevant “24 hour alert system” telephone number will be provided to every patient who will participate in the study. Unblinding may also be performed by the Sponsor for some SAEs in order to conform to regulatory reporting requirements (ie, for some SAEs that are both related and unexpected). 
If the code is broken, the patient must permanently discontinue IMP administration.  
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
The randomized list of treatment kit numbers will be generated centrally by Sanofi. The IMP 
(alirocumab 75 or 150 mg kits, or placebo kit) will be packaged in accordance with this list. The Trial Supply Operations Manager will provide the randomized list of treatment kit numbers 
and the Study Biostatistician will provide the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment allocation system provider. Then, this centralized treatment allocation system provider will generate the patient randomization list according to which it will allocate the treatments to the 
patients. 
Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or alirocumab during the double-blind 
treatment period. The randomization ratio alirocumab:placebo will be 2:1. For each randomized patient, there will be several corresponding treatment kit numbers (resupply visits), which will be allocated through the centralized treatment allocation system. Th e randomization is stratified by 
diabetes type (ie, Type 1 versus Type 2). 
The treatment kit numbers will be allocated using the centralized treatment allocation system on 
randomization visit (Day 1, Week 0), and then at Week 12 as re-supply visits, and at unscheduled visits if needed.

on their Week 8 LDL-C level following the up-titration rules (see Section  6.1). Regular transfer of 
data will be planned between the central laboratory and the centralize d treatment allocation 
system provider in order to proceed in a blinded manner for study sites and sponsor. 
Before randomizing a patient, the Investigator or  designee will have to contact the centralized 
treatment allocation system. 
A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is registered and assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. If a treatment is used without 
contacting the centralized treatment allocation system, then the patie nt will be considered as not 
randomized and withdrawn from the study. 
Two types of centralized treatment allocation systems will be used, the IVRS and the IWRS 
depending on the choice of the site. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
For the double-blind treatment period, each double-blind treatment kit, either alirocumab or placebo for alirocumab, will be prep ared to contain 6 prefilled pens in a child resistant package.  
In order to protect the blind, all double-blind treatment kit boxes for injection will have the same look and feel and therefore will be labeled with a double-blind label. 
In addition to the double-blind treatment kits for injection, a training kit containing 1 placebo for 
alirocumab prefilled pen will be prepared for the purpose of instructing patients on injection 
administration which is to be performed prio r to randomization at screening visit (Week-3, 
Visit 1). If deemed necessary, a second injection training with placebo for alirocumab can be 
performed using an additional training kit prior to randomization. Injection training with placebo will be performed and documented in the CRF , including if the designated person who 
administers IMP to the patient changes during the course of the study. 
Packaging is in accordance with the administratio n schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, policies, and procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructions for handling the IMP should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor.

temperature of the site refrigerator should be checked daily and recorded on a log sheet. 
The IMP that will be stored at the investigational site should be kept in an appropriate locked 
room, under the responsibility of the Investigator or designee or other authorized person in 
accordance with the storage conditions indicated on the label. 
After the supply of IMP kits to patients at the study site visits, appropriate provisions will be in 
place for transportation of the IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s refrigerator. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be s ubject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor, in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Measures taken to ensure and document IMP compliance and accountability are described below: 
x The Investigator or designee will obtain via IVRS/IWRS the treatment kit number(s) and he/she will dispense the treatme nt kit(s) to the patient. 
x The Investigator or designee will enter the treatment kit packaging number(s) and the kit numbers in the e-CRF. 
x IMP administration data will be recorded by the patients onto a Patient diary 
x Used pens (sharps container) and the treatment kit dispensed at the previous dispensation visit are brought back by the patient at IMP kit re-supply visits only 
x The Investigator or designee counts the number of remaining unused prefilled pens in the returned packs and fills in the Treatment Log Form at IMP kit re-supply visits;

remainder of the treatment duration. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team. The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP before the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
Sharp containers containing all us ed pens will be brought back to the site by the patient for the 
purpose of destruction. If the site is not able to destroy or destruction is not allowed in the country, all treatments kits will 
be retrieved by the Sponsor. A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator or designee and countersigned by the Investigator and the Monitoring Team. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly during the study, until Week 32. This medication is not provided by the Sponsor. 
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are 
considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may 
be given at the discretion of the Investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). Besides the specific information related to concomitant medications provided in this section, any other concomitant medication(s) w ill be allowed and will ha ve to be recorded in the e-CRF and source 
data. 
Nutraceutical products or over-the-counter therapies that may affect lipids are allowed (see 
Section  8.8.3 for exceptions) only if they have been used at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior 
to screening visit, during the screening period and during the 24 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. Examples of such nutraceutical products or over-the-counter therapies include omega-3 fatty acids at doses <1000 mg, plant stanols such as found in Benecol, flax seed oil, and psyllium. 
8.8.1 Management of background lipid-modifying therapy 
For background LMT, including statins, sites must follow the national product label for the safety 
monitoring and management of patients. 
Patients will be on stable, maximum dose/regimen of statin therap y that is tolerated by the patient 
with or without other LMT during the study as indicated in Section  7.

safety reasons, sites will be made aware of TG alerts, in orde r to make decisions on the patient’s 
background LMT ( Section  9). 
From the screening visit (Week -3) until the Week 24 visit, the background LMT should not be 
changed. No dose adjustment, discontinuation or initiation of other statins or other LMT should 
take place during this time, barring exceptional circumstances whereby overriding concerns 
(including but not limited to a TG alert posted by th e central lab) warrant su ch changes, as per the 
Investigator’s judgment. For a TG alert that has been confirmed by repeat testing, the Investigator should perform investigations, manage the patient, and modify the background LMT as per his/her medical judgment. 
While all fibrates are allowed at entry if the patient has tolerated the me dication and remained on 
a stable dose, should the patient require the introduction of a fibrate during the course of the study 
(ie, as rescue treatment in response to a TG alert) only fenofibrate will be allowed to be added. 
8.8.2 Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use an effective contraceptive method throughout the entire duration of the study treatment and for at least 10 weeks after the last injection of IMP. The applied methods of contraception have to meet the criteria for a highly effective method of birth control according to the “International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. M3(R2): Guidance on nonclinical safety 
studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals.

8.8.3 Prohibited concomitant medications 
The following therapies are not allowed during th e study (including the screening period until the 
EOT visit): 
x Red yeast rice products 
x Other PCSK9 inhibitors 
Note: while red yeast rice is considered a dietary supplement/nutraceutical, it contains HMG CoA reductase inhibitor activity (mechanism of action of statins), along with other active ingredients. Because such products lack standardization, varying amounts of the active substance could lead to alterations in lipids during the study and potentially confound endpoint assessment. 
8.8.4 Lifestyle and dietary habits 
Lifestyle and dietary habits should be maintained if possible throughout the entire study duration, as medically feasible, with minimum changes. Ther e shall be no significant changes in nutritional 
composition of the diet or in the quantity/pattern of food consumed.

Blood sampling to determine lipid parameters (ie, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non-HDL-C, Apo B, 
Apo A-1, ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, Apo C III, LDL particle size and number, and Lp [a]) should be performed in the morning, in fasting condition (at least 10 to 12 hours fast and refrain from smoking).  Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding the blood sampling are discouraged. 
TC, HDL-C, TG, Apo B, Apo A-1, Apo C-III and Lp(a) will be directly measured by the Central 
Laboratory as per the schedule in Section  1.2. LDL-C will be directly measured via beta

If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) then the central lab will reflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) the LDL-C rather than calculating it. Non-HDL-C will be calculated by subtracting HDL-C from the TC. Ratio Apo B/Ap o A-1 will be calculated. Triglyceride rich 
lipopoprotein will be calculated by total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol. Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage and shipment will be described in the specific laboratory manual whic h will be provided to sites.  
All patients will qualify for randomization based on the LDL-C value obtained at Week -3 visit. If the patient is not fasting at this or any other vis it requiring fasting, then he/she will be asked to 
come the day after or as close as possible to this date for the blood sampling.  
Communication of lipid results by central lab 
The lipid results from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit will not be 
communicated to the Investigators. However, sites will be notified in the event of a TG level 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) obtained any time after randomization (ie, TG alert). Repeat testing 
should be done as soon as possible after a TG alert. For a confirmed TG alert, please refer to relevant information in Section  8.8.1. 
Efficacy endpoints will not be considered as AEs, such as those involving abnormalities in lipid levels, unless meeting the criteria in Section  10.4. 
9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS 
9.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent ch ange in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, using all LDL-C values regardless of adherence to treatment (ITT 
estimand). The percent change is defined as:

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 49 100x (calculated LDL-C value at Week 24 - calculated LDL-C value at baseline)/calculated 
LDL-C value at baseline. 
The baseline calculated LDL-C value will be the last LDL-C level obtained before the first 
double-blind IMP injection. The calculated LDL-C at Week 24 will be the LDL-C level obtained 
within the Week 24 analysis window.  
All calculated LDL-C values (scheduled or unscheduled, fasting or not fasting) between Weeks 8 
to 24 may be used to provide a value for the primary efficacy endpoint, if appropriate, according to above definition.  
The analysis window used to allocate a time point to a measurement will be defined in the SAP.  
9.1.2 Primary safety endpoints 
Safety parameters (AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs) will be assessed throughout the study. The observation of safety data will be as follows: 
x Pre-treatment period is defined from the signed informed consent up to the first dose of 
double-blind IMP injection. 
x Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) peri od is defined as the time from the first 
dose of double-blind IMP injection to the last dose of IMP injection + 70 days (10 weeks) as residual effect of treatment is expected until 10 weeks after the stop of double-blind IMP. 
x Post-treatment period is defi ned as the time starting the day after the end of the TEAE 
period up to resolution/stabilization of all SAE and AESI, whichever comes last. 
9.1.2.1 Adverse events 
All AEs diagnosed by the Investigator  will be reported and described.  
All AEs will be coded to a “Lowest Level Term (LLT)”, “Preferred Term (PT)”, “High Level 
term (HLT)”, “High Level Group Term (HLGT)” and associated primary “System Organ Class 
(SOC)” using the version of MedDRA (Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory Activities) currently in 
effect at Sanofi at the time of the considered database lock. 
Adverse events/AESIs, SAEs, and product complaints will be collected from the time the patient 
signs the ICF to the last scheduled study visit, as applicable.  
Definitions for AEs, SAEs, and AESI, as well as obligation for reporting are further defined in 
Section  10.4.

The window period for Week 0 is +3 days.  The window period for Weeks 8, 12 and 24 is 
±3 days. The window period for Weeks 4, 20, and 32 is ±7 days. 
For all visits after Day 1/inclusion visit, if one visit date is changed, then the next visit should take 
place according to the original schedule as outlined in the Study Flow Chart (Section  1.2). 
Blood sampling 
All blood sampling, including the blood sampling for determination of lipid parameters (eg, TC, 
LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non-HDL-C, Apo A, Apo B, Apo C-III, Lp(a), LDL particle size and 
number) and also for plasma glucose should be performed in the morning, in fasting condition (ie, overnight, at least 10 to 12 hours fast and refrain from smoking), and before IMP injection for all site visits throughout the study. Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding the blood sampling are discouraged. 
Note: if the patient is not in fasting conditions, the blood sample will not be collected and a new 
appointment will be given to the patient for the day after (or as close as possible to this date), with instructions to fast (see above conditions). 
Laboratory tests 
The laboratory data are collected in accordance with the study schedule and the details provided

Urine samplings 
Urinalysis will be performed at screening and We ek 24 visits. Dipstick will be performed and will 
assess for pH, specific gravity, and for the presence of blood, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrates, 
leukocyte esterase, uro-bilinogen and bilirubin. If the dipstick is abnormal then standard microscopy will be conducted. Microscopy will evaluate for the presence of red blood cells (RBC), RBC clumps, white blood cells (WBC), WBC clumps, epithelial cells (transitional, renal tubular, and squamous), casts (hyaline, epithelial, WBC, RBC, granular, fatty, cellular, broad, 
waxy), crystals (triple phosphate, calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, uric 
acid, amorphous, ammonium biurate, bilirubin, leucine, tyrosine, cystine), bacteria, yeast- budding, yeast-hyphae, trichomonas, oval fat body, fat, mucous, and sperm. 
Spot urine testing will be performed for albu min and creatinine to calculate the albumin: 
creatinine ratio at the screening and Week 24 visits. Notes: Any clinically relevant abnormal laboratory value should be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making any decision for the concerned patient. It should be documented as an AE/AESI/SAE if one or more criteria in Section  10.4 are met.  
Decision trees for the management of certain labo ratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in 
Appendix C  and should be followed by Investigators. 
Physical examination 
A general physical examination should be performed at the time points indicated in the study 
schedule flowchart ( Section  1.2). If a new clinically significant abnormality or worsening from

Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in sitting position under standardized conditions, 
approximately at the same time of the day, on the same arm, with  the same apparatus (after the 
patient has rested comfortably in sitting position for at least 5 minutes). Values are to be recorded 
in the e-CRF; both systolic BP and diastolic BP should be recorded. At the first screening visit, BP should be measured in both arms. The arm with the highest diastolic pressure will be determined at this visit, and BP should be measured on this arm throughout the study. This highest value will be recorded in the e-CRF. 
Heart rate will be measured at th e time of the measurement of BP. 
Notes: in case of high BP values, the Investigator is responsible for the optimization of the 
patient’s treatment to achieve BP targets as defined by local guidelines/regi onal standards of care. 
Body weight and height 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same scale should be used throughout the study. 
Height needs to be measured, as self-reported heights are not acceptable. 
  
 
Insulin log 
Patient should be instructed to complete the insulin log in order to record his/her daily insulin 
dose (for basal insulin and for prandial insulin, as applicab le) for at least 7 days prior to each visit, 
and to bring this information to the next study vi sit. The patient may record the daily insulin dose 
for more than 7 days prior to the study visits, however only the information collected for the last 
7 days prior to each visit will be entered into the CRF. 
10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
10.1.1 Screening period 
Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria as noted in Section  7.1 should be screened. The 
screening period will take place up to 3 weeks or 21 days prior to randomization/Day 1 visit. 
Please note that every effort should be made to ensure that the screening window is as short as possible. If it is planned to have another designated person administer the injections to the patient during the study, then this person should be present for injection training.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 63 10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and 
Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the CRF.  
Temporary treatment discontinuation is defined as one or more scheduled injections that are not 
administered to the patient as decided by the Investigator. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinua tion is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pati ent not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or 
e-CRF. Patients should discontinue IMP for the following reasons: 
x Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
x Acute injection reaction of clinical concern. 
x SAE (or non-serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction considered related 
to IMP. 
x At patient request. 
x If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP (eg, laboratory abnormalities, please refer to decision tree in Appendix C ). 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
x Any code breaking requested by the Investigator. 
x Patient receives double-blind treatment prior to randomization

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 64 Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation (within 24 hours 
if possible), before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient.   
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should still continue the study and undergo all visits and procedures as described in Section  1.2 with the 
exception of study treatment adminis tration and its associated procedures. At the time of treatment 
discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at EOT visit (this should take place within 5 days of treatment 
discontinuation, if possible) and then resume the original study schedule until end of study. 
If after treatment discontinuation, the patient refuses to resume the original study schedule until 
the end of the study, then if possible, the patient should undergo an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the EOT visit (it should take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible). The patient, at a minimum, should then be followed-up for at least 10 weeks from the last administration of IMP or  until recovery or stabilization of any AE as 
specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. A final end of study phone visit will take place 10 weeks after the premature discontinuation. 
All definitive discontinuation of study treatment should be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the CRF when considered as confirmed. IVRS/IWRS should be notified 
when a patient prematurely discontinues study treatment. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the EOT visit. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to recontact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such patient s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how the primary endpoints of patients who are lost to 
follow-up will be considered. 
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important ev ents is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse 
- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or  asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality

- Suspected transmission of an infectious agent, if any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product (eg, product contamination) 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) that needs to be monitored, documented, and managed 
in a pre-specified manner described in the protocol ( Appendix B ). 
For this study, the AESI are:  
x Increase in ALT: 
ALT 3 x ULN (if baseline ALT <ULN) Or ALT 2 times the baseline value (if baseline 
ALT ULN) (Appendix C ). 
x Allergic events. 
- Allergic drug reactions and/or local injection site reactions deemed to be allergic by 
the Investigator (or have an allergic component), that require consultation with another 
physician for further evaluation of hypersen sitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s 
medical judgment should be reported as an AESI. 
x Pregnancy: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient or the partner of a male patient (if permitted 
by the female partner and by local regulatory authorities) during the study or within 70 days following the last dose of study drug.  
- Pregnancy will be recorded as AESI in a ll cases. Pregnancy will be qualified as an 
SAE only if it fulfils one or more SAE criteria.   
- In the event of pregnancy of a female patient included in the study, study product should be discontinued.   
- The follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.   
x Symptomatic overdose with IMP: 
- An overdose (accidental or in tentional) is an event suspected by the Investigator or 
spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic injection counts) and 
defined as at least twice of the intended dos e within the intended therapeutic interval 
(ie, 2 or more injections are administered in <7 calendar days), to be reported using the Term “symptomatic OVERDOSE (accident al or intentional), indicating the 
circumstance in parentheses (eg, “symptomatic overdose [accidental]” or

appropriate symptomatic  treatment instituted. 
- The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE/SAE forms.  
- Of note, asymptomatic overdose should be reported as a standard AE.  
x Neurologic events: 
- Neurologic events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a 
specialist should be reported as an AESI. If the event does not require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist, it should be reported as a standard AE. 
x Neurocognitive events 
- All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI 
10.4.1.4 Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions that are considered  by the Investigator as non-allergic events and 
that are related to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be 
further characterized by evaluating the related symp toms that comprise an injection site reaction 
such as but not limited to redness, pain, etc. If the patient experiences a local injection site 
reaction with no signs or symptoms except for erythema/redness, and/ or swelling, and the 
diameter of the erythema/ redness, or swelling measure <2.5 cm, no AE for local injection site reaction needs to be reported as this is not typically considered a clinically important finding. However, if the patient has a reaction of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes with activity, then it should be considered as a clinically relevant finding and should be reported as an AE with a corresponding grade of moderate or severe, in accordance with Appendix E .  
10.4.1.5 Device deficiency 
A device deficiency is any inadequacy related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety 
or performance of the medical device including malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
Product Complaints: 
x A product complaint is defined as any written, electronic, or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qua lity, durability, reliability, safety, efficacy or 
performance of a product after it is released for distribution. Patients will be instructed to contact their site for any questions or difficulties. 
x All product complaints must be reported on a product complaint form when there is a reason to suspect a problem with the device. 
x In case of a product complaint associated with the occurrence of an AE, the AE must be documented on an AE page in the CRF.

10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
x All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the signature of the ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the CRF. 
x All product complaints associated or not to an AE are to be recorded immediately on the corresponding products (study medical device) complaints pages and reported to the local 
Complaint Service immediately (within 24 hours). 
x Whenever possible, a diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of 
symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with 
respect to IMP, corrective tr eatment/therapy given, additiona l investigations performed, 
outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether ther e is a reasonable possibility that the AE 
was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
x The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations for certain events, such as SAEs/AESI, will continue beyond the last planned 
visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring 
team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
x When treatment is prematurely  discontinued, the patient’s obs ervations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, if possible. 
x Laboratory or vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI ( Appendix C )

x SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email address appear on the clinical trial protocol. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properl y mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. If for any reason, results of lipid values are indicated on any source documents (done for the safety of a patient in exceptional circumstances only), all such information should be redacted. 
x All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc) should be sent (by fax or e-mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
x A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the e-CRF system does not work 
In case of e-CRF back-up: 
x SEND (within 24 hours, preferably by fax or e-mail) the signed and dated corresponding page(s) from the CRF to the representative of the monitoring team whose name, fax 
number and e-mail address appear in the clinical trial protocol 
x ATTACH a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any 
copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges  
x All further documentation should be sent to the monitoring team within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigat or at any time after the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest  
For each defined AESI the Investigator must make  every attempt to colle ct additional specific 
information such as: 
x Preexisting related condition or lifes tyle of interest for the AE (eg, habits, CV risk factor).

corresponding screens in the e-CRF. Please refer to Section  10.4.1.3 for a listing of AESI and 
Appendix B  for a summary of reporting AEs. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, documented, and managed according to the related flow chart in Appendix C . Reporting instructions are provided in 
Appendix B . 
x Neutropenia 
x Thrombocytopenia 
x Increase in ALT 
x Acute renal insufficiency 
x Increase in CPK (other than cardiac-related) and suspicion of rhabdomyolysis 
Investigators are strongly encouraged to follow these algorithms in Appendix B  and Appendix C , 
especially in situations where the abnormality persists or when there is no clear explanation for the observed abnormality. However there may be situations where these algorithms are not entirely applicable; therefore, the Investigator may use his/her best judgment. Also, in some situations, the Sponsor may wish to discuss with the Investigator. Examples where these algorithms may not be applicable include, but  are not limited to, the following situations: 
x Patients with known stable, low or borderline neutrophil count at baseline 
x Patients with known stable, low or borderline platelet count at baseline 
x Patients with impaired renal function at baseline 
The Investigator should attempt to have a diagnosis for the observed finding and should use his/her best judgment as whether to or not enroll such patients, and if the patient is enrolled, how to best monitor these baseline abnormalities throughout the study.  
Additional examples where these algorithms may not  be applicable include, but are not limited to, 
the following situations: 
x Patients with ALT increase for which the abnormality resolves following statin dose 
reduction or statin discontinuation

10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
x All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (SUSAR), to the regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators. 
x All SAEs that are expected and at least reason ably related to the IMPs to the regulatory 
authorities, according to local regulations. 
The AESIs listed in Section  10.4.1.3 will be reported to those regu latory authorities who require 
such reporting.  
In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected as indicated  in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be considered unexpected. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (local injection site reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed-up as per the Investigator’ s medical judgment. Specific e-CRF screens are 
to be filled in. Information on cla ssifying the reaction are given in Section  10.4.1.4 and on 
reporting these reactions is given in Appendix B . 
10.6.2 Allergic adverse events 
Specific e-CRF screens are to be filled in to assess allergic reactions or allergic-like reactions that may occur during the clinical studies conducted with alirocumab.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 Sometimes transient injection site reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions. 
Adverse events that may constitute an allergic  reaction (eg, generalize d itch, nasal itch, swelling 
at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips,  eyes, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, 
difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in pitch of voice, incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest 
tightness, stridor, etc) should be considered to be reported on the General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin  (eg, local injection s ite reactions related to 
mechanics of injection) should only be recorded on the Local Injection Site Reaction 
Complementary Form. However, injection site reactions that progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as recommended in Appendix E  and General Allergic Reaction Complementary form 
should be completed. 
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporarily discontinued) if there is a suspicion of 
an allergic event related to IMP. See Section  10.3.1 for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section  10.3.2 for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
10.6.2.1 Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc. should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs. An unschedul ed assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver 
panel should be obtained. An additional blood sample will have to be drawn for PK and anti-alirocumab antibody analyses (adequate inst ructions will be provided to the site by the 
Monitor). If it is possible, the site will take pict ures of the skin lesions in order to provide the 
patient with them for the dermatologist’s visit. If the photos are obtained, then copies should be kept as source documents which may later be collected by the sponsor.  The Investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and information being requested to the consulting dermatologist. 
A full consultation report should be sent by the dermatologist to the Investigator. The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following information; a detailed description of the rash (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [eg, scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (including histopathology and immunofluorescence) was done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermatologist’s or Investigator’s medical judgment), the results of this investigati on with, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The Investigator 
will fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.

Acute allergic injection reaction (which are considered under the category of general allergic 
reactions) is defined as any AE that occurs during or shortly after injection of the IMP (characterized by but not limited to hypotension, bronchoconstriction, urticaria, edema, angioedema, nausea, vomiting). Emergency equipmen t and medication for the treatment of these 
potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, br onchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and epinephrine) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the training, and inclusion visits. 
Patients will be observed at the i nvestigational site for at least 30 minutes following the injection 
that takes place at the inclusion visit. Patients s hould be treated symptomatically if any AEs are 
observed. Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injection reaction is assessed as stable,

defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose or part of a dose of the double-blind IMP and have an evaluable primary efficacy endpoint during the efficacy treatment period. 
Patients in the mITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by 
randomization. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is considered as evaluable when the two following conditions are 
met: 
x The baseline calculated LDL-C value is available 
x At least one calculated LDL-C value is available during the efficacy treatment period and 
within one of the analysis windows up to Week 24. 
The efficacy treatment period is defined as the time period from the first double-blind IMP 
injection up to 21 days after the last double-blind IMP injection. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
The safety population considered for safety analyses will be the randomized population who did actually receive at least one dose or part of a dose of the double-blind IMP. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received (placebo or alirocumab). 
The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) period defined 
as the time from the first double-blind dose to the last double-blind dose of IMP + 70 days 
(10 weeks). 
In addition:  
x Nonrandomized but treated patients will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately.

be included in the safety population as randomized. 
x For patients receiving more than 1 study treatment during the trial, the treatment group allocation for as-treated  analysis will be the one to which the patient was treated with the 
longest duration  
11.3.3 Other analysis population  
The anti-alirocumab antibody analysis will be performed on all treated patients (safety population) with a blood sample at Week 0 (baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for antibodies post-double-blind IMP injection. 
 
 
 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Separate analyses will be performed for Type 1 diabetes patients on one hand and Type 2 diabetes 
patients on the other hand. However, some endpoints may also be analyzed on the pooled data (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients together). These analyses will be defined later in the statistical analysis plan. 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and co mpliance will be assessed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population. 
In order to ensure the continuity of the investigational treatment for the patients without 
interruption (only in case a disruption occurs in the availability of device components or during production of the prefilled pen), back-up plans may be implemented as described in Section  8.1. 
In that case, exposure to initial device and back-up device will be summarized and impact on 
study results will be assessed. More details will be provided in the SAP, if applicable. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The total exposure will be assessed by: 
x Duration of IMP exposure in weeks is defined as:  (last dose of double-blind IMP injection date – first dose of double-blind IMP injection date + 14 days)/7, regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations.  
x The total number of injections by patient. 
The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with an up-titration in the alirocumab group will be described.

A given administration will be considered noncompliant if the patient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.  
Compliance will be assessed using the following parameters: 
x The injection frequency will be defined for e ach patient as the average number of days 
between 2 injections, that is: (last dose date – first dose date)/(number of injections -1). 
This parameter will be summa rized descriptively (N, Mea n, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
The percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 as defined in Section  9.1.1 
will be analyzed in the ITT population using a mixed effect model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 to Week 24 analysis windows will be used and missing data are accounted for by the MMRM model.  
The model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (placebo versus 
alirocumab), time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 20 and Week 24), treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Model assumptions for normality will be explored prior to the analysis testing. 
This model will be run using SAS Mixed procedur e with an unstructured correlation matrix to 
model the within-patient errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood 
method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation. This model will provide baseline adjusted LS means estimates at Week 24 for both treatment groups with their corresponding standard errors (SEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To compare the alirocumab group to the placebo group, an appropriate contrast statement will be used to test the differe nces of these estimates, at the 2-sided 
0.05 level. Separate analyses will be performed for Type 1 diabetes patients on one hand (alpha risk = 0.05) and Type 2 diabetes patients on the other hand (alpha risk = 0.05). 
Let μ0 and μ1 be the population means of the percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C 
at Week 24 under placebo and alirocumab, respectively. The null hypothesis that will be tested is: 
 
H0 : μ0 = μ 1 
versus 
H1 : μ 0  μ1 
Robustness of this statistical method will be assessed via sensitivity analyses detailed in the SAP, 
including different methodologies for missing data (multiple imputati on and potentially pattern

evaluate the robustness of the results regardless of the way to assess LDL-C. Correlation of calculated LDL-C with measured LDL-C will be explored graphically as deemed necessary. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Method for controlling the overall type-I error rate when testing the key secondary efficacy endpoints is described in Section  11.4.2.3.  
For key secondary efficacy endpoints (defined in Section  9.2.1) and other efficacy endpoints 
(described in Section  9.2.3), descriptive summaries and analys es will be performed in the ITT 
population or mITT population depending on the estimand used.  
For descriptive summaries, percent change from baseline in calculated LDL C, C, HDL-C, TG, 
and non-HDL-C will be provided at each time point for each treatment group. All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled will be assigned to analysis windows defined in the SAP in order to provide an assessment for these time points. Laboratory assessments other than the ones provided by the central laboratory will be excluded. The time profile of each parameter will be plotted by treatment group with the corresponding SEs.  
Similar tables (with either percent change from ba seline or absolute change from baseline for the 
ratio) and plots will be provided for other efficacy endpoints: Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio 
Apo B/Apo A-1, Apo C-III, Lp(a), TGRL, LDL-C particle size, and LDL-C particle number. For TG and Lp(a), summary statistic s will include Q1 and Q3, and me dians (instead of means) by 
time point will be plotted.  
Multiple types of measurements ar e planned to be analyzed during differing time points in the 
trial, specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution (eg, percent 
change in calculated LDL-C), continuous measurements expected to have a non-normal distribution (eg, TG), and binary measurements (eg, proportion of patients reaching LDL-C <70 mg/dL). 
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution 
Continuous secondary variables defined in Section  9.2 anticipated to have a normal distribution 
(eg, lipids other than TG and Lp[a]) will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the 
primary endpoint. Specifically, the model will contain fixed categorical effects of treatment 
group, planned time points to Week 24 and treatment-by-time point interaction, as well as, the 
continuous fixed covariates of corresponding baseline value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. 
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal distribution 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  9.2, anticipated to have a nonnormal 
distribution (ie, TG and Lp[a]), will be analyzed using a robust regression model (ie, 
ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M-estimation option) with treatment group as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. Missing values will be addressed using a multiple

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 79 imputation approach, which will be  described in the SAP. The vari ables in the multiple imputation 
model will at least include the same variables as used in the robust regression model. The 
treatment group combined means will be provided with respective SE estimates. The combined mean difference between the treatment groups will be provided with the SE, 95% CI and p-value. 
Binary endpoints 
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Section  9.2 will be analyzed using logistic 
regression with treatment group as main effect and corresponding baseline value(s) as covariate. 
Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation appro ach which will be described in 
the SAP. The variables in the multiple imputation m odel will at least include the same variables as 
used in the logistic regression model. Treatment effects will be compared and the combined odds ratio estimate between the treatment groups, with their corresponding 95% CIs and p-value will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic regression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in 1 treatment arm and thus the maximum likelihood estimate may not exist), the Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach would be used for handling of missing values and 
an exact conditional logistic regression would be performed to compare treatment effects. The LOCF imputation method will consist of using the last value obtained up to the Week 24 analysis window (or Week 12 as applicable) to impute the missing week 24 value (or Week 12 respectively). 
11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations 
In order to handle multiple key secondary efficacy endpoints, the overall type-I error will be controlled by the use of a sequen tial inferential approach. Statistical significance of the primary 
parameter at the 0.05 alpha level is required before drawing inferential conclusions about first key secondary parameter (refer to order of list in Section  9.2.1).  
Inferential conclusions about successive key secondary parameters require statistical significance of the prior one. This fixed hierar chical approach will ensure a stro ng control of the overall type-I 
error rate at the 0.05 level.  
No further adjustments will be made for other efficacy endpoints for which p-values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose only. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by treatment group. No formal inferential testing will be performed. Summaries w ill be descriptive in nature. 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rules:

x The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on literature review and defined by the Sponsor for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. 
x PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment 
period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the 
numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage. 
x Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time 
from first dose of double-blind IMP injection to the last dose of double-blind IMP 
injection + 21 days 
The following definitions will be applied to AEs 
x Pre-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
pre-treatment period 
x TEAEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period 
x Post-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the post-treatment period 
Liver function tests 
The liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, are used to 
assess possible drug induced liver toxicity. The proportion of patients with PCSA values at any postbaseline visit by baseline status will be displayed by treatment group for each parameter.  
A graph of distribution of peak values of ALT ve rsus peak values of total bilirubin will also be 
presented. Note that the ALT and total bilirubin va lues are presented on a logarithmic scale. The 
graph will be divided into 4 quadrants with a vertical line corresponding to 3 x ULN for ALT and 
a horizontal line corresponding to 2 x ULN for total bilirubin. 
The incidence of liver-related AEs will be summarized by treatment group. The selection of 
preferred terms will be based on standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) Hepatic disorder. Time to 
liver-related treatment discontinuation and time to liver death may also be provided based on hepatic disorder SMQ. 
11.4.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group.

If needed for the purpose of scientific communication, both the efficacy and safety analyses will 
be performed at the Week 24 cut-off date and an update of the safety analysis at the end of the study, a two-step analysis as described below. All the efficacy data will be available for final 
analysis at a cut-off date corresponding to the Week 24 visit of the last patient. Since safety data are collected until the end of the study (Week 32), if  the analysis with Week 24 data is performed, 
an update of the safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study. If analyses are not 
needed at Week 24, then there will be only a one time analysis at the end of the study. 
The first-step analysis will be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and have at 
least all their data up to Week 24 collected and valid ated, and will consist of a final analysis of the

 6 2 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
2.1 Study Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, cross -over, placebo and active-controlled, double -blind, 
study of continuous 5 -hour intravenous (IV) infusions of BMS -986231 in patients with heart 
failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The trial is designed to evaluate the effects of 
BMS-986231 on systolic and diastolic  parameters measured by echocardiography.  
A cross-over design will be implemented in this trial; every subject will be exposed to each of 
the 3 interventions (BMS-986231, Nitroglycerin (NTG) and placebo) in 3 treatment periods . 
Each treatment period will i nclude one intervention occurring via 5-hour infusion, followed by a 
washout period of at least 7 days, but no more than 4 weeks.  
42 study participants will be randomized to receive BMS -986231, NTG, and placebo, in one of 
the 6 possible sequences.  
NTG, BM S-986231 and placebo will be administered as a 5 -hours infusion according to an 
uptitration schedule, which is achieved by an increase in the infusion flow rate. All three 
interventions (NTG, BMS -986231 and placebo) will have the same flow rate: 5 mL/H for  10 
min, followed by 10 mL/H for 10 minutes then 20 mL/H for the rest of the infusion.  
The corresponding doses of the active study medications will be:  
 NTG: 20 μg/min for 10 min, followed by 40 μg/min for 10 min, followed by 80 μg/min for 
the rest of the 5 -hour infusion;  
 BMS-986231: 3 μg/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 6 μg/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 12 
μg/kg/min for the rest of the 5 -hour infusion.  
In case of a decrease in systolic blood pressure, an algorithm will be used to down -titrate 
/interrupt or discontinue the study drug infusion  (see protocol Section 7.4 ). 
The study design schematic is presented in  Figure 2.1-1.

 8 Screening  
Screening for inclusion in the study  will be performed up to 4 weeks before the first treatment 
day. Screening will assess the eligibility criteria including assessment of ejection fraction, 
suitability of echocardiography windows and image quality. After screening, study participants 
will be enrolled in the study according to their eligibility as per the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and will be randomized to 1 of the 6 sequences that will be conducted in parallel.  
Treatment day (Day 1 of each period)  
Study participants will be admitted to the study facility on the treatment day, which will be Day 
1 of each of the three periods. Assessment of vital signs and laboratory tests will be performed 
pre-dose. In each treatment day, blood pressure and heart rate should be within the inclusion / 
exclusion criteria limits, and no atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter should be present in order to 
start the study treatment. The study drug infusion could start without waiting for the results of 
the laboratory assessments done in the morning of the tre atment day at the study facility if the 
following criteria are met:  
 The results of the laboratory assessment at screening / previous period are within ranges 
compatible with inclusion/exclusion criteria,  
 The study participant was medically stable without c hange in medication since the screening 
visit / previous period.  
If the laboratory tests (e.g. electrolytes, serum creatinine, eGFR, hemoglobin, transaminases) in 
the morning prior to the infusion are not within inclusion and exclusion criteria limits, the  study 
drug will be discontinued after consultation with the medical monitor. The abnormalities should 
be corrected before the next treatment period.  
Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECG), 
echocardiography, whole body bioimpedance and pulse wave analysis (non -invasive central 
aortic blood pressure) will be performed at selected times throughout the dosing interval. 
Participants will be closely monitored for adverse events throughout the study. Blood samples 
will also be collected at selected intervals after start of study drug administration for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.  
Discharge  
Study participants will remain in the study facility for approximately 3.5 hours post -dose and 
discharged on the same day, unless the investigator and the study team consider that an overnight 
stay is warranted. Same -day discharge is allowed if the following conditions are met:  
 in the opinion of the investigator an overnight stay is not warranted,  
 there is no hypotension after mobili zation and  
 none of the following events occurred during the study drug infusion: prolonged 
hypotension, symptoms of hypotension, new onset of sustained arrhythmia requiring 
pharmacologic or other interventions, any other events of concern e.g. chest pain s uggestive 
of ischemia.

 9 2.2 Treatment Assignment  
This study will use Interactive Response Technology (IRT): All participants will be centrally 
randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Subjects will be randomized using 
IRT in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 rat io to one of six sequences, as shown in Figure 2.1-1, with block size of 
six, to ensure the number of subjects randomized to each sequence remains balanced. 
Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits as listed in Schedule of Activities (Protocol 
Section 2 ). 
Enrolled participants, including those not dosed, will be assigned sequential participant numbers 
starting with 00001, (e.g., 00001, 00002, 0000 3.... 00010). Those enrolled participants meeting 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to be randomized. Randomization ID numbers 
will be assigned prior to dosing. Subjects who are re -enrolled (Protocol Section 6.4 ) will be 
assigned a new part icipant number.  An estimated 52 subjects will be screened in order to 
randomize 42 subjects. Further details are provided in Section 5.  
Participants will not be replaced if they are discontinued from the study.  
2.3 Blinding and Unblinding  
Blinding of treatmen t assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge of 
the investigational product is critical to the participant's management, the blin d for that 
participant may be broken by the investigator. The participant ’s safety takes priority over any 
other considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment , the investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the participant's 
immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to 
the investigational product, the prob lem may be properly managed by assuming that the 
participant is receiving active product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment 
assignment be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate 
authority for  the decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator should only call in for 
emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to discontinue the participant has been made.  
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is via the Interactive Respon se 
Technology (IRT) system. For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT 
manual. 
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt is made 
to preserve the blind.  
Any request to unblind a participa nt for non -emergency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
The Bioanalytical Sciences section or its designate may be unblinded to the randomized 
treatment assignments, in order to minimize unnecessary assays of samples from subject during  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 10 the placebo treatment period. Likewise, the Biotransformation section or its designate may be 
unblinded, if metabolite profiling work is conducted.  
In certain circumstances, a pharmacokineticist or designate(s) in Clinical Pharmacology and 
Pharmacometrics , biostatistician(s) and programmer(s) at BMS, or designee, may be unblinded 
in order to prepare preliminary summaries of PK and safety data, as needed. These summaries 
will not reveal individual subjects’ treatment sequence assignments.  
 
2.4 Protocol Amendmen ts 
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on the revised protocol version 0 2, which 
incorporates Amendment 0 2, dated 01-Sep-2017. 
2.5 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
There is no Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) planned for this study. The occurrence of 
significant safety events will be submitted for review to the independent DMC that monitors the 
ongoing phase 2b study  CV013011 , evaluating the safety, tolerability and e ffectiveness of BMS -
986231 in a population of acute decompensated heart failure patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
The executive committee will be a small body comprised of academic leaders. The executive 
committee will provide advice on overall design, study endpoin ts and recommendations for 
study sites, and will review results from final analyses with Sponsor.

4.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
 Pharmacokinetic endpoints include the Plasma concentrations of BMS -986231 and its 
metabolites  
5 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R 
In a review of stroke volumes and SVIs from the literature , baseline SVI generally ranged from 
30-40 mL/m ², with inter -individual standard deviation ( SD) of approximately 25 – 35% of the 
mean. Likewise, SV values generally ranged from 50 -70 mL, with inter -individual SD of 
approximately 25 – 35% of the mean. Results from these studies also suggest intra -individual 
correlations in the range of 0.6 – 0.8. 
Sample size calculations  assume baseline SVI of approximately 30 mL/m ², with placebo values 
consistent with baseline, an increase of 15% from baseline, relative to placebo, as meaningful 
(e.g. 4.5 mL/m ²), an inter -individual SD of 10 mL/m ², and intra -individual correlations for t he 
difference between placebo and HNO of 0.7. Using these assumptions, approximately 36 
subjects with data from treatment periods being compared will be required to achieve a power of 
90%, with a type I error probability of 0.05 (2 -sided). In order to addr ess the potential for 
missing data arising from dropout, an allowance of 15% subjects will be included, with a 
resulting target sample size of 42 subjects to be randomized. An estimated 52 subjects will be 
screened, in order to randomize 42 subjects. Sample sizes are calculated based on method IV 
from Mehrotra2, which compares post baseline values, adjusting for the differences in the 
baseline value.  The blinded SVI data will be reviewed after 50% of the planned treated subjects 
have completed treatment . BMS will consider re -estimating the sample size based on the 
observed SD. The review of SVI data will be repeated if necessary.

ANALYSES  
6.1 Study Periods   
Screening for inclusion in the study will be perfor med up to 4 weeks before the first treatment 
day. After screening, study participants will be enrolled in the study according to their eligibility 
as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and will be randomized to 1 of the 6 sequences that 
will be cond ucted in parallel.  
Each sequence has 3 periods. Study participants will be admitted to the study facility on the 
treatment day, which will be the Day 1 of each of the three periods.  Study participants will 
remain in the study facility for approximately 3.5  hours post -dose and discharged on the same 
day, unless the investigator and the study team consider that an overnight stay is warranted. The 
treatment day of period 1 and period 2 are followed by a washout period of at least 7 days but no 
more than 4 week s.

7 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
SAS® version 9.2 or higher will be used for statistical analyses, tabulations and graphical 
presentati ons. S-Plus® may be also used for graphical presentations.  
7.1 General Methods  
Descriptive summaries will be presented for continuous variables using number of subjects (N), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum.  
Descriptive summaries for  categorical variables will utilize counts and percentages. Several 
analyses noted in subsequent sections will present 95% confidence intervals (CIs), but no pre -
specified significance testing will be included . 
In general, continuous variables will be anal yzed using a mixed -effect model with sequence, 
treatment period, and treatment, and the difference in the treatment period baselines as a 
covariate. From the statistical modeling, the means, standard errors, and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals for the dif ference between BMS-986231 and the other treatment group will be 
presented. The analyses for efficacy and exploratory  endpoints will use a nominal level of 
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 15 α=0.05 for inference with no multiplicity adjustment.  The nominal p -value for comparing two 
treatments will be provided as well.  
Adverse events and medical history will be coded according to the most recent Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version. Previous and concomitant medications 
will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictiona ry. 
For analyses involving baseline, the baseline value is defined by the last value prior to the start of 
infusion for a specified period, unless otherwise noted.  
7.2 Study Conduct  
Protocol deviations identified as significant will be captured in a trial mana gement system and 
reported in the CSR. Relevant protocol deviations are those that are programmable and could 
potentially affect the interpretability of the study results. The following protocol deviations will 
be defined as relevant protocol  deviations an d listed:  
 Error in treatment assignment resulting in a subject being dosed with an incorrect treatment  
 Systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 11 5 mm Hg at screening  or pre-randomization  
 Violation of inclusion criterion 2 (b): Subjects do not have heart failure w ith reduced ejection 
fraction or have no LVEF on echocardiogram of 40% or less.  
 Violation of exclusion criterion 1 (a): Subjects have Systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 115 mm 
Hg at screening or pre -randomization.  
 Violation of exclusion criterion 1 (b):  Subjects have h eart rate < 50 beats per minute (bpm) 
or > 90 bpm at screening or  pre-randomization . 
 Violation of exclusion criterion 3 (a):  Subjects have  treatment  with oral phosphodiesterase 
type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil,  vardenafil or avanafil within 24  hours of study drug 
infusion or treated with tadalafil within 4 days of study drug infusion.  
 Violation of exclusion criterion 4 (a):  Subjects have estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.

BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 16 1.1.2 Demographic s and Baseline  Characteristics  
Frequency distributions and summary statistics for demographic and baseline variables will be 
presented for all enrolled subjects. Demographic variables to be s ummarized include: age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, and region . 
Baseline variables to be summarized include the following:  
 Physical measurements (height, body weight, body mass index)  
 Vital signs ( body temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and heart 
rate) 
1.1.3 Physical Measurements  
Physical m easurements such as body weight  and height will be summa rized by nominal visit for 
the safety population , as overall and by treatment  group. Measurements will also be listed for all 
treated subjects.  
1.1.4 Medical History and Previous Medications  
Medical history  and previous medications taken prior to dosing will be listed for the safety 
population .  
7.4 Extent of Exposure  
At any time during the administration of study drug, the study drug infusion must be 
discontinued if an adverse event or any other safety issue su ggests it is not in the patient ’s best 
interest to continue to receive study drug.  
The investigator has the option to adjust the study drug dosage level downward by 50%, 
interrupt, or discontinue the study drug infusion in patients that develop hypotension, or if the 
patient experiences symptomatic hypotension that is not easily tolerated, as follows  
 Study drug reduction : Study drug is decreased by 50% if SBP decreases to levels <90  mmHg 
but ≥80 mmHg. The dose cannot be subsequently increased.  
 Study drug interruption : Study drug is interrupted for 1 hour if SBP decreases to <80 mmHg 
or symptoms of low blood pressure occur within the first 4 hours of infusion. If the SBP is 
105 mmHg  after one hour interruption, the study drug could be resumed at 50 % of the 
dose to complete 5 -hours of effective study drug infusion.  
 Study drug discontinuation : Study drug will be permanently discontinued if SBP remains < 
105 mmHg after 1 hour interrupt ion or if SBP decreases to levels <80 mmHg or symptoms of 
low blood pressure occur after 4 hours of infusion.  
End of infusion procedures should be done as soon as possible after interruption or 
discontinuation of the study drug. If an infusion in a given p eriod is discontinued, patients 
remain eligible to complete subsequent periods.  
Study drug administration and  randomization schedule will be documented as per subject 
listings. The number and percentage of subjects with dose interruptions, dose reductions, and 
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 17 dosing discontinuations will also be summarized and listed  by treatment group for the safety 
population . 
Any non -study medications  taken by subjects, any conducted non -study medical treatment 
procedures, and any utilized non -study diagnostic procedures will also be listed.  
 
7.5 Efficacy 
 
7.5.1 Primary E fficacy Analysis  
SVI derived from the velocity time integral at the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT VTI) at 
the end of the 5 -hours infusion of treatment  will be summarized descriptively for all randomized 
subjects by treatment  group.  
SVI will be assessed using a contrast comparing placebo and BMS -986231. We follow the linear 
model proposed by Jemielita et al3, which includes sequence and treatment and the difference in 
the treatment period baselines as a covariate. Jemielita et al demonstrated that modelling certain 
linear combinations of baseline values as covariates increases the power of the test for a 
difference in outcomes by treatment.  In this study, the difference in baseline values among the 
treatments being compared will be considered according to this strategy. They further 
demonstrated that the model will give equivalent inference as in an ordinary least squares (OLS) 
model for difference of treatment effects, under the assumption of unstructured covariance 
structure. The Kenward -Roger approximation for the degrees of freedom will be specified for the 
model. 
Estimation of the variance covariance will  be based on unstructured (UN) R matrix assuming no 
common variances or covariances.  
Let   
Xik=(XiPk, XiNk, XiTk)T 
Yik=(YiPk, YiNk, YiTk)T 
be distinct 3 -length vectors of baseline SVI and end of infusion SVI, respectively. The subscript 
i=1,...6 indexes th e sequences, and P, N, T represent Placebo, NTG and BMS 986231. Moreover, 
k=1,...7 indexes subject k in sequence i.  
We fit the following linear mixed model:  
(YiTk-YiPk)|(XiTk-XiPk)=(T-P)+(iT-iP)+(T-P)(XiTk-XiPk)+(iTk-iPk), 
where T-P  is the difference of treatment effects of BMS -986231 and Placebo, iT-iP is the 
difference of treatment effect of BMS -986231 and Placebo within sequence i, T-P is the 
regression coefficient, and iTk-iPk is the variance term.

H0: T-P =0 
HA:T-P 0. 
The mean SVI at the end of 5 -hour infusion of BMS -986231 versus Placebo, corresponding 
standard error, p value, and 95% confidence interval will be calculated by the below SAS code  
and presented . Considering the sample size is small, the Kenward -Roger degree of freedom is 
used to adjust the standard error of treatment effect.

SVI will be summarized and listed for all randomized subjects as overall and by treatment.  
7.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Using the same model  as in the primary analysis , this analysis will be repeated for the secondary 
endpoints listed below and will also examine the comparison of  BMS-986231 vs NTG in 
addition to BMS -986231 vs Placebo.  
  Mean SVI derived from LVOT VTI at the end of the 5 -hours infusion of BMS -986231, 
versus NTG. 
 Mean LVEF, computed by Simpson’s method at the end of the 5 -hours infusion of BMS -
986231, versus placebo and NTG.  
 Mean cardiac power index (CPI) at the end of the 5 -hours infusion of BMS -986231, versus 
placebo and NTG.  Cardiac power index is calcula ted by the following equation: CPI [W/m2 ] 
= mean aortic pressure [mmHg] cardiac output [L/min] / body surface area [m2 ] 0.0022.  
 Mean Diastolic indices: E/A, annular e’ velocity, and E/e’ ratio at the end of the 5 -hours 
infusion of  BMS-986231, versus  placebo and NTG.  
 Mean LV global longitudinal strain, computed using STE at the end of the 5 -hours infusion 
of BMS-986231, versus placebo and NTG.  
The secondary endpoints will be summarized and listed for all randomized subjects as overall 
and by treatment.  
7.6 Safety 
All safety presentations will be based on the Safety Population.  
7.6.1 Deaths 
All reported deaths after a subject is enrolled (i.e., has signed the informed consent) will be listed 
separately by subject.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 19 7.6.2 Serious Adverse Events  
All reported seri ous adverse events (SAEs) will be listed by System Organ Class (SOCs) and 
Preferred Terms (PTs) for all safety population  subjects. SAEs must be collected from the date of 
informed consent and will be assessed up to 30 days after the end of infusion of the  last period.  
7.6.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded and grouped into PT by SOC, using current version of Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All recorded AEs will be summarized and listed by SOCs,  
PTs and treatment group . 
Non-serious AEs  with onset time from  the start of study drug infusion, until 24 hours after end of 
infusion in each treatment period of dosing in each period will be included in the summary 
tables. Events will be assigned to the study treatment administered to the subject . The proportion 
of subject s having an adverse event will be calculated as the number of subjects experiencing the 
event, divided by the total number of subjects receiving study treatment.  
All AE listings will indicate the unique subject identifier, age, g ender, current treatment, the date 
and time of onset, the date and time of resolution, day of onset relative to the start of treatment, 
action taken, investigator’s assessment of severity and relationship to study drug. Additional 
listings will be provided  for adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events without 
recorded resolution. Summaries of adverse events will include adverse events, adverse events by 
intensity and adverse events by relationship.   
Where a subject has the same adverse e vent, based on preferred terminology, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at the preferred 
terminology level in adverse event frequency tables.  
Where a subject has multiple adverse events within the sa me system organ class in a single 
analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at the system organ class level in adverse 
event frequency tables.  
When a subject has the same adverse event, based on preferred terminology, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to 
select the event to be included in summary tables:  
 Relationship to study medication  
 Intensity of event  
 Onset date and time  
When reporting adverse events by intensity, in addition to providing a summary table based on 
the event selection criteria detailed above, summary tables will also be provided based on the 
most intense event  during the analysis period - independent of relationship to study medication. 
For these tables, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to select the event to 
be included in summary  tables: 
 Intensity of event  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 20  Onset date and time  
Subjects will only be counted once in the ‘Total’ at their maximum intensity, regardle ss of SOC 
or PT. 
7.6.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The results of all protocol -specified clinical laboratory tests will be listed . Scheduled laboratory 
measurements will be summarized by treatment and scheduled time points for each laboratory 
test. 
The criteria used for classifying laboratory test results as markedly abnormal will be listed.  
Laboratory results for subjects with any marked laboratory abnormality (scheduled and 
unscheduled) will be listed. This listing will include all observations for the spe cific laboratory 
test and subject, not only the marked laboratory abnormalities. The frequency of subjects with 
any marked laboratory abnormality as well as hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis 
marked abnormalities, based on pre -specified criteria  (see Table 6.6.2.4-1), will be presented.  
Troponin T will be summarized descriptively by treatment for each time point, as well as change 
from baseline. Geometric mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) will also be presented  for the 
original values and percent of baseline.

7.8 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects at pre-dose, 0.5, 1 and 4.5 hours during 
infusion and 2  hours after end of infusion and plasma concentrations will be measured using 
LC-MS. In addition, a  PK sample will be collected from the subject when the dose is lowered 
due to a safety event and also at time of early discontinuation of study drug.  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters for BMS -986231 and BMT-284730 and other metabolites ( e.g., BMT-279554 and 
CAR-000463) will be estimated  as appropriate . The plasma concentration data may also be used 
to conduct population pharmacokinetic analysis and exposure -response analysis with select 
efficacy and safety endpoints.  Results of the population pharmacokinetic and e xposure-response 
analysis will be reported in a separate report.  
The PK population will be used for all listings. The Evaluable PK population will be used  for 
summaries and statistical analyses.  Geometric mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) will also

BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 25 be presented for sample  plasma concentration -time data.  Analysis will include all analyte data in 
the PK dataset for BMS -986231 and metabolites of BMS -986231. 
Subject plasma concentration -time profiles will be listed and summarized by treatment and 
nominal collection time for each analyte. Plots of mean (+SD) plasma concentration profiles 
versus time will be presented for each analyte, and all treatments will be superimposed on the 
same plot.  Concentration at the  end of infusion will also be summarized by t reatment, which is 
the concentration at hour 5 for subjects completing 5 hours infusion and the concentration 
collected at early discontinuation for subjects not completing 5 hours infusion . The PK sample s 
collected when the dose is  lowered due to a safety  event will be listed. 
 
8 CONVENTIONS  
8.1 Safety Data Conventions  
Except as noted in Section 7.6, safety data will be handled according to the BMS safety data 
conventions4. This document includes descriptions on how to analyze AE data as well as how to 
handle partial dates, missing dates, and unknown end dates when analyzing safety data.  If onset 
time of AEs is missing or incomplete, the onset date of AEs will be used to determine if the AEs 
will be included in the AE summary tables as follows. 
 Non-serious AEs will be included in summary tables if the onset date /time is on or after the 
start of the study drug infusion until 24 hours after endo f infusion in each treatment period 
of dosing.  
 Serious AEs will be included in summary tables if the onset date /time is on or after the start 
date of study drug infusion until 30 days after the end of infusion of the last period.  
8.2 Baseline  Measurements  
For analyses involving baseline, the baseline value is defined by the last value prior to the star t of 
infusion, unless otherwise noted.  
When there is a missing baseline assessment it will not be imputed.  
8.3 Multiple Measurements  
For longitudinal summaries of data, if there are multiple records within the same Hour ranges , 
then the value closest to the time of the planned  time points  is selected  unless specified 
otherwise.  
Laboratory Measurements  
For tabulations of changes from baseline or shift analyses, if multiple laboratory measurements 
are obtained within the same nominal visit, then the measurement obtained on the day closest to 
the target day for that nominal visit will be used; in the case of a tie, the measurement obtained 
on the earlier day will be used in the analyses.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 26 For tabulations of incidence of marked abnormalities (e.g. ALT > 3xULN), if m ultiple laboratory 
measurements are obtained within the same nominal visit, then the worst measurement within the 
nominal visit window nominal visit will be used.  
Vital Signs and ECGs  
If multiple vital sign or ECG measurements are obtained within the same nominal visit,  then the 
measurement obtained on the day closest to the target day for that nominal visit  will be used; in 
the case of a tie, the measurement obtained on the earlier day will be used  in the analyses.  
8.4 Pharmacokinetic Summaries  
In-text Tables  
For in-text pharmacokinetic tables, coefficient of variation (%CV) will be reported as integers. 
For other statistics except for standard deviations, values of 100 or higher will be presented as 
integers, values of 10 - <100 will be displayed to one decima l place, and values of 1 - < 10 will 
be displayed to two decimal places. Values less than 1 will be displayed to three decimal places.  
Ratios will also be displayed to three decimal places. Standard deviations will be reported to a 
precision of 1 decimal place more than the mean.  
Handling of Non -Quantifiable Concentrations  
For the summaries of  plasma concentration -time data, concentrations that are less than the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) should be displayed as “< LLOQ” in the listings and be tre ated as 
missing in summary tables and plots.   
All available plasma concentration -time data will be included in the PK data set and listed 
accordingly.  
Treatment of Outliers  
Individual  plasma concentrations, if deemed to be anomalous, may be excluded from the analysis 
following a review of available documentation (e.g., bioanalytical report, clinical data). Any 
such exclusion will be clearly listed in the study report along with justification for exclusion.  
Entire plasma concentration -time profiles for a su bject may be excluded following review of 
available documentation (e.g., bioanalytical report, clinical data). However, results of analysis 
with and without the excluded profiles may be presented in the study report. Any such exclusion 
will be clearly list ed in the study report along with justification for exclusion.  
PK Exclusions5 
PK Analysis, Reporting, and Exclusion criteria should follow the BMS PK Harmonization 
document Version 3.0.  
9 CONTENT OF REPORTS  
Statistical components for the clinical study report will be based on the content of this statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Details of the tables, listings, and figures to be prepared for interim analyses 
and the final CSR will be included in a study -specific Data Presentation Plan (DPP).

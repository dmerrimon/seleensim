Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 6 of 34 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
The present approaches to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are 
limited and for some patients there are significant drawbacks that have not been resolved. 
It would be desirable to provide a source of relief for constipation that would permit 
dosing adjustments to optimize effic acy and safety and that would be pleasant to consume 
to improve patient compliance.  The treatment should not have the  safety issues associated 
with oral phosphate laxatives, have an acceptable safety profile, and be effective in 
numerous types of constipa tion. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. is investigat ing the use of a new chemical composition, 
BLI400 (Lactitol Monohydrate NF Powder for Reconstitution) as a treatment for adult 
constipation.  Ample published literature with lactitol provides significant prec linical and 
clinical studies which support the safe and effective use of this GRAS -listed compound.  
These reports indicate that the BLI400 lactitol composition has promise as a candidate for 
further development for the treatment of constipation, as review ed herein. 
BLI400 is a member of the pharmaceutical class of osmotic laxatives; specifically it is a 
non-absorbed, colonically metabolized sugar alcohol (polyol). Studies reviewed here 
indicate it provides relief from the symptoms of constipation by rapidl y inducing a 
patient-controlled bowel movement. While lactitol appears to be minimally, if at all, 
absorbed in the small intestine,  colonic microbes split lactitol into D -galactose and D -
sorbitol, which are fermentable to organic acids including lactic, f ormic, propionic, 
butyric and acetic acids (as reviewed in Patil et al, 1987).  The osmotic properties of the 
small organic molecules consistently point to their pharmacodynamic effects as dependent 
on water retention with the stool.  Thus, BLI400 is a pro -drug of an essentially non -
absorbed osmotic laxative. Lactitol is generally considered to be pharmacologically inert 
and is often referred to as a “prebiotic” with no specific receptor targets for its laxative 
action.

Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 7 of 34 Rationale for Performing Research with the Investigational Product  
Lactitol monohydrate, at a daily dose of 21 grams per day appears to be a safe and 
effective treatment for constipation, but it has not been studied and proven in clinical 
trials in the US. Lactitol appears to be a  “prebiotic”, a substrate for colonic bacteria which 
convert it into osmotically active small molecules. Extensive published and non -published 
literature supports its safety and efficacy, but a Phase I II clinical trial is required for its 
registration in t he US.  It is envisaged there will be one, multi-site, controlled stud y in 
patients with documented constipation and that the design will be similar to other studies 
that have led to the approval of laxatives, such as those for MiraLAX, NDA 22 -015 and 
consistent with FDA’s recommendations for study endpoints in CIC trials .  
 
Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
Lactitol is a simple monosaccharide sugar alcohol, a synthetic derivative of the milk sugar 
lactose that was discovered  in the 1920s.  It is a dry, free flowing powder, readily soluble 
in aqueous solutions.  As shown by the structure diagrams, it is an analog of the 
disaccharide lactulose.

grams of BLI400  powder.  
 
Nonclinical Studies :  Extensive non clinical studies have been performed with lactitol as 
support for its registration and marketing in countries outside the US  and are reviewed in 
detail in the BLI400 Investigators’ Brochure .  The studies have covered basic 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and mu tagenicity, acute and chronic studies including 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity.  These studies were carried out in mice, rats, 
dogs and rabbits.  
 
Pharmacology:  Lactitol is not degraded by the galactosidase enzymes of the small 
intestine.  However, colonic microflora degrade lactitol extensively in rats so that lactitol 
elevated the proportions of acetic acid and lowered proportions of butyric acid in the 
hindgut of rats.  The osmotic effects of these organic acids appear to provide the 
pharmacodynamic basis for lactitol’s laxative action. Increased output of moist feces was 
seen in all animals species studied in a dose -related manner. The highest doses tested 
caused frank diarrhea in some studies.  
Metabolic Effects: In some studies, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were 
reduced equally in rats fed diets containing 7% sorbitol or lactitol .  By acidifying fecal 
contents, lactitol lowered ammonia levels in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, 
perhaps as a result of production of the poorly absorbed ammonium ion that follows 
lowering the cecal pH. Rats fed a diet containing 5% of lactitol for two weeks displayed a 
significant increase of calcium absorp tion.  
Toxicology  Studies: Only weak edema ensued after lactitol application to intact skin, but 
erythema and edema emerged when it was applied to abraded skin. Rodents treated with 
lactitol had l oose, frequent stools and cecal enlargement . This was often accompanied by 
decreased weight gain and increased water consumption. Clinical chemistry changes 
included changes in electrolyte levels, decreased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase. 
Perhaps as compensation for the electrolyte changes that probably follo wed the diarrhea, 
adrenal weight and hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata were seen in the highest dose

follow the increased calcium absorption. Lactitol was not conside red positive for 
mutagenicity or chromosomal damage studied in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Life-long carcinogenicity studies have indicated that Leydig cell dysplasia occurred in 
rats at high lactitol doses, but this was not seen in mice dosed fo r 24 month s or dogs 
dosed for 12 months. This species -specific effect in some rat strains was not considered 
significant to humans , since ordinary milk sugar, lactose, produces a similar effect in 
rodents.  
Clinical Pharmacology and Safety:  Since lactitol is extensively degraded to organic 
acids in the colon, it is little surprise that there are no published studies on its level in 
blood after administration.  Some have estimated that only 0.6% of an oral dose of lactitol 
is excreted in urine . Similar to wh at is found in animals, lactitol is extensively 
metabolized in the human colon, making available a significant proportion of the 
metabolites for colonic absorption.  Unlike in animals, l actitol does not seem to stimulate 
calcium absorption in humans, althou gh in one study when 15 g of lactitol was 
administered along with calcium in solution to fasting volunteers , calcium absorption was 
diminished .  Administering lactitol increases fecal Bifidobacteria  levels, while other 
bacteria ( fecal anaerobes, aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli ) were unaffected. 
After the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose by eight healthy male volunteers the 
rise in plasma glucose was significantly greater 30  and 60 minutes after ingestion of 
glucose while no rise in plasma glucose followed ingestion of lactitol.  
The investigation of the use of a mixture of lactitol for the treatment of constipation has 
been extensively studied, but the information is only av ailable in published form. From 
these observations, it appears that lactitol’s adverse events are limited largely to the 
gastrointestinal system. Symptoms such as nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, flatulence 
and vomiting may be expected and could lead to wit hdrawal from the study if not 
controlled.  Their incidence and severity may be ameliorated in some patients by dose -
adjustment .  Changes in hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis may be seen, and 
their clinical significance will be assessed during th e development of lactitol.  In one 
study plasma potassium was elevated with lactitol, but the values stayed within the normal 
range.

Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 10 of 34 Clinical Efficacy : Lactitol has been marketed since at least 1985 outside the US in 
Europe and other regions (where it is k nown as Lactitol Ex -Lax® or Importal®, for 
example) as a syrup or powder for the treatment of constipation in adults , including the 
elderly and children.  As a result a substantial body of evidence has accumulated on its 
use in treating constipation, as ev idenced by more than 19 publications since 1988, 
including two recent review articles (Maydeo, 2010; Faruqui and Joshi, 2012).  
A minimal effective dose of 0.25 g/kg has been suggested, and most studies have found 
that a starting dose of 20 g of lactitol is  effective and produces minimal side effects.  
Some studies that have allowed the subjects to make dosage increases to achieve relief of 
constipation symptoms and dose reductions to minimize side effects have indicated that 
this strategy can optimize thera py.  
Maydeo (2010) presented a systematic review of six published randomized, non -
randomized and open trials comparing the safety and efficacy of lactitol to those of 
lactulose. Overall, lactitol was comparable to lactulose in efficacy measures (normal sto ol 
consistency and number of bowel movement per week). Patients found lactitol to be more 
acceptable and were more compliant with it largely due to its superior palatability (73.2 % 
vs. 26.8 %). Lactitol was significantly better than lactulose in the frequ ency of adverse 
events (31.2 ± 0.8 % vs. 62.1 ±1.1 %, p= 0.0019). The physicians’ assessment favored 
lactitol as compared to lactulose (61.91% vs. 47.83%).  The following table is adapted 
from Maydeo’s summary of the reviewed trials.

To compare the safety and efficacy of BLI400 laxative versus placebo  in constipated adults. 
 
3. STUDY PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center study in constipated adult 
subjects. 
3.2. Number of Subjects 
Approximately 600 constipated, but otherwise healthy subjects will be randomized into 
this study. Approximately 30% of enrolled subjects will be elderly (greater than 65 years 
of age at time of randomization) . A “completed” subject is defined as one who took the 
study treatment and completed 6 months of treatment .  
3.3. Duration of Study  
The day after Visit 1 , subjects will begin a 14 day Screening Period to confirm their 
constipation status. Qualifying subjects will  be randomized at Visit 2 and will begin a 6 
month Treatment Period. Subjects will return for follow up clinic visits every 4 weeks 
during the Treatment Period .   
3.4. Study Treatments  
 
BLI400 Laxative 
BLI400 laxative will be provided polyethylene bottles containing enough study 
medication for approximately 30 days. The bottles will be equipped with a cap that can be 
used to measure 10.5 grams of BLI400. Using the provided measuring cap on the bottle, 
subjects will be instructed to mix 2 capfuls of study medication (approximately 21 g) in 4-
8 oz of juice or other beverage and take once daily , preferably in the morning . Subjects 
that develop persistent diarrhea or loose stools will be allowed to adjust their dose down 
to 10.5g (1 capful) per day.   
 
BLI400 placebo will be provided in identical polyethylene bottles containing regular 
maltodextrin.

Rescue Bisacodyl  
Subjects will be dispensed  bisacodyl tablets at each study visit . Subjects will be instructed  
to take 5 – 10mg (1 -2 tablets) of bisacodyl if they are experiencing severe discomfort due 
to their constipation, or have not had a BM in 4 days.  No more than 6 tablets (30mg) of 
bisacodyl should be taken in a week.  
 
If a subject does not have a bowel m ovement within 24 hours of taking a bisacodyl dose, a 
second dose should be taken. If after the second bisacodyl dose the subject does not have a 
BM within 24 hours, the subject should contact the site. The investigator should then 
consider having the subj ect return for an evaluation and/or discontinuing the subject from the 
study to seek alternative treatment . 
 
All study medication is required to remain at room temperature 20°-25°C (68° -77°F); 
excursions permitted between 15° -30°C (59° -86°F). 
 
All drug components will also have a clinical label containing a caution statement, study 
code, study sponsor and subject number. 
 
Sites can view weekly summaries of subject diary data, including rescue bisacodyl use. 
Investigators should consider disconti nuing subjects consistently taking more than 30mg 
of bisacodyl per week.

additional procedures should be performed on th ese subjects until after they have 
completed washout.   Subjects will receive a reminder card detailing the washout period.   
Rescue bisacodyl will not be dispensed at this visit.  When subjects return following 
washout, concomitant  medications should be reviewed, physical exam, vital signs, ECG, 
blood draws and serum pregnancy test should be performed (if not done previously).   
4.1.1.   Informed Consent  
Following the informed consent process, study subjects will sign a current IRB approved 
consent form. No study procedures may be performed prior to the subject providing 
informed consent. The subject’s original signed and personally dated Informed Consent 
Form (together with any subsequent IRB approved amended versions) must be retained by 
the Investigator in the subject’s file.  A copy of the original signed and dated Informed 
Consent Form must be given to the subject.  
4.1.2.  Enrollment and Allocation of Subject Number 
Subjects will be enrolled into the study only when they have given their written, informed 
consent to participate.  
Subjects enrolled at the screening visit will be assigned a subject number by site personnel .  
This number will consist of:  
• The 3-digit Site Number;  
• A 3-digit subject identifier number (this number is a sequentially allocated number). Each 
site will begin with 001 for the first subject screened, 002 for the second and so on.  For 
example, the third subject screened at Site 15 will become Subject Number 15003.  After a

4.1.3.  Electronic Subject Diary  during Scree ning Period  
Subjects will be asked to use an electronic subject  diary to self-report their bowel 
movement and rescue medication experiences each day.  Subjects will be required to enter 
data on each bowel movement as soon as possible following completion. This data will 
include assessments of BM completeness, consistency, straining and u rgency.  
Each dosing episode of rescue medication will be entered. Instructions  on how to 
complete the diary questions will be supplied in a separate manual.  
4.2. Visit 2 
Subjects will return to the study center as soon as possible after the 14 day Screening 
Period for Visit 2.  
 
BM Entry Criteri a – to be eligible for randomization, subjects must meet the following 
criteria related to their Screening Period BMs:  
• average of fewer than 3  complete spontaneous bowel movement s (CSBMs) per 
week during the 14 day Screening Period. A CSBM is defined as a bowel 
movement which has occurred with no rescue laxative use in the prior 24 hours  
and is accompanied by a sense of complete evac uation 
• average of fewer than 6 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week during  
the 14 day Screening Period. An SBM is defined as a bowel movement which has 
occurred with no rescue laxative use in the prior 24 hours  
• No more than 1 SBM with a Bristol Stool rating of 6  
• No SBMs with a Bristol Stool rating of 7

Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 18 of 34 4.2.1.  Randomization  
Subjects that meet the BM and Diary Compliance Criteria  will be randomized  using an 
automated interactive web response system (IWRS) . The randomization schedule will be 
implemented in the automated interactive web response (IWR) system  prior to kit 
distribution to the site.  At the time of randomization the IWRS will as sign a drug kit 
number for site personnel to dispense to the subject. Subjects will be stratified into one of 
the following two groups:  
 
Group 1: Subjects < 65 years of age at time of randomization  
Group 2: Subjects > 65 years of age at time of randomizat ion 
 
The site personnel must only dispense a drug kit that has been assigned by the IWRS.  
Dispensing kits out of order is considered a protocol violation.  
 
Vital signs  will be taken.   Subjects will be queried for any adverse events or changes to 
their concomitant medications.   
 
4.2.2.  Study Drug  
During Visit 2, subjects will be provided with instructions on how to take the study 
medication and rescue medication. One bottle of study drug (a 30 day supply) will be 
dispensed per subject along with one box of rescue bisacodyl . The study drug bottle wi ll 
be weighed for drug accountability purposes.  Subjects will take a daily dose of 2 capfuls 
of study powder until they return for Visit 3.  Subjects will be instructed  to return all 
medication (including bisacodyl) and components  at Visit 3.  
 
4.3. Treatment Period 
4.3.1.  Electronic Subject Diary  during Treatment Period  
 
Each day during the Treatment Period , subjects will complete their e -diary reporting. 
Subjects will report each bowel movement as it occurs along with related symptoms and

Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 19 of 34 characteristics (consistenc y, straining, urgency, completeness). Subjects will also report 
their daily study medication and rescue medication doses  (if applicable)  as they occur.  
4.3.2.  Treatment Day 1 
Starting the morning of  Treatment Day 1 (the day after randomization), s ubjects will 
measure two (2) capfuls of study medication and ingest it mixed in a beverage of their 
choice. When possible, s ubjects should take each dose at appromiately the same time 
every day  (preferably in the morning ). Subjects that develop persistent diarrhea or loose 
stools should contact their study center. Subjects with persistent diarrhea or loose stools 
will be allowed to adjust their dose down to 10 .5g (1 capful) per day.   
  
4.3.3.  Visits 3 – 7 (Days 28, 56, 84, 112 and 140 )  
Subjects will return to the clinic every 4 weeks (+/ - 2 days) for Visits 3 – 7.  Vital signs  
(see section 4.1 for details) will be taken .  Study personnel will weigh returned study 
medication bottles  and count rescue bisacodyl tablets for accountability purposes and for 
consistency with the electronic diary reporting. Study personnel must discuss any 
electronic diary reporting irregularities (e.g. missed study medication or excessive rescue 
bisacodyl use, reporting compliance). Subjects will be queried for any adverse events or 
changes to their concomitant medications. Samples for chemistry, hematology , PK  and 
urinalysis will be repe ated as outlined in Section 4. 1 (Note: serum pregnancy testing will 
be conducted at Visits 1, 5 and 8 only).  
 
Subjects suspected by the Investigator o f having developed lactic acidosis, characterized 
by abnormally low bicarbonate with abnormally high anion gap ( deemed clinically 
significant by the investigator ), should return for a redraw to test for lactate.  Subjects 
with high lactate levels believed to be caused by the study medication should be 
discontinued.  
 
A 30 day supply of study medication  (1 bottle) along with 1 box of rescue bisacodyl will 
be dispensed  at each visit . Unused product will not be redispensed.  No rescue medication 
will be redispensed .  Subjects will be instructed to bring all medication  (including 
bisacodyl)  and components  at each follow up visit.

Subjects with persistent diarrhea or loose stools will be allowed to adjust their dose down 
to 10.5g (1 capful) per day.   
 
At Visit 7 (Day 140), 2 bottles of study medication will be dispensed so that subjects have 
a sufficient supply to reach Visit 8 (Day 180 ).  
4.3.4.  Visit 8 – Day 180 (or Early Term)  
 
Subjects will return at after a approximately 180 days of dosing (+4 days) for their final 
clinic visit . Vital signs will be taken .  A 12-lead ECG will be performed by qualified, 
trained site personnel.   ECG output must be reviewed by a physician investigator. A 
physical examination will be performed. Study personnel will weigh study medication 
bottles and count rescue bisacodyl tablets for accountability purposes and for consistency 
with the electronic diary reporting. Study personnel must discuss any electronic diary 
reporting irregularities (e.g. missed study medication or excessive rescue bisac odyl use, 
reporting compliance) . Subjects will be queried for any adverse events or changes to their 
concomitant medications. Samples for chemistry , hematology ,urinalysis  and PK will be 
repeated as outlined  in Section 4. 1. Subjects suspected by the Investigator of having 
developed lactic ac idosis (as described in Section 4.3. 3) should return for a redraw to test 
for lactate.   
 
4.3.5.  Day 194 Follow-up Telephone Call : +/- 3 days 
At Day 194, approximately 2 weeks after the last study visit  or early term visit , site 
personnel will contact subjects by telephone to query if any new adverse events have 
occurred and if any adverse events ongoing at Visit 8 have resolved. Subjects will also be 
asked about the status of their concomitant medications.

4.5. Pregnancy  
Subjects who are female and of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test 
done at Visit 1. A positive result will rule out the pa rticipation of the subject in the study.  
Additional serum pregnancy tests will be performed at Visits 5 and 8. If a subject 
becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed from the study and 
followed until one month after the end of the preg nancy. 
 
Female study subjects must be surgically sterilized or using oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double -barrier method, intrauterine device, or testifies that she is monogamous 
with a vasectomized partner. Subjects practicing abstinence must  agree to use an acceptable 
form of birth control should they become sexually active during the study.  
 
Women with a history of bilateral tubal ligation are not considered of childbearing 
potential and are not required to have a pregnancy test at screening . 
 
Oral contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections are only considered effective if 
started at least 1 month before the study.  
 
Menopausal status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a woman of  
appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified cause of  
amenorrhea . 
 
4.6. Concomitant Medication s 
The use of concomitant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to Visit 1 until the 
end of the study  at the telephone contact on Day 194. Subjects enrolled in this study  will 
not be permitted to take  any laxatives  (other than the sponsor supplied res cue bisacodyl) , 
whether prescription or over -the-counter, from Visit 1 until after completion of Treatment 
Day 180. Any restricted laxative use  during the study may result in termination of 
subject’s participation. Subjects may not initiate treatment with any constipating 
medication.

5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use   
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (inluding a clinically significant  abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.   
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the subjects providing informed consent to 
participate in the study and will conclude with the end of study participation at Day 194 (2 
week follow -up phone call).   Diarrhea should be re ported as an adverse event if a subject 
has more than 3 watery stools per day  (Bristol Stool Rating = 7) . Subjects with clinically 
significant laboratory results at Visit 8 which are classified by the Investigator as adverse 
events should return for a repe at blood draw. Subjects will be instructed to report promptly 
adverse events to the Investigator. The Investigator will record date/time of report, date/time 
of onset, description of the adverse event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding 
treatment of the event, action(s) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse 
event, and the Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study treatment.  
 
The Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event  using the following 
categories:  
 
Grade Severity Description  
1 
 Mild Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
Causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
Causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 
Severe Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
Activities 
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death  
Life threatening or disabling  
5 Fatal Causes death of the participant  
 
Braintree Laboratories , Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -302 Amendment #1  
Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 24 of 34 The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using 
the following categories:  
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
In published Phase 3 studies, adverse events associated with BLI400 administered at 
doses required for effective treatment of constipation included flatulence, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal cramping  or pain and bloating . These adverse reactions were 
transient and subsided rapidly  upon dose adjustment or cessation . 
 
 
6. SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in at 
least one of the following outcom es: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage

8. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
8.1. Modification of Protocol  
Neither an Investigator nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protocol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the othe r and the IRB. Investigators that continually violate 
the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. 
The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems 
the incidence or severity of adverse events to be unacceptable.  
 
8.2. Subjects Discontinued from the Study  
Subjects may be dropped from the study for any of the following reasons:  
1) Subject did not meet BM Entry Criteri a. 
2) Subject did not meet Diary Compliance Criterion . 
3) Subject took prohibited laxatives during the Screening or Treatment Period 
4) An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication).  
5) The Investigator  decides that the subject should be dropped from the  
       study (e.g. serious adverse event, protocol violation , non-compliance ). 
6) The subject decides to withdraw from the study. Subjects are free to  
       withdraw their consent and discontinue participation in the study at any   
       time. 
 
Braintree Laboratories should be contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study, Braintree Laboratories must be notified with an 
explanation for all discontinuances.

9.1. Sample Size  
Six hundred subjects will be randomly assigned to BLI400 (21 g/day dose) or placebo in a 
ratio of 1:1 (300 BLI400 , 300 placebo).  The definition of a weekly responder is based on 
weekly assessments of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs).  
Based on data from a previous laxative study (Lembo et al, 2011) utilizing this  primary 
efficacy variable ( percent of subjects who are res ponders), it is anticipated that 
approximately 20% of subjects would be classified as responders in the  BLI 400 arm, 
with a placebo response up to 10%. The proposed study size will have approximately  90% 
power to detect a difference of 10% between the acti ve and placebo groups at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05 . 
9.2. Null and Alternative Hypotheses  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy  BLI400 Laxative 
to placebo in subjects with constipation. To establish this, the primary comparison of 
interest will be on the overall responder percentage  based on 12 weeks of treatment . A 
weekly responder is a subject who has ≥ 3 CSBMs and an increase  from baseline of > 1 
CSBM in that week.  
The null hypothesis will be that there is no difference in the response rates between 
BLI400 Laxative and placebo ; the alternative hypothesis is that the response rate is higher 
for BLI400 laxative than for placebo.  
9.3. Planned Analyses  
Data analysis will be pe rformed after all subjects have completed the study. No interim 
analyses are planned.  
9.3.1.   Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
An analysis of b aseline comparability of the following demographic and baseline 
characteristics for the treatment groups will be performed.   
• Age (ANOVA)  
• Gender (CMH Chi square)  
Braintree Laboratories , Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -302 Amendment #1  
Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 28 of 34 • Race/ethnicity (CMH Chi square)  
• Weight (ANOVA)  
• Screening Period Constipation Status (ANOVA)  
 
9.3.2.  Efficacy Analyses  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall 
treatment  success or failure . The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of 
subjects who are weekly responders for 9 out of the first 12 weeks of treatment , with at 
least 3 of these weeks occurring during weeks 9–12 of treatment. A weekly responder is a 
subject who has ≥ 3 CSBMs and an increase from baseline of > 1 CSBM in that week.  A 
CSBM is a bowel movement that occurs with no rescue laxative use in the previous 24 
hours and that is accompanied by a sense of complete evacuation.  
 
The following equation will be used to calculate the weekly CSBM frequency:  
CSBM frequency = 7 x (Number of CSBMs/number of days with non -missing CSBM 
assessments)  
 
If a subject has fewer than four days of data observed for a week, then that subject’s data 
should be considered missing for that entire week and the subject considered a non -
responder.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analy zed using the CMH test controlling for the effect 
of study center. The presence of a treatment -by-center interaction will be investigated by the 
Breslow-Day test of homogeneity of the odds ratio.  The strategy for pooling centers will be 
based on geographical considerations , with low enrolling centers pooled by geographic 
region.  Details of any pooling performed will be documented prior to database lock and 
unblinding of the study.  
No bowel movements that occur within 24 hours of a rescue bisacodyl (or other prohibited 
laxative) dose will be included in primary or secondary efficacy analyses.  
 
Braintree Laboratories , Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -302 Amendment #1  
Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 29 of 34 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include the following:  
• Overall response by gender and age group (< 65, > 65 years, > 75 years) 
• Number of study medication doses taken per week  
• Number of rescue doses taken per week (includes bisacodyl and other non -study 
laxative) 
• % of subjects not meeting ROME criteria at the end of each treatment week  
• BM Frequency per week (SBM and CSBM)  
• BM Frequ ency per month (SBM and CSBM)  
• BM Symptom Ratings per week  (straining, consistency, urgency, Bristol score)  
• BM Symptom Ratings per month (straining, consistency, urgency, Bristol score)  
• Number of diarrhea episodes per week (diarrhea is defined as > 3 watery  stools per day)  
 
9.3.3.Safety Analyses  
Analysis of safety will be performed using the modified Intent-to-Treat population (see 
Section 9.4).  Safety analyses may also be presented by age, gender and racial subgroup.  
 
Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA classification to provide a preferred 
term and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportions of subjects wit h adverse 
events will be presented by treatment group.  Tables of AEs will be presented by system 
organ class and preferred term, and include overall totals for AEs within each system 
organ class.  Counting will be done by subject and not by event.  A tabl e of counts and 
percentages will also be made of those subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to 
withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had an onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of the first dose of study drug up to 14 days after the last dose of 
Braintree Laboratories , Inc.  Confidential

Version dated  9-19-2016-2016  Page 30 of 34 study medication .  Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be consi dered as 
treatment -emergent.  
The difference in adverse event rates between study groups will be tested by Chi -Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95% confidence intervals.  Adverse events will be presented for 
the overall Treatment Perio d. 
Laboratory Paramet ers  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each treatment group for each laboratory parameter at each 
visit.  When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation w ithin a visit 
window will be used if there are multiple observations.  Changes from Visit 1 (Screening)  
will be presented in a similar format.  An additional listing will be provided of those 
subjects who have clinically significant laboratory values.  The  data will also be presented 
as shift tables , and clinically significant abnormalities will be examined.  
Results of laboratory tests for the change from Visit 1 (Screening) and group differences 
will be tested using ANOVA.  
Vital Signs  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each treatment group for each vital sign at each visit.  
When cal culating the summary statistics only, the last observation within a visit window 
will be used if there are multiple observations.  The data will also be presented as shift 
tables and clinically significant abnormalities will be examined.  
ECG variables will  be tabulated and presented for data collected at each visit . Data will be 
tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, CV%, SEM, 
minimum, and maximum) for each of the ECG variables. The differences in ECG 
variables between Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 8 will be tested using ANOVA.

The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.4.1.Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This population includes all subjects randomized to treatment and will be used for 
sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
9.4.2.  Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
This population consists of all randomized subjects that took at least one dose of study 
medication. This population will be utilized for primary and secondary  efficacy analys es 
and all safety analyses.  
9.4.3.  Per-Protocol Population  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects in the mITT population who 
have not violated the study eligibility  criteria and have not deviated significantly from the 
protocol during the course of the study.  Any efficacy analyses from this population will 
be considered as supportive to the ITT and mITT analyses.  Reasons for exclusion from 
the PP population will be defined prospectively in the statistical analysis plan and prior to 
unblinding of the data.

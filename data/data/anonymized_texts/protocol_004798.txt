The main  objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the ANNETM Sleep system to serve 
as a diagnostic aid for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults. Our primary 
hypothesis is that the ANNETM Sleep system is non-inferior compared to polysomnography (PSG) 
for the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA. 
3. INTRODUCTION  
Sleep disordered  breathing (SDB) is an increasingly common disorder characterized by a 
pathological increase in upper airway resistance experienced during sleep that ranges from 
benign snoring to its most severe form of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized 
by recurrent episodes of cessation of breathing and physiological stress as a result of intermittent 
periods of hypoxemia, and arousals. Studies have demonstrated that OSA leads to profound 
sleep fragmentation, disturbance of the autonomic nervous system, insulin resistance, increased 
systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and subsequent vascular endothelial dysfunction. These 
physiologic changes cause significant morbidity; OSA is an independent risk factor for wide 
ranging adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, 
myocardial infarction), metabolic disorders (insulin insensitivity, diabetes), neurological 
(dementia), motor vehicle accidents, and mood disorders.1-5 
The ANNETM Sleep  system has been validated in multiple clinical studies including a pilot 
investigation of its performance against a Type III Home Sleep Apnea Test (HST). In controlled 
clinical testing scenarios (n=13) with breathe-down studies of gases with lower and lower amounts 
of oxygen to induce hypoxia, the system has validated heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen 
saturation (SpO 2) against gold-standard monitoring systems. The average root mean square error 
(ARMS) is <1 heart beats per minute, 2.9% blood oxygenation, and 1.3 breaths per minute. The 
ARMS in the pediatric population (>150 subjects) is <2.5 heart beats per minute, 2.9% blood 
oxygenation, and 1.9 breaths per minute. In a comparison study of ANNETM Sleep vs HST in n=46 
high-risk individuals, the sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95% for the diagnosis of moderate 
to severe OSA was defined by an apnea-hypopnea index >15. The system is indicated for 
detection limits as follows:
●Heart rate:  0 to 300 beats per minute
●Respiratory  rate: 0 to 60 breaths per minute
●Oxygen  Saturation (SpO 2): 70 – 100%
In this  context, this study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of the ANNETM Sleep system to 
serve as a diagnostic aid for moderate to severe OSA.

STU0021444
Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 12 of 544.  STUDY ENDPOINTS
4.1 Primary  Outcome Measures
The diagnosis  of moderate to severe OSA by determining a patient’s Apnea-Hypopnea Index 
(AHI) using the ANNETM Sleep system compared to Polysomnography (PSG) over one (1) night 
worn concurrently.
4.2 Exploratory  measures
The following subset  of exploratory measures are intended to provide additional information. A 
full list is provided in section 11.5.
Evaluation  of the predictive value of the ANNETM Sleep system to differentiate obstructive vs 
central apnea events using the system’s onboard sensors
Patient  reported preferences between PSG and ANNETM Sleep
Patient  reported survey results for the ANNETM Sleep system
5.  RECRUITMENT METHODS
5.1 Recruitment  centers
Study subjects  will be recruited in 4 centers if they self-report symptoms of OSA or are 
prescribed either a PSG or HST by their regular healthcare provider when OSA is suspected 
from one of the following study sites: 
1) Carle  Foundation Hospital 
2) Northwestern  Memorial Hospital (NMH)
3) Northwestern  Lake Forest Hospital
4) Northwestern  Medical Group (NMG)
5) Central  DuPage Hospital (CDH)
5.2 Recruitment  procedures 
All recruiting  processes will follow this protocol and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Recruitment will occur in via two main strategies. The first will be community based and clinic 
based advertisements via social media ads, and physical fliers. The second will be center based 
recruitment via Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
5.2.1 Screening  potential patients
A study  coordinator may flag orders for PSG or HST studies via screening of EHRs. An algorithm 
will be set up based on the eligibility criteria of the trial to identify potential patients who have met 
enrollment criteria to establish a roster of potential subjects to be recruited. Study subjects who 
have a previous diagnosis of OSA or self-reported OSA symptoms may be enrolled in the study.
For all  Northwestern Hospitals, additional methods of identifying participants will be through the 
Electronic Data Warehouse (EDW) and through the use of study flyers and recruitment materials. 
The EDW at Northwestern is updated daily. An algorithm can be set up based on the eligibility 
criteria of the trial to identify potential participants that have met enrollment criteria. Data gathered 
IRB #: STU00213322-MODCR0001 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 9/13/2021 through 9/12/2022.
STU0021444
Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 13 of 54in the  EDW request will include Name, contact information (address, email and/or phone), Date 
of Birth, MRN, hospitalization date(s), and if applicable, date that a HST or PSG is ordered. The 
EDW request may exclude people based on the exclusion criteria. The use of the EDW will be 
used exclusively for recruitment purposes and no data from the warehouse will be added to the 
study data set for research analysis. The use of study flyers or advertisements will also be shared 
with potential study subjects who will be given contact information to follow up with the study 
team. For Carle Foundation Hospital, the site may utilize MyCarle, a patient database, to locate 
and contact  potential participants using the approved scripts (Appendix A & B).
5.2.2 Assess  eligibility of subjects for the study
Potential subjects  will be further screened for eligibility per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A study 
coordinator will contact potential subjects either in person or by phone and provide an overview 
of the study using an approved phone script (Appendix A), email (Appendix B), or patient 
recruitment flyer (Appendix C). The screening questionnaire will be asked during phone 
interviews and or email. An additional tool for screening study subjects will be completed with the 
use of the STOP-BANG questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Appendix D) and 
screening questions which may be done over the phone, in-person, or using a link to an electronic 
survey. 
5.2.3 Informed Consent  Form (ICF)
If a  subject is deemed eligible, the study coordinator will explain that if they consent they will wear 
the ANNE Sleep during an attended PSG study for one (1) night.  The coordinator will also inform 
subjects that they will be asked to complete the Sleep Diary log (Appendix E) during the morning 
following data collection and a patient survey at the end of the study (Appendix F). 
If subjects  are interested in participating in the study, the subject will sign the IRB approved 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) (Appendix G). Subjects may provide an electronic signature via 
REDCap, a secure web application for building and managing online data capture for research 
studies. Study subjects may also be asked to be photographed in-person at the time of their PSG 
study to demonstrate and document the location of the ANNE ™ Sleep sensors. 
5.2.4 Subject  Screening/Enrollment Log
When a  signed consent form is completed, the coordinator will obtain the subject’s medical history 
from the EHR and information including name, date of birth, address, telephone number, email, 
demographics, age, and sex. Each consented subject will be assigned a unique subject number. 
Subject numbers will not be reassigned or reused for any reason. Only their assigned subject 
number will identify subjects. The investigator must maintain a list of potential subjects and 
enrolled subjects using the Subject Screening/Enrollment Log.
5.3 Recruitment  monitoring
Recruitment for all sites  will be monitored carefully with weekly meetings between study 
coordinators and study investigators. Barriers to recruitment will be identified and addressed to 
ensure recruitment remains on track.

ANNE™ Sleep  system
Sibel’s ANNE™  Sleep system includes two skin-mounted, bio-integrated sensors to record vital 
signs, a wireless charger, a wireless charger adaptor, single-use chest adhesives, single-use over 
the sensor adhesives, single-use finger adhesives, and a mobile device with a mobile software 
application that enables data recording for download for further analysis. 
IRB #: STU00213322-MODCR0001 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 9/13/2021 through 9/12/2022.
STU0021444
Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 15 of 54Heart rate  (HR), respiratory rate (RR), actigraphy, and skin temperature are recorded from the 
ANNE™ Chest sensor. Blood oxygenation (SpO 2), peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), and skin 
temperature are recorded from the ANNE™ Limb sensor. PAT is indicative of vasoconstriction, 
which can serve as a proxy for respiratory disturbances and accepted by the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine for use as part of home sleep testing. The ANNETM Sleep system also 
calculates pulse transit time (PTT), a measure of time for a pulse generated from the heart to 
travel to the peripheral limb. It is used as a surrogate marker of respiratory effort, apnea, and 
hypopnea events. 
The first sensor  (chest unit) located on the chest contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis 
accelerometer, Bluetooth Low Energy System-on-Chip (SoC), a Lithium-Polymer battery, power 
management component, an analog front-end component, passive electrodes for 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), bio-impedance feature for RR, and a 
temperature sensing unit.  
The second  sensor (limb unit) located on the finger of a patient contains Bluetooth Low Energy 
SoC, a Lithium-Polymer battery, power management solution, low-power microcontroller, an 
analog front-end component, pulse oximeter (SpO2), and a temperature-measuring unit. 
The chest  sensor is placed on the body via a single-use chest adhesive as well as an optional 
over the sensor adhesive. Both adhesives will be removed and discarded after one use. The limb 
sensor is held in place by a single-use finger adhesive, which is removed and discarded after one 
use, then replaced with a new finger adhesive.

9.1 Pre-study  
The study  coordinator will schedule a conversation, via phone or in person, with the potential 
study subjects.
To minimize the  risk of loss of privacy and enhance confidentiality, the subject may have the 
option to discuss with the study coordinator over the phone or by a Zoom teleconference from the 
subject’s personal device. If Zoom communication is selected a unique meeting number and 
password known only to the subject will be provided. The study coordinator will monitor the 
number of attendees in the meeting and restrict meetings to IRB approved researchers on this 
study, the study subject, and additional people at the subject's discretion. Researchers will host 
the Zoom sessions and will utilize the waiting room feature to ensure that only the appropriate 
participants are included on the call.
The study  coordinator will cover following topics associated with the study:
(1) The  qualified subject will be asked to schedule a PSG study to operate concurrently with 
the ANNE™ Sleep system for one supervised night at the sleep center with the assistance 
of a study coordinator as needed. The target time frame will be to complete the sleep night 
within 2 weeks of enrollment and confirm when they will be completing the PSG night.
(2) A dvise subjects to avoid alcohol and sleep medication use such as antihistamine (OTC) 
or prescribed medicines for sleep support on the testing night. Any use of these 
substances on the night of monitoring sleep will be asked to be recorded in the diary.
(3) D iscuss with the subjects regarding the completion of the Demographic, Medical History 
and Sleep Survey (Appendix I) sleep diary (Appendix E) and usability survey (Appendix 
F). The sleep diary and usability survey should be available to complete via an email link 
through REDCap or printed out forms.
Any subject ’s questions or concerns associated with the study will 
also be addressed. 9.2 Study procedures
The following summarizes  the procedure subjects will go through during the PSG/ANNETM 
Sleep night. At least 24 hours prior to the subject’s PSG/ANNE™ Sleep study, the study 
coordinator will contact the participant by phone to confirm their scheduled appointment. Once 
confirmed, the study coordinator will meet the subject at their respective sleep health centers on 
the night of the PSG/ANNE™ Sleep study. 
9.2.1 PSG  procedures

Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 21 of 5410. SCORING
10.1 PSG  Scoring
The data  from PSG will be reviewed and scored for sleep staging and respiratory events by 3 
registered polysomnography technicians (RPSGT) who are blinded to the experimental 
condition, the scoring of the ANNETM sleep system, and represent scorers in clinical practice in 
AASM accredited sleep disorder centers. In order to minimize interscorer variability, the 
technicians will have >85% concordance and to ensure quality and reproducibility, a board 
certified sleep medicine physician who is blinded to the experimental condition will review all 
raw PSG data If AHI determined from PSG do not meet the 85% concordance between three 
RPSGTs, a board-certified sleep medicine physician will provide the final determination of the 
AHI.
Scoring of  PSG data will follow guidelines established by the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events (v2.6)6. Sleep scoring includes 
the following variables: clock time (hr:min) of lights off and lights on; total recording time (TRT= 
duration in minutes from lights off to lights on); total sleep time (TST= time in minutes spent in 
sleep stages N1 + N2 + N3 + REM); sleep latency (SL= time in minutes from lights off to the first 
epoch of any sleep stage); REM latency (time in minutes from lights off to the first epoch of 
REM sleep); wake after sleep onset (WASO= duration in minutes of TRT minus TST minus SL); 
sleep efficiency (SE= TST/TRT*100%); time in minutes in each sleep stage (N1, N2, N3 and 
REM sleep); percentage of time spent in each sleep stage (time in minute in each stage/TST 
*100%). Arousal events are quantified as total number of arousals and as arousal index (AI= 
number of arousals x 60/TST). The scoring of respiratory events to evaluate for sleep 
disordered breathing will also follow AASM scoring rules. The thermistor will be used for scoring 
apneas, and the pressure transducer and pulse oximetry will be used for scoring hypopneas. 
Chest and abdominal belts will be used to determine apnea type. 
The apnea-hypopnea  index (AHI) will be calculated in ranges of 15–30 apnea/hypopnea events 
per hour for moderate OSA and ≥30 apnea/hypopnea events per hour for severe OSA. The 
oxygen desaturation index (ODI), the hourly average number of desaturation episodes, will also 
be calculated based on similar criteria. 
An apnea  event is defined when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
There  is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event baseline using an 
oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study) or an 
alternative apnea sensor (diagnostic study). 
The  duration of the ≥90% drop in sensor signal is ≥10 seconds
Hypopnea is  defined when ALL of the following criteria are met:
The  peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure 
(diagnostic study),  PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative hypopnea sensor 
(diagnostic study).
The  duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds.
There  is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline.
AHI will  be calculated manually by its standard formula—AHI = apneas + hypopneas * 60/TST).:

10.2 ANNETM Sleep Scoring
The data  from ANNETM will be reviewed and scored for respiratory events by 3 registered 
polysomnography technicians (RPSGT) who are blinded to the scoring of the PSG, and 
represent scorers in clinical practice in AASM accredited sleep disorder centers. An average will 
be taken of the three scores. In order to minimize interscorer variability, the technicians will have 
>85% concordance and to ensure quality and reproducibility, a board certified sleep medicine 
physician who is blinded to the experimental condition will review all raw PSG data. If AHI 
determined from ANNETM Sleep exhibits greater than 20% difference between three RPSGTs, a 
board-certified sleep medicine physician will provide the final determination of the AHI.
Scoring of  ANNETM Sleep data will follow guidelines established by the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events (v2.6)6. Sleep scoring 
includes the following variables: total recording time (TRT= duration in minutes from sensor 
activation to sensor disconnection). The scoring of respiratory events to evaluate for sleep 
disordered breathing will also follow AASM scoring rules. 
The ANNETM Sleep  will be scored similarly with the system’s onboard sensors as an alternative 
hypopnea and apnea sensor via PAT. The definition of mild, moderate, or severe obstructive 
sleep apnea is based on AHI.
●AHI <  5: Normal 
●AHI ≥ 5  – <15: Mild 
●AHI ≥15 – <30:  Moderate 
●AHI ≥  30: Severe
The AHI  calculated from ANNETM Sleep will be considered an estimation of AHI, coined as Sibel-
AHI.
An apnea  event is defined as: 
●A  drop in peak signal excursion by ≥ 90% of pre-event baseline for ≥ 10 seconds using an 
oronasal thermal signal, PAP device flow, or an alternative apnea sensor. 
●No  requirement for a desaturation or an arousal
Hypopnea will  be defined by:
●The  peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure 
(diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative hypopnea sensor 
(diagnostic study)
●The  duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds
●There  is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline and/or the event is 
associated with an arousal
The scoring  of respiratory events to evaluate for sleep disordered breathing will also follow 
AASM scoring rules. Apnea-hypopnea index will be used to determine the presence and 
severity of sleep apnea (AHI= apneas + hypopneas *60/TRT). 
The accuracy  (sum of the number of true positives and true negatives divided by the sum of the 
number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives), sensitivity,

moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea will be compared to outputs from PSG.
11.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
11.1 Determination  of Sample Size 
The sample  size determination is based on the primary endpoint of determining the ANNETM Sleep 
system’s diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) when compared to the gold 
standard, PSG for AHI. The calculations are based on parameters derived from a pilot program 
conducted in a similar patient population of subjects (n=46) who self-reported symptoms of OSA 
based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire. In this program, an overall prevalence of moderate to 
severe sleep apnea was 58%. We assume that the patient population from which this current 
study will be recruited will have a similar burden of moderate to severe OSA. We assume the 
prevalence to be 50% given that broader community outreach may reduce the total prevalence of 
moderate to severe OSA in our final cohort. For the primary objective, we will compare the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ANNETM Sleep 
against the gold standard of diagnosis, the PSG for the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA. 
11.2 Power  Calculation
Power Calculation  Assumptions for Primary Endpoint of Sensitivity:
●Prevalence  of moderate to severe OSA in the population = 50%
●H0:  sensitivity of 80%
●HA: sensitivity of  90%
A total of  approximately 214 subjects may be recruited to complete the study. A minimum sample 
size of 164 subjects will be required to achieve a minimum power of 80% (actual power = 80.6%) 
in order to detect a change in the percentage value of sensitivity greater than or equal to 0.80, 
based on a target significance level of 0.05. 
Power Calculation  Assumptions for Primary Endpoint of Specificity:
●Prevalence  of moderate to severe OSA = 50%
●H0:  specificity of 80%
●HA: specificity of  90%
A minimum  sample size of 164 subjects will be required to achieve a minimum power of 80% 
(actual power = 80.6%) in order to detect a change in the percentage value of specificity greater 
than or equal to 0.80, based on a target significance level of 0.05. Assuming a PSG and/or 
ANNETM Sleep failure rate of 10% of study subjects, the target sample size is 181.259 E.. Erie,

Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 24 of 5411.3 Disposition  of Subjects 
Disposition status of the  enrolled patients (Full Analysis Set) will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages. Frequency and percentage of FAS patients with full follow-up will 
be reported, as well as patients with early withdrawal from the study, and the related reasons. 
The following disposition  status for subjects will be summarized overall and by group:
1) Number  and percentage of subjects in each FAS and per protocol analysis set (PPAS) 
analysis population
2) Number  and percentage of subjects who completed the study/withdrew from the study 
(and reasons for premature discontinuations)
Analysis Sets
Two analysis sets  will be created for study purpose: 
Full Analysis Set  (FAS). FAS includes all enrolled subjects (those who signed the informed 
consent and who satisfied the eligibility criteria). FAS will be used for subjects’ disposition, 
population description, and for Safety analysis.
The PPAS is  a subset of the FAS, restricted to subjects who adhere to the protocol and complete 
the PSG sleep night and ANNE sleep night concurrently without technical failures. The PPAS will 
be used for the performance analyses. The PPAS will serve as the primary analysis for the 
performance endpoints. If the FAS population is different from the PPAS population, then the 
analyses will be repeated for the FAS population. 
11.4 General  Methodology
Continuous variables  will be summarized using tables of descriptive statistics: number of patients 
with recorded observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics will 
be presented by diagnosis and clinical center. Diagnostic outcomes will be tabulated and 
compared for ANNETM Sleep vs PSG. 
11.5 Exploratory  measurements for research purposes
Additional statistical analyses will be  performed to compare outputs of AHI between the different 
systems. Specifically, these analyses include:
1) Evaluation  of the predictive value of the ANNETM Sleep system to differentiate 
obstructive vs central apnea events using the system’s onboard sensors
2) Linear  regression to establish correlation between AHI determined by ANNETM Sleep vs 
PSG on the same night
3) Bland-Altman  plots will be created to establish bias and 95% confidence intervals of 
agreement between AHI determined by ANNE™ Sleep and PSG.
4) Summary  statistics of the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the classification of the 
severity of OSA (normal, mild, moderate, and severe OSA) determined by AHI between 
PSG vs ANNETM Sleep.

Sleep and PSG.
Parameters ascribed  to the safety of patients will be summarized by diagnosis and clinical center. 
All available data from patients who fail to complete this study will be included in all safety 
summaries. Accuracy analysis will be run to provide % of agreement (overall, positive and 
negative agreement) between both procedures, p-value and 95% confidence interval. Correlation 
analysis (between two quantitative parameters) will be run: Pearson coefficient, p-value and 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated.
For other  analyses:
●Continuous  variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Comparison of continuous 
parameters between two groups will be performed using T-test or Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney 
U test, or Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric) for paired data, as appropriate.
●Categorical  variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages, and 
compared between two groups using Chi-Square or Fisher exact test, or Mac Nemar Chi- 
square test for paired data, as appropriate.
●Subject  disposition and follow-up, as well as demographic and baseline characteristics of 
patients, or to any questionnaire will be described for each clinical center in the follow up 
phone call within 1 week of completing the study.
11.6 Data  Analysis Presentation
All data analysis  will be performed by HealthCore Inc. Statistical programming and analyses will 
be performed using SAS Version 9.4 or higher. Raw data (i.e., minimum and maximum values 
presented for range in continuous variables) will be reported out to the precision with which it 
was collected. Means will be reported to 1 decimal place more than the raw data. SD will be 
reported to 1 decimal place more than the mean. Percentages will be reported to 1 decimal 
place. Trailing zeros will be presented to maintain a consistent level of precision, e.g. 2.0 rather 
than 2. All p-values will be rounded to 3 decimal places. If a rounded p-value is 0.000 (i.e., the 
actual p-value is less than 0.0005), then the p- value will be presented as ‘p< 0.001.’ 
The listings, specifically adverse  events and major protocol deviations, will be ordered by site, 
subject and visit as applicable, unless otherwise stated.

Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 26 of 5411.6.2 Handling  of Missing Data and Dropouts 
Missing data  will not be imputed and excluded from calculations. A summary of missing data will 
be provided according to the number of subjects, the time points where the data are missing and 
the clinical center. For each clinical center, number and percent of subjects with no missing data 
will be presented in tabular form. All final variables will undergo assessments of missingness to 
ensure that there is no systematic pattern of missing data. 
11.6.3 Major Protocol  Deviations 
Major protocol  deviations will be summarized by type (e.g. informed consent, inclusion or 
exclusion criteria error, unreported serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment violation, study visit 
not per protocol, other). In addition, any patient-specific protocol deviations will be listed for each 
subject. Each individual site will record protocol deviations. 
11.6.4 Adjustments for Multiple  Comparisons 
No adjustment will  be made. 
11.6.5 Demographics  and Baseline Characteristics 
Patients’ characteristics  and other baseline data will be summarized (see section 11.3 General 
Methodology). 
11.6.6 Primary  Endpoint
Analysis of  the primary endpoint will evaluate the accuracy of the ANNETM Sleep system as a 
diagnostic aid of moderate to severe OSA via AHI derived from both systems based on the gold 
standard, PSG. Sensitivity is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the 
number of true positives and the number of false negatives. Specificity is defined as the number 
of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and the number of false 
positives. Positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as the proportion of people with a test result 
who actually have the disease: the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of 
true positives and the number of false positives. Negative predictive value (NPV) is defined as 
the proportion of those with a negative test result who do not have the disease: the number of 
true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and the number of false 
negatives. Evaluation of the ANNETM Sleep System as a diagnostic tool for moderate to severe 
OSA will be assessed based on the following criteria:
●A  goal of sensitivity and specificity of greater than 80% in diagnosing moderate or 
severe OSA in comparison with the ANNETM Sleep against PSG.
●PPV  and NPV will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals.
PSG: AHI  ≥15 PSG: AHI  <15
ANNE Sleep : AHI ≥15 True Positive False Positive
ANNE Sleep : AHI <15 False Negative True Negative

Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 27 of 5411.6.7 Safety  Evaluation
Adverse events  should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, duration, intensity, and 
relationship to the study and use of the study device. All anticipated and unanticipated adverse 
events will be collected. Subjects will be able to contact the investigator at any time during the 
study if they note any change in their medical condition. The outcome of each adverse event will 
be observed and documented. Safety analysis, including adverse events and device deficiencies’ 
incidence and description will be run on FAS only.
12. COMPENSATION  FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Subjects will  receive $150 in gift cards for their time and effort. Compensation will be given to 
participants directly or mailed to the participant’s home within 3 weeks after study completion 
(which includes participating in a PSG and wearing ANNE™ Sleep for one night and completing 
the diary and usability survey). 
The cost  of the PSG will be covered by the research study unless ordered as Standard of Care 
and approved by the study subjects’ insurance provider. Participants will not be informed of the 
results of this research. 
13.  WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS
Participants may  end their participation at any time during the study. The study investigators may 
choose to withdraw a study subject if he or she is unable to use the devices or complete the 
survey and diary. The study investigators may withdraw a patient if they develop skin sensitivity 
or have a medical complication that precludes wearing of the sensors on the suprasternal notch. 
If a  subject is withdrawn from the study, they will be asked to return the study kit that is given to 
them at the start of the study. Unless specifically requested in writing, researchers will maintain 
and use data from patients that end their participation early. 
14.  RISKS TO  PARTICIPANTS
Risk category:  minimal
Potential risk:  There is a risk of skin irritation or allergic reaction to the ANNE™ Sleep sensors.  
The devices will be placed on skin epidermis without conductive gel, thereby minimizing the risk 
of any skin irritation or allergic reaction. In addition, there will be no skin preparation except the 
use of a sterile alcohol pad (provided) to gently exfoliate the dead skin cells or dirt on epidermis. 
The adhesives have passed both biocompatibility, skin sensitization and cytotoxicity testing.
There is  a risk of Protected Health Information (PHI) disclosure. Subject data will be de-identified 
and stored securely to prevent PHI disclosure.

STU0021444
Protocol Version  1.1 Date:  08.22.2021 Page 28 of 54Any adverse  events during the PSG will be addressed by the sleep technicians in accordance 
with the sleep lab’s standard procedure for handling adverse events. Any unique risks associated 
with the investigational sensors (as above) will be addressed by the study investigator and inform 
the sleep technicians of these risks prior to the PSG. The sleep technicians will be instructed to 
contact the study investigator if any skin irritation or allergic reactions occur.  If significant, the 
study will be terminated and usual medical care will be provided.
Protection against risks:  there is a high probability OSA subjects will be closely monitored by sleep 
technicians during their sleep study to avoid adverse events.  The ANNE™ Sleep sensors will be 
removed if associated with significant discomfort or rash.  
SURVEY/DIARY: Some  questions may make subjects uncomfortable or upset. Subjects do not 
have to answer these questions if they do not want to.
15.  ADVERSE EVENTS
The PI  will determine whether adverse events are related to the study or unrelated to the study. 
The length of the study will be 1 night determined by the completion of the PSG night with the 
sensor concurrently. All serious adverse events – even if not deemed to be study-related – will be 
reported to the IRB. This includes a participant’s death, life-threatening condition, hospitalization, 
or disability. All study-related adverse events determined by the PI as serious will be recorded 
and reported to the IRB and the sponsor within 1 business day. Serious study-related adverse 
events are defined as adverse skin effects that warrant prescription medical therapy, skin tears 
leading to bleeding or an open wound, or skin burns. Study-related adverse events will be 
recorded on the adverse event form. If participation is discontinued, the timing of this will be 
recorded. Adverse events or protocol deviations that will be reported include, but are not limited 
to the following:
●Skin related  irritation or injury related to application or removal of the sensor.
●Any  evidence of discomfort during device use will be recorded by observation and by 
interview of the subject.
●Human  subjects research conducted without IRB approval.
●Research  personnel do not obtain written consent or assent for a study when the IRB has 
determined that consent or assent is required. While no harm occurred, failure to obtain 
consent/assent is a violation of the research participant’s rights.
●Enrollment  of participants before IRB approval has occurred and/or after IRB approval has 
lapsed.
●Continued  treatment of participants after IRB approval has lapsed without first obtaining 
permission from the IRB.
●PI  enrolls a participant that does not meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The criteria 
that were not met puts the participant at risk of harm.
●Enrollment  of children, prisoners, pregnant women and fetuses, without prior IRB 
approval.
●Use  of an unapproved consent form.

consent, or have access to identifiable participant information.
●Assessment  for any inclusion/exclusion criterion was not done prior to beginning if study 
procedures. The criteria that were not evaluated prior to study procedures puts the 
participant at risk of harm.
●A  procedure, treatment, or visit specified in the protocol is conducted outside of the 
required time frame and has clinical consequence; poses risk of harm to the subject or 
others; and/or is thought to be impactful to the scientific integrity of the study.
16.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  TO PARTICIPANTS
There is  no expected benefit for individuals participating in the OSA study. If a result is 
concerning, the subject will be notified via risk letter and/or study physician will follow-up with 
subject’s physician if deemed medically necessary.
17.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND  PARTICIPANT CONFIDENTIALITY
Subject identifiable  medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential and disclosure to third parties other than the PI and the co-investigators is prohibited. 
All reports and communications relating to subjects in this study will refer to each subject only by 
their study identification number. Data generated as a result of this study are available for 
inspection on request by Food and Drug Administration or other government regulatory agency 
auditors, Sibel business partners specifically HealthCore, Inc. and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB).
Subject identity will  be protected through use of a coded list of identifiers which will be maintained 
separately from the data set. Source documents, questionnaires, and CRFs are kept in a secured 
area (in a locked cabinet in a locked room) and all electronic data is password protected so that 
only authorized personnel can have access. Photographs may be taken of the sensor on the 
suprasternal notch and finger for scientific and publication purposes only. Photographs and videos 
will be labeled only by subject identification number. All photos will be taken by research personnel 
with a research-dedicated phone and will be stored on a password protected server accessed by 
a password protected computer. Only authorized research personnel listed on the IRB protocol 
will have direct access to this data set, although there may be collaborative exchange of de-
identified data with other research institutions for assistance in the analysis of raw data. De-
identified sleep study raw data will be uploaded to a secure cloud-based platform, Sharefile, for 
use by Sibel study personnel.
Data stored  and used for future research will be de-identified. Data will not be used for future 
research outside of the scope of this study.

compliance with the currently approved protocol, ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s).
17.2 CONSENT  PROCESS (ALL PARTICIPANTS)
To protect  participant confidentiality, we will conduct all research-related discussions and 
informed consent procedures in a private room. If a private room is not available, a designated 
area far enough away from other patients such that they cannot hear the conversation will be 
used. We will obtain written informed consent from the participant in English, using the IRB-
approved consent form, prior to conducting any study procedure. 
The consent  process will be completed either in person or remotely by using an electronic consent 
document and collection of an electronic signature with REDCap or other electronic signature 
service like Adobe. The study coordinator will review the Informed Consent in person, by phone 
or in Zoom during the remote informed consent discussion. 
The study procedures,  risks, and benefits will be discussed and the study team will answer all 
questions prior to obtaining consent. The person performing the Informed Consent process, will 
ask questions of the study subject to confirm understanding and comprehension of the study. All 
versions of the consent forms will be approved by the relevant ethics committees prior to study 
initiation. 
Eligible participants  who do not wish to participate in this study will continue to receive care 
according to local clinical standards.

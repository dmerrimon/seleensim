Study drug: Erlotinib and ruxolitinib 
Study design: Phase  1: 
The study will follow a standa rd 3+3 dose  escalation trial des ign. 
Three to six patients will need  to be enrolled at each dose  level 
and assessed  for DLT for 1 full cycle (21 days) before a dose 
esca lation decision is made. No intra-patient dose  esca lation will 
be performed. Toxicity will be graded  according to NCI CTCAE,

A minimum of 6 evaluable patients must be  treated at the dose 
declared to be the MTD. An estimated 2-18 patients will be 
necessa ry to establish the MTD. 
 
Phase  2: 
Once the MTD has  been  determined, p atients will be enrolled in 
the phase  2 portion of the single-arm, two-stage, open -label s tudy

receive erlotinib and ruxolitinib at the MTD established in the 
phase  I portion. The patient take their previous dose of erlotinib if 
it is less than 150mg daily. Response  to therapy will be assessed 
by interval imaging every 6 weeks with high resolution CT scan 
with response  evaluated per RECIST 1.1. A minimum of 10 and a 
maximum of 19 patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 study.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 EGFR-mutant lung adenoca rcinoma and acquired resistance  to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors 
Approximately 20% of patients with lung adenoc arcinomas will harbor a mutation in the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene  found  within their tumors. EGFR-mutant lung cancer is highly 
respons ive to the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, with 
supe rior progression free survival when compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy[1-3] and is now 
recommended  as first-line therapy for pa tients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The majority of 
EGFR-mutant patients respond  to EGFR TKI’s (>70% response  rate) for an average of 10-16 
months, but then develop acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy with subse quent disease 
progression[1, 3, 4 ]. There are several known mechan isms of resistance, with the most common 
being the development of secon d-site mutations within the EGFR kinase domain[5]. There is 
significant research effort being directed at new  second  generation EGFR TKI’s and combination 
therapies to treat pa tients in the acquired resistance setting[6-9]; there are currently no approved 
drugs for use  in the acquired resistance  setting. 
 
3.2 Rationale for co ntinuing erlotinib in Acquired Resistance 
Cessa tion of EGFR TKI therapy upon  acquired resistance results in symptom exacerbation and 
acce leration of disease  progression in 20% of patients [10].  Symptoms and radiographic studies 
improve when these  patients restart erlotinib [11], indicating that tumors remain at least in part 
reliant on signaling through EGFR.  As standa rd practice, we continue EGFR-TKI therapy in all 
patients with acquired resistance, in addition to initiating second -line therapies in combination; we 
hypothesize that EGFR-driven tumors with acquired resistance  remain dependent  on EGFR 
signaling, even after the development of radiographic progression.  Current standa rd of care therapy 
at AR includes  co-administration of erlotinib and cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 
3.3 Rationale for combining JAK1/2 inhibition by ruxolitinib with erlotinib 
Activation of the EGFR is known to result in downstream pathway activation of the ERK, AKT and 
JAK/STAT pathways. Several groups have recently demonstrated that J AK signaling is involved in 
resistance to EGFR TKIs, and have proposed  JAK inhibition as a potential therapeu tic strategy in 
the setting of acquired resistance [12, 13]. 
 
Work done  by Dr. Jacqueline Bromberg and colleagues has established  a critical role for JAK/STAT 
pathway signaling in EGFR-mutant lung adenoc arcinoma[14].  Unpub lished  data from Dr 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

Amended: 04 /14/15 
Page 9 of 33  
 Bromberg’s lab shows that the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib synergizes with erlotinib in TKI-sensitive 
lines in vitro [15].  JAK inhibition also restores sensitivity to erlotinib in TKI-resistant lines, including 
those  harboring EGFR T790 M.  Furthermore, EGFR TKI resistance  was reversed with a JAK 
inhibitor in a xenog raft model of EGFR-mutant lung adenoca rcinoma. In a transgenic mouse  model 
of EGFR L858 R/T790M  mutant TKI-resistant lung adenoca rcinoma, time to death is significantly 
prolonged by co-treatment with a JAK inhibitor and erlotinib. Inhibition of the JAK2 feedba ck loop is 
thought to increase  sens itivity to erlotinib in sens itive lines and restore sensitivity in resistant lines. 
JAK2 inhibitors decrease  EGFR recycling, resulting in increased  wild-type (WT) EGFR e xpression. 
This WT EGFR is thought to heterodimerize with mutant EGFR, forming a complex succes sfully 
inhibited by erlotinib [15]. 
 
Cho and colleagues separately demonstrated that JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib also increases 
sens itivity to afatinib in both resistant cell lines (H1975,  PC9-GR) and  xenograft models[12]. The 
mechan ism of re-sensitization is not fully elucidated but may involve inhibition of EGFR TKI induced 
STAT3 activation. These  pre-clinical findings support the study of combination JAK and  EGFR 
inhibition in EGFR-mutant lung cancers that are resistant to EGFR TKI. 
 
3.5 Ruxolitinib: Studies to Date 
The JAK1 and -2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is FDA-approved at a dose of 20mg by mouth twice daily for the 
treatment of myelofibrosis, based  on a rando mized Phase  III trial in which it decreased  
splenomegaly (primary endpo int), and  improved symptom bu rden and overall survival (seconda ry 
endpo ints) [16]. It is generally well-tolerated with a side effect profile (primarily grade 1 or 2 
ecch ymosis, dizziness  and headache) that does not overlap with that of erlotinib (rash, d iarrhea). 
The dose -limiting toxicity of ruxolitinib is myelosupp ression; ho wever, this adverse effect was 
desc ribed in patients with hematologic malignancies and therefore may be less problematic in 
patients with lung aden ocarcinoma. Ruxolitinib has also been  studied in a Phase  2 trial of patients 
with relapsed /refractory AML, in which it was administered at a dose  of 25mg by mouth twice daily, 
yielding a response  rate of 60 percent [17]. 
 
3.6 Selection of Doses 
Patients in the proposed  trial will receive treatment with both ruxolitinib, the JAK1/2 inhibitor, and 
erlotinib.  Subjects will be given erlotinib at 150 mg PO da ily which is the FDA app roved dose. After 
cycle 1, shou ld there be toxicity related to the erlotinib dose,  dose  reductions will be allowed after 
completion of cycle 1. Retrospe ctive strongly suggests that lower doses  of EGFR TKIs may as 
effective as the FDA-approved standa rd doses  with significantly less toxicity[18, 19].The doses of 
ruxolitinib to be tested will be 10mg PO BID, which was the lowest dose  studied in the Phase 1/2 
study of ruxolitinib [20]; 15mg POD BID and 20mg PO bid.. FDA approved doses  are 5-25mg BID 
depend ing on concurrent medications or comorbidities and the specific indication for ruxolitinib. For 
myelofibrosis the initial doses  is 20mg twice daily for pa tients with normal platelet counts 
(>200,000mm3) 
 
3.7 Summary 
There are currently no FDA app roved treatments in the acquired resistance setting. However, there 
are currently several mutant-specific EGFR TKIs in clinical de velopment with promising early phase 
results. In this background, we choose  a null hypothesis of 10% as the bar from which we are 
measu ring efficacy of this combination. We hypothesize that JAK inhibition in combination with 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

Amended: 04 /14/15 
Page 10 of 33  
 
EGFR inhibition will lead to tumor shrinkage in patients with AR to erlotinib. To test this hypothesis, 
we propose  a Phase  1 trial to determine the safest dose  of the combination of erlotinib with 
ruxolitinib followed by a Phase  2 trial to determine the efficacy of this combination for the treatment 
of EGFR-mutant lung adenoca rcinoma with AR to erlotinib.  Proposed correlative studies include 
assess ment of pathway activation both by conventional immunoh istochemical staining of biopsy 
slides, and by isolation and analysis of tumor exosomes, vesicles extruded from tumors that reflect 
tumor characteristics in their make-up [21, 22]. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION

4.2 Intervention 
 
Phase  1 trial: 
We propose  a conventional dose -esca lation study in which oral ruxolitinib will be administered along 
with erlotinib 150mg PO da ily.  The patient must have been  on that dose  of erlotinib for at least one 
month prior to initiating treatment on study. Erlotinib is taken orally once  daily. We anticipate 
minimal overlapping toxicities and predict 3 dose  levels (50%, 75%, and  100% of the FDA-approved 
dose  of ruxolitinib of 20mg BID for myelofibrosis with a normal platelet co unt of >200,000/mmᶾ) will 
be required. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily at a given dose  level in a coho rt.

must c omplete 1 cycle (3 weeks) of therapy without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) prior to enrollment at 
the next dose level. No intra-patient dose  escalation will be performed.  If one  patient of the 3- 
patient-cohort has  a DLT, than that dose  level will be expanded  to 6 patients.  Escalation will 
continue only if no additional DLTs are obse rved. 
 
If two or more patients experience  a DLT, the previous dose  will be declared the MTD. If only 
three patients were treated at the dose  under co nsideration as the MTD, an additional three patients 
will be treated at that level to confirm no added  DLTs are observed. A  minimum of 6 evaluable 
patients must be treated at the dose  declared to be the MTD. Each cohort will cons ist of newly 
enrolled patients. All adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
Response  to therapy will be assessed by interval imaging every 2 cycles (6 weeks) with high 
resolution CT scan with response  evaluated per RECIST 1.1. An estimated 2-18 patients will be 
necessa ry to establish the MTD. Actual ac crual will depend  on the number of DLT’s observed. 
 
Phase  II trial: 
Once the MTD has  been  determined, p atients will be enrolled in the phase  2 portion of the single- 
arm, two-stage, open -label study to determine efficacy of erlotinib and ruxolitinib. Patients will 
receive erlotinib and ruxolitinib at the MTD established in the phase  1 portion. The patient may take 
their previous dose  of erlotinib if this is less than 150mg daily.  Response  to therapy will be 
assessed  by interval imaging every 6 weeks with high resolution CT scan with response  evaluated 
per RECIST 1.1. The first 6 week response  will be considered as the primary objective outcome in 
the phase  2 portion. Safety and efficacy will be assessed  throughout the treatment pe riod. In the 
event of disease  progression or unacceptable toxicity, the patient will be removed from the study. All 
patients will be followed for adverse events for 30 days following the last dose of study medication. 
 
Correlative studies: 
A. Each study participant is required to have undergone  a biopsy  at the time of acquired resistance 
to EGFR TKI monotherapy. EGFR T790M  status will be determined at acquired resistance, as  well 
as asses sment for MET amplification or any  additional ac quired mutations as is standa rd of care on 
these  acquired resistance biopsy samples. These  are performed in our Diagnostic Molecular 
Pathology Labo ratory using standard CLIA approved assays for mutational analysis and 
amplification.  Immunoh istochemical stains for pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, pAKT, Her2 and Her3 will 
be done  on archived biopsy tissue.These  are routinely performed in the Molecular Cytology Core 
Facility and in our Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Labo ratory at MSKCC .  Scoring of IHC will be 
performed by Dr. Maria Arcila (Director of the Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Lab) using standa rd 
IHC-H score criteria with assess ment of staining intensity (0-3) x by the percentage of positive cells 
for each  intensity for a final IHC-score. 
 
B. We and others have determined that patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC sec rete microvesicles 
(exosomes) which express the mutant forms of EGFR and  other signaling molecules[23, 24 ]. We 
(Bromberg lab) routinely isolate exosomes from patient plasma, murine plasma and conditioned  
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER

Amended: 04 /14/15

 media.  For pa tient plasma, we isolate exosomes using a well established protocol (see our 
published  manus cript [22]). Whole blood is collected in hepa rin containing tubes  (green top), placed 
on ice and delivered to our laboratory or picked up by my techn ician or assistant. The MRN and 
patient features are entered onto a secure server and  the sample is given a new numeric identifier. 
Here we follow a standa rd protocol for isolation of exosomes [22]. The blood is sequentially 
centrifuged (300x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to pellet the cells, 16 ,500x  g for 20 minutes at 4 °C to 
further remove cells and cell debris, filtered through a .0.2 μm filter to remove particles larger than 
200 nm and  finally at 100,000x g  for 70 minutes 4 °C to pellet the exosomes). The total nu mber of 
exosomes is quantified using NanoSite and protein concen tration is determined using a Bradford 
assa y.  Equal n umbers of exosomes (using a spectrophotometer based  analysis: NanoSite) or equal 
protein concentrations (5 ug) of exosomes are analyzed by western blot analysis and probed  for 
pEGFR, EGFR, HER2, HER3 pStat3, pAKT, pS6, pERK signaling proteins and Tubulin, Alix and 
Tsg101 (as loading controls and canon ical exosome proteins).  Semi-quantitative analyses is 
performed using ImageJ software of chemiluminescent s ignals. 
 
 
Significnatly, treatment of tumour bearing mice with a JAK2 inhibitor leads  to the release  of 
exosomes in the circulation expressing elevated levels of EGFR/pEGFR. This was determined 
using western blot ana lyses as desc ribed above. Conversely, erlotinib (TKI) treatment of EGFR 
mutant tumours leads  to increased  pStat3 levels both in tumor and in circulating exosomes. We 
therefore hypothesize that the protein/phosphor -protein profile of exosomes will recap itulate the 
phospho r-signaling cross-talk occurring in tumors. We therefore propose  analyzing circulating 
exosomes prior and  during treatment of patients.  10 to 15 milliliters of peripheral blood will be 
obtained at pre-determined intervals during the study. Timepoints include start of study treatment 
(C1D1), C1D8, followed by every 2 cycles, correspond ing to when a radiographic assessment on 
protocol will be reviewed (C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, etc). The samples will be obtained in order to assess 
circulating exosomes for the presence  of EGFR T790M  (using primers specific to this gate-keeper 
isoform and  detected by QPCR-which have been  established  in the lab), , pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, 
pAKT, Her2 and Her3 using semi-quantitative western blot analysis as described above. We 
hypothesize that exosome total EGFR protein levels will be elevated while pEGFR, pERK and 
pStat3 levels will be reduced in the exosome samples from pa tients on Ruxolitinib and Erlotinib as 
compared to Erlotinib alone. 
 
 
C. The recent clinical success  of immunomodulatory molecules for the treatment of NSCLC has  re- 
focused  our attention on the potential role of immunesupp ressive myeloid and t-cells with targeted 
therapies. We and others have recently shown that JAK inhibitors potently supp ress the function 
and abundance  of myeloid derived suppressive cells and increase  CD4 and CD8 cells in pre-clinical 
models[25]. We therefore propose  examining the levels of CD33+ MDSCs, CD4 and CD8 cells in 
these  patients at pre-determined intervals as described above. The same blood samples used  for 
exosomes will be processed for the analysis of immune cells by FACS analysis using established 
approaches  previously used in the Bromberg lab. The cell pellet obtained following initial 300 xg 
centrifugation is purified using density gradient p urification (Ficoll) and then analyzed by FACS using 
antibodies specific to myeloid, and T-cell popu lations. We hypothesize that a reduction of CD33+ 
myeloid cells and an increase  in CD4 and CD8 T-cells will be obse rved in those  patients receiving 
Ruxolitinib. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
5.1 Ruxolitinib 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 14-043 A(3) 
Amended: 04 /14/15 
Page  13 of 33  
 Ruxolitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 (IC50=3.3+/-1.2nM) and JAK2 (IC50=2.8+/- 
1.2nM) with modest se lectivity against TYK2 (IC50=19+/-3.2nM) and JAK3 (IC50=428+/-243n M), 
respec tively.  It is inactive against 28 additional kinases  when tested at 200nM.  Ruxolitinib has high 
solubility and permeability (i.e. it is designated as a Class I molecule in the Biopha rmaceutical 
Classification System) and exhibits moderate to high clearance, volume of distribution and oral 
bioavailability in preclinical spec ies.  After oral administration, ruxolitinib is absorbed rapidly, with 
maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieve within 1-2 hrs post-dose.  The half-life is about 3 
hours in humans; ruxolitinib plus metabolites have a half life of approximately 6 hours. Time to peak 
is 1-2 hours. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, and is excreted in the urine (74%) and 
feces  (22%) with parent drug accou nting for less than one percent of each.  It is primarily protein- 
bound  (97%). 
 
Ruxolitinib is a white to almost white powder. Ruxolitinib has been  shown to be stable for up  to six 
months at 40ºC and  up to 24 months at 25ºC. The 5mg (free base equivalent) is packaged in HDPE 
bottles.  Ruxolitinib is provided as 5mg strength tablets. The tablet formulations contain the active 
ingredient and  may include the following commonly used  excipients: microcrystalline cellulose, 
lactose, s tearic acid, magnesium stearate, co lloidal silicone  dioxide, sodium starch glycolate, 
Povidone  and hydroxyl p ropyl cellulose. 
 
Ruxolitinib was approved by the FDA with the trade name Jakafi, for the treatment of patients with 
intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis.  Incyte will provide ruxolitinib for this trial.  Because  the 
proposed  trial ad dresses  an unap proved indication, MSKCC will hold the IND and  will cross-file with 
Incyte’s IND. 
 
5.2 Erlotinib 
Erlotinib hydrochloride is a quinazolinamine that inhibits the intracellular phospho rylation of tyrosine 
kinase  assoc iated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The approved dose  for 
maintenance  therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer is 150mg daily.  It is very slightly soluble in water. 
It is a major sub strate of CYP3A4, and minor substrate of CYP1A2.  Erlotinib bioavailability is 
significantly increased  upon co-administration of food, so  recommended  dosing is on an empty 
stomach at least 1  hour before or 2 hours after eating.  Half-life in humans is 24-36 hours, with time 
to peak of 1-7 hours. It is excreted in the feces (1% as uncha nged drug) and urine (8%).  92 to 95% 
of the drug is bound  to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. 
 
Erlotinib is supp lied as 25mg, 100 mg and 150mg round  biconvex tablets. Erlotinib is stable when 
stored at 25 ºC. Erlotinib hydrochloride is available at 25 mg, 100mg and 150mg tablets that also 
include the following inactive ingredients: lactose monoh ydrate, hypromellose, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl 
sulfate and titanium d ioxide. The 25mg dose also includes  trace color additives, including FD&C 
Yellow#6.

We propose  a conventional dose -esca lation study in which oral ruxolitinib will be administered along 
with the patient’s prior stable dose  of erlotinib.  Erlotinib is taken orally once  daily.  We anticipate 
minimal overlapping toxicities and predict 3 dose  levels (50%, 75%, and  100% of the FDA-approved 
dose  of ruxolitinib) will be required. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily at the given dose  level in a 
coho rt. 
 
9.1 Therapeu tic Agents 
 
9.1.1 Therapeutic Agent - Erlotinib 
Erlotinib will be commercially obtained. Investigators shou ld reference  the current approved 
prescribing information. The FDA app roved dose  for non-small cell lung cancer  is 150mg orally once 
daily and will be used  in the phase  1, dose-finding portion of the study.  The medications will be 
dispensed  at the beginning of each  treatment c ycle and a pill diary will be used  to track adhe rence. 
Erlotinib is administered daily, at app roximately the same time of day every day. Erlotinib shou ld be 
taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour b efore, or 2 hours after the ingestion of food). If vomiting 
occu rs during the course of treatment, patients should not take an additional dose  of erlotinib that 
day. They shou ld resume treatment with the next schedu led dose. If the patient forgets to take 
his/her daily dose, he /she shou ld take erlotinib within 12 hours after the missed dose. If more that 12 
hours have elapsed, that day’s dose  shou ld be omitted, and the patients shou ld continue treatment 
with the next schedu led dose.  
 
9.1.2 Therapeutic Agent – Ruxolitinib 
The experimental agent being evaluated is ruxolitinib. It will be supp lied for the purposes  of this trial 
by Incyte Corporation. Study drug will be hand led by designated persons only, and hand led per 
acco rding to the specific care instructions. Ruxolitinib is given orally twice daily and can be taken 
with or without food at approximately the same time of the day each  day. The  medications will be 
dispensed  at the beginning of each  treatment c ycle and a pill diary will be used  to track adhe rence. 
When a dose  is missed, patients shou ld not take an additional dose, but should take the next usual 
prescribed dose.  
 
9.2 Treatment a rms 
All patients will receive ruxolitinib and erlotinib in this single-arm study. 
 
 
9.3 Phase  1 Study 
The study will follow a standa rd 3+3 dose  escalation trial des ign. Three to six patients will need  to be 
enrolled at each dose  level and  assessed  for DLT for 1 full cycle (21 days) before a dose  escalation 
decision is made. No intra-patient dose  escalation will be performed. Toxicity will be graded 
acco rding to NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. Response  to therapy will be asses sed by interval imaging 
every 2 cycles with response  evaluated per RECIST 1.1.

The phase  1 portion will accrue cohorts of 3-6 patients (maximum en rollment 18 patients). All 
patients will receive erlotinib at 150mg orally daily along with doses  of ruxolitinib orally twice daily. 
Patients in dose level 1 will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 10mg orally twice 
daily. In dose  level 2, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 15mg orally 
twice daily. In dose  level 3, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 20mg 
orally twice daily. 
 
9.4 Dose-Limiting Toxicities 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE) will be used  to 
grade toxicities during the trial. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT’s) are defined as any of the following 
events occurring during the first cycle of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks) that are, in the opinion of the 
treatment physician, possibly, probab ly, or definitely related to the investigational regimen: 
• Death related to the investigational regimen 
• Hematologic toxicities including: 
o Grade = 4 neutropen ia lasting > 5 days 
o Grade = 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) 
o Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with evidence  of clinically significant b leeding 
o Grade = 4 anemia 
• Non-hematologic toxicities including: 
o Grade ≥ 3 AST, ALT, alkaline phospha tase or total bilirubin 
o Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea, nausea, vomiting that lasts > 72 yrs desp ite optimal maximal 
suppo rtive care 
o Grade = 4 diarrhea, nausea or vomiting 
o Any other non-hematologic grade ≥ 3 major organ toxicity 
 
Patients in each cohort must complete the first 3 weeks of study therapy prior to enrollment of 
subse quent coho rts. If no DLT is seen  in the first 3 patients at a dose  level (i.e. dose  level 1), the 
following 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level (i.e. dose level 2). If 1 DLT is observed in 
the first coh ort, the next 3 patient coh ort will be enrolled at the same dose  level to expand  the cohort 
at that dose  level to 6 patients. If no further DLTs are identified in the expanded  coho rt (i.e. 0-1 DLT 
for 6 patients at the same dose  level), then the following 3 patient cohort will be enrolled at the next 
dose  level. If 2 DLTs are obse rved in any obse rved 3 patient coho rt, the next 3 patient cohort will be 
enrolled at the immediately previous lower dose  level to expand  the number of patients at that level 
to 6 patients and no further dose escalation will occu r. 
 
The MTD will be defined as the highest dose  where not more than 1 of 6 patients develops a DLT. 
Dose levels are outlined in Table 1 above. Dose escalation will proceed  within each  cohort 
acco rding to the schema in Table 2 below.

≤1 of 6 at highest dose level Recommended  phase 2 dose. 6 patients must be 
entered at the  recommended phase II dose prior 
to proceeding to the phase 2 study. 
 
 
Patients who do not complete 21 days of treatment for reasons  other than experiencing a DLT will 
be replaced. For  the purposes  of dose-esca lation decisions, only DLTs occurring during the first 
cycle (21 days) will be considered. 
 
9.5 Phase  2 Study 
All patients will receive oral ruxolitinib and erlotinib at the MTD established  during the phase 1 
portion. The patient take their previous dose  of erlotinib if it is less than 150mg daily. Dose 
modifications due to toxicity are described further in Section 11.0. Patients will be monitored for 
response  by CT every 2 cycles (6 weeks). The first 6 week response  will be considered the primary 
objective outcome for this portion of the study. The schedu le of evaluations and interventions is 
desc ribed in Section 10.0 
 
9.6 Correlative Studies 
All patients are required to have a repeat biopsy at the time of acquired resistance  to erlotinib 
therapy. Correlative studies will be performed on all patients participating in both the phase  I and 
phase  II portions of this clinical trial. Archival tissue from these  biopsies will be obtained if available. 
Mecha nisms of acquired resistance  will be asses sed for including EGFR T790 M, MET amplification, 
HER2 amplification and additional seconda ry point mutations. 
 
Samples will unde rgo immunoh istochemical staining for pEGFR, pSTAT3, pERK, pAKT, Her2 and 
Her3 in the Molecular Cytology Core Facility and in our Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Labo ratory 
at MSKCC . In addition, peripheral blood will be drawn at regular intervals to analyze exosomes for 
the presence  of EGFR T790M  as well as the same markers stained for by immunoh istochemistry. 
Two tubes  (10-15 ml) is required, and the research blood will be drawn at C1D1, C1D15, and then 
every two cycles ongoing (C3D1, C5D1, etc).

Toxicity grading will be performed in accordance  with NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. Dose-limiting 
toxicities will be identified as described in Section 9.4. After the MTD of the erlotinib and ruxolitinib 
combination is established, if toxicities are enco untered, adjustments will be made to either erlotinib, 
ruxolitinib or both based on the investigator’s discretion. He/She will base  the decision on the 
presumed attribution of the adverse event. For s afety and adverse event reporting, see section 17.0 
 
11.1 Management of Erlotinib related toxicities 
 
Toxicities with erlotinib that are likely (>20%) include: 
• Fatigue 
• Rash 
• Diarrhea 
• Decreased  appetite 
• Nausea /Vomiting 
 
Toxicities with erlotinib that are less likely (<20%) include: 
• Cough 
• Shortness of breath 
• Mouth sores (mucositis) 
• Abdominal pa in 
• Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye) 
• Liver toxicity (elevated liver function studies) 
 
Side effects of erlotinib that are rare, but serious include: 
• Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) 
• Acute renal failure 
• Stevens-Johnson  syndrome (a severe skin rash) 
• Liver failure 
• GI bleeding/perforation (bleeding or a hole that develops in the intestine) 
 
Erlotinib dose  modifications will are to be made according to the criteria outline in Table 5

11.2 Anti-diarrheal therapies 
Antidiarrheal medications may be introduced  if symptoms occur. Previous erlotinib studies have 
shown that the frequency and severity of diarrhea rarely hindered administration of erlotinib and 
could be managed with loperamide. The recommended  dose  of loperamide is 4mg at first ons et, 
followed by 2mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea-free for 12 hours. 
 
11.3 Anti-rash therapies 
Rash or de rmatosis can occur  within the first several da ys of treatment with erlotinib in many 
patients and has been  noted to diminish in severity desp ite continued  treatment. Patients shou ld be 
informed that skin toxicity is expected during treatment with erlotinib. Skin toxicity can take the form 
of dry skin, rash, acne iform eruption, and hair and nail changes. Prophylactic treatment of the skin 
may prevent or reduce  skin toxicity. Patients will be encou raged to use an alcoho l-free emollient 
cream or o intment to moisturize dry areas of the body twice a day after therapy with erlotinib is 
initiated. Patients will also be enco uraged to use a titanium dioxide or zinc oxide based  sunscreen 
product on  sun exposed  areas daily. 
 
Patients with any skin toxicity will be referred to dermatology for management. Recommended 
treatments may include topical therapy such as hydrocortisone  cream or clindamycin gel. If neede d, 
oral minocycline or oral doxycycline may be combined with topical therapy. For more severe cases, 
oral corticosteroids may be administered. Patients who fail to respond  to these  measures may have 
erlotinib interrupted, dose reduced  or discontinued. 
 
11.4 Management of Ruxolitinib related toxicities 
 
Toxicities with ruxolitinib that a re likely (>20%) include: 
• Anemia (low red blood cells) that may cause  you to feel fatigued or short of breath 
• Low platelet count may lead to bleeding and/or bruising 
 
Toxicities with ruxolitinib that are less likely (<20%) include: 
• Diarrhea 
• Fatigue 
• Weight gain

 • Nausea  
• Fevers 
• Shortness of breath 
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Swelling of the arms and legs 
• Bruising 
• Increased  in certain proteins in the blood that may indicate mild liver damage 
• Mild increases  in cholesterol levels 
• Increased  blood pressure 
• Urinary tract infections 
• Certain viral skin infections (called herpes zoster) 
• Low white blood cell count that cou ld increase the risk of infection 
• Bruising 
• Gas 
 
Side effects of ruxolitinib  that are rare, but serious include: 
• Tuberculosis 
• Progressive multifocal leukoencepha lopathy (PML), an inflammation of the brain 
 
 
 
Tuberculosis has occurred in a small number of patients with a blood disorder ca lled myelofibrosis 
treated with ruxolitinib. It is unclear whether this was related to the drug but other patient factors. 
One patient with myelofibrosis taking ruxoltiinib developed  PML. It is unclear whether this was 
related to the drug or other patient factors.

If treatment is held for longer than 4 weeks, discontinuation of study treatment shou ld be considered. 
 
12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
The same method of assessment (i.e. CT or MRI) and  the same techn ique (i.e. with or without 
contrast) shou ld be used  to characterize each  identified and reported lesion at base line, after 2 
cycles (+/- 2 weeks), and  every two cycles (+/- 2 weeks).  A designated radiologist at MSKCC will 
interpret the study CTs or MRIs according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The same radiologist/physician 
shou ld perform the evaluation for the entire duration of the study. 
 
Tumor response will be assessed  using RECIST 1.1. A CT scan of the chest or CT 
ches t/abdomen/pelvis will be performed to demonstrate all known areas of measu rable disease.  The 
base line study will occur no  more than 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration. A CT scan 
with contrast will be the preferred method and modality of imaging. A CT scan without contrast or 
MRI can be used  in patients with contraindications to radiographic contrast media used  in CT scans. 
All patients must ha ve at least one measu rable disease  lesion by CT or MRI. 
 
All measu rable lesions, up to a maximum of 5 lesions total, representative of all involved organs 
shou ld be identified as target lesions and recorded and measu red at base line. Target lesions shou ld 
be selected on the basis of their size, should be represen tative of all involved organs, and shou ld 
lend themselves to reproducible repeat measurements. All other lesions (or sites of disease) shou ld 
be identified as non-target lesions and shou ld also be recorded at base line as well. Definitions of 
response  in target and  non-target lesions are described in Table 7 and  8 below. Table 9 provides 
overall responses  for all poss ible combinations of tumor respo nses in target and nontarget lesions. 
 
 
 
Table 7: Evaluation of target lesions 
Comp lete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions 
Partial response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of the target lesions 
Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameter of 
the target lesions or the appearance of one or more 
new lesions 
Stable disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD

Discon tinuation of treatment 
Early death is defined as having no repeat tumor assess ments following initiation of study therapy 
resulting from death of the patient due  to disease or treatment. Patients with global de terioration of 
health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence  of disease 
progression will be recorded as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort will be made to document 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
Evaluation of best o verall response  
The best o verall respon se is the best response  recorded from the start of treatment un til disease 
progression, as defined in Table 9. 
 
Other definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients who receive at least one dose  of treatment with erlotinib and 
ruxolitinib will be evaluable for toxicity. However, patients who are replaced during the first cycle of 
treatment in the dose  escalation phase  for any  reason  other than DLT will not be included  in the 
assess ment of MTD. 
Evaluable for objective respons e: All patients at MTD will be included  in the intent-to-treat ana lysis of 
efficacy. 
Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of 
progression or dea th, whichever occurs first. 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from first treatment to time of death. 
 
 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients may withdraw from the study at any  time. Patients who are treated at the MTD who 
discon tinue early shou ld return within 30 days of the last dose of the study drugs for a follow up 
evaluation. Any assess ments listed for the final visit in Table 4 will be performed at that time. 
 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study should they experience  any of the following: 
• Dose limiting toxicity 
• Disease  progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) 
 
Other reasons  for study discontinuation include, but  are not limited to: 
• Change in patient e ligibility 
• Non-compliance  with the defined treatment p lan 
• Protocol violation 
• Investigator’s decision based  on patient’s best interest 
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Severe, unexpected toxicities/side effects 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Death 
 
For the Phase  I portion of the study, patients who withdraw from the study for reasons  other than 
DLT without co mpleting a full treatment cycle will be replaced.

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Phase  1 
Primary objective: to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) of the 
combination of erlotinib and ruxolitinib in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer  and acquired 
resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors. 
 
Endpo ints: identify any dose  limiting toxicities (DLTs), and  establish the MTD for the combination. 
The MTD will be defined as the dose  that does  not exceed  an accep table thresho ld of toxicity. Dose 
limiting toxicity is a binary outcome where a patient either experiences  a DLT or no t. DLT is defined 
as any of the toxicities described in Section 9.4 that occurs within one cycle after initiation of 
treatment with erlotinib and ruxolitinib. 
 
Methods:  A standa rd 3+3 design will be used  to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). There will 
be three set dose levels, using the approved dose  of ruxolitinib, with 50%,  75% and 100%  of the 
FDA app roved ruxolitinib dose  of 20mg PO BID for patients with myelofibrosis with platelets >200,000mm3. 
 
Dose Escalation Schedule 
Dose 
Level Ruxolitinib dose  Erlotinib daily 
Level 1 10 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
Level 2 15 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
Level 3 20 mg PO bid 150 mg PO da ily 
The dose  escalation scheme is as follows: 
 
1.  If none  of the initial three patients at a given dose  level experience  DLT, the next dose  level 
will be studied. 
2.  If one of the initial three patients at a given dose  level experiences  DLT, three additional 
patients will be treated at the same dose level. Escalation will con tinue only if there has been  
no additional DLT observed. 
3.  If two or more patients experience  DLT at a given dose, the previous dose  will be declared 
the MTD. Should two or more patients experience the DLT at dose  level 1, the study will be 
halted, and alternative combination dosing will be considered. 
4.  If only three patients were treated at a dose  under consideration as the MTD, an additional 
three patients will be treated at that level to confirm previous results. 
 
Thus, the maximum nu mber of patients that will be enrolled in the phase  I portion is 18 (6 at each 
dose  level). The probab ility of escalation given different true rates of dose-limiting toxicity is given 
below 
 
Toxicity rate 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 . 0.50 
. Probab ility of esca lation . 91% . 71% . 49% . 31% . 17% 
 
 
The MTD will be the phase 2 recommended  dose.  However, if the MTD is not e xceeded  at dose 
level 3, then dose  level 3 will be the phase 2 recommended  dose. At the completion of the phase  1 
portion, 6  patients will have been  treated at the MTD. These  patients will be followed for response 
assess ment and included  in the phase  2 portion of the study. A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 18 
patients will be enrolled in this phase. Given an expected accrual rate of 2 patients per month, the 
phase  1 portion of the study will be completed in within 9 months or less.

 Phase  II 
Primary objective:  to determine the efficacy of the combination of erlotinib and ruxolitinib in patients 
with EGFR-mutant lung cancer  and acquired resistance  to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors. 
 
Seconda ry objective: to determine overall survival and  respo nse rate and  further assess the toxicity 
of the combination at the MTD. 
 
Methods : A Simon minimax two-stage trial des ign will be utilized to assess the primary endpo int of 
response  rate (RECIST 1.1 CR+PR) at 6  weeks  (2 cycles). This study will test the null hypothesis of 
10% response  rate against the alternative hypothesis of 30% respon se rate for patients with 
acquired resistance. The design chosen  has a 10% type I error (falsely accep ting a non-promising 
therapy), 10%  type II error (falsely rejecting a promising therapy), for 90%  power.  In the first stage 
of this design, 16  patients will be treated.  Patients included  in the phase  1 trial that were treated at 
the recommended  phase  2 dose  will be included  toward accrual to the phase 2 portion. If 0-1 
responses  are seen  in the first 16 patients, the trial will be stopped  and declared negative.  If 2 or 
more patients have a response, than an additional 9 patients will be accrued to the second  stage. At 
the end of the study, if 5 or more patients have a response  out of a total of 25 patients enrolled, the 
combination of ruxolitinib and erlotinib will be considered worthy of further investigation. 
 
Overall survival and time to progression will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the 
follow-up starting at the initiation of therapy.  Patients will be censo red at the time of the last on - 
study evaluation if they don’t experience  the event of interest. Disease  control rate will be calculated 
by the sum of partial responses, co mplete responses and stable disease. 
Safety and tolerability will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The toxicities and the adverse 
events will be assessed  for each patients according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 criteria. The serious 
toxicities will be described separately. The safety popu lation will comprise of all the patients who 
receive at least one  dose  of MTD treatment. 
 
A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 19 patients will be enrolled in this phase, in addition to the 6 
patients carried over from the Phase  I MTD level. Given an expected accrual rate of 2 patients per 
month, the accrual to the phase  2 portion of the study will be completed in about  6-12 months. 
 
Correlative Studies 
 
Objectives: Exploratory objectives include analyzing biopsies obtained at the time of development of 
acquired resistance  to EGFR TKIs to identify the mechan ism of resistance  in each  sample. In 
addition, peripheral blood will be collected to obtain exosomes for further study. Within tumor 
exosomes, we will assess  for the presence  of EGFR T790M  and also do immunoh istochemical 
stains to quantitate protein expression. For the correlative studies, the analysis is primarily 
exploratory and hypothesis generating. Correlative studies will be performed on all patients 
participating in both the phase  I and  phase II portions of this clinical trial. 
 
Methods:  EGFR T790M  status will be determined for the biopsy samples obtained at the time of 
acquired resistance  to EGFR TKI monotherapy. The proportion of patients with T790M  mutation will 
be calculated, a long with the exact 95% confidence interval. The expression of proteins such as 
phospho -EGFR, phosp ho-sTAT3, phospo -ERK, phospho -AKT, Her2 and Her3 will be quantified by 
using immunoh istochemical (IHC) in these  biopsy tissues  and reported as a proportion of patients 
with each  IHC score. 
 
Small amount of peripheral blood will be collected at pre-determined time points such  as C1D1 (pre- 
treatment), C1D8 (one week into the first treatment cycle), and then every 2 cycles, co rrespond ing to 
when a radiographic  assessment on protocol will be reviewed, for obtaining exosomes. The status 
of phosph o-EGFR, phospho-sTAT3, phospo -ERK, phosph o-AKT, Her2 and Her3 in the exosomes

 will be quantified using IHC. Results are expressed as scores (1+, 2+ e tc) or coun ts and will be 
summarized at each time points using descriptive statistics (mean±s td). Graphical methods will be 
used  to evaluate the way protein expression changes during the course of treatment. Immune cells 
(CD33+ MDSCs, CD4 and CD8 cells) will be serially quantified by FACS analysis at C1D1, C1D8 
and then every 2 cycles, and  summarized at each  time point us ing descriptive statistics (mean±std) 
and graphical methods. 
 
With the exception of T790 determination in biopsy tissue, the correlative analyses will be 
exploratory and hypothesis generating.

15.2 Random ization 
 
Both Phase  1 and 2 of this trial are single arm studies.  As such, no randomization will occu r. 
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
This trial will be conduc ted in accordance  with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center’s Data 
Safety and Monitoring Plan. A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The 
respons ibilities of the RSA include project compliance,  data collection, abstraction and entry, data 
reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of 
the protocol study team. The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure database 
(Clinical Resea rch Database (CRD B). Source documentation will be available to support the 
computerized patient record. The principal investigator will maintain ultimate respons ibility for the 
clinical trial. 
 
The immunohistochemical and  exosome results will not be reported in the EMR; rather, these 
studies will be conduc ted and their results stored by Dr Jacqueline Bromberg and her lab on 
pass word-protected computers.  Patients will have  a unique study identifier, and  all PHI will be 
removed linking the samples in the laboratory to patients.

 There will be weekly teleconferences attended  by the Principal Investigators and research study 
personne l. The clinical status of enrolled patients will be reviewed during the meeting with specific 
attention to study-related toxicity. Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient 
accruals and completeness of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be gene rated to 
assess  missing data and incons istencies. Accrual rates and extent and  accuracy of evaluations and 
follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be 
brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action.  Random-sample data quality 
and protocol c ompliance audits will be conduc ted by the study team, at a minimum of two times per 
year, more frequently if indicated. 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were 
approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.  The plans address the new policies 
set forth by the NCI in the docu ment entitled “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and 
Safety Monitoring of Clinical T rials” which can be found  at: 
http://www.cance r.gov/clinicaltrials/patientsafety/dsm-guidelines/page1 
 
The DSM Plans at MSKCC were established  and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Resea rch. 
The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found  on the MSKCC Intranet a t: 
http://smskpsps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%20Documents/Clinical%20Resea rch%2 0Quality%20A

There are several different mechan isms by which clinical trials are monitored for data safety and 
quality. There are institutional p rocesses  in place for quality assurance  (e.g., protocol monitoring, 
compliance  and data verification audits, therapeu tic respo nse, and  staff education on clinical 
resea rch QA) and departmental proced ures for quality control, plus there are two institutional 
committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our c linical trials programs. The 
committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase  I and II clinical trials, and the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s 
Resea rch Counc il and  Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol de velopment and  review process, each protocol will be assessed  for its level or 
risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponso red, in-house 
sponso red, industry sponsored, NCI coope rative group, e tc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring 
procedu res will be established  at the time of protocol ac tivation. 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Prior to the enrollment of each  patient, the risks, benefits and objectives of the study will be reviewed 
with the participant, including a discuss ion of the poss ible toxicities and side effects. Alternative, 
non-protocol, treatment options will be discussed  with the patient. It will be reviewed that 
participation in this clinical trial is voluntary and that the patient may withdraw consent  at any  time. 
The study is designed with careful safety monitoring for toxicity including physician visits and serial 
cardiac monitoring. Specific guidelines for symptom management a re in place to protect the study 
participant.

Page  29 of 33  
 Human Subjects Involvement and  Characteristics: All patients at MSKCC who meet the inclusion 
criteria will be eligible. 3-18 patients will be enrolled unto the phase  1 portion, and and addition 3-19 
patients will be enrolled onto the Phase  2 study. Patients eligible will be 18 years of age or older with 
a KPS of 70% or greater. Both men and women and members of all ethnic groups  are eligible for 
this trial. Pregnant and  breast-feeding women are excluded  from this study. This protocol does  not 
include children because  the number of children is expected to be limited for the patient popu lation 
expected to be accrued onto this study. Also, the majority of children are already  accessed  by a 
nationwide pediatric cancer research network. This statement is based  on exclusion 4b of the NIH 
Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human 
Subjects. 
 
Consent  process: All patients at MSKCC who meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible. Participation 
in the trial is voluntary. All patients will be required to sign a statement of informed consent, which 
must co nform to IRB guidelines. The informed consent  procedu re is described in Section 18.0. 
 
Possible Toxicities/Side-Effects: There are risks associated with treatment as described in Section 
11.0; ho wever, patients screened  for en rollment will be deemed appropriate for treatment 
independent  of this study. 
 
Benefits: The combination of ruxolitinib and erlotinib has the potential to be effective and induce 
tumor responses  in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer and  acquired resistance  to erlotinib. 
 
Costs:  Patients will be charged (insurance  billed) for physician visits, erlotinib, routine laboratory 
tests and radiologic studies required for monitoring their cond ition. The patients will not be billed for 
the study drug, ruxolitinib. The research studies will be covered with separate resea rch funding and 
no charges assoc iated with research will be billed to the patient.  CLIA-certified mutation testing (i.e. 
EGFR mutation by fragment analysis, Sequenom or standa rd sequenc ing) will be billed to the 
patient/patient’s insurance. 
 
Alternatives: The alternative to this trial would be treatment with chemotherapy with or without 
continuation of erlotinib or participation in an alternative clinical trial. 
 
Confidentiality: Every effort will be made to maintain patient co nfidentiality. Research and hosp ital 
records are confidential. Patients’ names and any other identifying information will not be used  in 
reports or publications resulting from this study. Other au thorized agencies and appropriate internal 
personnel (eg. qualified monitors from MSKCC ) and external pe rsonnel (e.g. qualified monitors from 
Astellas (the manufacturer of erlotinib), its authorized agents, the FDA, and/or other governmental 
agencies) may review patient records as required. 
 
Patient safety: Patients are monitored by physicians and onco logy nurses who are very familiar with 
clinical trials. In the case of an adverse reaction, immediate medical attention is available. In the 
evenings and weekends, we have a 24-hour u rgent care facility for ou tpatients. The PI or co-PI will 
also be available at all times to organize any necessa ry intervention. 
 
Monitoring of data to ensure safety: This study is to be monitored by the institutional IRB. This 
incorporates an independent  data and safety monitoring board established  by arrangement with the 
National Cancer Institute. The analysis of safety will include all patients. Adverse events, including 
all toxic effects of treatment, will be tabulated individually, and summarized by severity and causa lity.

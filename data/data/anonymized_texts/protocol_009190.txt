1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of implementing a penicillin allergy 
delabeling protocol for low -risk pediatric patients in the primary care setting. Specifically, we 
seek to demonstrate risk -stratification of reported adverse reacti ons to penicillins and 
completion of direct amoxicillin challenge in low -risk subjects can be performed in the 
outpatient pediatric primary care setting.

a. Background  
Reported adverse drug reactions to penicillins are common; however, more than 90% of 
patients with a penicillin allergy label can safely tolerate penicillins (1, 2) . Numerous adverse 
outcomes are associated with an unverified penicillin allergy, and elective evaluation for 
penicillin allergy has been recommended (1, 3, 4) . 
 
There is a vast disparity between the number of patients with a penicillin allergy label and 
practicing allergists in the United States, with over 30 million penicillin -allergic labeled 
patients and less than 5000 practicing allergists (5, 6) . With such a significant prevalence of 
labeled penicillin allergy, no single medical discipline can handle this burden alone; a 
coordinated effort across both primary care and subspecialists will be required to address 
this. As the majority of penicillin allergy labels occur in young childhood, pediatricians are 
uniquely situated to have a significant impact in reducing the long -term consequences of a 
penicillin allergy label through delabeling strategies (1, 5) . Direct oral challenge in low -risk 
patients has been recommended as  a delabeling strategy for this population (7-9). 
Cumulative studies have now evaluated the safety and efficacy of direct amoxicillin 
challenge in children with a penicillin -allergy label in over 1400 subjects  (8-16); the majority 
of studies have taken place in the outpatient allergist setting. Across studies, positive 
challenge rates ranging from 0 -13%. The largest study was a single center prospective 
study which defined low -risk allergy patients as an absence of se vere cutaneous adverse 
reactions (SCARs); they reported on 818 patients and found a 6% positive challenge rate 
(8). Across the above studies, all reactions were mild and only required treatment with oral 
antihistamines, no epinephrine use was documented in any of these studies.  
  
While there is significant evidence for the safety and efficacy of direct penicillin challenge in 
the evaluation of penicillin allergy, this has not yet been widely implemented in the primary 
care setting. There have been two pilot studies exploring direct amoxicillin challenge in the 
pediatric primary care setting. The first was a retrospective study of 42 children in Australia 
who included children greater than 18 months old. They performed direct amoxicillin 
challenges after 3 months had elapsed fr om the  index reaction. There was a 3% positive 
challenge rate and all reactions resolved with only oral diphenhydramine. The second was a 
prospective study that included 102 children in Ireland and there no positive challenges to 
amoxicillin challenge. This appr oach has not been studied in the United States. A recent 
survey of US -based pediatricians identified perceived barriers to implementing penicillin 
allergy evaluations into their routine care (17). Significant gaps in knowledge exist regarding 
the feasibility of this approach involving direct amoxicillin challenge procedures in low -risk 
patients in the pediatric primary care setting.

b. Current practice  
Currently there is no standard protocol in the Children’s Health pediatric primary care clinic for evaluation of 
penicillin -allergy labels. Most often, children with a penicillin allergy label are referred to the Children’s Health 
pediatric allergy clinic for evaluation of peni cillin allergy regardless of their risk status based on the history of 
their index reaction to penicillin.   
 
 
3.  Study Design.  
Describe the study design (e.g., single/double blind, parallel, crossover, etc.)  Consider inserting a scheme to 
visually present the study design.  
 
This study is a prospective, descriptive, single arm study of a convenience sample of children 
from age 2 -18 with a history of parent reported penicillin allergy who present to an outpatient 
pediatric clinic for a routine healthcare maintenance visit.

Please respond to all components of this item, or clearly indicate which components are not applicable.  
 
 
Patients will be recruited from the  pediatric primary care  clinic  at the Children’s Health 
Specialty Center Dallas campus  who are scheduled for a routine healthcare maintenance 
visit, have a penicillin allergy listed in the electronic medical record, and have consented to 
participate in research activities. Patient caregivers will receive a telephone call, where in a 
study me mber will introduce the topic of penicillin allergy and delabeling through direct 
amoxicillin challenge and obtain verbal consent to administer  a risk-stratifying questionnaire 
evaluating the index reaction  and their interest in proceeding with the amoxicillin challenge, 
including reasons for hesitancy and perceived barriers . Subjects with a history of reactions 
consistent with severe cutaneous adverse reactions will be excluded. The study member will 
review the oral amoxicillin challenge procedure and assess caregiver and patient’s interest in 
proceeding with oral amoxicillin challenge.   
 
Subjects who are classified as low -risk and are interested  to proceed with direct amoxicillin 
challenge will be sent the consent form through the caregiver’s preference of encrypted email, 
mail, or patient portal MyChart for their review. Caregivers will be provided the option to sign 
the electronic consent form, using an encrypted, secure platform provided through UTSW 
(Docusign/REDCap), and if they choose this option, will be contacted via telephone to review 
the consent form and answer applicable questions. Alternatively, when presenting for their 
healthcare maintenance visit at the pediatric primary care clinic at the Children’s Health 
Specialty Center Dallas campus, the written consent form will be reviewed .. Patients will be 
screened for acute dermatitis or respiratory symptoms. Subjects with acute dermatitis or 
respiratory symptoms at time of evaluation will be excluded.  A point of care urine pregnancy 
test will be performed on adolescent female subjects who have begun menstruation; subjects 
who have a positive pregnancy test or who are breastfeeding will be excluded.  
 
A single dose of amoxicillin 50 mg will be administered at the start of the healthcare 
maintenance visit . Subjects will be observed for 10 minutes and if no reaction, will be given a 
second 200 mg dose and observed for a further 50 minutes for  immediate reactions, defined 
as onset of urticaria, angioedema, cough, wheezing, rhinitis, repetitive vomiting, diarrhea, 
protracted abdominal pain, or hypotension, and managed accordingly.  This direct amoxicillin 
challenge testing is the recommended evaluation for lo w-risk patients, and the investigatory 
component of this study is if it can be performed in conjunction with a routine healthcare 
maintenance visit in the pediatric primary care setting. During this observation period, 
subjects will have their healthcare m aintenance visit with the primary pediatric provider.  
Subjects who have a negative oral challenge will be provided documentation of their 
immediate tolerance of penicillin. Upon completion of challenge, a survey will be administered 
to families to assess t he quality of their experience and identify areas for improvement. If 
immunizations are indicated per the CDC vaccination schedule, they will be administered 
after this 60 -minute period of observation from the challenge. Subjects will be discharged with 
instructions to contact the pediatrician and study team for any delayed symptoms. We will 
also measure the duration of each subject’s time in the clinic from check in to check out. A 
follow up encounter will occur over the phone at 7 -10 days after the date o f oral challenge to 
assess for delayed reactions . At 1 year post -challenge, subjects’ penicillin allergy status will 
be assessed in the electronic medical record, and patients who have had penicillin allergy 
label added back to their allergy list will be contacted via telephone to assess reasons for the  
addition of the penicillin allergy label.  Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the 
population completing amox icillin challenge testin g.

Study Intervention #1  
Direct Amoxicillin Challenge  
List each group exposed to this 
intervention on a separate line.  
(e.g., experimental, control, Arm A, Arm B, 
etc) 
Or state All Groups/Subjects  For each group, list the benefits  of this intervention .  (Benefits can be directly from  
the intervention  or from a monitoring procedure likely to contribute to the subject’s 
well being).  If there are no benefits, state “none”.  
All groups/subjects  One benefit will be the a ccurate diagnosis of current penicillin tolerance status. If 
penicillin tolerant, would have the benefit of using penicillin -based antibiotic 
treatment for future infections and diminishing the harms associated with a 
penicillin -allergy label which include  prolonged hospital stays, increased surgical 
site infections, increased rates of Clostridium Difficile infections , and increased 
healthcare utilization costs when compared to patients without a penicillin allergy 
label. Another be nefit includes increased access to evaluation, as this evaluation 
would be included within patients’ healthcare maintenance visit and not require a 
separate referral to an allergist with the associated barriers of time and cost with 
seeing another provider .

Risks of Protocol Specified Medications/Procedures  
- Adverse reactions to amoxicillin include headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, and allergic 
reactions. Allergic reactions range from mild to severe, and if a patient has an allergic reaction, he/she 
may need oral, IM, or IV medications. The site inve stigators for this trial are credentialed advanced 
health providers who are trained to recognize and manage systemic reactions. Treatment will be 
available within 60 seconds in the event of a reaction. Emergency medications as listed below will be 
availabl e to treat any allergic reactions.  
- Treatment of individual acute allergic reactions during the conduct of the study may include 
antihistamines, epinephrine, -adrenergic agonists, oxygen. The risks of these common medications 
include the following  
o Antihistamines: drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, stomach upset, blurred vision, dry 
mouth/nose/throat  
o Epinephrine: tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, trouble 
breathing, headache, dizziness, anxiety, tremors, pale skin  
o -adrenergic agonists: nervousness, shaking, headache, dizziness  
o These risks will be minimized by appropriate dosing per guideline management of systemic 
allergic reactions .

2.0 Subject  enrollment  
Independently  living  subjects  from  the Chicago  area  will be recruited  by flyers  posted  around  the University 
of Illinois  at Chicago  (UIC)  campus.  The flyer  will also be posted  to social  media  outlets  including: Instagram, 
Facebook, and Twitter. All study procedures will be conducted at the Human Nutrition Research Unit (HNRU) located in the Applied Health Sciences Building (1919 West Taylor  St, Room 121C) .  
Each subject will attend 1 screening visit. Duri ng Visit 1 subjects will be screened by the Study Manager, 
Kelsey Gabel Ph.D., RD, via questionnaire, which will assess eligibility based on the requirements listed 
above. The  following  parameters  will also be  assessed: body  weight and  height (for BMI), a  blood  draw  (for 
fasting glucose/diabetic status). Alcohol and Health Screening questionnaire will be administered to 
determine history of alcohol dependence (questionnaire is attached to submission). The Study Manager will also distribute a 7 -day food reco rd and provide detailed instructions on how to complete the records. 
Follow -up with  participants  virtually  will be scheduled  10 days  after the first screening.  The food  record  will 
be assessed for adequacy  (to evaluate  each  participant's  motivation  to participate  in the study)  and fasting 
blood glucose (via glucometer) will be taken. Consent will be obtained prior to the administration of the  
screening questionnaire by  a member  of the study  team (key  research  personnel  identi fied in Appendix  P). 
 
3.0 Study  design  and procedures  
A 10 -week non -randomized, controlled, parallel- arm trial, divided into a 2 -week baseline and an 8 -week 
intervention  will be implemented. Older  subjects  with  overweight or obesity (n  = 20 ) will be assigned to 1 
Time  restricted  feeding  with  physical  activity  for weight  management  
Version  4, 07/19/21  4 of 11  of 4 groups: (1) TRE (n = 5 ) ad libitum food intake from 12 pm to 8 pm, fasting (with zero -calorie 
beverages) from 8 pm to 12 pm daily, (2) TRE + EN (n = 5), TRE diet as stated in group 1 plus 3 -4 days of 40-
60 minutes  of endurance  exercise  per week;  or 3) TRE + RT (n = 5), TRE diet as stated  in group  1 plus 3- 
4 days  of 40-60 minutes  of resistance training  per week 4)  control  (n = 5), ad libitum food  intake daily  with 
no meal timing restrictions.  In-person stu dy activities will be carried out at the Human Nutrition Research 
Unit (HNRU) located in the Applied Health Sciences Building (1919 West Taylor St, Room 121C) or at 
Coalition Strength and Conditioning (2051 West Carroll Ave, Chicago IL 60612).

Diet  protocol  
TRE group and combination groups (8 -h eating window): During the weight loss period, the TRE 
groups  will be instructed  to eat ad libitum  from  12-8pm  daily,  and fast from  8-12 pm (16-h fast).  During 
the 8 -h eating window, there will be no restrictions on ty pes or quantities of foods consumed.  
Moreover, participants will not be required to monitor caloric intake during this ad libitum feeding period. During the fasting period, participants will be encouraged to drink plenty of water and will be permitted  to consume  energy -free drinks,  such  as black  tea, coffee,  and diet sodas  (limit  2 diet sodas/d, 
since these beverages  may  increase sugar  craving  
26). TRE participants  will meet  with  the dietitian  every 
week (by phone or zoom) throughout the weight loss period to review their diet adherence. Subjects will also be taught how to make healthy food choices that conform to ADA nutrition guidelines.

Endurance exercise combination group: Only the TRE + EN combination group will partake in the 
endurance exercise training. Participants will be given two supervised endurance exercise options due 
to COVID -19, one in -person and one remote.  Option 1 (in -person): All training sessions will be 
conducted at the HNRU. Subjects will participate in a supervised aerobic exercise program 3 -4 times  
per week, 40 -60 min/d, for 8 weeks.16,28 Exercise will be performed on an elliptical, stationary bike or 
rowing erg. Participants will be masked, exercise equi pment will be placed ≥6ft apart and cleaned 
between use. During the week 1 sessions, subjects will exercise for 40 minutes at a moderate intensity (65%  heart  rate max  (HRmax)).  During the week  2 sessions,  subjects  will train  for 50 minutes  at a higher 
intensity (75% HRmax). For weeks 3 -8, subjects will train for 60 minutes at an even higher intensity 
(85% HRmax). The participants will wear heart rate monitors (Fitbit Alta HR, Boston, MA) during each 
training session to provide visual feedback of their individualized target heart rate. Fitbit monitors will 
be distributed to subjects at each training session. Compliance with the training: A research assistant will be present to supervise all the training sessions. Exercise will be carefully documented through attendance at the training sessions. Subjects will be permitted to choose the day and time slot that works best for them. If a subject misses their session, they will be required to make up for it that same week. Subjects will be permitted to miss 4 sessions total during the 8 -week intervention.  
 
Option 2 (remote):  All training sessions will be conducted at the subject’s home. Subjects will 
participate in a supervised aerobic exercise program 3 -4 times per week, 40 -60 min/d, for 8 weeks.16,28 
Exercise will be performed by watching YouTube aerobic exercise (Zumba) vid eos at home. The video 
links will be provided by the study coordinator prior the exercise session. The coordinator conducting the study session on Zoom will have immediate knowledge of the subject's location so that they can relay this information to emergency personnel if needed. During the week 1 sessions, subjects will exercise for 40 minutes at a moderate intensity (65% heart rate max (HRmax)). During the week 2 sessions, subjects will train for 50 minutes at a higher intensity (75% HRmax). For weeks 3 -8, subjects 
will train for 60 minutes at an even higher intensity (85% HRmax). The participants will wear heart rate monitors (Fitbit Alta HR, Boston, MA) during each training session to provide visual feedback of their individualized target heart rate. Fitbit monitors will be distributed to subjects so that they can monitor their heart rate at home. Compliance with the training: A research assistant will be present to 
supervise all the training sessions over Zoom. All sessions will be pre -scheduled with th e research 
assistant, so the participant knows when to enter the Zoom meeting to perform the activity. Exercise will be carefully documented through regular online attendance at the training sessions. Subjects will be permitted  to choose  the day and time  slot that works  best  for them.  If a subject  misses  their  session, 
they will be required to make up for it that same week. Subjects will be permitted to miss 5 sessions total during the 24 -week trial. 
Resistance t
raining  combination group (in-person) : Only  the TRE + RT combination  group  will partake 
in the resistance training exercise. All training sessions will be conducted in -person at the Coalition  
Time  restricted  feeding  with  physical  activity  for weight  management  
Version  4, 07/19/21  6 of 11  Strength and Conditioning by Cole Cruz, MS, ACSM, CSCS. During the baseline period participants will 
attend two session prior to t he intervention for familiarization and testing. The first session will be a 
familiarization session where the participant will be instructed on how to do the movements correctly 
and safely. The second session will test the participants’ 5rm of deadlift, b ox squat, overhead press,  
and bench press.  1RM estimates will be based off  of the 5rm (80%  of 1rm)29. Subjects  will participate in 
a supervised resistance training program beginning with 3 times per week progressing to 4 times per week in weeks 3 -8 
16,30. Each session will be 40 -60 min in duration and will continue for 8 -weeks28,30,31. 
During RT session participants will perform a progressive periodized whole -body resistance exercise 
(exercise program attached  to submission).  During the first  2 weeks  of the  RT program, the  participants 
will complete three sets of 10 –15 repetitions of 65% of their 1 rep max. For the following 6 weeks, the 
training  volume  will be set at three sets  of 8–12 repetitions  at an  intensity  of 75-85%  of 1 rep  max.  Each 
week, weight will progressively increase by 5 –10% as needed due to training adaptation. For all 
exercises, the participants will be instructed to perform each repetition in a slow, controlled manner, with a rest of 1 -2 min between sets. The participan ts will wear heart rate monitors (Fitbit Alta HR, 
Boston, MA) during each training session to provide visual feedback of their individualized target heart 
rate. Fitbit monitors will be distributed to subjects at each training session. Compliance with the 
training: A research assistant will be present to supervise all the training sessions for compliance and 
correct technique execution. Exercise will be carefully documented through attendance at the training sessions. Subjects will be permitted to choose the  day and time slot that works best for them. If a 
subject misses their session, they will be required to make up for it that same week. Subjects will be 
permitted to miss 4 sessions total during the 8 -week intervention. (see COVID protocols in Subject 
Safe ty) 
Control  group  protocol:  Controls  will be instructed  to maintain  their  weight  throughout  the trial,  and not to 
change eating or physical  activity habits.  Controls  will visit the research  center  at the same frequency as  the 
treatment groups  (for outcome  measurements)  to control  for investigator -interaction  bias between  groups. 
Controls  will be offered  free weight  loss diet counseling (4 sessions)  at the conclusion  of the study  by Kelsey 
Gabel, PhD., RD.  
 
Weekly check -in: Weekly check- in calls will be done with all participants regardless of group at a 
prespecified time weekly via either zoom or telephone based on the participant preference. This 
appointment  time  will remain  the same  throughout  the 10 weeks.  During this call the study  coordinator will 
address possible issues with compliance, difficulty with the intervention, and complete the adverse events questionnaire verbally. Time stamped weigh in photos and adherence logs will also be requested at this appointment. Furt her, dietary counseling to support the participant will be included in each call by a 
registered dietitian (Kelsey Gabel, PhD, RD). Diet counseling will not include weight loss counseling, but general lifestyle improvement so as can be also given to the co ntrol group for weight maintenance. All 
counseling will be based off of recommendations from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, The American Heart Association, and Healthy People 2020. Topics will include:  
 
• Increasing  fruit  and vegetable intake  
• Reading food  labels  
• Water  intake  
• Lean  protein  
• Healthy  fats 
• Whole  grains  
• A balanced plate Choices  for eating  out

4.0 Data analysis  
Data  will be analyzed by SPSS software  (SPSS v24).   
5.0 Statistical  considerations  
All continuous variables will be examined for distributions and the presence of outliers. Variables that are 
not normally distributed will be transformed and if normality cannot be achieved, will be analyzed using 
non-parametric tests. Standardized descriptive statistics including measures of means, median, standard 
deviations, ranges, and standard errors for continuous variables within each group will be calculated to describe  the groups  at fixed  time  points.  Differences  between  groups  at baseline  will be assessed by a one- 
way ANOVA. A linear mixed model will be used to assess time, diet, and time × diet effects for each outcome. This model will provide unbiase d estimates of time and treatment effects under a missing - at- 
random assumption. Time will not be assumed to be linear in the model. This strategy will allow for estimation of time and diet effects (and their interaction) without imposing a linear time tr end. Relations 
between continuous variables will be assessed by Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients as appropriate. Data will be analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

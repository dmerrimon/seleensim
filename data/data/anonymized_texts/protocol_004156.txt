 CHAPTER 1: INTRO DUCTION  58 
 59 
The study is being conducted by the T1D Exchange Clinic Network and is being coordinated by 60 
the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Florida.   61 
 62 
1.1 Study Background and  Rationale  63 
Exercise is at the cornerstone of type 1 diabetes (T1D) management (1). However, blood glucose 64 
stability during exercise, and for up to 12 -24 hours in recovery, remains a major challenge (2). A 65 
fear of hypoglycemia deters many patients from enga ging in aerobic exercise (3). For those who 66 
choose to exercise on a regular basis, hypoglycemia is a common complaint that often requires  67 
breaks in sports and competition, games and training (1). To reduce the incidence of 68 
hypoglycemia during and immediate ly after exercise, patients are recommended to reduce their 69 
bolus dose at the meal preceding exercise by 25 -75% (1), however, this approach frequently 70 
results in pre -exercise hyperglycemia, particularly if the exercise is performed 2 hou rs or more 71 
after th e meal (2,4, 5).  Even exercise in the fasting state in patients on continuous subcutaneous 72 
insulin infusion (CSII) promotes a drop in glycemia if basal insulin levels are unadjusted (6).  73 
 74 
Post-exercise nocturnal hypoglycemia is also very common in T1D, wit h roughly 50% of young 75 
patients developing the condition about 7 -11 hours after the end of vigorous afternoon exercise 76 
(7). If insulin administration occurs to correct post -exercise meal -related hyperglycemia (often 77 
called rebound hyperglycemia), severe po st-exercise hypoglycemia can occur which may even 78 
result in death (8). Patients can reduce the dose of rapid -acting insulin administered with the 79 
dinner meal after late day exercise to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia risk (9) or lower basal 80 
insulin delivery for 6 hours at bedtime (10) to help mitigate risk, but these strategies often result 81 
in hyperglycemia (9, 10). Although extra carbohydrate ingestion not covered by insulin 82 
administration can help prevent hypoglycemia during and after exercise (11), excessi ve intake 83 
defeats the ability of the patient to have a negative caloric balance, thereby limiting the capacity 84 
for patients to maintain or lose body weight.  85 
 86 
Patients on insulin pump therapy have the flexibility to reduce basal insulin delivery in 87 
anticipa tion of exercise and in recovery to help guard against hypoglycemia. The International 88 
Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines recommend that basal insulin 89 
reductions should be done 60 -90 minutes before the start of exercise so that circul ating insulin 90 
levels are lowered by the start of the activity (12). This is a somewhat cumbersome and 91 
unpredictable task that is usually not performed correctly, even by the most educated and 92 
motivated patients. Since glucose production by the liver during  moderate intensity exercise is 93 
primarily facilitated by a rise in the glucagon to insulin ratio (13) and patients with T1D have a 94 
reduction in this ratio during exercise because of a relative peripheral hyperinsulinemia (13) and 95 
impaired glucagon secretio n (14), it may be better to attempt to change this ratio by the 96 
administration of glucagon at the onset of exercise. The recent development of a more stable 97 
form of soluble glucagon (e.g. G-Pen MiniTM glucagon from Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  98 
(Xeris) ) has  given researchers and clinicians the possibility of using this product as a 99 
preventative strategy to combat exercise -associated hypoglycemia. However, to date, studies 100 
have not been done that examine the efficacy of mini -dose glucagon administration for e xercise.  101 
 102

 1.2  Synopsis of Study Protocol  103 
This project focuses on the development of a new strategy for the prevention of exercise - 104 
associated hypoglycemia using mini -dose glucagon .  105 
 106 
1.2.1 Objective s 107 
The primary objective of the protocol is to d etermine if the admi nistration of mini-dose glucagon 108 
administered subcutaneously just before exercise produces better glucose stability than no 109 
adjustments for moderate intensity exercise in patients with T1D.  It will also be assessed 110 
whether mini -dose glucagon before exerci se produces better glucose stability than basal insulin 111 
reductions or extra carbohydrate consumption.  In addition, the impact of mini -dose glucagon 112 
administration before exercise on nocturnal glycemia after exercise will be evaluated.  113 
 114

1. Screening /Baseline V isit  130 
o Sign informed consent form and assess ment of  eligibility  131 
o Assessment of VO 2max for fitness evaluation and for the determination of 132 
exercise intensity for the experimental trials .  133 
 134 
2. Randomized Crossover Trial  135 
Each participant  will undergo four aerobic exercise sessions (in random order) in the 136 
CRC, with different strategies for glucose regulation:  137 
 Control Trial : Fasted exercise, no basal insulin reduction  138 
 Strategy 1: Fasted  exercise, basal insulin reduction only (50% reduction in basal rate 139 
five minutes before exercise , for the duration of the exercise)  140 
 Strategy 2 : Fasted exercise , no basal adjustment  + pre -exercise glucose tabs (buccal 141 
route -40 grams in total )  142 
 Strategy 3: Fasted  exercise, no basal adjustment + pre -exercise mini -dose glucagon  143 
(sc)  144 
 145 
In all 4 sessions , aerobic exercise will be performed in the fasted state (before a 146 
standardized meal) for 45 minutes at ~50 -55% of the  participant’s  pre-determined aerobic 147 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 6 of 25 
 capacity (see flow chart in section 1.4).  The strategies for select sessions will b e blinded as 148 
described in section 3.2.2.  149 
 150 
1.2.5 Primary Outcome  151 
The primary outcome for this study will be the glycemic response  during exercise and 152 
early recovery . 153 
 154 
1.2.6 Main Safety Outcomes  155 
 Hypoglycemic events  156 
 Hyperglycemic events  157 
 Dizziness, pallor and other symptoms of poor perfusion and /or exercise 158 
intolerance  159 
 160 
1.3 General Considerations  161 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the study policies 162 
document, with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of H elsinki, with 163 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice.  164 
 165 
A risk -based monitoring approach will be followed, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for 166 
Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach t o Monitoring” (August 167 
2013).  168 
 169 
The mini-dose glucagon  preparation (G-Pen Mini™ ) is not FDA approved.  Therefore, an IND 170 
(#119733 ) has been received from the FDA by Xeris in order  to conduct the study.  The Daily 171 
Dose ™ syringes used to inject the mini -dose gl ucagon are also not FDA approved in the U.S.  172 
While use of the syringes will be considered investigational, the study investigators believe they 173 
do not meet significant risk device criteria per 21 CFR 812.3(m) and thus an IDE from the FDA 174 
is not needed.  175

 CHAPTER 3: STUDY PRO TOCOL  294 
 295 
3.1 Procedures Prior to First Exercise Session  296 
 Assessment of VO 2max following the Bruce protocol   297 
 Optimization of basal insulin dose as per investigator’s usual routine  298 
 299 
3.2 Exercise Sessions  300 
Each participant will be assigned to a sequence of control trial , strategy 1, strategy 2, and 301 
strategy 3  through a randomization process  as outlined in section 3.2.2 .  Each exercise session 302 
will be separated by at least 3 days  and participants will be expe cted to complete all sessions 303 
within 12 weeks from the time of the baseline/screening visit .  Participants will be advised to 304 
avoid any vigorous exercise within 24 hours before or after the laboratory -based exercise tests. 305 
Subjects will be asked about acti vity to monitor adherence to these recommendations.  306 
 307 
3.2.1 Prior to Exercise Sessions  308 
The day before each exercise session participants will:  309 
 Insert new insulin infusion set into abdomen  or upper buttock  (ensure not in exercising 310 
limb).  311 
 For CGM users,  insert a new CGM  sensor  312 
 For non -CGM  users, come into clinic to have a CGM sensor inserted to use with a 313 
blinded receiver  314 
 315 
The participant will be contacted by the research staff on the evening before and the morning of 316 
each exercise session  to review gluc ose levels and help mitigate pre -exercise hyperglycemia or 317 
hypoglycemia .  318 
 If at the time of the morning call, the glucose concentration is below target ( <100 319 
mg/d L), then supplemental fast -acting carbohydrate will be taken . If above target ( >140 320 
mg/d L), then a conservative correction bolus will be recommended (based on insulin 321 
sensitivity factor).   322 
 323 
The participant will arrive at the CRC in a fasted state (minimum of 8 hour fast) by 9 a.m., but 324 
exercise sessions can begin as early as  8 a.m.   325 
 Blood glucose  concentration will be check ed upon arrival to the clinic . Oral glucose or 326 
IV glucose may be given to bring participant into range before exercise.  327 
 Females will have a urine pregnancy test performed prior to each exercise session (if 328 
applicable) . 329 
 330 
 Before an exercise session can begin:  331 
1. Participant glucose must be: 100 - 140 mg/dL (venous, plasma)  332 
2. Last insulin bolus (mealtime or correction) should be ≥3 hours previously  333 
  334 
3.2.2 During Exercise Sessions  335 
At each visit, participants will complete one of the fo llowing four exercise sessions (sequence of 336 
sessions determined by randomization):  337 
 338 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 12 of 25 
 Control Trial :  No basal insulin adjustment, no carbohydrate intake until glucose drops <70 339 
mg/dL.  Then 20 grams of dextrose will be given orally.  340 
Strategy 1 :  Basal insul in reduction to 50% five minutes  before the start of exercise. Basal 341 
insulin rate will be returned to usual rate 45 minutes after the start of exercise.   342 
Strategy 2 : Dextrose tabs taken orally (20 grams) five minutes before the start of exercise and 343 
at 30 minutes of exercise (total 40 grams) . 344 
Strategy 3 *:  Glucagon (150 µg) five minutes before the start of exercise (SQ -abdomen) . 345 
 346 
*The dose for strategy 3 will likely be 150 µg, but may be modified to be lower or higher, with a 347 
possible range of 75 -300 µg. One or more pilot phases of up to 6  participants will be conducted  348 
prior to study initiation  to determine the most appropriate dose.  349 
 350 
The participant’s pump will be blinded during the control trial, strategy 1, and strategy 3 and an 351 
injection of saline will be given during the control trial and strategy 1 so that participant is 352 
blinded to strategy.   353 
 354 
Exercise will consist of moderate intensity aerobic activity (treadmill jogg ing/brisk walking) 355 
performed at 50 -55% of predetermined VO 2max for 45 minutes . Continuous  heart rate  356 
measurements will be conducted along with intermittent ratings of perceived exertion (Borg 6 -20 357 
scale) . 358 
 359 
Exercise will be terminated if:  360 
 Glucose is <70 mg/dL; participants will be treated for hypoglycemia  (initially 20 grams 361 
of oral dextrose tabs or IV dextrose or IM glucagon depending on the  severity of the 362 
hypoglycemia ). 363 
 Participants experience dizziness, pallor and other symptoms of poor perfusion and or 364 
exercise intolerance  365 
 366 
Any treatment given will be recorded.  367 
 368 
Participants who are not able to complete an exercise session due to termination will still 369 
complete remaining study procedures as outline d in sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.  370 
 371 
3.2.3 Following Exercise Sessio ns 372 
Following each exercise session, the participant will rest for 30 minutes and then consume a 373 
standardized meal  containing  44-50 grams of carbohydrate that constitute ~55% of calories, 374 
together with ~20% calories from protein and ~25% calories from fat. The amount of bolus 375 
insulin given will be based on the carbohydrate content of the meal and the patient’s own 376 
individualized insulin to carbohydrate ratio. Insulin will be administered five minutes before the 377 
standardized meal . In the first phase of the experiments, insulin “corrections” will not be given 378 
unless subjects have post exercise/ pre meal hyperglycemia ≥270 mg/dl. If hypoglycemia occurs 379 
prior to the meal, subjects will be treated with 20 grams of fast acting carbohydr ate prior to meal 380 
consumption.  381 
 382 
The participant will be monitored for at least 2 hours after the meal prior to discharge.  383 
 384 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 13 of 25 
 Participants will be given a meal log and another standardized meal to take with them at 385 
discharge. Participants will be instructed to eat the standardized meal for their next meal and log 386 
the time it was eaten. They will also be asked to log any meals they consume through noon the 387 
following day.  388 
 389 
For participants using the blinded CGM, the sensor will be removed at 12PM the next day a t 390 
home (~ 24 hours after the end of exercise).  The participant will bring the device to the next 391 
visit or mail it back to the clinic.   392 
 393 
Participants will receive a phone call the day after each exercise session to elicit  any adverse 394 
events.  395 
 396 
For CGM user s, the CGM data will be downloaded at each visit and arrangements made to 397 
transmit the data following the last exercise session.  398 
 399 
The participant’s insulin pump will be downloaded at each visit and arrangements made to 400 
transmit the data following the last exercise session.  401 
 402 
3.2.4 Sample collection  403 
Blood samples collected through a venous catheter with  plasma glucose measured by an YSI 404 
analyzer . Blood samples will be collected at:  405 
 Baseline (at  -30, -15, -5,  0 min)  406 
 During exercise (at 5, 10, 15, 25, 35 , 45 min)  407 
 In recovery post exercise (at 50, 55, 60, 75  min)  408 
 Regularly following a standardized mixed meal for 90 minutes (at 90, 105, 120, 135, and 409 
165 min)  410 
 411 
Plasma from t he collected blood samples will be used to measure t he following hormones, 412 
proinflammatory mark ers and metabolites  at baseline, during exercise, in recover y post exercise, 413 
and regularly following the standardized mixed meal : 414 
 Insulin  415 
 Glucagon  416 
 Cortisol  417 
 Growth hormone  418 
 Catecholamines (e pinephrine and norepinephrine)   419 
 Interleukin -6, tumor necros is factor -α 420 
 Nonesterified fatty acids  421 
 β-hydroxybut yrate 422 
 Lactate  423

 CHAPTER 4: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND SAFETY MONITORING  425 
 426 
4.1 Adverse Event Reporting and Monitoring  427 
4.1.1 Definition  428 
A reportable adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective 429 
of whether or not the event is considered treatment -related, that occurs 12 hours prior, during, or the 430 
day after each exercise session , except for hypoglyce mia, hyperglycemia, injection -related, and 431 
exercise -induced events which are only reported as adverse events when the criteria described 432 
below are met.  433 
 434 
Hypoglycemic events  are recorded as Adverse Events if the event required IV dextrose or IM 435 
glucagon to treat.   436 
 437 
Hyperglycemic events  are recorded as Adverse Events if evaluation or treatment was obtained from 438 
a health care provider  or if the event involved DKA, as defined by the Diabetes Control and 439 
Complications Trial ( DCCT ) and described below , or in the absence of DKA if evaluation or 440 
treatment was obtained from a health care provider or an acute event involving hyperglycemia or 441 
ketosis.  442 
 443 
Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if all of the following are present:   444 
 Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia , nausea, or vomiting  445 
 Serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones  446 
 Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15  447 
 Treatment provided in a health care facility  448 
 449 
Injection -related  events  are recorded as Adverse Eve nts if sufficiently severe that treatment was 450 
given . 451 
 452 
Exercise -induced events  are recorded as Adverse Events if the subject falls during the exercise 453 
protocol or develops signs or symptoms of a myocardial infarction, poor perfusion (pallor, 454 
cyanosis), angi na, pathologic  arrhythmia,  or another medical condition not expected to occur during 455 
or following the exercise.      456 
 457 
4.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  458 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible adverse 459 
events or unto ward findings.   460 
 461 
All adverse events whether volunteered by the participant, discovered by study personnel during 462 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 463 
reported on a web -based case report form specif ically for adverse event reporting.  464 
 465 
The study investigator will assess the relationship of each adverse event to be related or unrelated to 466 
study drug by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been 467 
caused by the treatment.  Reasonable possibility is not the same as “any possibility.”   The 468 
following should be considered when evaluating the relationship:  469 
• Timing of event  470 
• Patient’s history  471 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 15 of 25 
 • Prevalence of finding in population at risk  472 
• Other possible causes - diseases, exposures, therapies, etc  473 
• Known pharmacology of study drug (and control) or side effect of drug  474 
 475 
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three -point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 476 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe a dverse event 477 
is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not 478 
be clinically serious.  479 
Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study 480 
will be followed  until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the 481 
condition is expected.   482 
Each reported adverse event is reviewed by the Medical Monitor to verify the coding and the 483 
reporting that is required.  Adverse events will be coded usin g the MedDRA dictionary.  484 
 485 
4.1.3 Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  486 
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that:  487 
 Results in death  488 
 Is life -threatening (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 489 
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event)  490 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  491 
 Results in significant disability/incapacity  492 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  493 
 Could have  result ed in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization without  medical 494 
or surgical intervention to prevent any of these events  495 
 496 
Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the Coordinating Center immediately via 497 
completion of the online se rious adverse event form.   498 
 499 
The Medical  Monitor responsible for reviewing serious or unexpected adverse events is:  500 
 501 
Roy W. Beck, M.D., Ph.D.  502 
Jaeb Center for Health Research  503 
15310 Amberly Drive, Suite 350  504 
Tampa, FL  33647  505 
Phone:  (813)  975-8690  506 
Fax: (888) 795-2859  507 
Email: rbeck@jaeb.org  508 
 509 
The Coordinating Center will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is 510 
serious , related to the study drug or procedures,  and unexpected.  Notification will be m ade within 511 
10 days after the Coordinating Center becomes aware of the event. The Coordinating Center also 512 
will notify Xeris  of any such events , who will be responsible for fulfilling reporting requirements to 513 
the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ). 514 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 16 of 25 
 Each pr incipal investigator is responsible for informing his/her IRB of serious , related, and 515 
unexpected  adverse events and abiding by any other reporting requirements specific to his/her  IRB.  516 
 517 
4.2 Risks  518 
4.2.1 Potential Risks and Side Effects  519 
Glucagon has a long  history of medical use in the U .S., and is currently marketed by Eli Lilly & Co. 520 
as Glucagon for Injection [rDNA origin], and Novo Nordisk as GlucaGen® HypoKit®, both 521 
reference listed drugs for treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon has a rapid onset of action 522 
and an extremely short half -life, and its safety, efficacy and clinical pharmacology have been well 523 
established.  524 
 525 
In a Phase 2 study, Protocol No. XSGP -201, healthy, fasted adult volunteers were administered 526 
rescue doses of Xeris  G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and Lilly Glucagon for 527 
Injection [rDNA origin] (1.0 mg) in a randomized, crossover fashion.  Overall, all Xeris and Lilly 528 
treatments were well tolerated.  There were no SAEs during the study, and all AEs obs erved were 529 
transient and generally expected with rescue injections of glucagon.  The most commonly reported 530 
AE was injection site pain, and the incidence of this AE was significantly higher in the Xeris 0.5 mg 531 
and Xeris 1 mg groups compared with the Lilly 1 mg group; however, edema and erythema at the 532 
injection site occurred infrequently and did not vary significantly with treatment.  Within the Lilly 1 533 
mg group, the most commonly reported AE was nausea, the incidence of which was significantly 534 
higher compa red with the Xeris 0.5 mg and 1 mg groups.  The incidences of all remaining AEs 535 
were low and not notably different across treatment groups.  536 
 537 
However , as reported by Haymond  (15), when subcutaneous glucagon in dosages of 20 –150 μg  was 538 
given to children to manage impending hypoglycemia due to gastroenteritis or poor oral intake of 539 
carbohydrates, it did not result in a perceived worsening of the patient’s nausea, nor did it result in 540 
emesis immediately after glucagon administration, as is commonly observed with the recommended 541 
single large 500 –1,000 μg rescue dose.   542 
 543 
In Xeris’ completed Phase 2a safety/PK/PD study , Protocol No. XSMP -201, which tested 75 –300 544 
μg G -Pen Mini™ doses in adult T1D patients, neither nausea nor vomiting were observed with 545 
doses of 75 -150 μg. Nausea, but not vomiting was reported by 4/12 subjects given the 300  μg dose 546 
(3 mild, 1 moderate).  Since doses of subcutaneous G -Pen Mini™ (glucagon injection) given to 547 
adults per this protocol  will range from 75 –300 μg, some nausea is possible, but the incidence is 548 
expected to be relatively low and severe nausea is not expected.  549 
Although available data from prior studies indicate that mini -dose glucagon is likely to successfully 550 
treat mild to moderate hypoglycemia, this i s not definitively proven. Therefore, there is a risk that 551 
mini-dose glucagon will not work as well as glucose tablets or other oral carbohydrates and if this is 552 
the case, severe hypoglycemia could result.    553 
Endurance exercise, as will be performed in thi s study, may be associated with generalized fatigue 554 
and mild to moderate hypoglycemia. In rare situations, exercise can promote myocardial infarction, 555 
sudden cardiac death or arrhythmias. In persons who have proliferative retinopathy, exercise that 556 
increas es blood pressure significantly (>180 mmHg) can promote retinal bleeding ( PMID:  557 
21800941 ). Since all participants will be screened prior to the exercise test for diabetes -related 558 
complications and glucose monitoring will be performed throughout the experim ents, the risk of a 559 
serious exercise -associated adverse event will be extremely remote.    560 
 561 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 17 of 25 
 The blood draws and IV placement could result in discomfort or bruising, or rarely , an infection or a 562 
blood clot.  Fainting may also occur. The exact blood volumes collected may vary according to 563 
local IRB regulations.  The maximum blood volume collected from adults >18 years will not exceed 564 
250 ml at each visit.  565

 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS  568 
 569 
5.1 Benefits  570 
Participants may benefit by gaining a better understanding of how to prevent exercise -associated 571 
hypoglycemia . 572 
 573 
5.2  Participant  Compensation  574 
5.2.1 Participant Reimbursement  575 
The participant will receive $ 100 for the screening visit/ VO 2 max testing and $ 225 for each exercise 576 
session. Participants will receive compensation for transportation to and from each exercise session. 577 
Participants who participate in the pilot phase will receive $100 for the screening visit/  VO 2 max 578 
testing and $100 for each exercise s ession that is part of the pilot.  Participant compensation will be 579 
paid by check, merchandise gift card or money card.  580 
 581 
Additional travel expenses may be paid in select cases for participants with higher expenses . 582 
 583 
5.2.2 Study Costs  584 
All study costs will be covered by the study.  The p articipant will use his/her  own pump , blood 585 
glucose meter,  and CGM (if used) .  The participant will be asked to insert a new infusion set on the 586 
day prior to each exercise session and if CGM is used, a ne w CGM sensor.  The participant will also 587 
be asked to perform additional blood glucose meter checks.  Participants will be permitted to 588 
request reimbursement through their site for any CGM sensor s, infusion set s, or blood glucose 589 
meter strips required  speci fically for the purpose of the study.  590 
 591 
5.3 Participant  Withdrawal  592 
Participation in the study is voluntary, and a participant  may withdraw at any time.  The investigator 593 
may withdraw a participant  who is not complying with the protocol. For participant s who wit hdraw 594 
or are withdrawn, their data will be used up until the time of withdrawal.  595 
 596 
Participants will not be withdrawn from the study if the study drug is discontinued due to adverse 597 
events . 598 
 599 
5.4 Confidentiality  600 
For security and confidentiality purposes, participant s will be assigned an identifier that will be used 601 
instead of their name.  Protected health information gathered for this study will be shared with the 602 
Coordinating Center, the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, FL.  Information also may be 603 
provided to Xeris, Inc  which is providing the glucagon for the study, and Unitio, Inc., which is a 604 
T1D Exchange collaborating organization.  605 
 606 
Some of the s tudy data will be entered on the Coordinating Center’s secure website through an SSL 607 
encrypted connection. The Coordinating Center websites are maintained on Unix and Linux servers 608 
running Apache web server software and on a Windows server running IIS, all  with strong 609 
encryption. The study website is password -protected and restricted to users who have been 610 
authorized by the Coordinating Center to gain access. No identifiable health information of an 611 
enrolled participant  will be relea sed by the Coordinating Center.  612 
 613

 CHAPTER 6: STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  621 
 622 
The approach to  sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below.  A detailed statistical 623 
analys is plan will be written and finalized prior  to the completion of the study . 624 
 625 
6.1 Sample Size  626 
A target of 16  subjects , with replacement of any participants who do not complete the study, was 627 
selected  as a re asonable  sample size for this feasibility study . Considering the primary outcome of 628 
glucose, p ower was approximated using a t -test.  The table below provides power estimates based 629 
on a paired t -test comparing glucose during the mini -dose glucagon treatment and glucose during 630 
the control treatment.  631 
 632

*Power was calculated for a sample size of 16 participants with a two -sided alpha of 0.05  and assuming a standard 634 
deviation of 40 mg/dL  for each treatment.  (A previous DirectNet exercise study was considered when estimating 635 
standard deviation [16].) 636 
 637 
6.2 Analysis Plan  638 
  639 
6.2.1 Primary Outcome  640 
The primar y outcome for this study will be glucose , as measured by YSI analysis , during exercise 641 
and early recovery .  642 
 643 
6.2.2 Primary Analysis  644 
The primar y analysis  for this study will be a descriptive comparison of glycemic response  during 645 
exercise and early recovery  between the mini -dose glucagon group (strategy 3) and the control 646 
group. Summary statistics will be calculated.  In the event that exercise is terminated early due to 647 
glucose <70 mg/dL and the participant  is treated for hypoglycemia, the nadir glucose value will be 648 
carried forward through early recovery.  649 
 650 
To obtain a test of significance, a  treatment comparison of glucose during exercise and early 651 
recovery  will be completed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures that accounts for the 652 
correlation due to the cross -over design and the correlation due to multiple measures, adjusting for 653 
baseline  glucose level and period.  Regression diagnostics will be performed and if the distribution 654 
of residuals is skewed, non -parametric methods and transformations will be considered.  655 
 656 
6.2.3 Secondary Outcomes   657 
The following outcome measures will also be analyzed.  658 
 Occurrence of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) as measured  by YSI analysis during exercise or 659 
early recover y 660 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 21 of 25 
  Occurrence of hyperglycemia (≥ 270 mg/dL) as measured by YSI analysis  in the following 661 
time periods: during exercise, after exercise  in early recover y/prior to meal ingestion  and for 662 
90 minutes after the meal (2 hours after the end of exercise)  663 
 Glucose  levels during exercise and early recovery (venous plasma)  664 
 Glucose levels after a standardized meal (glucose area under the curve analysis, venous 665 
plasma)  666 
 Glucose levels in late recovery ( afternoon and overnight following the exercise protocols - 667 
CGM  analysis ) 668 
o Mean  669 
o Nadir  670 
o Area ab ove and below curve threshold (i.e. area above or below 70-180 mg/dL ) 671 
o % of time in range (70 -180 mg/dL)  672 
o % of time below 70 mg/dL  673 
o Occurrence of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL)  overnight  674 
 Carbohydrate intake (before, during and for 30 min post exercise)  675 
 HR and ratings of perceived exertion  676 
 Insulin and glucose counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, GH, catecholamines, cortisol)  677 
 Inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL -6) 678 
 Metabolites (nonesterified fa tty acids, β -hydroxybuterate , lactate ) 679 
 680 
 681 
6.2.4 Secondary Analyses   682 
The primary and secondary outcomes  will largely be examine d in a descriptive manner.  Summary 683 
statistics will be calculated by treatment strategy . For binary variables, p ercentage of participants 684 
developing the outcome, with 95% confidence interval, will be calculated  by strategy. Each of the 685 
three strategies will be compared to the control in secondary analyses.  686 
 687 
Tests of significance will also be obtained using a 2 -sided alpha of 0. 05. For binary variables, a  688 
generalized linear mixed model with a logistic link function for a binary outcome will be fit to 689 
assess differences between strategy 3 and each of the other strategies .  The model will be adjusted 690 
for baseline glucose and period . For continuous variables, repeated measures linear regression 691 
models will be fit adjusting for period and where applicable the baseline value. Regression 692 
diagnostics will be performed and if the distribution of residuals is skewed, non -parametric methods  693 
and transformations will be considered.   No formal correction will be made for multiple 694 
comparisons.  695 
 696 
6.3 Safety Analyses  697 
Adverse events will be tabulated by strategy :    698 
 Proportion reporting at least one adverse event  699 
 Proportion with an adverse event thought by investigator to be related to strategy  700 
 Proportion who stopped study treatment  in response to an adverse event  701 
 Total number of adverse events reported  702 
 Number of serious adverse events reported  703 
 Number of non -seriou s adverse events reported  704 
 705 
 
 
mini-dose glucagon exercise protocol v3.0_04 -14-16 clean       Page 22 of 25 
 Adverse events will be tabulated by MedDRA categories with frequencies compared between 706 
strategies .  Similar models and diagnostics will be performed as described for the efficacy outcomes 707 
above.  708

 CHAPTER 7 : DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING  711 
 712 
7.1 Data Collection  713 
Data will be collected directly on electronic case report forms and will be considered source 714 
documents when data are directly entered.  Other data will be collected from participant logs, 715 
downloads of devices and from laboratories processing the samples . 716 
 717 
7.2 Quality Assurance and Monitoring  718 
Designated personnel from the Coordinating Center will be responsible for maintaining quality 719 
assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems to ensure tha t the trial is conducted and data 720 
are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable 721 
regulatory requirements.  722 
 723 
A risk -based monitoring (RBM) plan will be developed and revised as needed during the course 724 
of the study.  The RBM plan will focus mainly on data related to eligibility, adverse events and 725 
the primary efficacy analysis .  As much as possible, remote monitoring will be performed in 726 
real-time, with on -site monitoring performed to evaluate the verity and completeness of the key 727 
site data.  728 
 729 
Xeris, the Jaeb Center for Health Research, or their representatives may visit the study facilities 730 
at any time in order to maintain current and personal knowledge of the study through review of 731 
the records, comparison w ith source documents, observation and discussion of the conduct and 732 
progress of the study.  733

INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Background  
This is a prospective clinical  study to determine the efficacy of Profound  device for treatment of 
cellulite in the upper arms, above the knees and the bra bulge area . The Profound  system received 
FDA 510(k) clearance in 2009 under K082391, and is intended for  use in dermatologic and general 
surgical procedures for hemostasis and electrocoagulation and  the pe rcutaneous treatment of 
facial wrinkles.  In addition , the Profound  device received  FDA 510(K) clearance in 2016 under 
K161043 , and is intended for  use in d ermatologic and general surgical procedures for 
electrocoagulation  and hemostasis, percutaneous treatment of facial wrinkles, and improvement 
in the appearance of cellulite (suppor ted by long -term clinical data - 6 months).  
Cellulite is an aesthetically un acceptable cosmetic problem for many post -adolescent women.  It 
is largely observed in the gluteal -femoral regions with an “orange -peel” or “cottage cheese” 
appearance [1].  The condition is not specific to overweight issues although increased adiposity 
will exacerbate the cosmetic issue.  
Recent research papers on cellulite anatomical features have shown specific features in the 
dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin which are characteristic of cellulite presence [1 -5].  
First, superficial fat lobules called papillae adiposae  were shown to be protruding within the 
dermal layer in the form of intrusion pockets.   Figure 1 - Fat indentation invading the dermal layer  
shows a gross histology of the dermis/subcutis transition wher e the fat pockets are present.  
 
 
Figure 1 - Fat indentation invading the dermal layer  
 
Second, tissue observations from autopsy on female subjects with cellulite have suggested a 
higher percentage of fibrous septae oriented perpendicular to the skin surface as opposed to 
males who tend to have the septae organized in a criss -cross fashion.  The arrangement of fibrous 
septae perpendicular to the skin surface in a female is shown in Figure 2 - Fibrous septae in 
subcutis perpendicular to the skin surface .

Figure 2 - Fibrous septae in subcutis perpendicular to the skin surface  
 
This subcutaneous fibrous strand organization tends to create uneven appearance of the skin 
surface, which is characteristic of cellulite.  Therefore, it is thought that treatments targeting the 
dermis and subcutaneous layers of the skin could have beneficial effects on the appearance of 
cellulite.  Indeed, a treatment which would increase the dermal thickness would create a 
condition where th e hypodermal fibrous strand organization described above would have fewer 
tendencies  to deform the skin surface and improve the appearance of cellulite.    Furthermore, a 
remodeling of the subcutaneous fibrous band organization following fractional thermal  injuries, 
in conjunction with a volumetric reduction of the fat lobules would decrease the local tension 
forces responsible for the presence of cellulite.   
This study presents a one arm investigation aimed at using fractional energy delivery targeting 
the dermal and subcutaneous tissue together.  
Device Description: Profound    
The main intent of the System is to utilize a minimally -invasive approach to directly deliver RF 
energy into tissue through pairs of micro -electrode needles and use temperature senso rs within 
the needles to reliably create fractional thermal injuries within the skin.  The System, shown in 
Figure 3 – Cartridge, Handpiece, and Console , consists of:  
• Console to allow physician to set treatment parameters and delivers RF energy to a re -
useable Handpiece and Cartridge;  
• Two types of re -useable Handpieces ( SubQ Handpiece and Dermal Handpiece)  to enable 
subject treatment by making the link  between the Console and a single -use sterile 
Cartridge; and  
• Two types of s ingle -use sterile Cartridge s to deliver RF energy :

• SubQ Cartridge (75⁰)  delivers RF energy to the subcutaneous  through  the 
dermal layer of the skin, which creates fractional thermal i njuries to ablate 
the targets – the dermal and subcutaneous layers.  
• Dermal Cartridge (25⁰) delivers RF energy to the dermal layer of the skin, 
which creates fractional thermal i njuries to abl ate dermal targets.  
 
Figure 3 – Cartridge, Handpiece, and Console  
 
The Console includes a color touch screen with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is mainly 
used to select two treatment parameters – the target temperature an d the application time, 
communicate messages to the user, and setup preferences.   
Principles of operation  
The System uses a minimally invasive approach to  deliver bipolar non -ablative radiofrequency 
(RF) energy to the dermal layers of the skin. The physic ian first selects two treatment parameters, 
target tissue temperature and application time, by interacting with the GUI of the Console.  Using 
the Handpiece and Cartridge connected to the Console, the physician then inserts the array of 
micro -needle electr ode pairs into the dermal layer  of the skin .  Within each pair, a temperature 
sensor is located at the distal tip of the electrode to provide real -time feedback of target tissue 
temperature from within the forming thermal injury .  This temperature feedback  information 
allows  the console to deliver RF energy to the needles to reach and maintain the physician -
selected target temperature.  The system allows it to precisely, predictably, and reliably reach and 
maintain tissue temperature regardless of skin impe dance, as shown in peer -reviewed 
publications [6 -11].

STUDY DESIGN OVERVIE W 
This study is a prospective, open -label, baseline -controlled, clinical study, to evaluate  cellulite 
appearance , skin laxity  and subcutaneous fat following  Profound  treatment , using the Dermal 
and/or SubQ Cartridges for  minimal ly-invasive  treatment targeted to both dermal and 
subcutaneous layer of the skin  in the upper arms, above the knees and bra bulges [ area between 
the armpits and chest ].  
Up to 60 Healthy subject s at 2 investigational  sites will be enrolled in this study. All subjects will 
undergo an assessment of their general health. Treatment areas will undergo  a single Dermal 
and/or SubQ treatment , depending on the body location, thickness of fat in the treatment area 
and proximity to bone. The treatment will be according to physician discretion, as both treating 
physicians are highly experienced Profound users. G lobal aesthetic  improvement (GAI) will be 
assessed  at each follow -up visit starting from the 1-month follow -up. 
Before treatment (15 -20 minutes) the tissue to be treated will be injected with tumescence 
solution.  
All treatment areas will undergo a single treatment with the Profound  device , utilizing the Dermal 
and/or SubQ Cartridges . 
During the fo llow -up period , 4 visits will be conducted as follow s: one-week post first treatment 
safety follow -up visit (1wk FU post Tx.1)  and efficacy and safety follow -up visits at the 1 -month  
(1M FU), 3-month  (3M FU) and 6-month (6M  FU) post treatment  visits .  
Improvement in cellulite appearance will be assessed at each post baseline visit. Additionally, 
investigator and subject questionnaires will be completed.  Finally, photography will be 
performed under visible light conditions o f the front, right, left and back view.  Most assessments 
will be performed  at all study  visits.  
STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Profound  device utilizing the 
Dermal and SubQ Cartridges for minimall y-invasive cellulite treatment in  the upper arms, above 
the knees and bra bulge areas.  
Primary Objective

and SubQ Cartridges  during all study  
2. Comfort level during treatment:  
Comfort  assessment will be performed independently by the subject using NSR scale. 
Subjects will be asked to fill out a  questionnaire after the treatment /s (Tx.1/  Tx.2)  
Secondary Objective s 
1. Statistically significant improvement in appearance  of cellulite, skin laxity and 
subcutaneous fat deposits (Appendix III – Tables 6 and 7) of the upper arms, above  the 
knees and bra bulges,  following  dermal and/or subcutaneous Profound treatment, as 
assessed by study investigator at all post treatment visits (1M FU, 3M FU & 6M FU) versus 
baseline.  
2. Investigator  satisfaction:  
Satisfaction assessment will be performed by the study investigator  using a pre -defined  
scale questionnaire  (Appendix III – Table 8) . The investigator  will fill out the  questionnaire 
at each  post treatment  follow -up visit  (1M FU, 3M FU & 6M FU) . 
3. Subject imp rovement and satisfaction:  
Subject  assessment s will be performed independently by the subject using a pre -defined 
scale questionnaire  (Appendix III – Tables 7 -10). Subjects will fill out the  questionnaire at 
each follow -up visit (1M FU, 3M FU & 6M FU) . 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Blinded evaluation of global aesthetic improvement (GAI)  in the appearance of cellulite, skin laxity 
and subcutaneous fat deposits of the upper arms, above the knees and bra bulges, using a 5-point  
grading scale (Appendix III  – Table  6).  Efficacy is assessed by correctly identifying the correct pre - 
and post -treatment photos of the same subject, and having at least  50% or greater (Grade of 3 or 
4) global aesthetic improvement  at the 3 -month follow -up visit  relative to baseline photos. 
Improvement reflects improvement in cellulite appearance, skin laxity or visible reduction in 
localized fat deposits in the treated areas.  There will be two blinded evaluators to assess the 
photos.  
The study primary end point is achieved when 80% subjects show at least  50%  improvement at 
the 3 -month follow -up visit  relative to baseline photos.

ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study 
participant during their participation in the study.  
Anticipated Adverse Effects  
Following treatment with the  Profound  the following local adverse effects could occur 
(anticipated):  
➢ Ecchymosis  ➢ Numbness  
➢ Hyperpigmentation  ➢ Infection  
➢ Hypopigmentation  ➢ Itching  
➢ Bruising  ➢ Scarring  
➢ Swelling  ➢ First degree burns  
➢ Twinge ( pain ) ➢ Second degree burns  
➢ Loss of sensation  ➢ Nerve d amage  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesired clinical occurrence in a study subject as indicated by signs, 
symptoms, illnesses, events that develop or worsen in severity in association with the study when 
deemed by t he Investigator to be related to use of the device or study procedures. The 
Investigator will document all adverse signs and symptoms regardless of severity or frequency 
that are either volunteered by subjects or observed during the course of the study tha t are related 
to the device.  The Investigator will also record adverse experiences of subjects resulting from 
concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states that 
the Investigator deems related to the device. In cluded in the description will be the nature of the 
sign or symptom, the date of onset, whether the event was serious, the severity, the relationship 
to study procedures or investigational device, the action taken, the date of resolution, and the 
outcome. The Principal Investigator will determine the relationship of the adverse device effect 
to the investigational device.  
Anticipated effects from the injected local or tumescent anesthetic if used may be allergic 
reaction, feeling anxious, shaky, dizzy, rest less, or depressed; drowsiness, vomiting, ringing in the 
ears, blurred vision; confusion, twitching, seizure (convulsions); fast heart rate, rapid breathing, 
feeling hot or cold; weak or shallow breathing, slow heart rate, weak pulse; or feeling like passi ng 
out. Less serious side effects include: mild bruising, redness, local scars, itching, or swelling where 
the medication was injected; mild dizziness; nausea.

Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For device studies, part 21 CRF 812.3(s)  uses the term unan ticipated adverse device effect  which 
is defined as an y serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with the  device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature,  severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
Significant device failure may constitute an adverse event if an undesirable experience occurs.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use or the deployment of the device, or any event that  is a result of a user error.  
All unanticipated adverse e ffects will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate:  Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may be ameliorated by simple 
therapeutic measures, and may interfere with usual activity.  
Major:  Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and 
that interferes with usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by 
therapeutic measures and the discontinuation of the study device may be 
required.  
Severe:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity.   
The relationship of the adverse effect to the study is defined as follows:  
Probable:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and 
another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, 
and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to study device.  
Probably not:  An adverse event has little or no temp oral relationship to the study device 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not related:  An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much 
more likely alternative etiology.

Protocol #  DHF21711  Rev. Date  November 17 , 2017  Page 27 of 37 
 
Anticipated adverse events in this study include : 
➢ Bruising  ➢ Numbness  
➢ Hyperpigmentation  ➢ Infection  
➢ Hypopigmentation  ➢ Itching  
➢ Swelling  ➢ First degree burns  
➢ Twinge ( pain ) ➢ Second degree burns  
➢ Loss of sensation  ➢ Nerve d amage  
Subjects worldwide participated in clinical research and underwent treatment with the profound  
device . The Profound  device will be used in this study was previous ly used in  study  and emitted 
the same energy . To date, no serious adverse events or unanticipat ed AEs have been reported. 
The reported AEs relate to dermal  and subcutaneous tissue, confined to the treatment area and 
were all mild in nature and resolved within the study period.  
Potential benefits to participating individuals and to society  
Subjects m ay or may not benefit from improvement in cellulite appearance  on the treated area  
via a minimal -invasive technique .  All subjects in the treatment groups are expected to have some 
benefit from the treatment procedures as would be expected for the commerci al I device. Subject 
will receive treatment /s procedures at no cost.  This study will benefit the advancement of 
medicine by generating data on safety and efficacy that will aid in the development of an 
alternative treatment options to procedures with high er potential risks subjects .  The results of 
this study will help to determine whether th is device is  safe and effective for improvement of 
cellulite appearance . 
Conclusion:  
In light of the potential benefits of minimal -invasive cellulite appearance  relative to its risks, the 
potential benefits associated with the use of the Profound  System  outweigh its risks, supporting 
study initiation.  
Payment for Participation  
Subjects will be paid a total of $ 200 for all study visits and evaluations.  Payment s will be issued 
at the last FU visit .  Subjects will not pay for office visits, examinations or procedures that are part 
of this clinical study.  After treatment, subjects who do not complete all study -related procedures 
and requirements will not be  paid nor will they receive partial payments for completed visits.

APPENDIX II – PHOTOG RAP HY GUID ELINE S 
 
At each time point (before the treatments and at the follow‐up visits); photographs of the treated 
areas should be taken in a standardized manner.  
o Photographs should be taken in a private room or area of the clinic under controlled 
conditions, including the distance from the camera to t he subject, height of the camera, 
background, camera positioning, subject's positioning and lighting in order to achieve 
high quality before & after sets.  
o Subject’s hair should be removed at all photographs at all -time points. Un wanted hair at 
the treated area will be shaved by study staff at the clinic.  
o For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study photographs, 
especially per subject.  
o The digital files should follow a consistent standard naming scheme  (including: date, 
subject stu dy ID, subject initials, for example: 001TS_Tx.1_Mar 21 2015, etc.)

APPENDIX IV - PAIN ASSESSMENT  
 
Immediately after treatment the subject will be asked to rate treatment related pain. Pain will be 
assessed post treatment based on the Numerical Scale  Response  (NSR). The subject will be 
presented a scale  (below) with words along a horizontal line and asked to make a mark along the 
scale  to rate their pain from no pain to worst possible pain.  A number will be derived by the 
research staff by measuring up to the point the subject has indicated  versus the entire line .

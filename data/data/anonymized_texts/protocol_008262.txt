 1 GENERAL INFORMATION 
1.1 Introduction  
 
Acne vulgaris is the most common skin diseas e in patients with skin of color and second most 
common in C aucasian population1.  The global prevalence is thought to be as high as 60- 80% in 
individ uals 12- 25 years of age1,2.  However, it is not limited to only teenagers but also to adults, 
especially adult females3.  The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial.  Genetics may also play a role. 
 The treatment pathway should be directed to different pathogenic factors including, excessive 
sebum production, hyper keratinization, P. acnes , and inflammation4,5,6,7,8.   
Data is limited for skin of color patients in Phase III registration trials. Data is limited 
because there a few studies that focus on patients with skin of color.  Therefore, a unique study dedicated to patients with skin of color in a real -world setting will be 
welcome to add further evidence to phase III data.  
 
 Winlevi is the first topical  anti androgen and sebum inhibitor approved for acne vulgaris.
9 However, 
we do not have any clinical experience with W inlevi in treatment for acne 
Therefore ,it  is reasonable to study W inlevi  to emulate real life practice.

 4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
i. Female subjects who are pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test), breast -feeding, or who 
are of childbearing potential and not practicing a reliable method of birth control.  
ii. Allergy or sensitivity to any component of the test medications (Section 5.2).  
iii. Subjects who have not complied with the proper wash- out periods for prohibited medications 
(Supplement I).  
iv. Medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates the subject’s 
participation in the clinical study.  
v. Skin disease/disorder that might interfere with the diagnosis or evaluation of acne vulgaris   
vi. Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse.  
vii. History of poor cooperation, non- compliance with medical treatment, or unreliability. 
viii. Exposure to an investigational drug study within 30 days of the Baseline Visit.  
4.3 Withdrawal of Subjects  
It is the right and duty of the Investigator to discontinue the study participation of a subject when the subject's health or well -being is threatened by continuation in the study. Such subjects should be 
withdrawn from the study.  
 The following are circumstances that would result in the subject's discontinuation from the study:  
 
 the subject experiences a serious adverse event rendering them unable to continue study participation;  
 the subject is unable to physically or mentally tolerate the use of the test medication;  
 an exclusion criterion becomes apparent at any time during the study; or  
 the subject voluntarily withdraws.  
 In the event of premature discontinuation from the study, the Investigator should determine the primary reason for discontinuation.  A subject who is withdrawn from the study prior to initiation of treatment may be replaced.

 5.3 Concomitant Medication/Treatment 
Please see Supplement I for a listing of prohibited medications.  Necessary therapies that will not

5.5       Summary of Benefits 
There may be certain direct benefits derived from participating in this study. Such benefits include 
temporary, partial or complete, clearance of your acne lesions; however, it is possible that you receive no benefit. The results of this study may be useful in the development of a new therapy for others with similar conditions to yours.

7.2.3  Follow -up and Final Reports  
Subjects who have had a serious adverse event must  be followed clinically until all parameters, 
including laboratory values (if applicable), have either returned to normal or are otherwise explained.  
 
If death was the outcome of the event on the initial SAE Report, a Follow -up/Final Report, including 
autopsy report, when performed, must be completed.

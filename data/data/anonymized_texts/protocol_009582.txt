 1 Introduction 
1.1 Background  
The best method by which to triage patients presenting to the emergency 
department  (ED) has yet to be established. The key objective of the process of 
triage is to determine which patient is at the highest risk because that patient 
will require the greatest amount of resources and attention to determine the most appropriate treatment.  Risk stratification is a necessar y method for 
triaging patients, particularly in the ED, as the number of patients presenting to the ED and the availability of staff is never equally matched requiring a method to determine the order and urgency in which patients are treated.  
 Recent scori ng systems to determine risk of significant clinical deterioration in 
patient health, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) , utilize vital 
signs (i.e., heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, pulse oximetry) and a subjective measure of the patient’s mental status (i.e., AVPU score: alert, reacts to voice, reacts to pain, or unconscious). Elevated MEWS values has been shown to be related to mortality .
1 In the United Kingdom, a 
national early warning score (NEWS) has been implemented nationwide and been shown to discriminate patients at risk of the combined outcome of cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit ( ICU) admission , or death within 24 
hours.
2 
 A novel algorithm for determining risk of acute cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, for patients presenting to the ED has recently been reported. Unlike prior risk stratification tools that relied on basic vital sign data,  this 
algorit hm utilizes multiple metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) as well as a 
machine learning approach to solve the risk classification problem.  The 
algorithm requires the collection of vital sign data, patient mental status, and at 
least  5 minutes of continuous electrocardiography (to calculate HRV  metrics ). 
It was shown to be more accurate than MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours of admission to hospital.
3 Furthermore, the algorithm has been 
used to predict serious complications (mortality, car diac arrest, ventricular 
tachycardia, hypotension requiring inotropes or intra- aortic balloon pump  
(IABP)  insertion, intubation or mechanical ventilation, complete heart block, 
bradycardia requiring pacing, and recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization) within 72 hours in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. In this patient population, a score of 4 or higher  from the algorithm  had a 
sensitivity of 0.880, specificity of 0.680, positive predictive value of 0.195, and a nega tive predictive value of 0.985 which was better than using ST 
elevation/depression and troponin in predicting complications within 72 hours.
4 
The primary limitation of the algorithm is that it has been developed and tested 
in Singaporean patients . Verification of the results of the studies using this 
algorithm in other  patient cohorts  is required. As such, the proposed study will 
investigate the sensitivity and specificity of th e algorithm.

3 Statistical Analysis  
3.1 Introduction  
The primary objective is to verify an existing prediction algorithm of cardiopulmonary events.  The secondary objective is to assess the prediction 
algorithm with regard to the frequency of cardiopulmonary events.  
 Standard summary statistics will be calculated for relevant study variables.  For continuous variables, summary statistics will include means, medians, standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals around the means.  Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages.  Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS version 9.1 or above (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) or another statistical analysis package.
 
3.2 Primary Outcome M easure  
The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of cardiopulmonary events . It 
will be measured as the occurrence of any cardiopulmonary event, within 72 hours of presentation to the ED, including:  
 Cardiac arrest  
Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)  
Hypotension requiring inotropes or intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion  
Intubation or mechanical ventilation  
Complete heart block  
Bradycardia requiring insertion of a pacing wire or external pacing, and  
Percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) or coronar y artery bypass surgery 
(CABG).  
 For the primary outcome measure of  occurrence of cardiopulmonary events , binary 
logistic regression will be used to estimate the probability that a cardiopulmonary 
ZOLL Medical

In-Hospital Study 
Version 2.0 Page 16 of 32 
 event has occurred given the v alues of explanatory variables, given by the 
following equation:  
 
 Y is the primary outcome measure  
Yi = 1 if a cardiopulmonary event has occurred 
Yi = 0 if there is no cardiopulmonary event  
 πi = the probability  of a cardiopulmonary  event  
 X = (X1, X2, ..., Xk) being the set of explanatory variables  
 
Model : 
 
logit(π i)=β 0+β1xi1+…+β kxik 
 
A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve will be constructed and the area 
under the curve will be calculated to assess the model sensitivity.  
 
3.3 Secondary Outcome Measure  
 
The secondary outcome measure of the frequency of any cardiac event will be 
measured as the occurrence of any cardiac and cardiac -related events, not 
limited to:  
  1. In-hospital Death  
2. In-hospital  Cardiac Arrest  
3. Composite cardiovascular outcome or intervention (Lethal Arrhythmias , 
Acute Pulmonary Edema, Cardiogenic Shock, Myocardial Infarction, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, Coronary artery Bypass Surgery , New or Recurrent MI, Recurrent Ischemia requiring Revascularization)  
 
For the secondary  outcome measur e of frequency of any cardiopulmonary event , 
multiple linear  regression will be used to estimate the probability that an increase 
in the number of  cardiopulmonary event s given the v alues of explanatory variables, 
given by the following equation:  
 
 Yi is the  number of cardiopulmonary events  
 πi = the probability  of a cardiopulmonary  event  
 X = (X1, X2, ..., Xi) be the  set of explanatory variables  
 p=number  of β coefficients  in the model (including the intercept)

3.4 Randomization  
This study is observational and no randomization of subjects will occur.  
 
3.5 Blinding 
This study is observational and no blinding will occur.  
 
3.6 Missing Data  
The primary analysis will be based on the data as observed.  Two additional 
sensitivity a nalyses will be performed where subjects with missing data are (1) 
assumed to  have no cardiopulmonary events and (2) assumed to have a 
cardiopulmonary event.  
3.7 Sample Size  
Approximately 760 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study to provide 634 
subjects in the final analysis.  
 
When the sample size is 634, the logistic regression test of β=0 (α = 0.050 two-
sided) will have 80% power to detect a β of 0.747 (an odds ratio of 2.111); this 
assumes that one normally distributed covariate x is being added to the model 
after adjustment for prior covariates, that its multiple correlation with covariates already in the model is 0.500 and, that the proportion of successes at the mean 
of x is 0.050.  
4 Monitoring Procedures  
4.1 Monitoring  
This study  will be monitored according to appropriate regulations and SOPs .

 5.5 Use of Study  Findings  
5.5.1  Subject Confidentiality  
In conducting the study, the investigational site will comply with all applicable 
laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable medical information including but not limited to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).   
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. the subject is alive and 
well) at the end of their schedul ed study  period.  
 
All personal information pertaining to subject s will be kept confidential.  
Subjects will be identified only by their Subject ID Number.  Clinical study  
documents and hospital and clinic medical records pertaining to subjects may be reviewed by Sponsor  personnel or their representatives.  
 
Information obtained in the course of executing this study , including still and 
motion photography, may be presented for regulatory, clinical or educational purposes as long as no subject is identified.

 6 Appendice s 
ECG Monitoring 
The X Series is intended for use to monitor and/or record 3- , 5-, or 12- lead ECG 
waveform and heart rate, and to alarm when heart rate is above or below limits 
set by the operator.  
Each site will receive 3 X -series monitors to be used on subjects enrolled in the 
study .  These devices will be on loan and will be returned to the sponsor at the 
completion of the study.  
The patient’s ECG is monitored by connecting the patient to the unit via a 3- , 5-, 
or 12- lead patient cable or hands -free therapy electrodes. The ECG waveform is 
presented on the display along with the following information:    
• averaged heart rate, derived by measuring R to R intervals  
• lead selection - I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 (with ECG 
cable),  PADDLES, or PADS.  
• ECG  size - 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 cm/mV, AUTO  
• status messages  
The ECG bandwidth is user selectable.  
IMPORTANT:  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WE ARE REQUIRING THE RECORDING OF A 3-LEAD, CONTINUOUS ECG  OF AT LEAST 5 MINUTES.  
Continuous Waveform Recording  
Continuous waveform recording allows you to record continuous waveforms to a 
full disclosure case log for the patient being monitored. This feature needs to be enabled by a supervisor. The supervisor can access this feature by pressing the Setup quick access key ( ), and then selecting Supervisor>Log>Waveform Recording. In this menu, the following settings can be customized:  
• Record Displayed Waveforms – Record only the top waveform that is 
displayed or record all     waveforms that are displayed.  
• Record Additional Waveforms – Always record the CO2 waveform or 
always record the IBP and the CO2 waveforms.  
Note: When Continuous waveform recording is disabled, no waveforms (except 
snapshots) are recorded.  
The full disclosure case can, at a minimum, concurrently store the following information:  
ZOLL Medical

In-Hospital Study 
Version 2.0 Page 25 of 32 
 • 32 monitor snapshots  
• 500 non- ECG events  
• 24 hours of continuous ECG (4 waveforms), Capnography, IBP (3 
channels), and Pads Impedance  
The actual information that is stored depends on usage. Also, the specific 
combination of stored continuous waveform data depends on how the waveform recording settings are configured in the Supervisor menu.  
ECG Monitoring Setup 
The proper application and placement of electrodes is essential for high quality 
ECG monitoring. Good contact between the electrode and skin minimizes motion 
artifact and signal interference.  
The following procedure describes how to monitor a patient’s ECG using 3- and 
5-Lead ECG cables.  
To monitor a patient’s ECG using 3- and 5- Lead ECG cables, perform t he 
following steps:  
1. Prepare the patient's skin for electrode application:  
2. Apply the electrode pads to the patient.  
3. Connect each lead of the ECG cable to the appropriate electrode.  
4. Insert the patient cable plug into the ECG input connector on the X Series unit.  
5. Select the ECG waveforms to be displayed on the waveform trace display screen.  
6. Observe the patient‘s electrocardiogram on the display, and adjust size of the ECG waveform trace, as necessary.  
Preparing the Patient for Electrode Appli cation  
The proper application of electrodes is essential for high quality ECG monitoring. 
Good contact between the electrode and skin minimizes motion artifact and 
signal interference.  
Before applying electrodes, prepare the patient’s skin, as necessary:  
• Shave or clip excess hair at electrode site.  
• Clean oily skin with an alcohol pad.  
• Rub site briskly to dry.

 Applying Electrodes to the Patient  
The following sections show where to place electrodes when using 3 - and 5- Lead 
cables to perform ECG monitoring. For 3- Lead ECG cables, apply electrodes as 
in Figure 4- 1, 3-Lead Electrode Placement. For 5- Lead ECG cables, apply 
electrodes as in Figure 4- 2, 5-Lead Electrode Placement.  
Avoid placing electrodes over tendons and major muscle masses.  
Make sure that the ECG electrodes are placed to allow defibrillation, if 
necessary.  
3-Lead Electrode Placement  
Depending upon local usage, the ECG leads are marked either RA, LA, and LL 
(or R, L, and F). The following table shows the markings and color codes for the 
differ ent lead sets.

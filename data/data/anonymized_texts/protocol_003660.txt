2.1
 
Objective
 
The
 
overall
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
examine
 
the
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
of
 
easier
 
versus
 
harder
 
goals.
  
If
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
are
 
established,
 
efficacy
 
can
 
be
 
evaluated
 
in
 
a
 
subsequent,
 
fully-powered
 
optimization
 
trial.
 
The
 
overarching
 
research
 
question
 
of
 
this
 
line
 
of
 
work
 
is
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
optimal
 
goal
 
setting
 
intensities
 
that
 
maximize
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
a
 
digital
 
intervention
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.

To

2.3
 
Background
 
and
 
Significance
 
2.3.1
 
Obesity
 
Obesity
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
public
 
health
 
problem.
 
Obesity
 
has
 
become
 
a
 
pervasive
 
health
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
with
 
rates
 
of
 
42%
 
among
 
adults
 
and
 
another
 
30+%
 
overweight.
 
Excess
 
weight
 
heightens
 
risk
 
for
 
chronic
 
diseases,
 
including
 
type
 
2
 
diabetes,
 
and
 
can
 
magnify
 
psychological
 
distress
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
weight
 
stigma.
 
Behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions
 
that
 
involve
 
frequent
 
in-person
 
meetings,
 
diet
 
and
 
exercise
 
goals,
 
and
 
behavioral
 
strategies
 
are
 
the
 
gold
 
standard
 
for
 
treating
 
overweight
 
and
 
obesity.
 
These
 
5
 
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
are
 
effective
 
in
 
producing
 
weight
 
loss
 
up
 
to
 
10%,
 
but
 
often
 
lack
 
scalability.
 
This
 
research
 
is
 
significant
 
because
 
it
 
will
 
optimize
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
that
 
has
 
potential
 
for
 
broad
 
reach
 
and
 
scalability.
 
2.3.2
 
Fully
 
digital
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions
 
Digital
 
health
 
interventions
 
that
 
deliver
 
treatment
 
remotely
 
seek
 
to
 
minimize
 
burden
 
and
 
decrease
 
costs
 
compared
 
to
 
in-person
 
interventions.
 
With
 
widespread
 
penetration
 
of
 
smartphones
 
among
 
U.S.
 
adults,
 
digital
 
health
 
interventions
 
have
 
potential
 
to
 
reach
 
booad
 
geographic
 
segments
 
of
 
the
 
population.
 
Compared
 
to
 
traditional
 
interventions
 
with
 
counseling,
 
standalone
 
digital
 
interventions
 
offer
 
greater
 
scalability
 
given
 
lower
 
personnel
 
costs,
 
and
 
produce
 
modest
 
weight
 
loss.
 
However,
 
weight
 
loss
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
modest;
 
thus,
 
more
 
work
 
is
 
needed
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
fully
 
digital
 
approaches.
 
2.3.3
 
Goal
 
setting
 
Goal
 
setting
 
is
 
a
 
core
 
component
 
of
 
behavioral
 
obesity
 
treatment.
 
Goals
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
behaviors
 
(e.g.,
 
to
 
exercise
 
more)
 
or
 
outcomes
 
(e.g.,
 
to
 
lose
 
weight).
 
Many
 
behavioral
 
obesity
 
treatments
 
include
 
goals
 
for
 
weight
 
loss,
 
physical
 
activity,
 
and
 
calories,
 
yet
 
there
 
is
 
large
 
variability
 
in
 
the
 
specific
 
intensities
 
of
 
these
 
goals.
 
Past
 
research
 
has
 
shown
 
that
 
personalized
 
goals
 
are
 
helpful
 
at
 
promoting
 
behavior
 
change,
 
adaptive
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
static
 
goals,
  
immediate
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
gradual
 
goals,
 
and
 
larger
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
smaller
 
goals,
 
However,
 
to
 
our
 
knowledge,
 
no
 
study
 
has
 
examined
 
the
 
optimal
 
goal
 
intensity
 
(i.e.,
 
harder
 
versus
 
easier
 
goals)
 
to
 
be
 
given
 
in
 
a
 
fully
 
digital
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention.
 
Doing
 
so
 
would
 
aid
 
in
 
identifying
 
the
 
most
 
efficacious
 
and
 
least
 
burdensome
 
approach
 
to
 
goal
 
setting
 
in
 
a
 
highly
 
scalable
 
context.

Theoretical
 
Framework
 
Self-regulation
 
theories,
 
including
 
Social
 
Cognitive
 
Theory
 
and
 
Control
 
Theory,
 
posit
 
that
 
behavior
 
change
 
occurs
 
through
 
comparison
 
of
 
one’s
 
behavior
 
to
 
one’s
 
goals
 
or
 
past
 
performance.
 
Meta-analyses
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
that
 
goal
 
setting,
 
self-monitoring,
 
and
 
feedback
 
work
 
in
 
tandem
 
to
 
promote
 
greater
 
behavior
 
change
 
and
 
weight
 
loss.
 
 
 
2.5
 
Using
 
the
 
Multiphase
 
Optimization
 
Strategy
 
(MOST)
 
 
The
 
Multiphase
 
Optimization
 
Strategy
 
(MOST)
 
is
 
an
 
engineering-inspired
 
framework
 
used
 
for
 
systematically
 
constructing
 
multicomponent
 
behavioral
 
interventions.
 
MOST
 
involves
 
three
 
phases:
 
Preparation,
 
Optimization,
 
and
 
Evaluation.
 
In
 
the
 
Preparation
 
phase,
 
components
 
and
 
their
 
respective
 
levels
 
of
 
interest
 
are
 
identified
 
and
 
pilot
 
tested.
 
A
 
conceptual
 
model
 
is
 
created
 
to
 
depict
 
how
 
behavior
 
change
 
occurs
 
through
 
the
 
various
 
components
 
and
 
mechanisms.
 
In
 
the
 
Optimization
 
phase,
 
the
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
effects
 
of
 
those
 
components
 
are
 
evaluated
 
in
 
a
 
fully-powered
 
trial.
 
Often,
 
a
 
factorial
 
design
 
is
 
used.
 
Components
 
and
 
component-levels
 
that
 
produce
 
a
 
minimal
 
clinically
 
important
 
difference
 
are
 
retained
 
in
 
the
 
newly
 
optimized
 
intervention,
 
whereas
 
those
 
that
 
produce
 
minimal
 
or
 
iatrogenic
 
effects
 
are
 
removed.
 
Lastly,
 
in
 
the
 
Evaluation
 
phase,
 
the
 
newly
 
optimized
 
intervention
 
is
 
tested
 
against
 
a
 
meaningful
 
comparator
 
to
 
determine
 
efficacy
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
package.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
achieve
 
intervention
 
EASE,
 
by
 
balancing
 
the
 
Effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
against
 
other
 
constraints
 
such
 
as
 
Affordability,
 
Scalability,
 
and
 
Efficiency.

Advancing
 
Knowledge
 
in
 
the
 
Field
 
No
 
study,
 
to
 
our
 
knowledge,
 
has
 
examined
 
the
 
optimal
 
goal
 
setting
 
intensity
 
in
 
a
 
fully
 
digital
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention.
 
Examining
 
both
 
the
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
effects
 
of
 
different
 
goal
 
intensities
 
will
 
enable
 
creation
 
of
 
an
 
intervention
 
that
 
maximizes
 
weight
 
loss
 
while
 
minimizing
 
undue
 
patient
 
burden
 
and
 
effort.

easier
 
or
 
harder
 
version
 
of
 
4
 
goal
 
domains:
 
calorie
 
goal,
 
step
 
goal,
 
eating
 
window
 
goal,
 
and
 
Red
 
Zone
 
Food
 
goal.
 
The
 
intervention
 
will
 
last
 
10
 
weeks,
 
with
 
remote
 
assessments
 
at
 
baseline,
 
4
 
weeks,
 
and
 
10
 
weeks.
 
All
 
procedures,
 
including
 
the
 
intervention
 
and
 
assessment,
 
will
 
occur
 
remotely.
 
3.2
 
Study
 
Design
 
 
This
 
optimization
 
trial
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
2
4
 
full
 
factorial
 
design
 
(i.e.,
 
2x2x2x4)
 
to
 
test
 
easier
 
vs.
 
harder
 
versions
 
of
 
4
 
goals.
 
As
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
Table
,
 
for
 
each
 
goal
 
domain,
 
half
 
of
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
assigned
 
to
 
receive
 
the
 
easier
 
version
 
while
 
the
 
other
 
half
 
will
 
receive
 
the
 
harder
 
version.
 
In
 
total,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
1
 
of
 
16
 
experimental
 
conditions.
 
A
 
factorial
 
trial
 
compares
 
means
 
across
 
c
ombinations
 
of
 
conditions
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
test
 
main
 
effects
 
of
 
components
 
and
 
their
 
interactions.
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
main
 
effect
 
of
 
calorie
 
goal
 
intensity
 
is
 
the
 
mean
 
for
 
the
 
participants
 
who
 
receive
 
the
 
easier
 
version
 
of
 
it
 
(i.e.,
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
1-8)
 
versus
 
the
 
mean
 
of
 
those
 
who
 
receive
 
the
 
harder
 
version
 
of
 
it
 
(i.e.,
 
conditions
 
9-16).

Recruitment
 
materials
 
will
 
direct
 
interested
 
individuals
 
to
 
an
 
online
 
screening
 
questionnaire
 
(REDCap)
 
that
 
describes
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
assesses
 
initial
 
eligibility.
 
Eligible
 
candidates
 
will
 
then
 
receive
 
an
 
email
 
invitation
 
to
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
an
 
initial
 
remote

At
 
this
 
visit,
 
trained
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
confirm
 
eligibility
 
and
 
describe
 
study
 
procedures.
 
If
 
individuals
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
participating,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
obtain

Next,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
help
 
participants
 
create
 
a
 
Fitbit
 
account,
 
and
 
administer
 
online
 
baseline
 
measures.
 
Once
 
completed,

will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
1
 
of
 
16
 
experimental
 
conditions

Screen
 
Failures
 
Participants
 
who
 
consent
 
but
 
then
 
become
 
ineligible
 
prior
 
to
 
randomization
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
randomized.
 
Examples
 
would
 
include
 
if
 
a
 
participant’s
 
baseline
 
weight
 
collected
 
via
 
the
 
study-issued
 
scale
 
(after
 
consenting)
 
puts
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
range
 
on
 
the
 
BMI
 
criterion
 
(i.e.,
  
no
 
longer
 
being
 
in
 
the
 
25.0-45.0
 
kg/m
2
 
range),
 
or
 
if
 
a
 
participant
 
reports
 
a

or
 
exclusionary
 
medical
 
condition
 
in
 
the
 
period

Withdrawal/Termination
 
Criteria
 
If
 
after
 
randomization
 
and
 
during
 
the
 
study
 
period
 
the
 
participant
 
no
 
longer
 
meets
 
certain
 
eligibility
 
criteria,
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
study.
 
This
 
includes
 
13
 
 
the
 
following:
 
if
 
a
 
participant
 
becomes
 
pregnant
 
during
 
the
 
study;
  
finding
 
out
 
that
 
certain
 
criteria
 
were
 
falsified
 
or
 
not
 
reported
 
(e.g.,
 
initial
 
age,
 
initial
 
BMI,
 
concurrent
 
enrollment
 
in
 
another
 
weight
 
management
 
intervention,
 
a
 
health
 
condition
 
that
 
contraindicates
 
weight
 
loss
 
or
 
requires
 
more
 
intensive
 
treatment),
 
or
  
investigator
 
discretion
 
for
 
safety
 
reasons.
 
Participants
 
who
 
become
 
pregnant
 
during
 
the

period
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
leave
 
the
 
study.
 
Changes
 
in
 
health
 
behaviors
 
and
 
weight
 
may
 
not
 
be

for
 
a
 
baby
 
during
 
pregnancy.
 
Note
 
that
 
if
 
a
 
participant
 
begins
 
use
 
of
 
an
 
antiobesity
 
medication
 
during
 
the

5%
 
weight
 
loss
 
by
 
10
 
weeks,
 
which
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
obesity
 
treatment
 
guidelines
 
and
 
equates
 
to
 
0.5-2
 
lbs
 
weight
 
loss/week.
 
 
Self-monitoring

window
 
(start
 
and
 
stop
 
times)
 
every
 
morning
 
via
 
a
 
brief
 
web-based
 
survey
 
(REDCap).
 
They

Foods
:
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
self-monitor
 
their
 
Red

Foods
 
(highly
 
caloric
 
foods
 
of
 
limited
 
nutritional
 
value,
 
such
 
as
 
ice
 
cream
 
and
 
soda)
 
via
 
a
 
brief
 
web-based
 
e-checklist
 
(REDCap).
 
They
 
will
 
receive
 
this
 
e-checklist
 
daily
 
in
 
weeks
 
1
 
and
 
10
 
and
 
weekly
 
in
 
weeks
 
2-9.
 
They
 
will
 
receive
 
immediate
 
feedback
 
as
 
to
 
whether
 
they
 
met
 
their
 
goal.
 
Tailored
 
feedback
:
 
Each
 
week,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
email
 
with
 
tailored
 
feedback
 
pertaining
 
to
 
their
 
progress
 
on
 
their
 
assigned
 
self-monitoring
 
goals
 
(described
 
below)
 
and

:
 
Each
 
week,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
email
 
with
 
theory-informed
 
skills
 
training
 
materials
 
that
 
include
 
structured
 
behavioral
 
lessons
 
on
 
nutrition
 
and
 
physical
 
activity
 
as

will
 
be
 
prompted
 
each
 
week
 
to
 
reflect
 
on
 
their
 
current
 
behaviors
 
and
 
areas
 
for

Outcomes
 
3.6.1
  
Overview
 
of
 
Measures
  
 
The
 
primary
 
outcomes
 
of
 
this
 
pilot
 
study
 
relate
 
to
 
the
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
of
 
the
 
various
 
goals
 
and
 
their
 
intensity
 
levels.
 
We
 
will
 
compare
 
these
 
outcomes
 
to
 
our
 
a
 
priori
 
benchmarks
 
listed
 
in
 
the
 
Table
 
below.
 
Additional
 
exploratory
 
outcomes
 
are
 
also
 
included
 
in
 
this
 
table,
 
and
 
marked
 
with
 
an
 
asterisk.
 
The
 
planned
 
primary
 
outcome
 
for
 
the
 
subsequent
 
fully-powered
 
optimization
 
trial
 
is
 
weight
 
change.
 
We
 
will
 
collect
 
data
 
on
 
weight
 
change
 
in
 
our
 
pilot
 
study.
 
Based
 
on
 
prior
 
research
 
of
 
digital
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions,
 
we
 
have
 
set
 
benchmarks
 
for
 
the
 
3%
 
and
 
5%
 
thresholds,
 
which
 
have
 
been
 
associated
 
with
 
improved
 
cardiometabolic
 
health.
 
We
 
will
 
measure
 
body
 
weight
 
using
 
smart
 
scales
 
(Fitbit
 
Aria
 
Air)
 
that
 
automatically
 
transmit
 
data
 
to
 
the
 
research
 
team.
 
The
 
smart
 
scales
 
will
 
be
 
mailed
 
to
 
participants.
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
with
 
best
 
practices
 
prior
 
to
 
each
 
weight
 
assessment:
 
calibrate
 
upon
 
arrival;
 
weigh
 
in
 
the
 
AM
 
without
 
clothing,
 
before
 
eating/drinking,
 
and
 
after
 
voiding.
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
administer
 
behavior
 
change
 
measures
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
subsequent
 
optimization
 
trial.
 
In
 
particular,
 
dietary
 
recalls
 
will
 
be
 
measured
 
using
 
the
 
Automated
 
24-Hour
 
(ASA-24)
 
Dietary
 
Assessment
 
Tool
 
and
 
physical
 
activity
 
will
 
be
 
measured
 
using
 
the
 
GLTEQ
 
self-report
 
measure
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
objectively
 
via
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
Inspire
 
3
 
activity
 
tracker
 
to
 
evaluate
 
step
 
count.
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
assess
 
perceived
 
ease
 
of
 
the
 
goals.

Weights
 
will
 
be
 
collected

e-scale,
 
self-monitoring
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
collected
 
objectively
 
by
 
the
 
digital

and
 
all
 
other
 
measures
 
will
 
be
 
collected
 
via
 
online
 
questionnaire
 
(REDCap
 
or
 
a
 
dietary

Fitabase
 
software
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
retrieve
 
the
 
objective
 
self-monitoring
 
data
 
via
 
Fitbit’s
 
API.
 
At
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
each
 
remote
 
evaluation,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
emailed
 
instructions
 
for
 
weighing
 
themselves
 
on
 
their
 
e-scales,
 
and
 
sent
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
the
 
online
 
survey
 
to
 
complete
 
measures.
 
Reminders
 
will
 
be
 
sent
 
if
 
weights
 
are
 
not
 
synced
 
or
 
surveys
 
not
 
completed.
 
3.7.1
 
Randomization
 
and
 
Masking
 
Following
 
recommendations
 
for
 
factorial
 
designs,
 
we
 
will
 
randomize
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
16
 
conditions
 
using
 
permuted
 
block
 
randomization
 
with
 
a
 
block
 
size
 
of
 
16.
 
The
 
20
 
 
allocation
 
sequence
 
will
 
be
 
generated
 
by
 
the
 
study’s
 
PI
 
and
 
stored
 
in
 
REDCap.
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
use
 
REDCap
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
random
 
allocation
 
sequence
 
(i.e.,
 
randomize
 
a
 
participant)
 
once
 
both
 
the
 
baseline
 
weight
 
and
 
web-based
 
surveys
 
are
 
submitted.
 
The
 
first
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
will
 
occur
 
approximately
 
two
 
days
 
after
 
randomization.
 
On
 
that
 
day,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
automated
 
email
 
describing
 
their
 
treatment
 
assignment.
 
Participants
 
will
 
not
 
masked
 
to
 
treatment
 
assignment.
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
masked
 
to
 
treatment
 
assignment
 
due
 
to
 
logistical
 
limitations
 
and
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
quality
 
assurance.
 
However,
 
all
 
surveys
 
will
 
be
 
sent
 
via
 
REDCap
 
and
 
completed
 
without
 
study
 
staff
 
involvement.
 
In
 
addition,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
not
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
allocation
 
sequence.
 
3.7.2
  
Quality
 
Assurance
 
Participants
 
enrolled
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
may
 
not
 
participate
 
in
 
other
 
research
 
studies
 
where
 
weight
 
loss
 
is
 
targeted.
 
In
 
addition,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
refrain
 
from
 
self-monitoring
 
behaviors
 
that
 
are
 
not
 
assigned
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
refrain
 
from
 
using
 
any
 
other
 
weight-related
 
apps
 
or
 
activity
 
trackers
 
for
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
trial.
 
By
 
explaining
 
the
 
rationale
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
prior
 
to
 
enrollment
 
and
 
setting
 
expectations
 
upfront,
 
we
 
hope
 
to
 
keep
 
compliance
 
with
 
these
 
instructions
 
high.

Sample

Aligning
 
with
 
recommendations
 
for
 
conducting
 
pilot
 
studies,
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
our
 
proposed
 
pilot
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
assess
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
no
 
power
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
conducted.
 
The
 
sample
 
size
 
(n=32)
 
was
 
selected
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
number
 
of
 
participants
 
(n=2)
 
per
 
condition
 
and
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
meet
 
budget
 
and
 
time
 
restrictions.
 
 
3.9
  
Statistical
 
Analysis
 
We
 
will
 
use
 
descriptive
 
data
 
to
 
assess
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
outcomes,
 
and
 
will
 
compare
 
them
 
to
 
our
 
a
 
priori
 
feasibility
 
benchmarks,
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
Table
 
above.
 
To
 
evaluate
 
exploratory
 
changes
 
in
 
efficacy
 
outcomes
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
evaluated
 
in
 
a
 
larger-scale
 
trial,
 
we
 
will
 
descriptively
 
assess
 
the
 
main
 
effects
 
of
 
each
 
goal-setting
 
component
 
being
 
tested,
 
along
 
with
 
their
 
interactions.
 
Unlike
 
in
 
an
 
RCT
 
that
 
compares
 
the
 
means
 
of
 
each
 
treatment
 
arm
 
to
 
one
 
another,
 
a
 
factorial
 
trial
 
compares
 
the
 
means
 
across
 
combinations
 
of
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
and
 
uses
 
the
 
entire
 
sample,
 
which
 
makes
 
it
 
an
 
efficient
 
and
 
economical
 
study
 
design.
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
main
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
Calorie
 
Goal
 
intensity
 
is
 
calculated
 
by
 
computing
 
the
 
mean
 
for
 
the
 
participants
 
who
 
receive
 
the
 
harder
 
goal
 
(i.e.,
 
those
 
in
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
9-16
 
in
 
the
 
Table
 
above)
 
versus
 
the
 
mean
 
of
 
those
 
who
 
22
 
 
receive
 
the
 
easier
 
goal
 
(i.e.,
 
those
 
in
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
1-8),
 
collapsed
 
across
 
the
 
other
 
factors.
 
In
 
a
 
subsequent
 
optimization
 
trial,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
powered
 
to
 
detect
 
these
 
effects.

will
 
be
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight/obesity
 
who
 
are
 
otherwise
 
healthy.
 
Individuals
 
who
 
are
 
pregnant
 
or
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
that
 
would
 
limit
 
participation
 
in
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
or
 
be
 
better
 
suited
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
intensive
 
or
 
different
 
type
 
of
 
intervention
 
are
 
excluded
 
from
 
our
 
trial
 
(e.g.,
 
individuals
 
with
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
an
 
eating
 
disorder
 
or
 
cardiovascular
 
event,
 
uncontrolled
 
diabetes
 
mellitus
 
or
 
hypertension,
 
cancer,
 
dementia).
 
Healthy
 
volunteers
 
are
 
included
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
any
 
complications
 
that
 
could
 
arise
 
from
 
participation
 
in
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
that
 
is
 
of
 
lower
 
intensity
 
and
 
remotely
 
delivered.
 
Risks
 
to
 
participants
 
are
 
anticipated
 
to
 
be
 
low
 
given
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
examining
 
evidence-based
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
and
 
promoting
 
weight
 
loss
 
through
 
lifestyle
 
change
 
(e.g.,
 
decrease
 
intake
 
of
 
unhealthy
 
foods,
 
increase
 
steps).
 
We
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
including
 
a
 
vulnerable
 
population
 
(e.g.,
 
children,
 
pregnant
 
women)
 
as
 
participants.
 
To
 
ensure
 
participant
 
safety
 
in
 
this
 
study,
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
screening
 
procedures
 
that
 
are
 
common
 
in
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions,
 
such
 
as
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
are
 
safe
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
moderate
 
intensity
 
physical
 
activity
 
and
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
that
 
is
 
contraindicated
 
in
 
a
 
remote
 
weight
 
loss
 
program
 
will
 
be
 
employed.
 
The
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
–
 
including
 
moderate-intensity
 
physical
 
activity
 
and
 
dietary
 
change
 
through
 
reduction
 
of
 
unhealthy
 
foods
 
and
 
increase
 
of
 
healthy
 
foods
 
–
 
is
 
commensurate
 
with
 
the
 
current
 
national
 
guidelines
 
for
 
behavioral
 
obesity
 
treatment.

interest,
 
and
 
understanding
 
of
 
study
 
procedures
 
and
 
assigned
 
intervention
 
components.
 
During
 
this
 
call,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to

team.
 
25
 
 
 
The
 
RA
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
source
 
of
 
contact
 
with
 
participants
 
(e.g.,
 
sending
 
intervention
 
materials
 
and
 
survey
 
measures
 
via
 
email).
 
The
 
RA
 
will
 
alert
 
the
 
PI
 
of
 
any

Based
 
on
 
participant
 
feedback,
 
the
 
PI
 
will
 
revise
 
the
 
intervention
 
and
 
study
 
procedures
 
as
 
necessary
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
risks
 
of
 
injury

5)
 
presenting
 
study
 
findings
 
in
 
aggregate
 
in
 
publications,
 
presentations,
 
and
 
all
 
other

efforts.
 
Investigators
 
will
 
be
 
sensitive
 
to
 
issues
 
surrounding
 
confidentiality
 
and
 
other
 
forms
 
of
 
participant
 
risk,
 
including
 
discomfort
 
surrounding
 
talking
 
about
 
personal
 
health
 
issues
 
and
 
behaviors.
  
The
 
study
 
team's
 
onboarding
 
will
 
include
 
a
 
discussion
 
of
 
confidentiality
 
and
 
how
 
this
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
maintained
 
throughout
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
the
 
study.
 
All
 
staff
 
will
 
have
 
taken
 
the
 
required
 
online
 
human
 
subjects
 
course
 
on
 
this
 
topic
 
(e.g.,
 
CITI
 
training).
 
In
 
addition,
 
this
 
topic
 
will
 
be
 
regularly
 
addressed
 
during
 
weekly
 
staff
 
meetings
 
where
 
staff
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to
 
ask
 
questions
 
pertaining
 
to
 
this
 
issue.
 
 
 
27
 
 
All
 
study
 
procedures
 
will
 
occur
 
through
 
remote

Eligibility
 
screening
 
will
 
initially
 
occur
 
via
 
REDCap
 
questionnaire,
 
and
 
confirmed
 
by
 
study
 
personnel
 
via
 
1:1
 
phone
 
or
 
Zoom
 
conversation.
 
Communications
 
about
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
obtaining

consent
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
conducted
 
individually
 
via
 
phone
 
or
 
Zoom
 
with
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
team.
 
These
 
communications
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
by
 
a
 
study
 
staff
 
member
 
who
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
private,
 
closed

Participants
 
will
 
be
 
requested
 
to
 
complete
 
these
 
sessions
 
in
 
a
 
private,
 
closed
 
room
 
when
 
possible
 
to
 
protect
 
their

Only
 
study
 
team
 
members
 
will
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
email
 
account
 
and

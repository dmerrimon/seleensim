Planned trial period:  
First Patient  First Visit: Sep tember  2018  
Last Patient  Last Visit: Second quarter  2019  Phase of development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective is to demonstrate that dasiglucagon is superior to placebo following a single 
injection of 0.6  mg of dasiglucagon in treating hypoglycemia in children  with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM ). 
Secondary objectives are:  
 To confirm  that a single dose of dasiglucagon [0.6  mg] is comparable to a single  dose of GlucaGen® 
[1 mg/mL] in treating hypoglycemia in children  with T1DM,  (in accordance with the label, children 
below 25 kg body weight will be administered 0.5 mg GlucaGen®), 
 To assess safety profile of dasiglucagon in children  with T1DM,  
 To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile of dasiglucagon in children  with T1DM.  
Trial  design:  
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled, parallel -arm trial 
designed to assess efficacy, safety and PK of dasiglucagon vs. placebo and vs . GlucaGen® in 
children with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) . Patients will receive a single subcutaneous injection of 
the investigational product during a hypoglycemic clamp procedure. Handling, preparation and 
administration of trial product  will be done by unblinded trial personnel. All trial assessments will be 
done by blinded trial personnel.  
The trial design is illustrated in the figure below.

Statistical methods:  
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ) will be listed 
and summarized with statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all 
data collected up to that time will be included into the analysis.  
Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and 
maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. Categorical 
efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of patients in 
corresponding categories . The primary endpoint, time to recovery, will be summarized using Kaplan -
Meier estimates for each treatment group in total and stratified by age intervals  and injection site. The 
median time to recovery with 95% confidence interval will be estimated by trea tment group.  
Log-rank tests will be applied to compare the 2 treatment groups to the placebo group.  
In the primary analysis, recovery cannot be achieved in those patient s where IV glucose treatment is 
administered. Those patient s who receive IV glucose wil l be censored (i.e. set to ‘not recovered’) at 45 
minutes after dosing.  
All safety data will be analy zed with descriptive methods.  
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after medical coding using 
the Medical Dictio nary f or Regulatory Activities . AE summary tables will include counts and percentages 
of patients who experienced AEs summarized by SOC and PT.  
Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations will be described and PK metrics determined.  
AUE 0-30min will be summarized with descriptive statistic s. 
Sample size calculation:  
The primary comparison is between the dasiglucagon and placebo treatment arms. From phase 2  
results , the median time to an increase of 20  mg/dL of the 0.6  mg dose was approximately 10

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9/55 minutes . For placebo -treated patient s, the median time to recovery is assumed to be more than 50 
minutes. Assuming an exponential time -to-recovery distribution with median times of 10 and 50 
minutes, a 2-sided log -rank test will be able to detect a difference between dasiglucagon 0.6  mg and 
placebo with 9 0% power with a follow -up time of 45 minutes at a 5% significance level with 20 
patient s randomized to the dasiglucagon arm and 10 patient s to placebo . Gluca Gen® is included as a 
reference to compare  the respon ses and AE profile to  dasiglucagon with those to  a marketed product. 
It is expected that 10 patients in the  Gluca Gen® group  will suffice for the comparison.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17/55 5. Introduction  
5.1 Background of the trial 
Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes is defined as episodes of an abnormally low plasma 
glucose concentration .9 This is a common, unpredictable , and potential ly dangerous side  effect 
of treatment of diabetes mellitus with especially  insulin or sulfonylureas. It is more frequent in 
patients with profoun d endogenous insulin deficiency, such as occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM)  and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment of type 2 diabet es mellitus with insulin 
causes hypoglycemia progressively and more frequently over time, whereas in T1D M, 
hypoglycemia is experienced throughout the course of established disease.  
Symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific. Patients undergoing a hypoglycemic 
episode experience unpleasant symptoms such as  anxiety, sweating, hunger, tremors, 
palpitations , paresthesia, nausea and pallor. Depending on its severity, the hypoglycemia may 
lead to mild confusion, behavioral changes, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma , and death.1  
The incidence of hypoglycemic events or even the fear of hypoglycemia influences patients’  
adherence to prescribed treatment regimens  for diabetes mellitus . This leads to inadequate 
glycemic  control, which in turn may lead to an increased risk of diabetic complications.  
Glucagon  
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone, secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. 
Glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeosta sis and is the counterpart of 
insulin for controlling blood glucose levels  (i.e. it acts in opposition to insulin in terms of effects on 
blood glucose levels ). Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in 
hypoglycemic states, thereby restoring glucose homeostasis. Glucagon receptor agonism has 
also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, body adipose tissue mass 
and food intake.   
Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and cases of hypoglycemia can be reversed by glucagon. 
Therefore , glucagon is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  
Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon (ZP 4207 ) is a stable p eptide analog of human  glucagon, available in a ready -to-
use liquid formulation  and is  in development  for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in insulin 
dependent patients with diabetes mellitus . Dasiglucagon  is a specific and full glucagon receptor 
agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and elimination 
(minutes).  It is a peptide  of 29 amino acids , with 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native 
glucagon. The main purpos e of the substitutions is to increase the physical and chemical stability 
of the glucagon analog compared to marketed glucagon products such as Lilly ´s Glucagon or 
GlucaGen®. Dasiglucagon exhibits improved physical and chemical stability and is available i n an 
aqueous solution at neutral pH.2 
Five clinical trials have been completed  with dasiglucagon:  A first human dose trial  (ZP4207 -
14013 ), a multiple -dose  dose -escalation trial (ZP4207 -15007 ) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dasiglucagon , a phase 2 crossover trial 
to assess  the PK and PD of a single dose of an optimized formulation of dasiglucagon 
admin istered subcutaneously  (SC) in patients with T1DM  (ZP4207 -15126) , and a feasibility trial 
testing the bionic pancreas w ith dasiglucagon  was completed ( ZP4207 -16051 ).2 Finally,  a cross -
over trial (ZP4207 -16098 ) assessing PK and PD responses after micro -doses of dasiglucagon 
administered SC to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus under euglycemic and hypog lycemic 
conditions , compared to marketed glucagon , was completed.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18/55 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dasiglucagon  
The results of the phase 1 and 2 clinical trials confirm dose -proportionality for dasiglucagon PK, 
which is characterized  by a fast absorption with a peak plasma concentration obtained after 35 
minutes. Thereafter, the plasma concentration rapidly declines with an average half -life of 28 
minutes. The median time to the maximum plasma concentration (C max) was later for 
dasigl ucagon than for GlucaGen® (35 versus 20 minutes). For Cmax, the results indicated that 
0.3 mg dasiglucagon was comparable to 0.5  mg GlucaGen® (90% confidence interval : 0.8167; 
1.0068) and 0.6  mg dasiglucagon was comparable to 1.0  mg GlucaGen® (90% confiden ce 
interva I: 0.8850; 1.1991).2 At these dose levels, the total exposures (AUC 0-inf) were higher for 
dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen®. 
At all dose levels in the phase 2 trial, all patients achieved a plasma glucose level of at least 
70 mg/dL as well as an increase in plasma glucose by at least 20  mg/dL within 30 min utes post-
dose. The maximal observed time to reach the 20  mg/dL plasma glu cose increase ranged from 
15 to 27  minutes across doses and decreased as the dose increased. The PD responses of 
0.6 mg of dasiglucagon and 1.0  mg of GlucaGen® were comparable .2 
Safety of dasiglucagon  
The safety data for dasiglucagon did not give rise to any relevant safety concerns for dasiglucagon 
beyond those  expected,  related to the pharmacological effect of glucagon receptor agonism . All 
adverse events (AEs) recorded in the trials were of mild or moderate severity. The most frequent ly 
reported systemic AE was nausea, which is a known side effect following administration of 
glucagon. Headache was the next most frequently reported event, occurring in all dose gr oups in 
the phase 2 trial. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after administration with 
either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® and all were mild and transient. The most frequent injection 
site reaction was erythema, occurring in all treatme nt groups, including the placebo group, 
irrespective of dose.  Therefore,  the phase 1 and 2 results and the safety profile described to date 
do not give rise to specific safety concerns.  For further information, please refer to  the Investigator 
Brochure.2  
Immunogenicity of dasiglucagon  
In adults, anti -drug antibodies (ADA) have been assessed in the completed clinical trials. In one 
of the 5 completed clinical tr ials (ZP4207 -16098) 1 transient ADA incidence have been detected 
in one T1DM  patient. The antibodies were able to bind to dasiglucagon and glucagon confirming 
the cross -reactivity potential found in the non -clinical toxicity studies (IND 135869 Section 
2.4.4.6). The antibodies were also capable of neutralizing the in vitro activity of both dasiglucagon 
and glucagon, but could not be associated with any AEs or effects on PK or PD in the patient . 
The trial was a multiple dose trial and completers had received  a total of 11 investigational drug 
administrations (8 injections of dasiglucagon and 3 injections of recombinant glucagon) (IND 
135869 Section 2.5.6.3) and indicate d that increased exposure will likely increase the risk of ADA 
formation. However, due to t he crossover trial design, the induction of ADA cannot be decisively 
attributed to either dasiglucagon or glucagon treatment. The ADA incidence in that trial was 4.3% 
and considered low. From the long -term non -clinical toxicology studies, the detection of antibodies 
was not associated with a change in toxicity profile compared to ADA negative animals. In the 13 - 
and 26 -week rat studies, an increase in exposure was observed in dose groups ≥8 mg/kg/day, 
which correlates with the dose groups with the highest f requency of ADA -positive animals. So far, 
these findings have not been observed in humans.  
The consequences of an immune response towards endogenous glucagon is not fully known. In 
a recent review summarizing the current physiology of glucagon and learning s from recent 
glucagon antagonist research, it was concluded that although glucagon is an important hormone 
for controlling postprandial glucose levels, it was not essential for the maintenance of fasting 
glucose and glucagon antagonism did not cause hypog lycemia .5 Rather, the lack of glucagon 
signaling induced imbalance in amino acid metabolism leading to elevated amino acid plasma

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19/55 levels. As excess  levels of amino acids can be excreted by the kidneys and the detected ADA 
incidence have been transient, the impact is not considered a major risk for the trial population . 
The overall immunogenicity risk of dasiglucagon in a clinical context is therefore  considered low 
and the potential effects of induced ADAs judged to be of limited clinical consequence.   
5.2 Trial rationale  
The SC bolus dose of 0.6  mg dasiglucagon that is the most appropriate dosing to ensure rapid 
rescue from hypoglycemia in adults appears to be appropriate also in children 6 years old and 
above.  
To simulate the potential PK/PD response in children, a previously developed population PK/PD 
model for dasiglucagon was updated with an allometric PK component derived from published 
glucagon pediatric data from weight groups of 25.4±5.2, 43.2±8.9, and 61.2±13.8  kg (mean±SD) 
and adults. The simulations suggested that a 0.3  mg SC bolus dose o f dasiglucagon would result 
in a slightly slower increase of blood glucose compared to the 0.6  mg dose in the 3 pediatric body 
weight groups. Considering the intended clinical indication of treating patient s for severe 
hypoglycemia where time to PD response is considered essential, the 0.3  mg dose appears less 
attractive than the 0.6  mg dose.  
The higher total drug exposure (AUC and C max) predicted in children at lower body weight, relative 
to that observed i n adults at a dose of 0.6  mg, is within the tolerable exposure achieved in adults 
administered 2.0  mg dasiglucagon, and the duration of exposure is truncated due to a shorter t ½ 
in children . In addition, rapid saturation of the PD response results in simil ar total and maximum 
glucose response (AUE and CE max) throughout the body weight range from 25 to 77 kg.  
Based on all data generated to date across 4 clinical trials performed in adults receiving 
dasiglucagon at different dose levels, no clear dose -respon se for nausea and vomiting was 
observed above a certain threshold. It is therefore not expected that the intensity and frequency 
of nausea and vomiting at a dose of 0.6  mg will differ between adults and children/adolescents. 
This expectation is further con sistent with results of the recently conducted trial ZP4207 -16098 in 
adults with T1DM, which indicated a similar degree of nausea and vomiting at SC bolus doses of 
0.2 and 0.6  mg dasiglucagon.   
5.3 Assessment of anticipated benefits and risks  
Glucagon emer gency kits are often underutiliz ed in the treatment of patien ts experiencing severe 
hypoglyc emia. Considering the seriousness and potential complications that  can arise from 
severe hypoglyc emic episodes, it is essential that parents and caregivers receive ade quate, 
hands on training for use of glucagon rescue kits to ensure safe, timely, and effective 
administration. Given the challenges with parent/caregiver training and use of current glucagon 
products, Zealand Pharma A/S is developing dasiglucagon as a read y to use rescu e treatment 
for severe hypoglyc emia. The development of dasiglucagon will provide parents and caregivers 
of children with diabetes mellitus a more efficient alternative for t he treatment of severe 
hypoglyc emia. The ready -to-use kit addresses an unmet need and may potentially prove to be 
life-saving.  
As glucagon and its analogs belong to a well -known drug class with a known mode of action, 
dasiglucagon is not expected to be a high -risk molecule.  
Treatment wi th an investigational medicinal product may result in undesired effects or complaints. 
Undesired effects and complaints such as nausea  and vomiting are known AEs occurring with  
glucagon administration. Similar AEs have also been observed to a limited degre e in the 5 clinical 
studies  conducted with dasiglucagon.  As with every novel drug substance, new and yet unknown 
side effects also may occur.  
There are limited data available to assess the immunogenic potential of glucagon products 
available on the market,  but the data available indicate that marketed glucagon only has a small

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20/55 immunogenic potential. Based on the 5 clinical studies completed  with dasiglucagon  to date (see 
Section 5.2), no anti -dasiglucagon or anti -glucagon antibodies have been detected , except for 
trial ZP4207 -16098, in which there was one transient low titer ADA incidence showing reactivity 
towards both dasiglucagon and glucagon. The patient was tested positive for both anti -
dasiglucagon and anti -glucagon antibodies at the follow -up visit, 24 days after the last drug 
exposure (titer: 35.4 and 33.8, respectively). The patient was also found to be positive for 
dasiglucagon and glucagon in vitro  neutralizing activities. The titer of anti -dasiglucagon activity 
was equal to the assay minimum required dilution. Due to the crossover nature of this trial, the 
induction of ADAs could not be associated with a specif ic treatment. Testing perform ed 3.5 
months after last dosing  confirmed a positive finding for anti -dasiglucagon antibodies (titer of 
38.8), while the test was negative for anti -glucagon antibodies. At a final follow -up visit performed 
7 months after last d osing, the patient was negative for anti -dasiglucagon antibodies. There was 
no evidence for altered PK, PD, or safety profile for this patient . 
Administration of dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions similar to those 
observed for  other therapeutic peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected allergies to 
the trial products  or related products will be excluded from the trial. Mild or moderate allergic 
reactions may include symptoms of rash, fever, flu -like symptoms, nause a, headache, and 
myalgia. Acute generalized hypersensitivity reactions are usually very rare but may include 
symptoms of flushing, sweating, dizziness, change in blood pressure and difficulties in breathing. 
No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the 4 clinical trials conducted 
with dasiglucagon . Direct access to resuscitation equipment is ensured at the clinical trial center s. 
With the exception of medical examinations, a patient  participating in this trial is not likely to derive 
any personal health -related benefits. The results of the trial may contribute to the future use of 
dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing severe hypoglycemic  reactions . 
Overall, the benefit to risk ratio for p atients entering the ZP4207 -17086  trial is considered 
acceptable.

7.1 Overall trial design and plan  
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled, parallel -arm trial 
designed to assess efficacy, safety and PK of dasiglucagon vs. placebo and vs. GlucaGen® in 
children with T1D M. It is currently anticipated that it will be conducted at 2 -3 centers  in Europe 
and 1 -2 centers  in the US A. 
The trial will include the following periods (as illustrated in Figure 7-1, below).  
 A screening period from Day  -30 to Day  -3 
 A treatment period, from Day  0 to Day  1 (day of randomization  and single dosing with trial 
product ). Unblinded trial personnel will do the handling, preparation and administration of trial 
product . All trial assessments will be done by blinded trial personnel  
 A follow -up visits at Day  28 (the end-of-trial visit)

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24/55 7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups  
The trial will be randomized and double -blind to increase trial validity and to reduce bias during 
evaluation of assessments with the treatments. Since the  3 trial products  are not identical in 
appearance,  (dasiglucagon  and placebo are  liquid formulation s and GlucaGen® is available as a 
powder for reconstitution), unblinded trial personnel , who will not be involved in other trial 
procedures and assessments , will do the handling, preparation and administration of trial product . 
Blinded trial personnel will do all trial assessments performed at the trial center .    
Children  with T1DM will be randomized 2:1:1 in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
dasiglucagon compared to  placebo and  GlucaGen® and PK/PD parameters . The ran domized, 
double -blind, parallel arm design with administration of a single  dose of randomized trial product  
(dasiglucagon , placebo  or GlucaGen®) will allow a relative comparison between the  3 treatment 
arms . 
Dasiglucagon will be administered at  fixed doses independent of body weight because  this is the 
intended therapeutic dosing regimen in the emergency treatment of hypoglycemia. The selected 
dose of 1  mg GlucaGen® is the recommended dose for treatment of severe hypoglycemia  (in 
accordance with  the label, children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 0.5 mg 
GlucaGen®). Based on pre -clinical and clinical studies  in adult patients , it has been demonstrated  
that 0.6  mg of dasiglucagon results in an initial PD response (i.e. acute glucose mobilization) 
comparable to 1  mg GlucaGen® (see also Section 5.1).  
7.3 Selection of trial population  
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. As this 
condition also affects children and there is a therapeutic need for them to get access to safe and 
efficacious emergency treatment , the present trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of a 
single dose  of SC dasiglucagon compared to placebo and GlucaGen® in children  with T1DM  in 
experimentally induced hypoglycemia in a hypoglycemic clamp procedure.   
The trial will enroll patients in centers in the EU  and in the US A.

7.3.3  Premature withdrawal  from trial 
Participation in the trial is strictly voluntary. A patient  has the right to withdraw from the trial at any 
time and for any reason . If the child chooses to withdraw or his/her parents or legal guardian s 
choose to have the child withdrawn , the investigator must be informed immediately. The 
investigator has the right to terminate participation of any patient  at any time if the investigator 
deems it in the patient 's best interest. The reason and circumstanc es for withdrawal will be 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
7.3.3.1  Possible reasons for patient withdrawal  
A patient will be withdrawn  if the following applies:  
 If a protocol deviation occurs which , in the clinical j udgment of the investigator , can invalidate 
the trial endpoints , the patient will be  withdrawn by the investigator  
 AEs that are considered unacceptable by the patient  or the investigator  
If withdrawal  occurs following administration of any trial product , the patient  will be asked to  return 
and participate in the  complete follow -up visit at trial Day 28. In this case, withdrawal  relates only 
to blood sampling but not to the safety assessments. P atients should be followed for AEs for the 
same duration as those who are not withdrawn . 
If trial participation is terminated due to an AE possibly related to the trial product  (including 
reference product ) or trial examinations, the patient must be followed  up by additional 
examinations according to the medical judgment of the investigator un til the abnormal condition 
is resolved or the investigator deems further observations or examinations to be no longer 
medically indicated.

he/she will be e xcluded from the dosing visit  but may be rescheduled once 1 -7 days later.  
7.3.3.2  Center discontinuation  
The center can be closed and the trial terminated for the following reasons:  
 The center is unlikely to be able to recruit sufficient patients within the agreed  time frame  
 The center does not respond to trial management requests  
 Repeat protocol violations  
However, even in case of center discontinuation the center should be kept open as long as 
previously enrolled patients are ongoing. Patients already enrolled sh ould be followed and 
documented for the ir entire  individual trial duration  before actually discontinuing the center.  
7.3.3.3  Trial  termination  
The sponsor reserves the right to modify or terminate the trial at any time. Possible reasons for 
termination are:  
 Safety  reasons – the incidence of AEs in this or any other trial using the same trial product  
indicates a potential health risk for the patient s 
 New scientific knowledge becomes known that makes the obj ectives of the trial no longer 
feasible/valid  
 Unsatisfactory  enrol lment of patients

provided for this trial will be stored in the fridge, in a secure area with restricted access at the trial cente r. 
The trial product s ready for use should be separated from any other clinical supplies, to avoid product  
errors.  
The temperature should be monitored  by recording the actual, minimum, and maximum temperatures 
using a calibrated thermometer or thermocouple, or by continuous recording using a qualified 
temperature monitoring system. The temperature should be evaluated and documented at least on 
working d ays on a temperature log. This log must be included in the Investigator Site File upon trial 
termination.  
The unblinded person responsible for trial product  handling must contact the unblinded monitor in case 
of temperature deviations outside the acceptabl e range.  
Please see the trial materials  manual for additional information on handling trial product . 
 
7.4.5  Investigational treatment and dosing conditions  
7.4.5.1  Changes  to diabetes management prior to dosing  visit 
At the screening visit, patient s will be instructed  by the investigator about the changes in their 
diabetes treatment leading up to and immediately prior to the dosing visits. There should not be 
any changes in their diabetes management until 3 days (72 hours) prior to the planned trial 
product  administrat ion except to switch to NPH insulin. The investigator  will provide individual  
dosing instructions  for this change . Within 72 hours prior to dosing, the use of insulin degludec or 
insulin glargine U300 is prohibited. Within 48 hours prior to dosing, the use  of long -acting insulin 
(e.g. insulin glargine U100 or insulin detemir) is prohibited. Within 22 hours prior to dosing, the 
use of insulin NPH is prohibited. Within 12 hours prior to dosing, the use of any short acting (bolus) 
insulin, except insulin gluli sine (Apidra®) is prohibited. During the insulin -induced hypoglycemic 
procedure, continuous SC insulin infusion must be stopped.  
7.4.5.2  Dosing visit  
Patient s will be admitted to the clinic with their parents in the evening of the day before dosing 
(Day 0 ). Their eligibility for the trial will be checked, and only those still eligible will continue and 
remain in the clinic overnight.  
If the patient  meets any of the exclusion criteria at clinic admission on Visit 2, day 0 , he/she will 
be excluded from the dosing vi sit but may be rescheduled once 1 -7 days later.  
An infusion catheter will be inserted into each arm for the manual glucose clamp procedure, with 
the glucose infusion in one arm and the insulin infusion in the opposite arm  preferably, but the 
same infusion catheter can also be used . Another  IV catheter , separated from infusion catheter(s),  
for blood sampling will be placed in the morning before trial product  administration. The hand of 
this arm will be warmed (55 -65 ºC) to arterialize venous blood. If there are issues with blood 
sampling from e.g. the metacarpal vein for the purpose of glucose measurements, the investigator 
may use a new and more proximal IV access.  
On the morning of the dosing day (Day 1), patient s are required to be in a fasting condition, 
defined as having consumed only water since 22:00 hours the night before. They may consume 
water ad libitum. The patient s must not consume any alcohol or smoke within 24 hours prior to 
dosing.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30/55 7.4.5.2.1  Diabetes management  
Last injection or bolus administration via continuous SC insulin i nfusion  of any insulin medication  
should not take place within the 12 hours before dosing. Patient s normally using insulin aspart 
will be switched to human soluble insulin or glulisine for the period between 12 and 10 hours prior 
to dosing, if needed. Patient s using continuous SC insulin i nfusion  will have their pump switched 
off at 22:00 hours.  
To achieve a target glucose level of 90 -160 mg/dL (5.0 -8.9 mmol /L) in the morning of dosing, 
patient s may be administered insulin glulisine and/or glucose at the discretion of the investigator  
by IV infusion using the following glucose infusion rate and insulin infusion rate as a guidance. 
Deviation from the guidance is allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Plasma glucose  levels 
will be checked overnight at regular intervals in order to achieve and maintain the target plasma 
glucose  level of 90 -160 mg/dL (5.0 -8.9 mmol /L). 
A general guidance for administration of insulin IV and/or g lucose IV at the dosing visit  
Fluid infusion rate:  
If plasma glucose < 300  mg/dL, then infusion of isotonic solution with 5% glucose:  
 Age 6–10 years: 80 mL/kg/24 h  
 Age >10 years: 60 mL/kg/24 h  
If plasma glucose > 300 mg/dL the glucose infusion will be substituted with fluid volume of normal 
saline (0.9% NaCl)  at same infusion rate as above.  
Infusion of insulin:  
Insulin  infusions should be performed with  0.5 IU insulin glulisine (Apidra®) per kg body weight  in 
48 mL NaCl 0.9% according to the following recommendations : 
Glucose  Infusion rate  Insulin dose (IU/kg  BW/h)

7.4.5.2.2  Hypoglycemic clamp procedure and dosing  
At the time of admission to the clinic, which is the day before clamp procedure , the patient ’s 
eligibility must be checked. If the patient  meets any of the exclusion criteria  at the time of 
admission to the clinic  at V2 , he/she will be excluded from the dosing visit  but may be rescheduled 
once 1 -7 days  later.  
Eligible patient s will be randomized to either dasiglucagon, placebo or GlucaGen® in the morning 
of the dosing visit . That morning  after 7 o’clock am, the infusion of IV glucose will be stopped. 
This should be at least 30 min utes prior to planned trial prod uct administration. Insulin infusion 
rate and insulin dose are at the discretion of the investigator or can follow the protocol general 
guidance (see above). The investigator may deviate  from the guidance. Insulin IV infusion will be 
stopped when glucose l evel declines to below 80  mg/dL. 
During insulin -induced hypoglycemia, plasma glucose levels will be monitored closely at the site. 
After the start of insulin infusion, plasma glucose should be checked  approximately every 10 
minutes while plasma glucose is above 110 m g/dL, approximately every 5 minutes once plasma 
glucose is at or below 110 mg/dL , until after dosing , when the patien t’s plasma glucose returns to  
≥70 mg/dL (3.9  mmol/L).  From that time on , plasma glucose should be checked approximately 
every 30  minutes until 300  minutes (5  hours) after dosing. Plasma glucose concentrations will be 
measured using the US FDA -approved glucose analyzer YSI 2300, Yellow Springs Instruments,

Germany.  
At the discretion of the investigator, additional plasma glucose measurements can be taken at 
any time during the trial, for example when there is a suspicion (e.g. symptoms) of a hypoglycemic 
episode.  
Plasma glucose measurements for safety should only be recorded in the eCRF if they are related 
to an AE (e.g. a hypoglycemic episode).  
In case of persistent post -treatment hypoglycemia, patient s will receive rescue treatment with an 
IV glucose infusion (see Section 7.4.5.2.3  for details). Blood samples for PD and PK assessments 
should still be taken at the specified time  points . 
Once the glucose concentration declines to <80  mg/dL, blood samples for baseline assessment 
of plasma glucose and dasiglucagon/GlucaGen PK will be collected 5 min utes later. The samples 
are the baseline samples and should be collected within 2 -5 minutes before tria l product 
administration. If plasma glucose is ≥54  mg/dL and <80  mg/dL (3.0 -4.4 mmol /L), trial product will 
be administered.  
If plasma glucose is <54  mg/dL (3.0  mmol /L), IV glucose solution will be administered sufficient 
to raise plasma glucose to within the 54 -80 mg/dL target range. The run -in period will be 
adequately extended (at least 30 min utes) until the above target is achieved and new baseline 
samples for plasma glucose, dasiglucagon/GlucaGen PK, will be collected.  In this case, glucose 
should not be infused within 10 minutes before trial product administration. If plasma glucose is 
not within the target range after the second attempt, the patient  should be rescheduled for a new 
treatment visit within 7 days (+ 2 days).  
After 60 minutes, patient s will be allowed to eat and drink moderately (appropriate to their body 
size, with a maximum of 50gr carbohydrate s) to minimize discomfort in terms of potential nausea. 
The amount and type of food and drink consumed will be recorded . Patient s should remain in  bed 
until completion of the test procedure 300 minutes after dosing  (bathroom visits are allowed).  
7.4.5.2.3  Rescue p rovisions  for hypoglycemia  
During insulin -induced hypoglycemia, plasma glucose levels as well as the patient  status will be 
monitored closely throug hout the procedure. After administration of trial product , if their glucose 
levels become too low, patient s may receive post -treatment IV glucose infusion to ameliorate 
hypoglycemia, as follows:  
1. The IV glucose infusion should be initiated if a patient  experiences escalating symptoms of 
hypoglycemia (e.g. start of moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia) at any time during the test 
procedure. Glucose infusion should then be initiated targeting a plasma glucose level 
>70 mg/dL 
2. If plasma glucose is <54  mg/dL be tween t=8 and t=44 minutes, glucose infusion (e.g. 
1-2 mg/kg administered over 5 -10 seconds) should be initiated to maintain plasma glucose 
between 55  mg/dL and 70  mg/dL. Pause glucose infusion if plasma glucose is >70  mg/dL 
3. If plasma glucose is <70  mg/dL at t≥45 minutes, glucose infusion (e.g. 2 -3 mg/kg 
administered over 5 -10 seconds) should be initiated to maintain plasma glucose between 
70 mg/dL and 90  mg/dL. Pause glucose infusion if plasma glucose is >80  mg/dL 
7.4.6  Selection of doses in the trial 
The select ed dose of 1  mg GlucaGen® is the recommended dose for treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia  (in accordance with the label, children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 
0.5 mg GlucaGen®). Pre-clinical and adult clinical studies  demonstrated  that 0.6  mg of 
dasiglucagon results in an initial PD response (i.e. acute glucose mobilization) comparable to 
1 mg GlucaGen®.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32/55 The estimation of the dasiglucagon dose in the pediatric trial is based on a PK and PD approach6 
where a previously developed pop ulation  PK/PD model3 for dasiglucagon was extended with an 
allometric scaling component for the PK model4. The PD resp onse was assumed to be similar  in 
pediatric and a dult patients as organ maturation for patients above 4 years is assumed not to 
have a meanin gful impact on dasiglucagon PD. The pediatric PK component was developed by 
allometric scaling of clearance (Cl ) and volume (V) by body  weight from published glucag on PK 
data obtained from 2 clinical trials following i ntramuscular  administration to pediatric (4 to 17 
years) and adult T1DM patients11,9. 
The conclusion of the modelling was that a  dose of 0.6 mg appears appropriate to ensure a fast 
rescue from hypoglycemia for adult patients and children down to a weight of 25 kg. Although the 
dasiglucagon C max and AUC is expected to be higher in children , it does not exceed the total C max 
and AUC obtained in adult s previously administered 2 mg dasiglucagon. The higher total drug 
exposure (AUC and C max) at lower weight is partially compensat ed by the shorter t ½ and saturated 
PD response. The resulting total time of drug exposure and PD effect (AEU and CE max) is similar 
throughout the weight range . 
7.4.7  Collection of blood samples  
The total blood volume to be obtained from any individual child will  be about 43  mL. The maximum 
amount per visit is 12 to 17  mL. These values are within the recommended scope provided by the 
EU5. 
The following blood volume will be taken for each sample at each visit:  
Sample type  Visit 1 (mL)  Visit 2 (mL)  Visit 3 (mL)   
Biochemistry/pregnancy  5.00  - 5.00

7.4.8  Treatment compliance  
Unblinded trial personnel will handle, prepare and administer a ll trial product s.  
7.4.9  Method of assigning  patient s to treatments  
Forty  patient s will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (dasiglucagon/placebo/GlucaGen®) into the 3 
treatment arms  and stratified  in 2 age groups: 6 to ≤12 years and 12 to ≤ 18 years  and by injection 
site (abdomen/thigh) . A minimum of 16 patients will be enrolled into each age group, including a 
minimum of 8 patients in either of age groups on dasiglucagon treatment ar m. 
Patient s who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of the following 
treatment arms:  
 Dasiglucagon, liquid formulation, 1  mg/mL, 0.6  mL

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33/55  Placebo treatment: Placebo, liquid formulation, 0.6  mL  
 Active control treatment: Reco mbinant glucagon hydrochloride, 1  mg lyophilized powder for 
reconstitution (GlucaGen®, Novo Nordisk) in 1  mL sterile water  (in accordance with the label, 
children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 0.5 mg GlucaGen®) 
Randomization will be performe d using a central, dynamic variance minimization randomization 
method  using an interactive web response system (IWRS) that will randomi ze a patien t to one of 
the 3 aforementioned treatment arms and then assign dispensing unit numbers to that patient.  
An unblinded statistician/programmer who is separate from the trial team will generate the 
randomi zed kit list before the initiation of the trial .  
Treatment assignment will be kept strictly confidential and accessible only to authori zed perso ns 
until after d ata base lock. However, the investigator s can perform an emergency unbli nding within 
the IWRS in case of an emergency , see Section 7.4.10 . 
7.4.10  Blinding  and breaking the blind  
This is a double -blind trial. Dasiglucagon is available as a liquid formulation and GlucaGen® is 
available as a powder for reconstitution ; they are therefore not identical in appearance . Unblinded 
trial personnel will be responsible  for handling, preparing  (according to the prescription from the 
IWRS) , and administering the trial product , and the syringes used for administration will be 
wrapped in aluminum foil to maintain the blinding at bedside. Parents being in the room with their  
child must be instructed not to look while the unblinded staff is administering the injection . To 
maintain doub le-blind conditions, blinded trial personnel  not involved in the administration of trial 
product s will perform all trial assessments at the tria l center and is responsible for keeping the 
records strictly confidential and accessible only to the unblinde d staff. However, unblinded 
personnel at the specialty laboratories  will perform the exposure assessments and ADA 
assessments to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® administration is matched with the 
applicable bioanalytical assay . 
Treatment assignment will be kept strictly confidential and accessible only to authorized persons 
until after the time of unblinding  (database lock) . Codes with tr eatment assignment will however 
be readily available in the IWRS to the blinded personnel in case of an emergency.   
The code for a particular patient  may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the identity of 
the treatment allocation would influence t he treatment of the patient . The emergency code break 
can be performed using the IWRS. Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code 
must record the time, date and reason as well as his/her initials in the source documents.  
The breaking of blind ed codes in case of medical emergency for a patient  should not unblind the 
trial personnel to the treatment information of other patient s. The person performing the unblinding 
should inform as few people as possible about the result of the unblinding. All persons unblinded 
for a specific patient  should be documented.   
If the trial center needs to break the code, the medical monitor should, if at all possible, be 
contacted prior to breaking the code and the monitor must be notified within 24 hours after the 
code has been broken.  
7.4.11  Drug accountability and disposal  
Unblinded trial personnel will do the h andling, preparation and administration of trial product . Each 
center will keep accurate records of the trial supplies received, stored, and dispensed, using 
appropriate forms. The trial supplies will be stored under appropriate conditions, locked  and with 
restricted access.  The unblinded monitor will perform the drug accountability to ensure 
compliance.  
All unused supplies and all empty and partially empty con tainers of trial product  will be stored until 
the trial closure visit has been performed and then sent to the sponsor.

All concomitant medication s will be recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Prior to the start of the clamp procedure,  the patient ’s eligibility must be checked. If the patient  
has taken any prohibited medication , he/she will be excluded from the dosing visit but may be 
rescheduled 1 -7 days later. Each patient  may only have their dosing visit rescheduled once . See 
Section 7.3.3.1  for possible reasons for patient discontinuation . 
7.4.13  Treatment after end of trial  
After the end of their trial participation, pat ients should return to the standard of care that they 
received prior to enrollment in the trial. The treating physician will be responsible for supervising 
patients after the end of the trial.

7.5.3  for further details.  
7.5.5  Additional (safety) examinations  
If there are any unclear symptoms or observations the responsible physician in charge may 
perform fu rther medical examinations, other than outlined in this protocol, including further clinical 
laboratory tests, in order to clarify the relevance or to diagnose symptoms.  
7.5.6  Efficacy measurements  
A description of the sample handling and sample processing at the site will be included in the 
laboratory manuals. Validation documentation for the assays must be available prior to sample 
analyses. A bioanalytical report for each analysis of trial PD and PK samples will be prepared.  
Pharmacokinetic measurements  
The exposure to trial medication (dasiglucagon or GlucaGen®) for evaluation of PK will be 
assessed based on plasma concentration data (AUC 0-90min, Cmax, tmax) from samples collected at 
the dosing visit (Visit 2). The sampling procedure is described in Section 7.5.2 . 
Pharmacodynamic measurements  
The plasma glucose profile for evaluation of the primary and secondary clinical efficacy endpoints 
will be assessed based on plasma concentration data (AUE 0-30min) from samples collected at the 
dosing visit (Visit 2). The samples will be sent to the clinical laboratory and analyzed using a 
sensitive and validated a ssay for glucose measurements. The sampling procedure is describe d 
in Section 7.5.2 .

 Urinalysis:  pH, blood (leukocytes and erythrocytes), pro tein, glucose, ketones, nitrite  
 Immunogenicity:  
Serum  samples for assessment of a ntibodies against dasiglucagon/GlucaGen® will be 
measured at screening Visit 1 and at follow -up Visit 3  by the special laboratory, Y ork 
Bioanalytic al Solutions (York, United Kingdom).  A description of the sample handling and 
sample processing, storage and shipment at the center will be included in the laboratory 
manual . Immunogenicity samples will be analyzed after the last patient last visit.  
The clinical ADA assays, one specific for dasiglucagon and another for GlucaGen®, have 
been validated in accordance with existing  guidelines and recommendations.  
Confirmed positive anti -dasiglucagon antibody samples from treatment - induced or treatment - 
boosted (tit er increase above 5 -fold) ADA -positive patients will be evaluated for binding titer , 
neutralizing potential and neutralizin g titer as well as cross -reactivity towards endogenous 
glucagon. Any treatment -induced or treatment -boosted ADA -positive patients will be 
monitored until the ADA levels return to baseline levels .  
The in vitro  neutralizing effect of the antibodies will be measured using an assay based on 
glucagon receptor expression in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The calculated 
sensitivity in previous studies was about 51.8 ng/mL. The assay was also validated for 
recombinant glucagon with similar results. In c ase of a positive result in the neutralizing 
antibody assay, a titer estimation will be performed. The cell -based neutralizing antibody 
analyses will be performed by a special laboratory, BioAgilytix, Durham, N orth Carolina , USA.   
No further serum sampling  will be needed as the ADA samples can be used for neutralizing 
antibody analysis.  
Residual and additional antibody serum samples may be stored until approval of market 
authorization by the health authorities. Further characterization of the antibody respo nse may 
be requested by the health authorities.  
A pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and follow -up (Visit s 1, 2 and 3 ) for female 
patients of childbearing potential  only.  
An alcohol breath test will be performed at the dosing visit (Visit  2). 
For further d etails , please refer to  the laboratory manual .  
 
7.5.7.2  Safety examinations  
Physical examination is  performed at s creening  (Visit 1) , dosing ( Visit 2 ) and end-of-trial (Visit 3).

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38/55 8. Adverse events  
8.1 Definitions  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials are 
crucial for the protection of patients, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
regul atory agencies worldwide.  
 
Adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient administered a trial  product  and which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unin tended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporal ly associated with the use of a trial product , whether or not considered related 
to the trial product .  
Note: This inclu des events from the first trial -related activity after the patient has signed the 
informed consent.  
AEs include:  
 A clinically significant wor sening of a concomitant illness  
 A clinical laboratory abnormality that is clinically significant, i.e. any abnormality that suggests 
a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active 
management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of 
medicine dose or more frequent f ollow -up due to the abnormality  
 Hypoglycemic episodes (see Section 8.4) 
 Injection site reactions  
The following should not be recor ded as AEs, if recorded at screening (on Medical History form 
or eCRF):  
 Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the informed consent  
 Pre-existing conditions , including those  found because  of screening procedures (pre -existing 
conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness)  
 
When assessing an adverse event, the following definitions are use:  
Serious adverse event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  results in any of the following :  
 Results in death  
 Is life-threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitali zation  
 Results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity  
 Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is medically important  
Medical judgement must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to be ‘medically 
important’. A medically important event may not be immediately life -threatening  or result in

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39/55 death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes  listed in the definition above . 
Other important events:  
The following events must always be reported to the s ponsor accor ding to SAE timelines, 
regardless of whether the event is non -serious or serious:  
 Risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST > 3  x ULN and total bilirubin > 2  x ULN, where no 
alternative etiology exist  
 Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via th e trial product  
 Overdose of the trial product  
 Suspected abuse  or misuse of the trial product  
 Medication error involving the trial product  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the trial product.  
Severity  of an adverse event  
The maximum intensity (severity) of all AEs must be assessed by the investigator  and 
documented. Severity should be graded when the AE outcome is known:  
 Mild: No or transient symptoms, no interference with  the patient´s  daily activities  
 Moderate : Marked sy mptoms, moderate interference with the patient´s  daily activities  
 Severe : Considerable interference with the patient´s  daily activities , which  the patient  finds 
unacceptable. A severe reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as serious and an SAE 
is not a lways severe in nature.  
Causality relationship to trial product  
 Probable : Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
 Possible : A causal relationship is conc eivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely : The e vent is most likely related to etiology o ther than the trial product  
Outcome of an adverse event  
 Recovered/resolved : The patient has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment,  the 
condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the patie nt 
signed the informed consent  
 Recovering/resolving : The condition is improving and the patient is expected to recover from 
the event. This term is only applicable if the patient has completed the trial  
 Recovered/resolved wit h sequelae : The patient has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, th e AE must be reported as an SAE  
 Not recovered/  not resolved : The condition of the patient has not improved  and the symptoms 
are unchanged  
 Fatal : This term is only applicable if the patient died from a condition related to the reported 
AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a patient before he/she died should be assessed as 
"recovered/res olved", "recovering/resolving", "recovered/ resolved with sequelae" or "not 
recovered/not resolved". An AE with fatal out come must be reported as an SAE  
 Unknown : This term is only applicable if t he patient is lost to follow -up

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40/55 Suspected unexpected s erious  adverse reactions  
An AE is considered a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) if the nature 
or severity is not consistent with the applicable produ ct Reference Safety Information . For 
dasiglucagon, the expectedness of an AE will be determi ned by whet her or not it is listed in 
the Reference Safety Information section of the I nvestigator’s Brochure . 
 
Adverse event of special interest  (AESI)  
An AESI is an event that, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus (e.g. required by health 
authorities). In this trial , hemodynamic changes are considered AESIs  that are defined as follows:  
 Post-dose clinical signs, or measured vital signs, indicating a clinically significant drop in 
blood pressure including signs of orthostatic hypotension, vas ovagal responses or 
bradycardia.   
 Post-dose change in pulse or blood pressure considered an event of hypo - or hypertension 
as judged by the investigator.  
AESI s must be reported to the sponsor in the same way and with the same timelines as SAE s 
(see Sectio ns 8.2 and 8.3). 
8.2 Collection, recording and reporting of adverse events  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated 
informed consent form (ICF) is obtained until the end of the post -treatment follow -up period (which 
may include contacts for follow -up of safety). In addition, patie nts will be observed for any signs 
or symptoms and asked about their condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been 
feeling since you were last asked?” at each contact with the trial center  (visit or telephone) . 
Patients  will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during 
the trial.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to trial product, must be 
recorded and evaluated by the investigator. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be g iven when 
signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology. If no diagnosis can be made, the investigator 
should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs. Investigators must record their opinion 
concerning the relationship of the AE to the trial produ ct. All measures required for AE 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.  
 
Each AE must be reported on the AE  page of the  eCRF.  
All AE information should at a minimum include the following:  
 Date and  time of onset and resolution  
 Date and time of investigator ’s first information on the AE  
 Seriousness  
 Severity  
 Causal relationship with trial product  
 Measures taken due to AE  
 Date and time of resolution and final outcome  
Each  AE will be coded  using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities . 
SAEs  and AESI s, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after 
the last dose of trial product, must be reported to the appropriate s ponsor conta ct person(s) within

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41/55 24 hours after obtaining knowledge about the event, followed by a complete SAE form as soon 
as more information is av ailable.  For each SAE  and AESI , a separate SAE form should be 
completed.   
The investigator should report the SAE and AE SI in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) and the 
system will generate an email to the sponsor´ s Pharmacovigilance Unit (PharmaLex), informing 
them of the reported SAE.  
It is the responsibility of the sponsor ´s Pharmacovigilance Unit (PharmaLex)  to report al l SUSARs 
that occur in this trial to the respective competent authorities  and the  institutional review board 
(IRB), or independent ethics committee (IEC)  in accordance with the local requirements in force 
and ICH guideline for GCP.  
8.3 Follow -up of adverse events  
All AEs that are ongoing at the end of the patient’s participation in the trial will be followed  up until 
the event is resolved or reaches a satisfactory outcome as deemed by the investigator .  
Follow -up actions for all SAEs will be performed accord ing to appropriate clinical care practices 
and may depend on the nature of the event. These will be determined after internal review and/or 
sponsor review.  
The follow -up information should only include new (updated and/or additional) information that 
reflects the situation at the time of the investigator ’s signature.  
Follow -up information on (S)AEs and AESI s will be updated using the (S)AE form. If a non -serious 
event b ecomes serious during the follow -up, the AE form and SAE form have to be used and 
reporting timelines follow those of a SAE.  
The investigator  must forward follow -up information on SAEs and if previously non -serious AEs 
become SAEs to the sponsor  immediatel y (within 24 hours) after obtaining knowledge about the 
new information . 
The investigator must record follow -up information in the eCRF for non -serious AE and on the 
SAE form for SAEs  and AESI . Follow -up questions to investigators regarding SAEs  are queried 
directly by safety CRO to the investigator.  
Follow -up information must be reported according to the following:  
 SAEs  and AESI : All SAEs and AESI must be followed until the outcome of the events is 
“recovered/resolved,” “recovered/resolved with sequ elae,” or “fatal,” and until all queries have 
been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer, or AEs that are ongoing at time of death 
(where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or 
“not recovered/not resolv ed.” Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” 
when the patient has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to 
recover.  
The SAE and AESI follow -up information should only include new (eg, corrections or 
addit ions) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator's first 
knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non -serious AEs which 
subsequently become SAEs.  
 Non-serious AEs: Non -serious AEs must be followed until t he outcome of the event is 
“recovering/resolving,” “recovered/resolved,” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until 
the end of the follow -up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all 
queries related to these AEs have been reso lved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer, or AEs 
that are ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the 
outcome of “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved.” Cases can be closed with 
the outcome of “recove ring/resolving” when a patient has completed the follow -up period and 
is expected by the investigator to recover.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42/55 If a potential hypersensitivity reaction is observed, additional blood samples, as clinically 
indicated, may be required to further character ize the potential hypersensitivity reaction. If an 
anaphylactic shock is suspected, samples may be taken for the measurement of tryptase. In this 
case, a blood sample should be taken 3  to 4 hours after the event and again approximately 
1 to 2 weeks later t o determine tryptase baseline levels. In addition, assessments for elevated 
histamine levels may be considered.  
The investigator must ensure that the worst -case severity and seriousness of an event is kept 
throughout the trial, ie, if the severity of an AE  changes over time then it should be reported as 
1 AE with the most severity. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow -up with 
re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event.  
If an AE is resolved and re -appears later then it sh ould be reported as a new AE.   
Queries or follow -up requests must be responded within 14 calendar days from the date of receipt 
of the request, unless otherwise specified in the follow -up request.  
8.4 Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia will be regarded as an AE, reco rded,  and documented on an AE form (or SAE 
form, if applicable) . 
Hypoglycemia is defined as a decline in  plasma glucose below 3.9 mmol /L (70 mg/dL). Since 
hypoglycemia will be induced during the dosing visit, in accordance with hypoglycemia clamp 
procedure described in Section 7.4.5.2.2 , ONLY  plasma glucose below 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) 
must be reported as an AE , at the dosing visit (V2), and at incidences that IV glucose is given 
after trial product  administration . 
8.5 Pregnancy  
Female patients  must be instructed to notify the i nvestigator immediately if they become pregnan t 
or if they suspect to be pregnant during the trial.  All initial reports of pregnancy in female patients  
must be reported to the sponsor by the trial center  personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge 
of the event using the appropriate pregnancy form. Ab normal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are 
considered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. If a patient  becomes pregnant during 
the trial, a determination regarding t he trial product discontinuation must be made by the 
investigator.  
Because the effect of the trial product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male 
patient s must be reported by the trial center  personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of th e 
event using the appropriate pregnancy form. Male patient s must be instructed to notify the 
investigator immediately if their partner becomes pregnant or suspects to be pregnant.  
The investigator must follow the pregnancy until the pregnancy outcome is known and the 
newborn infant is 1 month of age. The investigator must report information about the pregnancy, 
pregnancy outcome, and health of the newborn infant(s), as well as AEs in connection with the 
pregnancy, and AEs in the f etus and newborn infant.  
8.6 Precautions  
Normal precautions taken for a human trial, including the provision of emergency equipment, will 
be taken during this trial. Qualified and well -trained physicians and medical staff will instruct the 
patients. During a patient ’s participation in  the trial, the investigator  should ensure adequate 
medical care for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the trial. The 
investigator  should inform the patient  when medical care is needed for intercurrent  illnesses of 
which the investigator  becomes aware.

8.7 Safety committee  
An internal Zealand Pharma A/S safety committee is constituted to perform the safety surveillance 
of clinical trials with dasiglucagon, including this trial.  
If safety signals  or concerns  are observed, whether  based on reported SAEs, review of all AEs 
and laboratory parameters  reported , or any other  notifi cation of significant findings, the safety 
committee  will respond appropriately to protect the safety of the patients.   
The safety committee  convenes regularly, every quarter , to review the safety information, 
including SAEs, AEs and laboratory data. Additional safety committee  meeting may be called at 
the discretion of any safety committee  member, should new safety signals occur during this time 
interval .

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44/55 9. Data management and quality control  
9.1 Electronic c ase report forms  
All the information collected during the trial will be recorded in the eCRFs, which are identified by 
patient  number. Synteract will design suitable eCRFs . The investigator will ensure that the eCRFs 
are completed  correctly . The investigator will sign all data entered  in the eCRF electronically , 
signifying agreement with and responsibility for the recorded data.   
9.2 Quality control  
The investigator will permit trial -related monitoring, IEC review, and regulatory inspections, 
providing direct access to source d ata/documents. Sponsor -authorized quality assurance 
personnel may carry out audits for which the investigator must provide support.  
A monitor from Synteract will supervise the trial . The trial monitor will contact the investigator 
regularly to discuss the progress of the trial and to check the trial documents including the 
informed consent forms for completeness and consistency.  
The trial monitor or a representative of the sponsor will cross -check the data entered in the eCRFs 
with the source data at the trial center  and observe the trial procedures in order to verify 
adherence to the trial protocol.  
The eCRFs will be checked for completeness and correctness by the monitor and by the data 
management department of Synteract  according to the Synteract  standa rd operating procedures , 
and the investigator will resolve  any queries.  
All of the clinical data will be captured via EDC using a web -based tool. The software Marvin from 
the company XClinical (www.xclinical.com) is the preferred EDC software. Marvin is co mpliant 
with all legislation relevant to EDC  (Food and Drug Administration USA,  21 C ode of Federal 
Regulations  [CFR]  Part 11, GCP).  
The investigator center  staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access 
features (username and password). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The 
investigator will approve the data using an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11),  and this 
approval is used to confirm the accuracy of the data recorded.  
The eCRFs will be used for all patients. The investigator’s data will be accessible from the 
investigator’s center  throu ghout the trial. The e CRFs must be kept current to reflect pati ent status 
at each phase during the course of the  trial. The e CRF will not capture personalized data. The 
investigator must make a separate confidential record of personalized details (name and initials) 
on the patient  identification and enrollment log. The investigator does all changes to data  through 
the EDC system .  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator of the respective center  to ensure that all patient  
discontinuations or changes in trial or other medications entered i n the patient ’s eCRF are also 
made on the patient ’s medical records.  
The eCRFs for any patient  leaving the trial should be completed at the time of the final visit or shortly 
thereafter.  
9.3 Data management  
Data management will be performed according to Synteract  standard operating procedure s.

08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45/55 10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
10.1 Statistical analysis plan  
A separate  Statistical Analysis Plan  will detail  the planned statistical analysis and may include 
necessary adaptations to the planned statistical analysi s before unblinding of the data.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
trial report.  
10.1.1  General considerations  
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and summarized with 
statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all data collected 
up to that time point will be included into the analysis.  
Raw data listings and summary tables will be generated using SAS© software Vers ion 9 or higher  
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) .  
Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. 
Categorical efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of 
patient s in corresponding categories.   
10.1.2  Classification of patient s to subsets  
For the statistical analysis,  the randomized patient s will be divi ded up into the following datasets:  
The following definitions are applicable:  
Safety analysis set 
(SAS)  all patient s who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
trial product  
Full analysis set  
(FAS)  all patient s of the SA S 
Per protocol set 
(PPS)  all patient s of the FA S for whom no relevant protocol deviations 
were documented .  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. A secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint  will be based on the PPS. Safety analysis will be based  on the SAS.  
The decision whether a protocol deviation is relevant or not for the exclusion of patient s from the 
PPS will be made case -by-case in a data review meeting.  
10.1.3  Efficacy endpoints  
For the confirmatory analyses, the primary and secondary  endpoints for the dasiglucagon 0.6 mg 
and placebo treated patients  will be compared. A hierarchical procedure will be applied for the 
control of multiplicity. The primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated on the FAS. In the 
primary analysis, those  patients  who require rescue IV glucose will be censored at the time to 
plasma glucose recovery.  In a sensitivity analysis, the time to plasma glucose recovery will be 
analyzed without censoring the patien ts who received rescue IV glucose.   
10.1.3.1  Hierarchical testing procedure  
For the confirmatory analyses, the following a priori defined hierarchical inferential test order will 
be applied for the control of the type 1 error rate across the planned multiple comparisons. The 
primary endpoint and secondary  endpoin ts will be inferentially evaluated within the FAS in the 
following order, where inference will proceed at the 2-sided 0.05 criterion significance level until 
the first failure to reject the null hypothesis for a dasiglucagon versus placebo comparison:  
Zealand Pharma A/S  
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 1.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 June 2018   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46/55  Primary:  Time to plasma glucose recovery  
 Secondary  1-4: Plasma glucose recovery within 30 minutes, within 20 minutes, within 15 
minutes, and within 10 minutes after study drug injection without administration of rescue IV 
glucose.  
 Secondary  5-8:  Plasma gluco se changes from baseline within 30 minutes, within 20 minutes, 
within 15 minutes, and within 10 minutes after study drug injection or at the time of rescue.  
The GlucaGen® versus placebo comparisons will not be included in the inferential testing hierarchy,  
since the efficacy of GlucaGen® is previously established, and these comparisons are intended to 
support the validity of the study for the dasiglucagon versus placebo comparisons.  
Analogous supportive sensitivity analyses will be conducted in the PP S, but without inference intent.  
10.1.3.2  Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary endpoint, time to plasma glucose recovery, will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier  
estimates for each treatment group in total and stratified by age group and injection site. The median 
time to recovery with 95% confidence interval will be estimated by treatment group , in total and in 
each strat um. 
A stratified l og-rank test will be applied to compare the dasiglucagon 0. 6 mg treatment group to the 
placebo  group . The same method will be applied  to compare dasiglucagon 0.6  mg with Gluca Gen®. 
In the primary analysis, recovery cannot be achieved in those patient s where IV glucose treatment 
is administered. Those patient s who receive IV glucose will be censored (i.e. set to ‘not recovered’) 
at 45 minutes after dosing.  
A further sensitivity analysis will be done by censoring data at the actual time when the  patients  
received glucose  IV. 
10.1.3.3  Secondary efficacy endpoints  
The secondary  efficacy endpoints are plasma glucose recovery within 10, 15, 20 and 3 0 minutes 
after trial product  injection, i.e. achieving a ≥ 20 mg/dL increase in plasma glucose from baseline 
within 0 to 10, 15, 20 and 30  minutes. If a patient  has received an IV glucose treatment before 
recovery, the patient  is set to ‘not recovered’ in the analysis of the 4 endpoints, corresponding to 
censoring in the time -to-recovery analysis for the primary endpoint. The 10-, 15-, 20- and 30 -
minute recovery rate s of 2 treatment groups will be compared by a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test 
stratified by age group and injection site. The treatment and age group responder rates with the 
95% confidence intervals will be presented for the 10-, 15-, 20- and 30 -minute endpoint.  
If due to small or zero cell counts the Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel test fails, non -stratified Fisher’s 
exact tests will be applied instead.  
Plasma glucose changes from baseline at 10, 15, 20 and 30  minutes after trial product injection 
will be analyzed in an analysis of variance  with factors treatment (3 levels) age group (2 levels) 
and injection site (2 levels) for each endpoint. If the rescue IV glucose was administered before 
10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes, respectively, the patient ’s plasma glucose changes from baseline will 
be dete rmined from the value at the time of rescue IV glucose administration. Adjusted treatment 
means will be presented with their 95% confidence intervals. The 4 analysis of variance  will also 
be used to tes t the difference between treatme nts adjusted for age g roup and injection site.  
10.1.4  Safety endpoints  
Clinical laboratory  data 
Clinical laboratory test results will be marked whether the result is below, within or above the 
respective reference range. The number of values outside of the reference range will be counted.

Adverse events  will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after 
medical coding using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. AE summary tables will 
include counts and percentages of patient s who experienced AEs summarized by SOC and PT.  
Other safety data  
Time to first IV glucose infusion, after IMP administration (N.B. IV glucose infusion prior to IMP 
administration should not be included, as it is part of hypoglycemic clamp procedure)  will be 
described with descriptive statistics. No statistical tests will be performed.  
Vital signs, physical examination, ECG  and local tolerability data will be summari zed with 
descriptive statistics.  
Immunogenicity  
Occurrence  of ADA will be analyzed  descriptively per treatment group. No statistical tests are 
planned.  
10.1.5  Pharmacokinetic endpoints  
Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations will be described and the following 
parame ters are calculated  and summarized with descriptive statistics : 
 Area u nder the plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® concentration versus time curve from 0 to 
30 minutes post -dose (AUC 0-30min) 
 Area under the plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® concentration versus time curve from 0 
to 300  minutes post -dose (AUC 0-300min ) 
 Area under the plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® concentration versus time curve from 0 
to infinitely post -dose (AUC 0-inf) 
 Maximum of all valid plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® concentration measurements from 
0 to 300  minutes post -dose (C max) 
 Time to maximum of plasma  dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® concentration measurements (t max) 
 Terminal elimination rate constant of plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® (λz) 
 Terminal plasma elimination half -life of dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® (t½) 
 Total body clearance of plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® (CL/f)  
 Volume of distribution of plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® (Vz/f) 
 Mean residence time of plasma dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® (MRT)  
10.1.6  Pharmacodynamic endpoints  
Plasma glucose response as area under the effect curve above baseline from time 0 to

No subgroup analysis is currently planned.  
10.1.11  Interim analysis  
No interim analysis is currently planned.  
10.2 Determination of sample size  
The primary comparison is between the dasiglucagon and placebo treatment arms. From phase 
2 results , the median time to an increase of 20  mg/dL of the 0.6  mg dose was approximately 10 
minutes. For placebo -treated patient s, the median time to recovery is assumed to be more than 
50 minutes. Assuming an exponential time -to-recovery distribution with median times of 10 and 
50 minutes, a 2-sided log -rank test will be able to detect a difference between dasiglucagon 
0.6 mg and placebo with 9 0% power with a follow -up time of 45 minutes at a 5% significance level 
with 20 patient s randomized to the dasiglucagon ar m and 10 patient s to placebo.  
Gluca Gen® is included as a reference to compare the responses and AE profile to  dasiglucagon 
with those to  a marketed product. It is expected that 10 patients in the  Gluca Gen® group will 
suffice for the comparison.

12.1 Responsibilities  
Zealand Pharma A/S is the sponsor of this trial. Synteract , a contract research organization , will 
organize the performance of thi s trial.  
A list with the names and addresses of the responsible institutions and persons is provided in 
Appendix 1 of this protocol.  
12.2 Protocol deviations  
Before data are released for statistical analysis, a treatment -masked review of all data will take 
place to identify protocol deviations that may potentially affect the results. This review will be 
performed without revealing to which trial product the patients  were assigned. The masking of the 
trial products will be maintained  for everyone involved in allocating patients  to the analysis sets 
until data are released for statistical analysis. Furthermore, spurious outliers will be evaluated. In 
addition, protocol deviations that may potentially affect the results will be identifi ed and it will be 
evaluated if patient s and/or data should be excluded from the analysis. Protocol deviations will 
be classified as minor or major in a consistent way. Major deviations from the protocol may lead 
to the exclusion of a patient  from the P PS. 
Major protocol deviations may include deviations related to trial inclusion or exclusion criteria, 
conduct of the trial, patient  management or patient  assessment. Unless explicitly decided 
otherwise during the treatment -masked data review, the following wi ll be considered major 
protocol deviations:  
 Violation of one or more major inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 Interruption of administration of trial product  
 Significant deviation from time windows  
 Incorrect treatment allocation  
 Missing primary endpoint.  
The vi olation of several major inclusion/exclusion criteria or the complete absence of efficacy data 
might lead to exclusion of the patient  from the FAS . In that case, the decision should be taken at 
the treatment -masked data review meeting, and the exclusion fr om efficacy analysis will be 
justified in the signed notes of the meeting.  
Obviously erroneous data points may be excluded from the analyses or re -analyzed (in case of , 
for example,  serum concentrations). The decision to re -analyze or exclude data points f rom the 
statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the sponsor and the trial statistician.  
The patient s or observations to be excluded and the reason for their exclusion will be documented 
and signed by those responsible prior to database release . The documentation will be stored 
together with the remaining trial documentation. The patient s and observations excluded from 
analysis sets, and the corresponding reasons, will be described in the clinical trial report.   
12.3 Protocol changes  
This trial protocol may be amended  following the procedures specified by local laws and 
regulations. Substantial amendments to this trial protocol may be implemented only if the approval 
of the CA(s) and a favorable opinion of the ethics committee(s) have been obtai ned. 
Substantial amendments to the conduct of the clinical trial may arise from changes to the protocol 
or from new information relating to the scientific documents in support of the trial. Amendments 
to the trial are regarded as “substantial” where they a re likely to have a significant impact on  one 
of the following :

stage  using off -the-shelf tools. CDISC provides a complete CDISC ODM Viewer for thes e 
purposes. If needed, PDF  files can be created from the ODM file.  
After trial completion at sites in the US, the investigator will retain and preserve 1 copy of all data 
genera ted in the course of the trial, specifically including, but not limited to, those defined by GCP 
as essential until:  
 At least 2 years after the last marketing authorization for the trial product  has been approved 
or the sponsor has discontinued its researc h with the trial  product , or 
 At least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the 
trial product  
However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s)  or if needed by the sponsor.  
At the end of such period, the investigator will notify the sponsor in writing of his or her intent to 
destroy all such material. The sponsor will have 30 days to respond to the investigator’s notice, 
and the sponsor will have  a further opportunity to retain such materials at the sponsor’s expense.  
After trial completion at sites in Europe, the sponsor will receive a copy of their data in electronic 
format (e.g. CD) and retain them for at least 25 years.  
One copy will remain with the investigator. The investigator will arrange for the retention of the 
patient identification codes, patient files, and other source data until at least 5 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region  and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the product. These documents need to 
be retained for a longer pe riod of time if required by applicable regulatory authorities or by 
agreement with the sponsor.  
The investigator will keep copies of these trial records (and all trial -related documents, including 
source data) for the maximum period of time permitted by th e hospital, institution, or private 
practice.

Planned trial period:  
First Patient  First Visit: Sep tember  2018  
Last Patient  Last Visit: Second quarter  2019  Phase of development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective is to demonstrate that dasiglucagon is superior to placebo following a single 
injection of 0.6  mg of dasiglucagon in treating hypoglycemia in children  with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM ). 
Secondary objectives are:  
• To confirm  that a single dose of dasiglucagon [0.6  mg] is comparable to a single dose of GlucaGen® 
[1 mg/mL] in treating hypoglycemia in children  with T1DM,  (in accordance with the label, children 
below 25 kg body weight will be administered 0.5 mg GlucaGen®), 
• To assess safety profile of dasiglucagon in children  with T1DM,  
• To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile of dasiglucagon in children  with T1DM.  
Trial  design:  
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled, parallel -arm trial 
designed to assess efficacy, safety and PK of dasiglucagon vs. placebo and vs . GlucaGen® in 
children with diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) . Patients will receive a single subcutaneous injection of 
the investigational product during a hypoglycemic clamp procedure. Handling, preparation and 
administration of trial product  will be done by unblinded trial personnel. All trial assessments will be 
done by blinded trial personnel.  
The trial design is illustrated in the figure below.

Statistical methods:  
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ) will be listed 
and summarized with statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all 
data collected up to that time will be included into the analysis.  
Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and 
maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. Categorical 
efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of patients in 
corresponding categories . The primary endpoint, time to recovery, will be summarized using Kaplan -
Meier estimates for each treatment group in total and stratified by age intervals  and injection site. The 
median time to recovery with 95% confidence interval will be estimated by treatment group.

Log-rank tests will be applied to compare the 2 treatment groups to the placebo group.  
In the primary analysis, r ecovery cannot be achieved in those patient s where IV glucose treatment is 
administered. Those patient s who receive IV glucose will be censored (i.e. set to ‘not recovered’) at 45 
minutes after dosing.  
All safety data will be analy zed with descriptive methods.  
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) after medical coding using 
the Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory Activities . AE summary tables will include counts and percentages 
of patients who experienced AEs summarized by SOC and PT.  
Plasma dasiglucagon and glucagon concentrations will be described and PK metrics determined.  
AUE 0-30min will be summarized with descriptive statistic s. 
Sample size calculation:  
The primary comparison is between the dasiglucagon and placebo treatment arms. From phase 2  
results , the median time to an increase of 20  mg/dL of the 0.6  mg dose was approximately 10 
minutes. For placebo -treated patient s, the median time to recovery is assumed to be more than 50 
minutes. Assu ming an exponential time -to-recovery distribution with median times of 10 and 50 
minutes, a 2-sided log -rank test will be able to detect a difference between dasiglucagon 0.6  mg and 
placebo with 9 0% power with a follow -up time of 45 minutes at a 5% signifi cance level with 20 
patient s randomized to the dasiglucagon arm and 10 patient s to placebo . Gluca Gen® is included as a 
reference to compare  the responses and AE profile to  dasiglucagon with those to  a marketed product. 
It is expected that 10 patients in the  Gluca Gen® group  will suffice for the comparison.

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17/58 5. Introduction  
5.1 Background of the trial 
Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes is defined as episodes of an abnormally low plasma 
glucose concentration .9 This is a common, unpredictable , and potential ly dangerous side  effect 
of treatment of diabetes mellitus with especially  insulin or sulfonylureas. It is more frequent in 
patients with profoun d endogenous insulin deficiency, such as occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM)  and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus. Treatment of type 2 diabet es mellitus with insulin 
causes hypoglycemia progressively and more frequently over time, whereas in T1D M, 
hypoglycemia is experienced throughout the course of established disease.  
Symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia are not specific. Patients undergoing a hypoglycemic 
episode experience unpleasant symptoms such as  anxiety, sweating, hunger, tremors, 
palpitations , paresthesia, nausea and pallor. Depending on its severity, the hypoglycemia may 
lead to mild confusion, behavioral changes, loss of consciousness, seizures, coma , and death.1  
The incidence of hypoglycemic events or even the fear of hypoglycemia influences patients’  
adherence to prescribed treatment regimens  for diabetes mellitus . This leads to inadequate 
glycemic control, which in turn may lead to an increased risk of diabetic complications.  
Glucagon  
Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone, secreted from the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. 
Glucagon plays a central role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and is the counterpart of 
insuli n for controlling blood glucose levels  (i.e. it acts in opposition to insulin in terms of effects on 
blood glucose levels ). Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in 
hypoglycemic states, thereby restoring glucose homeostasis. Glucag on receptor agonism has 
also been shown to exert effects on lipid metabolism, energy balance, body adipose tissue mass 
and food intake.   
Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and cases of hypoglycemia can be reversed by glucagon. 
Therefore , glucagon is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  
Dasiglucagon  
Dasiglucagon (ZP 4207 ) is a stable p eptide analog of human glucagon, available in a ready -to-
use liquid formulation  and is  in development  for the treatment of severe hypoglycemi a in insulin 
dependent patients with diabetes mellitus . Dasiglucagon  is a specific and full glucagon receptor 
agonist designed to mimic the effects of glucagon, having a fast absorption and elimination 
(minutes).  It is a peptide  of 29 amino acids , with 7 amino acid substitutions compared to native 
glucagon. The main purpose of the substitutions is to increase the physical and chemical stability 
of the glucagon analog compared to marketed glucagon products such as Lilly ´s Glucagon or 
GlucaGen®. Dasiglucago n exhibits improved physical and chemical stability and is available in an 
aqueous solution at neutral pH.2 
Five clinical trials have been completed  with dasigluca gon: A first human dose trial  (ZP4207 -
14013 ), a multiple -dose  dose -escalation trial (ZP4207 -15007 ) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dasiglucagon , a phase 2 crossover trial 
to assess  the PK and PD of a single dose of an optimized formulation of dasiglucagon 
administered subcutaneously  (SC) in patients with T1DM  (ZP4207 -15126) , and a feasibility trial 
testing the bionic pancreas w ith dasiglucagon  was completed ( ZP4207 -16051 ).2 Finally,  a cross -
over trial (ZP4207 -16098 ) assessing PK and PD responses after micro -doses of dasiglucagon 
administered SC to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus under euglycemic and hyp oglycemic 
conditions , compared to marketed glucagon , was completed.

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18/58 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dasiglucagon  
The results of the phase 1 and 2 clinical trials confirm dose -proportionality for dasiglucagon PK, 
which is characterized by a fast absorption with a peak plasma concentration obtained after 35 
minutes. Thereafter, the plasma concentration rapidly declines with an average half -life of 28 
minutes. The median time to the maximum plasma concentration (C max) was later for 
dasiglucagon than for GlucaGen® (35 versus 20 minutes). For Cmax, the results indicated that 
0.3 mg dasiglucagon was comparable to 0.5  mg GlucaGen® (90% confidence interval : 0.8167; 
1.0068) and 0.6  mg dasiglucagon was comparable to 1.0  mg GlucaGen® (90% confidence 
interva I: 0.8850; 1.1991).2 At these dose levels, the total exposures (AUC 0-inf) were higher for 
dasiglucagon compared to GlucaGen®. 
At all dose levels in the phase 2 trial, all patients achieved a plasma glucose level of at least 
70 mg/dL as well as an increase in plasma glucose by at least 20  mg/dL within 30 min utes post-
dose. The maximal observed time to reach the 20  mg/dL plasma glu cose increase ranged from 
15 to 27  minutes across doses and decreased as the dose increased. The PD responses of 
0.6 mg of dasiglucagon and 1.0  mg of GlucaGen® were comparable .2 
Safety of dasiglucagon  
The safety data for dasiglucagon did not give rise to any relevant safety concerns for dasiglucagon 
beyond those  expected,  related to the pharmacological effect of glucagon receptor agonism . All 
adverse events (AEs) recorded in the trials were of mild or moderate severity. The most frequent ly 
reported systemic AE was nausea, which is a known side effect following administration of 
glucagon. Headache was the next most frequently reported event, occurring in all dose gr oups in 
the phase 2 trial. Injection site reactions were observed only sporadically after administration with 
either dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® and all were mild and transient. The most frequent injection 
site reaction was erythema, occurring in all treatme nt groups, including the placebo group, 
irrespective of dose.  Therefore,  the phase 1 and 2 results and the safety profile described to date 
do not give rise to specific safety concerns.  For further information, please refer to  the Investigator 
Brochure.2  
Immunogenicity of dasiglucagon  
In adults, anti -drug antibodies (ADA) have been assessed in the completed clinical trials. In one 
of the 5 completed clinical tr ials (ZP4207 -16098) 1 transient ADA incidence have been detected 
in one T1DM  patient. The antibodies were able to bind to dasiglucagon and glucagon confirming 
the cross -reactivity potential found in the non -clinical toxicity studies (IND 135869 Section 
2.4.4.6). The antibodies were also capable of neutralizing the in vitro activity of both dasiglucagon 
and glucagon, but could not be associated with any AEs or effects on PK or PD in the patient . 
The trial was a multiple dose trial and completers had received  a total of 11 investigational drug 
administrations (8 injections of dasiglucagon and 3 injections of recombinant glucagon) (IND 
135869 Section 2.5.6.3) and indicate d that increased exposure will likely increase the risk of ADA 
formation. However, due to t he crossover trial design, the induction of ADA cannot be decisively 
attributed to either dasiglucagon or glucagon treatment. The ADA incidence in that trial was 4.3% 
and considered low. From the long -term non -clinical toxicology studies, the detection of antibodies 
was not associated with a change in toxicity profile compared to ADA negative animals. In the 13 - 
and 26 -week rat studies, an increase in exposure was observed in dose groups ≥8 mg/kg/day, 
which correlates with the dose groups with the highest f requency of ADA -positive animals. So far, 
these findings have not been observed in humans.  
The consequences of an immune response towards endogenous glucagon is not fully known. In 
a recent review summarizing the current physiology of glucagon and learning s from recent 
glucagon antagonist research, it was concluded that although glucagon is an important hormone 
for controlling postprandial glucose levels, it was not essential for the maintenance of fasting 
glucose and glucagon antagonism did not cause hypog lycemia .5 Rather, the lack of glucagon 
signaling induced imbalance in amino acid metabolism leading to elevated amino acid plasma

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19/58 levels. As excess levels of amino acids can be excreted by the kidneys and the detected ADA 
incidence have been transient, the impact i s not considered a major risk for the trial population . 
The overall immunogenicity risk of dasiglucagon in a clinical context is therefore considered low 
and the potential effects of induced ADAs judged to be of limited clinical consequence.   
5.2 Trial rationa le 
The SC bolus dose of 0.6  mg dasiglucagon that is the most appropriate dosing to ensure rapid 
rescue from hypoglycemia in adults appears to be appropriate also in children 6 years old and 
above.  
To simulate the potential PK/PD response in children, a previously developed population PK/PD 
model for dasiglucagon was updated with an allometric PK component derived from published 
glucagon pediatric data from weight groups of 25.4±5.2, 43.2±8.9, and 61.2±13.8  kg (mean±SD) 
and adults. The simulations suggest ed that a 0.3  mg SC bolus dose of dasiglucagon would result 
in a slightly slower increase of blood glucose compared to the 0.6  mg dose in the 3 pediatric body 
weight groups. Considering the intended clinical indication of treating patient s for severe 
hypoglycemia where time to PD response is considered essential, the 0.3  mg dose appears less 
attractive than the 0.6  mg dose.  
The higher total drug exposure (AUC and C max) predicted in children at lower body weight, relative 
to that observed in adults at a  dose of 0.6  mg, is within the tolerable exposure achieved in adults 
administered 2.0  mg dasiglucagon, and the duration of exposure is truncated due to a shorter t ½ 
in children . In addition, rapid saturation of the PD response results in similar total and maximum 
glucose response (AUE and CE max) throughout the body weight range from 25 to 77 kg.  
Based on all data generated to date across 4 clinical trials performed in adults receiving 
dasiglucagon at different dose levels, no clear dose -response for nausea  and vomiting was 
observed above a certain threshold. It is therefore not expected that the intensity and frequency 
of nausea and vomiting at a dose of 0.6  mg will differ between adults and children/adolescents. 
This expectation is further consistent with results of the recently conducted trial ZP4207 -16098 in 
adults with T1DM, which indicated a similar degree of nausea and vomiting at SC bolus doses of 
0.2 and 0.6  mg dasiglucagon.   
5.3 Assessment of anticipated benefits and risks  
Glucagon emer gency kits are o ften underutiliz ed in the treatment of patien ts experiencing severe 
hypoglyc emia. Considering the seriousness and potential complications that  can arise from 
severe hypoglyc emic episodes, it is essential that parents and caregivers receive adequate, 
hands on training for use of glucagon rescue kits to ensure safe, timely, and effective 
administration. Given the challenges with parent/caregiver training and use of current glucagon 
products, Zealand Pharma A/S is developing dasiglucagon as a ready to use resc ue treatment 
for severe hypoglyc emia. The development of dasiglucagon will provide parents and caregivers 
of children with diabetes mellitus a more efficient alternative for t he treatment of severe 
hypoglyc emia. The ready -to-use kit addresses an unmet need  and may potentially prove to be 
life-saving.  The trial may also provide a direct benefit to patients and their parent(s)/caregiver by 
allowing patients to experience signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in a highly specialized 
treatment center where they wi ll be under continuous supervision and medical monitoring. This 
will help the patient and their parent(s)/caregiver  recognize the signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia and start treatment before the event becomes more serious.  
As glucagon and its analogs belo ng to a well -known drug class with a known mode of action, 
dasiglucagon is not expected to be a high -risk molecule.  
Treatment with an investigational medicinal product may result in undesired effects or complaints. 
Undesired effects and complaints such as nausea  and vomiting are known AEs occurring with  
glucagon administration. Similar AEs have also been observed to a limited degree in the 5 clinical

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20/58 studies  conducted with dasiglucagon.  As with every novel drug substance, new and yet unknown 
side effects also may occur.   
There are limited data available to assess the immunogenic potential of glucagon products 
available on the market, but the data available indicate that marketed glucagon only has a small 
immunogenic potential. Based on the 5 clinical studies completed  with dasiglucagon  to date (see 
Section 5.2), no anti -dasiglucagon or anti -glucagon antibodies have been detected , except  for 
trial ZP4207 -16098, in which there was one transient low titer ADA incidence showing reactivity 
towards both dasiglucagon and glucagon. The patient was tested positive for both anti -
dasiglucagon and anti -glucagon antibodies at the follow -up visit, 24 days after the last drug 
exposure (titer: 35.4 and 33.8, respectively). The patient was also found to be positive for 
dasiglucagon and glucagon in vitro  neutralizing activities. The titer of anti -dasiglucagon activity 
was equal to the assay minimum require d dilution. Due to the crossover nature of this trial, the 
induction of ADAs could not be associated with a specific treatment. Testing perform ed 3.5 
months after last dosing  confirmed a positive finding for anti -dasiglucagon antibodies (titer of 
38.8), wh ile the test was negative for anti -glucagon antibodies. At a final follow -up visit performed 
7 months after last dosing, the patient was negative for anti -dasiglucagon antibodies. There was 
no evidence for altered PK, PD, or safety profile for this patient . 
Administration of dasiglucagon may be associated with a risk of allergic reactions similar to those 
observed for other therapeutic peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected allergies to 
the trial products  or related products will be excluded from the trial. Mild or moderate allergic 
reactions may include symptoms of rash, fever, flu -like symptoms, nausea, headache, and 
myalgia. Acute generalized hypersensitivity reactions are usually very rare but may inclu de 
symptoms of flushing, sweating, dizziness, change in blood pressure and difficulties in breathing. 
No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the 4 clinical trials conducted 
with dasiglucagon . Direct access to resuscitation equipme nt is ensured at the clinical trial center s. 
The results of the trial may contribute to the future use of dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes 
mellitus experiencing severe hypoglycemic  reactions . 
Overall, the benefit to risk ratio for patients entering t he ZP4207 -17086 trial is considered 
acceptable . The trial design subjects the patients concerned to as little burden and other 
foreseeable risks as possible.  
German y only: With the exception of medical examinations, a patient participating in this trial is  
not likely to derive any personal health -related benefits. The results of the trial may contribute to 
the future use of dasiglucagon in patients with diabetes mellitus experiencing severe 
hypoglycemic reactions.  The perceived risks and burden of the trial  will be discussed with the 
patients and their parent(s)/guardian(s) prior to the trial, and it is therefore expected that a given 
patient will not be enrolled if there are concerns about the risks or burden of the trial. A patient 
can be withdrawn if the burden of trial procedures is considered unacceptable by the patient, their 
parent(s)/guardian(s) or the investigator; see Section  7.3.3.1 . Therefore, the investiga tor will need 
to monitor the burden of the trial activities for each patient.  
To minimize the burden for the pediatric participants , the trial will be  conducted in highly 
specialized center s for clinical research studies in patients with T1DM  having  specif ic experience 
and expertise in the conduct of pediatric trials. In Germany, this trial will be conducted at the 
Diabetes Center for Children and Adolescents, Children's Hospital AUF DER BULT, Hannover 
under supervision of Professor Thomas Danne. All trial nurses, trial coordinator s and sub -
investigators are specially trained in conducting pediatric trials and in the management of diabetes 
in children. All patients that will be included in the trial  are familiar with the site and staff. Following 
diagnosis of T1DM, they have all attended information meetings about their illness and training 
sessions about controlling their diabetes, measuring blood glucose levels, injecting insulin and 
treating hypog lycemia (based on a monitored provocation) at the trial site. This trial gives another 
opportunity to the patients and their parents to learn about hypoglycemia signs and symptoms in 
a well -controlled environment and to learn how to treat hypoglycemia in a real-life emergency 
situation.

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21/58 Facilities at the site allow for overnight stays with 2 patients (and their parents) in a room. The 
patients will be allocated to rooms based on age and their relationships with other patients. Age -
appropriate entertainment will be provided for all patients. The participating patients will be 
investigated with two being present  in the same room as this has proven to distract the  participants  
from the burden of the trial and allows  for interaction with peers , which makes the e xperience 
much more pleasurable. As only otherwise healthy participants  are eligible for inclusion in the 
trial, the risk of transmitting an infection from one participant  to another is negligible.  The 
participating patients will be separated from other  in-patients at the hospital to ensure a minimum 
degree of risk to the trial patients from potential infections as well as any bias this may cause in 
the outcome of the trial.  
The interaction between  the trial staff and the other patients during the overnight  stay helps 
reduce the stress/anxiety felt by the patients prior to the procedure. Parents and patients also 
have the opportunity to discuss day -to-day issues with other participants or staff. In addition, the 
staff can control the patients’ blood glucose values during the night and ensure the  patients  are 
ready to participate in the trial. Following the procedures, the patients will remain under 
observation  in their rooms for 5 hours. Age -appropriate entertainment will be provided for all 
patients during t his period  of observation , which is similar to that occurring after  an event of 
hypoglycemia.  
Currently, there is no plan to include any additional site s in Germany. Should any other sites be 
included, the sponsor will ensure that the same standards and qualifications are applied to these 
sites as well.  
The Kinder - und Jugendkrankenhaus AUF DER BULT is an institution which is dedicated to the 
care of  sick and handicapped children , and was  founded for this purpose more than 150 years 
ago. The mission state ment of the institution expressively states the importance of research for 
pediatric care with focus on creating an acceptable  environment  for children and their families. 
For example, the patient ’s age and personal preference is considered when appointmen ts are 
made , as patients often know each other from the outpatient ward or diabetes camps and choose 
to do studies at the same time  as others . Age -appropriate entertainment and leisure activities are 
available to reduce the stress of being treated as an in -patient and lying in a bed. The trial 
person nel are experienced in pediatric medical procedures. For example, all patients are offered 
a local anesthetic (EMLA®) to reduce the potential pain of venous punctures.  
The patients will be  examined prior to the  trial visit to ensure that patients with health issues are 
identified in time and no health issues are overlooked , which could be aggravated through 
participation in the trial procedures.  
The trial protocol has been adapted to be appropriate for children  between 6  and 17 years  of age . 
The trial patient s will be exposed to minimal invasive procedures, which include insertion of two 
pediatric catheters for a clamp procedure and blood draw. To ensure a minimum of burden to the 
children, the number of catheters has been reduced compared with the adult trials. The site offers 
use of topical anesthetic as part of their standard of care when placing catheters. The use of 
catheters allows injection of insulin/glucose to quickly control blood glucose levels and blood 
samples can be drawn without the need for finger pricks or other sampling methods.  
The n umber and volume of blood sampl es do not exceed what is required for a successful trial 
and do not exceed the limits permitted by Health Authorities. In accor dance with guidance and 
directive  of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) , blood sampling should not exceed 1% of the 
total blood volume at each  visit (i.e. approximately 18 mL for a patient with a body weight of 
20 kg), and should not exceed 3% of the tota l blood volume during a period of four weeks (i.e. 
approximately 54 mL for a 20 kg patient).  
Insulin induced -hypoglycemia is commonly used to assess the safety and efficacy of glucagon or 
similar products in this class. Compared with the trials conducted with dasiglucagon in adults, the 
children in the ZP4207 -17086 trial will have a higher target plasma glucose concentration prior to 
treatment with dasiglucagon and a lower rate of insulin infusion. Both of these measures increase

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22/58 the level of control and r educe the risk for plasma glucose concentrations below the expected 
range (54 -80 mg/dL ; 3.0-4.4 mmol/L) prior to treatment.  
Patients will be in a controlled setting with access to immediate intervention, should this be 
required. If any child reacts differe ntly than expected, rescue provisions based on the type of 
reaction and the timing relative to the clamp procedure are available (see Section  7.4.5.2.3 ). 
With the close monitoring of patients at the clinical site, the considerable experience with the 
insulin induction technique at the clinical site and the pre -defined thresholds for administering IV 
glucose described in the protocol, the risk of the insulin inductio n technique to patients is 
considered to be minimal and well controlled.  
The burden associated with nausea and vomiting  is considered minimal (slight and temporary 
impairment of the health of the patient) and any discomfort is temporary.  The trial was designed 
based on a large amount of data generated in adults, thereby limiting the number of pediatric 
patients needed to be dosed to provide adequate and conclusive data on the safety and efficacy 
of dasiglucagon in this age group.  It is not possible to treat the patients prophylactically with anti -
emetics, as this will bias the tolerability profiles of the treatments. However , treatment of any 
adverse events will be provided when it is needed . In order to reduce the effects of nausea , the 
children will b e given a small meal 1 hour after the clamp procedure is completed.  
The potential risks associated with allergic reactions are similar to those for other therapeutic 
peptides or proteins. Patients with known or suspected allergies to the trial products or related 
products will be excluded from the trial. No severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been 
observed in the clinical trials conducted to date with dasiglucagon and the risk of such an event 
is assessed as low. However, direct access to resuscita tion equipment is ensured at the clinical 
trial sites.  
ADAs have been assessed in all completed clinical trials in adults (n=448). Only one transient 
ADA incidence has been detected in one patient with T1DM in one of the completed clinical trials 
(ZP4207 -16098). The trial was a multiple -dose trial and completers had received a total of 11 
investigational drug doses  (8 injections of dasiglucagon and 3 injections of recombinant 
glucagon). The antibodies were able to bind to dasiglucagon and glucagon and were also capable 
of neutralizing the in vitro  activity of both dasiglucagon and glucagon, but were not associated 
with any AEs or effects on PK or PD in the patient. Due to the cross -over trial design, the induction 
of ADA could not be decisively attributed to  either dasiglucagon or glucagon treatment. Since the 
potential of dasiglucagon to induce ADAs at clinically relevant doses is considered to be low, the 
sponsor considers the risk of developing ADA in this trial as minimal. To ensure minimal burden 
on the trial population ADA assessment will only be performed at the screening and the end of 
trial visit.  
In balancing the risk and benefit of the trial, it has to be taken into consideration that this age 
group is at highest  risk of severe  hypoglycemia due to unplanned physical activities and  the eating 
behaviors  frequently encountered in pediatric patients.

7.1 Overall trial design and plan  
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled, parallel -arm trial 
designed to assess efficacy, safety and PK of dasiglucagon vs. placebo and vs. GlucaGen® in 
children with T1DM. It is currently anticipated that it will be conducted at 2 -3 centers  in Europe 
and 1 -2 centers  in the US A. 
The trial will include the following periods (as illustrated in Figure 7-1, below).  
 A screening period from Day  -30 to Day  -3 
 A treatment period, from Day  0 to Day  1 (day of randomization  and single dosing with trial 
product ). Unblinded trial personnel will do the handling, preparation and administration of trial 
product . All trial assessments will be done by blinded trial personnel  
 A follow -up visits at Day  28 (the end-of-trial visit)

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26/58 7.2 Discussion of trial design and choice of control groups  
The trial will be randomized and double -blind to increase trial validity and to reduce bias during 
evaluation of assessments with the treatments. Since the  3 trial products  are not identical in 
appearance,  (dasiglucagon  and placebo are  liquid formulation s and GlucaGen® is available as a 
powder for reconstitution), unblinded trial personnel , who will not be involved in other trial 
procedures and assessments , will do the handling, preparation and administration of trial product . 
Blinded trial personnel will do all trial assessments performed at the trial center .    
Children  with T1DM will be randomized 2:1:1 in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
dasiglucagon compared to  placebo and  GlucaGen® and PK/PD parameters . The randomized, 
double -blind, parallel arm design with administration of a single  dose of randomized trial product  
(dasiglucagon , placebo  or GlucaGen®) will allow a relative comparison between the  3 treatment 
arms . 
Dasiglucagon will be administered at  fixed doses independent of body weight because  this is the 
intended therapeutic dosing regimen in the emergency treatment of hypoglycemia. The selected 
dose of 1  mg GlucaGen® is the recommended dose for treatment of severe hypoglycemia  (in 
accordance with  the label, children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 0.5 mg 
GlucaGen®). Based on pre -clinical and clinical studies  in adult patients , it has been demonstrated  
that 0.6  mg of dasiglucagon results in an initial PD response (i.e. acute glucose mo bilization) 
comparable to 1  mg GlucaGen® (see also Section 5.1).  
7.3 Selection of trial population  
Dasiglucagon is indicated for treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM. As this 
condition also affects children and there is a therapeutic need for them to get access to safe and 
efficacious emergency treatment , the present trial aims to eval uate the efficacy and safety  of a 
single dose  of SC dasiglucagon compared to placebo and GlucaGen® in children  with T1DM  in 
experimentally induced hypoglycemia in a hypoglycemic clamp procedure.   
The trial will enroll patients in centers in the EU  and in the US A.

7.3.3  Premature withdrawal  from trial 
Participation in the trial is strictly voluntary. A patient  has the right to withdraw from the trial at any 
time and for any reason . If the child chooses to w ithdraw or his/her parents or legal guardian s 
choose to have the child withdrawn , the investigator must be informed immediately. The 
investigator has the right to terminate participation of any patient  at any time if the investigator 
deems it in the patien t's best interest. The reason and circumstances for withdrawal will be 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
7.3.3.1  Possible reasons for patient withdrawal  
A patient will be withdrawn  if the following applies:  
 If a protocol deviation occurs which , in the clinical j udgment of the investigator , can invalidate 
the trial endpoints , the patient will be  withdrawn by the investigator  
 AEs that are considered unacceptable by the patient  or the investigator  
 If the burden of study procedures is considered una cceptable by the patient , their parent(s)  
or the investigator  
If withdrawal  occurs following administration of any trial product , the patient  will be asked to return

reference product ) or trial examinations, the patient must be followed  up by additional 
examinations according to the medical judgment of the investigator until the abnormal condition 
is resolved or the investigator deems further observations or examinatio ns to be no longer 
medically indicated.  
If the patient  meets any of the exclusion criteria 1 -9 at the time of admission to the clinic  at V2 , 
he/she will be excluded from the dosing visit  but may be rescheduled once 1 -7 days later.  
7.3.3.2  Center discontinuation  
The center can be closed and the trial terminated for the following reasons:  
 The center is unlikely to be able to recruit sufficient patients within the agreed time frame  
 The center does not respond to trial management requests  
 Repeat protocol violations  
However, even in case of center discontinuation the center should be kept open as long as 
previously enrolled patients are ongoing. Patients already enrolled should be followed and 
documented for the ir entire  individual trial duration  before actually discon tinuing the center.  
7.3.3.3  Trial  termination  
The sponsor reserves the right to modify or terminate the trial at any time. Possible reasons for 
.termination are:  
 Safety reasons – the incidence of AEs in this or any other trial using the same trial product  
indicates a potential health risk for the patient s 
 New scientific knowledge becomes known that makes the obj ectives of the trial no longer 
feasible/valid  
 Unsatisfactory enrol lment of patients

of temperature deviations outside the acceptable range.  
Please see the trial materials  manual for additional information on handling trial product . 
 
7.4.5  Investigational treatme nt and dosing conditions  
7.4.5.1  Changes  to diabetes management prior to dosing  visit 
At the screening visit, patient s will be instructed by the investigator about the changes in their 
diabetes treatment leading up to and immediately prior to the dosing visits. There should not be 
any changes in their diabetes management until 3 days (72 hours) prior to the planned trial 
product  administration except to switch to NPH insulin. The investigator  will provide individual  
dosing instructions  for this change . Within 72 hours prior to dosing, the use of insulin degludec or 
insulin glargine U300 is prohibited. Within 48 hours prio r to dosing, the use of long -acting insulin 
(e.g. insulin glargine U100 or insulin detemir) is prohibited. Within 22 hours prior to dosing, the 
use of insulin NPH is prohibited. Within 12 hours prior to dosing, the use of any short acting (bolus) 
insulin, except insulin glulisine (Apidra®) is prohibited. During the insulin -induced hypoglycemic 
procedure, continuous SC insulin infusion must be stopped.  
7.4.5.2  Dosing visit  
Patient s will be admitted to the clinic with their parents in the evening of the day before do sing 
(Day 0 ). Their eligibility for the trial will be checked, and only those still eligible will continue and 
remain in the clinic overnight.  
If the patient  meets any of the exclusion criteria at clinic admission on Visit 2, day 0 , he/she will 
be excluded from the dosing visit but may be rescheduled once 1 -7 days later.  
An infusion catheter will be inserted into each arm for the manual glucose clamp procedure, with 
the glucose infusion in one arm and the insulin infusion in the opposite arm  prefera bly, but the 
same infusion catheter can also be used . Another  IV catheter , separated from infusion catheter(s),  
for blood sampling will be placed in the morning before trial product  administration. The hand of 
this arm will be warmed (55 -65 ºC) to arterial ize venous blood. If there are issues with blood 
sampling from e.g. the metacarpal vein for the purpose of glucose measurements, the investigator 
may use a new and more proximal IV access.  
On the morning of the dosing day (Day 1), patient s are required to be in a fasting condition, 
defined as having consumed only water since 22:00 hours the night before. They may consume 
water ad libitum. The patient s must not consume any alcohol or smoke within 24 hours prior to 
dosing.

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32/58 7.4.5.2.1  Diabetes management  
Last injection o r bolus administration via continuous SC insulin i nfusion  of any insulin medication  
should not take place within the 12 hours before dosing. Patient s normally using insulin aspart 
will be switched to human soluble insulin or glulisine for the period between 12 and 10 hours prior 
to dosing, if needed. Patient s using continuous SC insulin i nfusion  will have their pump switched 
off at 22:00 hours.  
To achieve a target glucose level of 90 -160 mg/dL (5.0 -8.9 mmol /L) in the morning of dosing, 
patient s may be administered insulin glulisine and/or glucose at the discretion of the investigator  
by IV infusion using the following glucose infusion rate and insul in infusion rate as a guidance. 
Deviation from the guidance is allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Plasma glucose  levels 
will be checked overnight at regular intervals in order to achieve and maintain the target plasma 
glucose  level of 90 -160 mg/dL (5.0 -8.9 mmol /L). 
A general guidance for administration of insulin IV and/or g lucose IV at the dosing visit  
Fluid infusion rate:  
If plasma glucose < 300  mg/dL, then infusion of isotonic solution with 5% glucose:  
 Age 6–10 years: 80 mL/kg/24 h  
 Age >10 years: 60 mL/kg/24 h  
If plasma glucose > 300 mg/dL the glucose infusion will be substituted with fluid volume of normal 
saline (0.9% NaCl) at same infusion rate as above.  
Infusion of insulin:  
Insulin  infusions should be performed with  0.5 IU insulin gl ulisine (Apidra®) per kg body weight  in 
48 mL NaCl 0.9% according to the following recommendations : 
Glucose  Infusion rate  Insulin dose (IU/kg BW/h)  
>200  mg/dL 10.0 mL/h 0.1 
150–200 mg/dL 5.0 mL/h 0.05

Abbreviation: BW=B ody weight  
7.4.5.2.2  Hypoglycemic clamp procedure and dosing  
At the time of admission to the clinic, which is the day before clamp procedure , the patient ’s 
eligibility must be checked. If the patient  meets any of the exclusion criteria  at the time of 
admission to the clinic  at V2 , he/she will be excluded from the dosing visit  but may be rescheduled 
once 1 -7 days later .  
Eligible patient s will be randomized to either dasiglucagon, placebo or GlucaGen® in the morning 
of the dosing visit . That morning  after 7 o’clock am, the infusion of IV glucose will be stopped. 
This should be at least 30 min utes prior to planned trial product administration. Insulin infusion 
rate and insulin dose are at the discretion of the investigator or can follow the protocol general 
guidance (see above). The investigator may deviate  from the guidance. Insulin IV infusion wi ll be 
stopped when glucose level declines to below 80  mg/dL. 
During insulin -induced hypoglycemia, plasma glucose levels will be monitored closely at the site. 
After the start of insulin infusion, plasma glucose should be checked approximately every 10 
minu tes while plasma glucose is above 110 m g/dL, approximately every 5 minutes once plasma 
glucose is at or below 110 mg/dL , until after dosing , when the patien t’s plasma glucose returns to  
≥70 mg/dL (3.9  mmol/L).  From that time on , plasma glucose should be ch ecked approximately 
every 30  minutes until 300  minutes (5  hours) after dosing. Plasma glucose concentrations will be 
measured using the US FDA -approved glucose analyzer YSI 2300, Yellow Springs Instruments,

Germany.  
At the discretion of the investigator, additional plasma glucose measurements can be taken at 
any time during the trial, for example when there is a suspicion (e.g. symptoms) of a hypoglycemic 
episode.  
Plasma  glucose measurements for safety should only be recorded in the eCRF if they are related 
to an AE (e.g. a hypoglycemic episode).  
In case of persistent post -treatment hypoglycemia, patient s will receive rescue treatment with an 
IV glucose infusion (see Section 7.4.5.2.3  for details). Blood samples for PD and PK assessments 
should still be taken at the specified time  points . 
Once the glucose concentration declines to <80  mg/dL, blood samples for baseline asse ssment 
of plasma glucose and dasiglucagon/GlucaGen PK will be collected 5 min utes later. The samples 
are the baseline samples and should be collected within 2 -5 minutes before trial product 
administration. If plasma glucose is ≥54  mg/dL and <80  mg/dL (3.0 -4.4 mmol /L), trial product will 
be administered.  
If plasma glucose is <54  mg/dL (3.0  mmol /L), IV glucose solution will be administered sufficient 
to raise plasma glucose to within the 54 -80 mg/dL target range. The run -in period will be 
adequately extended (at least 30 min utes) until the above target is achieved and new baseline 
samples for plasma glucose, dasiglucagon/GlucaGen PK, will be collected.  In this case, glucose 
should not be infused within 10 minutes before trial product administration. If plasma glucose is 
not within the target range after the second attempt, the patient  should be rescheduled for a new 
treatment visit within 7 days (+ 2 days).  
After 60 minutes, patient s will be allowed to eat and drink moderately (appropriate to their body 
size, w ith a maximum of 50gr carbohydrate s) to minimize discomfort in terms of potential nausea. 
The amount and type of food and drink consumed will be recorded . Patient s should remain in bed 
until completion of the test procedure 300 minutes after dosing  (bathroom visits are allowed).  
Germany only: Trial  staff will be instructed on pediatric aspects of hypoglycemia  according to the 
Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent 
Diabetes  (ISPAD) 2018  (https ://www.ispad.org/page/ISPADGuidelines2018 ). As the blood 
glucose falls, the initial symptoms result from activation of the autonomic nervous system and 
include shakiness, sweating, pallor and palpitation. In healthy individuals with no diabetes, these 
symp toms occur at a blood glucose level of approximately 70 mg/d L (3.9 mmol/L ) in children and 
54 mg/d L (3.0 mmol/L ) in adults. However, this threshold in individuals with diabetes will depend 
on their glycemic control , with an adaptive shift of the glycemic t hreshold for symptom onset to a 
higher glucose level with chronic hyperglycemia and lower glucose level with chronic 
hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms result from brain glucose deprivation and include 
headache, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision , difficulty hearing, slurred speech and confusion. 
Behavioral changes such as irritability, agitation, quietness, stubbornness and tantrums may be 
the prominent symptom particularly for the preschool child, and may result from a combination of 
neuroglycop enic and autonomic responses. The patient ’s blood glucose values will be monitored 
via Point of Care plasma calibrated blood glucose measurements every 10  minutes or per 
investigator discretion from the start of the hypoglycemia induction protocol. Frequen cy of glucose 
testing will be according to  investigator discretion based on the patient ’s condition, the glucose 
values and their rate of change.  
The investigator must terminate the experiment immediately if he/she feels at any point that a 
patien t’s burde n is not acceptable or safety may be at risk.  
7.4.5.2.3  Rescue p rovisions  for hypoglycemia  
During insulin -induced hypoglycemia, plasma glucose levels as well as the patient  status will be 
monitored closely throughout the procedure. After administration of trial product, if their glucose

hypoglycemia, as follows:  
1. The IV glucose infusion should be initiated if a patient  experiences escalating symptoms of 
hypoglycemia (e.g. start of moderate symptoms of hypoglycemia) at any time during the test 
procedure. Glucose infusion should then be initiated targeting a plasma glucose level 
>70 mg/dL 
2. If plasma glucose is <54  mg/dL be tween t=8 and t=44 minutes, glucose infusion (e.g. 
1-2 mg/kg administered over 5 -10 seconds) should be initiated to maintain plasma glucose 
between 55  mg/dL and 70  mg/dL. Pause glucose infusion if plasma glucose is >70  mg/dL 
3. If plasma glucose is <70  mg/dL at t≥45 minutes, glucose infusion (e.g. 2 -3 mg/kg 
administered over 5 -10 seconds) should be initiated to maintain plasma glucose between 
70 mg/dL and 90  mg/dL. Pause glucose infusion if plasma glucose is >80  mg/dL 
7.4.6  Selection of doses in the trial 
The selected dose of 1  mg GlucaGen® is the recommended dose for treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia  (in accordance with the label, children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 
0.5 mg GlucaGen®). Pre-clinical and adult clinical studies  demonstrated  that 0.6  mg of 
dasiglucagon results in an initial PD response (i.e. acute glucose mobilization) comparable to 
1 mg GlucaGen®. 
The estimation of the dasiglucagon dose in the pediatric trial is based on a PK and PD approach6 
where a previously developed pop ulation  PK/PD model3 for dasiglucagon was extended with an 
allometric scaling component for the PK model4. The PD resp onse was assumed to be similar  in 
pediatric and adult patients as organ maturation for patients above 4 years is assumed not to 
have a meanin gful impact on dasiglucagon PD. The pediatric PK component was developed by 
allometric scaling of cl earance (Cl ) and volume (V) by body  weight from published glucagon PK 
data obtained from 2 clinical trials following i ntramuscular  administration to pediatric (4 to 17 
years) and adult T1DM patients11,9. 
The conclusion of the modelling was that a  dose of 0.6 mg appears appropriate to ensure a fast 
rescue from hypoglycemia for adult patients and children down to a weight of 25 kg. Although the 
dasiglucagon C max and AUC is expected to be higher in children , it does not exceed the total C max 
and AUC obtained in adult s previously administered 2 mg dasiglucagon. The higher total drug 
exposure (AUC and C max) at lower weight is partially compensated by the shorter t ½ and saturated 
PD response. The resulting total time of drug exposure and PD effect (AEU and CE max) is similar 
throughout the weight range . 
7.4.7  Collection of blood samples  
The total blood volume to be obtained from any individual child will be about 43  mL. The maximum 
amount per visit is 12 to 17  mL. These values are within the recommended scope pr ovided by the 
EU5. 
The following blood volume will be taken for each sample at each visit:

7.4.8  Treatment compliance  
Unblinded trial personnel will handle, prepare and administer a ll trial product s.  
7.4.9  Method of assigning  patient s to treatments  
Forty  patient s will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (dasiglucagon/placebo/GlucaGen®) into the 3 
treatment arms and stratified  in 2 age groups: 6 to ≤12 years and 12 to ≤ 18 years  and by injection 
site (abdomen/thigh) . A minimum of 16 patients will be enrolled into each age group, including a 
minimum of  8 patients in either of age groups on dasiglucagon treatment arm.  
Patient s who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of the following 
treatment arms:  
 Dasiglucagon, liquid formulation, 1  mg/mL, 0.6  mL 
 Placebo treatment: Pla cebo, liquid formulation, 0.6  mL  
 Active control treatment: Recombinant glucagon hydrochloride, 1  mg lyophilized powder for 
reconstitution (GlucaGen®, Novo Nordisk) in 1  mL sterile water  (in accordance with the label, 
children below 25 kg body  weight will be administered 0.5 mg GlucaGen®) 
Randomization will be performed using a central, dynamic variance minimization randomization 
method  using an interactive web response system (IWRS) that will randomi ze a patien t to one of 
the 3 aforementioned treatment arms and then assign dispensing unit numbers to that patient.  
An unblinded statistician/programmer who is separate from the trial team will generate the 
randomi zed kit list before the initiation of the trial .  
Treatment assignment will be kept strictly confidential and accessible only to authori zed perso ns 
until after data base lock. However, the investigator s can perform an emergency unbli nding within 
the IWRS in case of an emergency , see Section 7.4.10 . 
7.4.10  Blinding  and breaking the blind  
This is a double -blind trial. Dasiglucagon is available as a liquid formulation and GlucaGen® is 
available as a powder for reconstitution ; they are therefore not identical in appearance . Unblinded 
trial personnel will be responsible for handling, preparing  (according to the prescription from the 
IWRS) , and administering the trial product , and the syringes used for administration will be 
wrappe d in aluminum foil to maintain the blinding at bedside. Parents being in the room with their 
child must be instructed not to look while the unblinded staff is administering the injection . To 
maintain doub le-blind conditions, blinded trial personnel  not inv olved in the administration of trial

records strictly confidential and accessible only to the unblinde d staff. However, unblinded 
personnel at the specialty laboratories  will perform the exposure assessments and ADA 
assessments to make sure that dasiglucagon or GlucaGen® administration is matched with the 
applicable bioanalytical assay . 
Treatment assignment will be kept strictly confidential and accessible onl y to authorized persons 
until after the time of unblinding  (database lock) . Codes with treatment assignment will however 
be readily available in the IWRS to the blinded personnel in case of an emergency.   
The code for a particular patient  may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the identity of 
the treatment allocation would influence the treatment of the patient . The emergency code break 
can be performed using the IWRS. Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code 
must record the time, da te and reason as well as his/her initials in the source documents.  
The breaking of blinded codes in case of medical emergency for a patient  should not unblind the 
trial personnel to the treatment information of other patient s. The person performing the un blinding 
should inform as few people as possible about the result of the unblinding. All persons unblinded 
for a specific patient  should be documented.   
If the trial center needs to break the code, the medical monitor should, if at all possible, be 
contact ed prior to breaking the code and the monitor must be notified within 24 hours after the 
code has been broken.  
7.4.11  Drug accountability and disposal  
Unblinded trial personnel will do the h andling, preparation and administration of trial product . Each 
center will keep accurate records of the trial supplies received, stored, and dispensed, using 
appropriate forms. The trial supplies will be stored under appropriate conditions, locked  and with 
restricted access.  The unblinded monitor will perform the drug accoun tability to ensure 
compliance.  
All unused supplies and all empty and partially empty containers of trial product  will be stored until 
the trial closure visit has been performed and then sent to the sponsor.  
7.4.12  Prior and concomitant therapy  
All concomitant medication s will be recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Prior to the start of the clamp procedure,  the patient ’s eligibility must be checked. If the patient  
has taken any prohibited medication , he/she will be excluded from the dosing visit but may be 
rescheduled 1 -7 days later. Each patient  may only have their dosing visit rescheduled once . See 
Section 7.3.3.1  for possible reasons for patient discontinuation . 
7.4.13  Treatment after end of trial  
After the end of their trial participation, patients should return to the standard of care that they 
received prior to enrollment in the trial. The treat ing physician will be responsible for supervising 
patients after the end of the trial. 
7.5 Assessments and schedule of measurements  
The following assessments and measurements will be carried out at the times specified in the trial 
schedule of assessments  (Table 2-1).

If there are any unclear symptoms or observations the responsible physician in charge may 
perform fu rther medical examinations, other than outlined in this protocol, including further clinical 
laboratory tests, in order to clarify the relevance or to diagnose symptoms.  
7.5.6  Efficacy measurements  
A description of the sample handling and sample processing at the site will be included in the 
laboratory manuals. Validation documentation for the assays must be available prior to sample 
analyses. A bioanalytical report for each analysis of trial PD and PK samples will be prepared.  
Pharmacokinetic measurements  
The exposure to trial medication (dasiglucagon or GlucaGen®) for evaluation of PK will be 
assessed based on plasma concentration data (AUC 0-90min, Cmax, tmax) from samples collected at 
the dosing visit (Visit 2). The sampling procedure is described in Section 7.5.2 . 
Pharmacodynamic measurements  
The plasma glucose profile for evaluation of the primary and secondary clinical efficacy endpoints 
will be assessed based on plasma concentration data (AUE 0-30min) from samples collected at the 
dosing visit (Visit 2). The samples will be sent to the clinical laboratory and analyzed using a 
sensitive and validated a ssay for glucose measurements. The sampling procedure is describe d 
in Section 7.5.2 . 
7.5.7  Safety and tolerability measurements  
7.5.7.1  Safety laboratory tests  
Routine safety laboratory tests will be performed centrally . Samples for safety la boratory 
parameters will be collected at Visits 1  and 3 . Samples for urinalysis will b e collected at Visits 1, 
2, and 3 . The following parameters will be determined:  
 Clinical chemistry:  sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose, urea, creatinine, total bilirubin, AST , 
ALT, gamma -glutamyltransferase , alkaline phosphatase, total protein, C -reactive protein ,

 Hematology:  hemoglobin, red blood cell count (erythrocytes), hematocrit, platelet count 
(thrombocytes), total whit e blood cell count (leucocytes)  
 Coagulation : international normalized ratio , fibrinogen (at screening visit only)   
 Urinalysis:  pH, blood (leukocytes and erythrocytes), pro tein, glucose, ketones, nitrite  
 Immunogenicity:  
Serum  samples for assessment of a ntibodies against dasiglucagon/GlucaGen® will be 
measured at screening Visit 1 and at follow -up Visit 3  by the special laboratory, Y ork 
Bioanalytic al Solutions (York, United Kingdom).  A description of the sample handling and 
sample processing, storage and shipment at the center will be included in the laboratory 
manual . Immunogenicity samples will be analyzed after the last patient last visit.  
The clinical ADA assays, one specific for dasiglucagon and another for GlucaGen®, have 
been validated in accordance with existing  guidelines and recommendations.  
Confirmed positive anti -dasiglucagon antibody samples from treatment - induced or treatment - 
boosted (tit er increase above 5 -fold) ADA -positive patients will be evaluated for binding titer , 
neutralizing potential and neutralizin g titer as well as cross -reactivity towards endogenous 
glucagon. Any treatment -induced or treatment -boosted ADA -positive patients will be 
monitored until the ADA levels return to baseline levels .

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40/58 The in vitro  neutralizing effect of the antibodies will be measured using an assay based on 
glucagon receptor expression in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. The calculated 
sensitivity in previous studies was about 51.8 ng/mL. The assay was also validated for 
recombinant glucagon with similar results. In case of a positive result in the neutralizing 
antibody assay, a titer estimation will be performed. The cell -based neutralizing antibody 
analyses will be performed by a special laboratory, BioAgilytix, Durham, North Carolina , USA.   
No further serum sampling will be needed as the ADA samples can be used for neutralizing 
antibody analysis.  
Residual and additional antibody serum samples may be stored until approval of market 
authorization by the health authorities.  Further characterization of the antibody response may 
be requested by the health authorities.  
A pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and follow -up (Visit s 1, 2 and 3 ) for female 
patients of childbearing potential  only.

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41/58 8. Adverse events  
8.1 Definitions  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials are 
crucial for the protection of patients, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide.  
 
Adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient administered a trial  product  and which 
does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporal ly associated with the use of a trial product , whether or not considered related 
to the trial product .  
Note: This inclu des events from the first trial -related activity after the patient has signed the 
informed consent.  
AEs include:  
 A clinically significant wor sening of a concomitant illness  
 A clinical laboratory abnormality that is clinically significant, i.e. any abnormality that suggests 
a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active 
management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of 
medicine dose or more frequent f ollow -up due to the abnormality  
 Hypoglycemic episodes (see Section 8.4) 
 Injection site reactions  
The following should not be recor ded as AEs, if recorded at screening (on Medical History form 
or eCRF):  
 Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the patient has signed the informed consent  
 Pre-existing conditions , including those  found because  of screening procedures (pre -existing 
conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness)  
 
When assessing an adverse event, the following definitions are use:  
Serious adverse event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  results in any of the following :  
 Results in death  
 Is life-threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitali zation  
 Results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity  
 Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is medically important  
Medical judgement must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to be ‘medically 
important’. A medically important event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
Zealand Pharma A/S  
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42/58 death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes  listed in the definition above . 
Other important events:  
The following events must always be reported to the s ponsor according  to SAE timelines, 
regardless of whether the event is non -serious or serious:  
 Risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST > 3  x ULN and total bilirubin > 2  x ULN, where no 
alternative etiology exist  
 Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the tr ial product  
 Overdose of the trial product  
 Suspected abuse  or misuse of the trial product  
 Medication error involving the trial product  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the trial product.  
Severity  of an adverse event  
The maximum intensity (severity) of all AEs must be assessed by the investigator  and 
documented. Severity should be graded when the AE outcome is known:  
 Mild: No or transient symptoms, no interference with  the patient´s  daily activities  
 Moderate : Marked sy mptoms, moderate interference with the patient´s  daily activities  
 Severe : Considerable interference with the patient´s  daily activities , which  the patient  finds 
unacceptable. A severe reaction does not necessarily deem the AE as serious and an SAE 
is not a lways severe in nature.  
Causality relationship to trial product  
 Probable : Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
 Possible : A causal relationship is conc eivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely : The e vent is most likely related to etiology o ther than the trial product  
Outcome of an adverse event  
 Recovered/resolved : The patient has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment,  the 
condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the patie nt 
signed the informed consent  
 Recovering/resolving : The condition is improving and the patient is expected to recover from 
the event. This term is only applicable if the patient has completed the trial  
 Recovered/resolved wit h sequelae : The patient has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, th e AE must be reported as an SAE  
 Not recovered/  not resolved : The condition of the patient has not improved  and the symptoms 
are unchanged  
 Fatal : This term is only applicable if the patient died from a condition related to the reported 
AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a patient before he/she died should be assessed as 
"recovered/res olved", "recovering/resolving", "recovered/ resolved with sequelae" or "not 
recovered/not resolved". An AE with fatal out come must be reported as an SAE  
 Unknown : This term is only applicable if t he patient is lost to follow -up

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43/58 Suspected unexpected s erious  adverse reactions  
An AE is considered a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) if the nature 
or severity is not consistent with the applicable produ ct Reference Safety Information . For 
dasiglucagon, the expectedness of an AE will be determi ned by whet her or not it is listed in 
the Reference Safety Information section of the I nvestigator’s Brochure . 
 
Adverse event of special interest  (AESI)  
An AESI is an event that, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus (e.g. required by health 
authorities). In this trial , hemodynamic changes are considered AESIs  that are defined as follows:  
 Post-dose clinical signs, or measured vital signs, indicating a clinically significant drop in 
blood pressure including signs of orthostatic hypotension, vas ovagal responses or 
bradycardia.   
 Post-dose change in pulse or blood pressure considered an event of hypo - or hypertension 
as judged by the investigator.  
AESI s must be reported to the sponsor in the same way and with the same timelines as SAE s 
(see Sectio ns 8.2 and 8.3). 
8.2 Collection, recording and reporting of adverse events  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated 
informed consent form (ICF) is obtained until the end of the post -treatment follow -up period (which 
may include contacts for follow -up of safety). In addition, patie nts will be observed for any signs 
or symptoms and asked about their condition by open questioning, such as “How have you been 
feeling since you were last asked?” at each contact with the trial center  (visit or telephone) . 
Patients  will also be encouraged to spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during 
the trial.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to trial product, must be 
recorded and evaluated by the investigator. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be g iven when 
signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology. If no diagnosis can be made, the investigator 
should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs. Investigators must record their opinion 
concerning the relationship of the AE to the trial produ ct. All measures required for AE 
management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.  
 
Each AE must be reported on the AE  page of the  eCRF.  
All AE information should at a minimum include the following:  
 Date and  time of onset and resolution  
 Date and time of investigator ’s first information on the AE  
 Seriousness  
 Severity  
 Causal relationship with trial product  
 Measures taken due to AE  
 Date and time of resolution and final outcome  
Each  AE will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities . 
SAEs  and AESI s, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30 days after 
the last dose of trial product, must be reported to the appropriate  sponsor contact person(s) within 
Zealand Pharma A/S  
Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44/58 24 hours after obtaining knowledge about the event, followed by a complete SAE form as soon 
as more information is av ailable.  For each SAE  and AESI , a separate SAE form should be 
completed.   
The investigator should report the SAE and AESI in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) and the 
system will generate an email to the sponsor´ s Pharmacovigilance Unit (PharmaLex), informing 
them of the reported SAE.  
It is the responsibility of the sponsor ´s Pharmacovigilance Unit (PharmaLex ) to report all SUSARs 
that occur in this trial to the respective competent authorities  and the  institutional review board 
(IRB), or independent ethics committee (IEC)  in accordance with the local requirements in force 
and ICH guideline for GCP.  
8.3 Follow -up of adverse events  
All AEs that are ongoing at the end of the patient’s participation in the trial will be followed  up until 
the event is resolved or reaches a satisfactory outcome as deemed by the investigator .  
Follow -up actions for all SAEs wil l be performed according to appropriate clinical care practices 
and may depend on the nature of the event. These will be determined after internal review and/or 
sponsor review.  
The follow -up information should only include new (updated and/or additional) information that 
reflects the situation at the time of the investigator ’s signature.  
Follow -up information on (S)AEs and AESI s will be updated using the (S)AE form. If a non -serious 
event b ecomes serious during the follow -up, the AE form and SAE form have to be used and 
reporting timelines follow those of a SAE.  
The investigator  must forward follow -up information on SAEs and if previously non -serious AEs 
become SAEs to the sponsor  immediatel y (within 24 hours) after obtaining knowledge about the 
new information . 
The investigator must record follow -up information in the eCRF for non -serious AE and on the 
SAE form for SAEs  and AESI . Follow -up questions to investigators regarding SAEs  are queried 
directly by safety CRO to the investigator.  
Follow -up information must be reported according to the following:  
 SAEs  and AESI : All SAEs and AESI must be followed until the outcome of the events is 
“recovered/resolved,” “recovered/resolved with  sequelae,” or “fatal,” and until all queries have 
been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer, or AEs that are ongoing at time of death 
(where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or 
“not recovered/not r esolved.” Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” 
when the patient has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to 
recover.  
The SAE and AESI follow -up information should only include new (eg, corrections or 
additions) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator's first 
knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non -serious AEs which 
subsequently become SAEs.  
 Non-serious AEs: Non -serious AEs must be followed un til the outcome of the event is 
“recovering/resolving,” “recovered/resolved,” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until 
the end of the follow -up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all 
queries related to these AEs have been  resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer, or AEs 
that are ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the 
outcome of “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved.” Cases can be closed with 
the outcome of “r ecovering/resolving” when a patient has completed the follow -up period and 
is expected by the investigator to recover.

Clinical Trial Protocol, final version 3.0  ZP4207 -17086 (ZEA-DNK -02170) 
 
08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45/58 If a potential hypersensitivity reaction is observed, additional blood samples, as clinically 
indicated, may be required to further char acterize the potential hypersensitivity reaction. If an 
anaphylactic shock is suspected, samples may be taken for the measurement of tryptase. In this 
case, a blood sample should be taken 3  to 4 hours after the event and again approximately 
1 to 2 weeks la ter to determine tryptase baseline levels. In addition, assessments for elevated 
histamine levels may be considered.  
The investigator must ensure that the worst -case severity and seriousness of an event is kept 
throughout the trial, ie, if the severity of an AE changes over time then it should be reported as 
1 AE with the most severity. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow -up with 
re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event.  
If an AE is resolved and re -appears later then it should be reported as a new AE.   
Queries or follow -up requests must be responded within 14 calendar days from the date of receipt 
of the request, unless otherwise specified in the follow -up request.  
8.4 Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia will be regarded as an AE, recorded,  and documented on an AE form (or SAE 
form, if applicable) . 
Hypoglycemia is defined as a decline in  plasma glucose below 3.9 mmol /L (70 mg/dL). Since 
hypoglycemia will be induced during the dosing visit, in accordance with hypoglycemia clamp 
procedure described in Section 7.4.5.2.2 , ONLY  plasma glucose below 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) 
must be reported as an AE , at the dosing visit (V2), and at incidences that IV glucose is given 
after trial product  administration . 
8.5 Pregnancy  
Female patients  must be instructed to notify the i nvestigator immediately if they become pregnan t 
or if they suspect to be pregnant during the trial.  All initial reports of pregnancy in female patients  
must be reported to the sponsor by the trial center  personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge 
of the event using the appropriate pregnancy form. Ab normal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are 
considered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. If a patient  becomes pregnant during 
the trial, a determination regarding t he trial product discontinuation must be made by the 
investigator.  
Because the effect of the trial product on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male 
patient s must be reported by the trial center  personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of th e 
event using the appropriate pregnancy form. Male patient s must be instructed to notify the 
investigator immediately if their partner becomes pregnant or suspects to be pregnant.  
The investigator must follow the pregnancy until the pregnancy outcome is known and the 
newborn infant is 1 month of age. The investigator must report information about the pregnancy, 
pregnancy outcome, and health of the newborn infant(s), as well as AEs i n connection with the 
pregnancy, and AEs in the f etus and newborn infant.  
8.6 Precautions  
Normal precautions taken for a human trial, including the provision of emergency equipment, will 
be taken during this trial. Qualified and well -trained physicians and med ical staff will instruct the 
patients. During a patient ’s participation in the trial, the investigator  should ensure adequate 
medical care for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the trial. The 
investigator  should inform the patient  when medical care is needed for intercurrent  illnesses of 
which the investigator  becomes aware.

8.7 Safety committee  
An internal Zealand Pharma A/S safety committee is constituted to perform the safety surveillance 
of clinical trials with dasiglucagon, including this trial.  
If safety signals  or concerns  are observed, whether  based on reported SAEs, review of all AEs 
and laboratory parameters  reported , or any other  notification of significant findings, the safety 
committee  will respond appropriately to protect the safety of the patients.   
The safety committee  convenes regularly, every quarter , to rev iew the safety information, 
including SAEs, AEs and laboratory data. Additional safety committee  meeting may be called at 
the discretion of any safety committee  member, should new safety signals occur during this time 
interval .

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47/58 9. Data management and quality  control  
9.1 Electronic c ase report forms  
All the information collected during the trial will be recorded in the eCRFs, which are identified by 
patient  number. Synteract will design suitable eCRFs . The investigator will ensure that the eCRFs 
are completed  correctly . The investigator will sign all data entered  in the eCRF electronically , 
signifying agreement with and responsibility for the recorded data.   
9.2 Quality control  
The investigator will permit trial -related monitoring, IEC review, and regulatory inspe ctions, 
providing direct access to source data/documents. Sponsor -authorized quality assurance 
personnel may carry out audits for which the investigator must provide support.  
A monitor from Synteract will supervise the trial . The trial monitor will contact  the investigator 
regularly to discuss the progress of the trial and to check the trial documents including the 
informed consent forms for completeness and consistency.  
The trial monitor or a representative of the sponsor will cross -check the data entered  in the eCRFs 
with the source data at the trial center  and observe the trial procedures in order to verify 
adherence to the trial protocol.  
The eCRFs will be checked for completeness and correctness by the monitor and by the data 
management department of Synteract  according to the Synteract  standard operating procedures , 
and the investigator will resolve  any queries.  
All of the clinical data will be captured via EDC using a web -based tool. The software Marvin from 
the company XClinical (www.xclinical.com) is the preferred EDC software. Marvin is compliant 
with all legislation relevant to EDC  (Food and Drug Administration USA,  21 C ode of Federal 
Regulations  [CFR]  Part 11, GCP).  
The investigator center  staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access 
features (username and password). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The 
investigator will approve the data using an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11),  and this 
approval is used to confirm the accuracy of the data recorded.  
The eCRFs will be used for all patients. The investigator’s data will be accessible from the 
investigator’s center  throu ghout the trial. The e CRFs must be kept current to reflect pati ent status 
at each phase during the course of the  trial. The e CRF will not capture personalized data. The 
investigator must make a separate confidential record of personalized details (name and initials) 
on the patient  identification and enrollment log. The investigator does all changes to data  through 
the EDC system .  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator of the respective center  to ensure that all patient  
discontinuations or changes in trial or other medications entered i n the patient ’s eCRF are also 
made on the patient ’s medical records.  
The eCRFs for any patient  leaving the trial should be completed at the time of the final visit or shortly 
thereafter.  
9.3 Data management  
Data management will be performed according to Synteract  standard operating procedure s.

10.1 Statistical analysis plan  
A separate  Statistical Analysis Plan  will detail  the planned statistical analysis and may include 
necessary adaptations to the planned statistical analysi s before unblinding of the data.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
trial report.  
10.1.1  General considerations  
All data obtained in this trial and documented in the eCRFs will be listed and summarized with 
statistics or frequency tables as appropriate. In case of termination of the trial, all data collected 
up to that time point will be included into the analysis.  
Raw data listings and summary t ables will be generated using SAS© software Version 9 or higher  
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) .  
Continuous variables will be summarized with means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, 
and maximums and valid cases.  
Other summaries (e.g. quartiles, 95% confidence intervals) may be used as appropriate. 
Categorical efficacy and safety variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of 
patient s in corresponding categories.   
10.1.2  Classification of patient s to subsets  
For the statistical analysis,  the randomized patient s will be divided up into the following datasets:  
The following definitions are applicable:  
Safety analysis set 
(SAS)  all patient s who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
trial product  
Full analysis set  
(FAS)  all patient s of the SA S 
Per protocol set 
(PPS)  all patient s of the FA S for whom no relevant protocol deviations 
were documented .  
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. A secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint  will be based on the PPS. Safety analysis will be based on the SAS.  
The decision whether a protocol deviation is relevant or not for the exclusion of patient s from the 
PPS will be made case -by-case in a data review meeting.  
10.1.3  Efficacy endpoints  
For the confirmatory analyses, the primary and secondary  endpoints for the dasiglucagon 0.6 mg 
and placebo treated patients  will be compared. A hierarchical procedure will be applied for the 
control of multiplicity. The primary and secondary endpoints will  be evaluated on the FAS. In the 
primary analysis, those patients  who require rescue IV glucose will be censored at the time to 
plasma glucose recovery.  In a sensitivity analysis, the time to plasma glucose recovery will be 
analyzed without censoring the patien ts who received rescue IV glucose.   
10.1.3.1  Hierarchical testing procedure  
For the confirmatory analyses, the following a priori defined hierarchical inferential test order will 
be applied for the control of the type 1 error rate across the planned multiple  comparisons. The 
primary endpoint and secondary  endpoints will be inferentially evaluated within the FAS in the 
following order, where inference will proceed at the 2-sided 0.05 criterion significance level until 
the first failure to reject the null hypot hesis for a dasiglucagon versus placebo comparison:

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49/58  Primary:  Time to plasma glucose recovery  
 Secondary  1-4: Plasma glucose recovery within 30 minutes, within 20 minutes, within 15 
minutes, and within 10 minutes after study drug injection without administr ation of rescue IV 
glucose.  
 Secondary  5-8:  Plasma glucose changes from baseline within 30 minutes, within 20 minutes, 
within 15 minutes, and within 10 minutes after study drug injection or at the time of rescue.  
The GlucaGen® versus placebo comparisons wi ll not be included in the inferential testing hierarchy, 
since the efficacy of GlucaGen® is previously established, and these comparisons are intended to 
support the validity of the study for the dasiglucagon versus placebo comparisons.  
Analogous supportiv e sensitivity analyses will be conducted in the PP S, but without inference intent.  
10.1.3.2  Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary endpoint, time to plasma glucose recovery, will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier  
estimates for each treatment group in total and stratified by age group and injection site. The median 
time to recovery with 95% confidence interval will be estimated by treatment group , in total and in 
each strat um. 
A stratified l og-rank test will be applied to compare the dasiglucagon 0. 6 mg treatment  group to the 
placebo  group . The same method will be applied to compare dasiglucagon 0.6  mg with Gluca Gen®. 
In the primary analysis, recovery cannot be achieved in those patient s where IV glucose treatment 
is administered. Those patient s who receive IV glucose will be censored (i.e. set to ‘not recovered’) 
at 45 minutes after dosing.  
A further sensitivity analysis will be done by censoring data at the actual time when the  patients  
received glucose  IV. 
10.1.3.3  Secondary efficacy endpoints  
The secondary  efficacy e ndpoints are plasma glucose recovery within 10, 15, 20 and 30  minutes 
after trial product  injection, i.e. achieving a ≥ 20 mg/dL increase in plasma glucose from baseline 
within 0 to 10, 15, 20 and 30  minutes. If a patient  has received an IV glucose treatment before 
recovery, the patient  is set to ‘not recovered’ in the analysis of the 4 endpoints, corresponding to 
censoring in the time -to-recovery analysis for the primary endpoint. The 10-, 15-, 20- and 30 -
minute recovery rates of 2 treatment groups will be compared by a Cochran -Mantel -Haen szel test 
stratified by age group and injection site. The treatment and age group responder rates with the 
95% confidence intervals will be presented for the 10-, 15-, 20- and 30 -minute e ndpoint.  
If due to small or zero cell counts the Cochran -Mantel - Haen szel test fails, non -stratified Fisher’s 
exact tests will be applied instead.  
Plasma glucose changes from baseline at 10, 15, 20 and 30  minutes after trial product injection 
will be analy zed in an analysis of variance  with factors treatment (3 levels) age group (2 levels) 
and injection site (2 levels) for each endpoint. If the rescue IV glucose was administered before 
10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes, respectively, the patient ’s plasma glucose changes from baseline will 
be determined from the value at the time of rescue IV glucose administration. Adjusted treatment 
means will be presented with their 95% confidence intervals. The 4 analysis of variance  will also 
be used to tes t the difference between treatme nts adjusted for age group and injection site.  
10.1.4  Safety endpoints  
Clinical laboratory  data 
Clinical laboratory test results will be marked whether the result is below, within or above the 
respective reference range. The number of values outside of the reference range will be counted.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared.  
10.1.10  Subgroup analysis  
No subgroup analysis i s currently planned.  
10.1.11  Interim analysis  
No interim analysis is currently planned.  
10.2 Determination of sample size  
The primary comparison is between the dasiglucagon and placebo treatment arms. From phase 
2 results , the median time to an increase of 20  mg/dL of the 0.6  mg dose was approximately 10 
minutes. For placebo -treated patient s, the median time to recovery is assumed to be more than 
50 minutes. Assuming an exponential time -to-recovery distribution with median times of 10 and 
50 minutes, a 2-sided log -rank test will be able to detect a difference between dasiglucagon 
0.6 mg and placebo with 9 0% power with a follow -up time of 45 minutes at a 5% significance level 
with 20 patient s randomized to the dasiglucagon arm and 10 patient s to placebo.  
Gluca Gen® is included as a reference to compare the responses and AE profile to  dasiglucagon 
with those to  a marketed product. It is expected that 10 patients in the  Gluca Gen® group will 
suffice for the comparison.

12.1 Responsibilities  
Zealand Pharma A/S is the sponsor of this trial. Synteract , a contract research organization , will 
organize the performance of thi s trial.  
A list with the names and addresses of the responsible institutions and persons is provided in 
Appendix 1 of this protocol.  
12.2 Protocol deviations  
Before data are released for statistical analysis, a treatment -masked review of all data will take 
place to identify protocol deviations that may potentially affect the results. This review will be 
performed without revealing to which trial product the patients  were assigned. The masking of the 
trial products will be maintained for everyone involved in allocating patients  to the analysis sets 
until data are released for statistical analysis. Furthermore, spurious outliers will be evaluated. In 
addition, protocol  deviations that may potentially affect the results will be identified and it will be 
evaluated if patient s and/or data should be excluded from the analysis. Protocol deviations will 
be classified as minor or major in a consistent way. Major deviations fro m the protocol may lead 
to the exclusion of a patient  from the P PS. 
Major protocol deviations may include deviations related to trial inclusion or exclusion criteria, 
conduct of the trial, patient  management or patient  assessment. Unless explicitly decided  
otherwise during the treatment -masked data review, the following will be considered major 
protocol deviations:  
 Violation of one or more major inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 Interruption of administration of trial product  
 Significant deviation from time wind ows  
 Incorrect treatment allocation  
 Missing primary endpoint.  
The violation of several major inclusion/exclusion criteria or the complete absence of efficacy data 
might lead to exclusion of the patient  from the FAS . In that case, the decision should be tak en at 
the treatment -masked data review meeting, and the exclusion from efficacy analysis will be 
justified in the signed notes of the meeting.  
Obviously erroneous data points may be excluded from the analyses or re -analyzed (in case of , 
for example,  serum concentrations). The decision to re -analyze or exclude data points from the 
statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the sponsor and the trial statistician.  
The patient s or observations to be excluded and the reason for their exclusion will be documented 
and signed by those responsible prior to database release. The documentation will be stored 
together with the remaining trial documentation. The patient s and observations excluded from 
analysis sets, and the corresponding reasons, will be descri bed in the clinical trial report.   
12.3 Protocol changes  
This trial protocol may be amended  following the procedures specified by local laws and 
regulations. Substantial amendments to this trial protocol may be implemented only if the approval 
of the CA(s) and a favorable opinion of the ethics committee(s) have been obtained.  
Substantial amendments to the conduct of the clinical trial may arise from changes to the protocol 
or from new information  relating to the scientific documents in support of the trial. Amendments 
to the trial are regarded as “substantial” where they are likely to have a significant impact on  one 
of the following :

08 January 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55/58 To meet regulatory requirements, the eCRF data will be elect ronically stored at centers . The 
CDISC ODM (see http://www.cdisc.org/  for details) will be used to store and archive all electronic 
data at the centers . Since CDISC ODM is also the source for the EDC  web-based system, no 
transcription of data is necessary. CDISC ODM is a platform -independent standardized data 
format including the complete trial metadata and audit trail. The data can be reviewed at a later 
stage using off -the-shelf tools. CDISC provides a complete CDISC ODM Viewer for thes e 
purposes. If needed, PDF  files can be created from the ODM file.  
After trial completion at sites in the US, the investigator will retain and preserve 1 copy of all data 
generated in the course of the trial, specifically including, but not limited to, those defined by GCP 
as essential until:  
 At least 2 years after the last marketing authorization for the trial product  has been approved 
or the sponsor has discontinued its research with the trial  product , or 
 At least 2 years have elapsed s ince the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the 
trial product  
However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s) or if needed by the sponsor.  
At the end of such period, the  investigator will notify the sponsor in writing of his or her intent to 
destroy all such material. The sponsor will have 30 days to respond to the investigator’s notice, 
and the sponsor will have a further opportunity to retain such materials at the spons or’s expense.  
After trial completion at sites in Europe, the sponsor will receive a copy of their data in electronic 
format (e.g. CD) and retain them for at least 25 years.  
One copy will remain with the investigator. The investigator will arrange for the retention of the 
patient identification codes, patient files, and other source data until at least 5 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH r egion, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the product. These documents need to 
be retained for a longer period of time if required by applicable regulatory authorities or by 
agreement with  the sponsor.  
The investigator will keep copies of these trial records (and all trial -related documents, including 
source data) for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private 
practice.

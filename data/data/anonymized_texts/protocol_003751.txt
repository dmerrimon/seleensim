Title of trial: A Random ized, double -masked, placebo -controlled exploratory study to evaluate 
safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of Orally 
administered BI1467335 for 12 w eeks with a 12 w eek follow up period in patients 
with Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without center -involved diabetic 
macular edema (ROBIN study)

Trial site(s): Multi -center trial
Clinical phase: IIa
Trial rationale: This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the oral compound BI 
1467335 and to investigate the changes in DR lesion morphology. An oral 
medication capable to treat the moderate/severe stages of NPDR could fill an 
important gap in which patients with NPDR could receive treatment and thereby 
their disease progression could be slow ed or even reversed. 
Trial objective(s) : The primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability of 12 w eeks treatment of 
oral BI 1467335 compared to placebo in patients with moderately severe to severe 
non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without center -involved diabetic 
macular edema (CI-DME) and secondary to explore the efficacy of BI 1467335 on 
improvement of diabetic retinopathy.
Trial design : Placebo -controlled, double -masked, random ized, parallel design comparison of two 
groups over 12 w eeks of treatment with 12 w eeks of follow -up.
Number of patients 
randomized : 100
Number of patients on 
each treatm ent:50
Diagnosis: Patients with moderately severe orsevere NPDR , i.e. Diabetic R etinopathy Severity 
Scale (DRSS )level 47 or 53 without CI-DME .

Secondary endpoints are the proportion of patients with at least 2 steps 
improvement in the study eye on the DRSS at week 12 compared to baseline, and
the proportion of patients with adverse events (according to CTCAE) other than 
ocular adverse events over the on-treatment perio d(over 24 weeks )
Safety criteria: Adverse event reporting, vital signs, 12 -lead electrocardiogram ( ECG )and standard 
safety laboratory parameters.
Statistical m ethods: The randomiz ation will be stratified by the severity level of the disease under study 
as assessed by DRSS, i.e. level s47 or 53.
Endpoints related to proportion of patients with improvement in DRSS will be 
summarized descriptively and will be analyzed using logistic regression adjusting 
for baseline visual acuity if sufficient numbers of events are observed. . 
 
 
All other endpoints will be analyzed using descriptive statistics .

1The medication will be administered once daily, beginning on Day 1 (Visit 2a) . Scheduled last day of trial 
medication intake is Visit EOT where the trial medication will be administered at the site from the kit that the 
patient returns to the site , unless patient discontinues pr ematurely for safety reasons or w ithdraws consent .
2This Visit has also to be com pleted for patients who are withdraw n or who have discontinued the trial early: in 
case of early discontinuation , visit EOT will be completed as soon as possible after the last trial medication 
intake instead of the next planned treatment period visit, and the visits FU1, FU2 and FU3 should be 
performed 4, 8and 12 w eeks after the last trial medication intake, respectively. If patient discontinues 
prematurely for safety reasons or w ithdraws consent, 
trial medication administration and PK collection will 
not be performed at EOT Visit. Please refer to Section 6.2.3.
3The screening period should be kept as short as possible, but the minimum time interval betw een Screening 
and Randomiz ation is necessary to allow for receipt of confirmation from the central imaging reading center, 
laboratory and ECG results.
4Prior to an y study related procedure; may also be done at an extra visit up to 2 w eeks before Visit 1. Re-
consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and should be conducted 
according to the sponsor’s instructions. Note: Collection of adverse events and other study requirements begin 
at the time patient signs informed consent.
5Serum/ plasma and DNA biobanking is optional. To allow  the collection of additional blood samples for 
serum/plasma and DNA biobanking a separate informed consent must be obtained. 
6Vital signs (to be performed prior to blood collection) include: pulse rate, arterial systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and respiratory rate (Section 5.2.2 ).
7Pregnancy testing : at screening s erum pregnancy test is done (XS), and at the other visits as a reflex when urine 
testing (XU) is positive.
8At screening and follow -up visits 12-lead ECGs should preferentially be performed prior to blood sampling. 
During the treatment period, ECG should be performed approximately 60 min after trial medication intake. At 
visits 3 and 4 athe ECG may be performed later at that day . ECGs will be recorded a fter the patients have 
rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. Please refer to Section 5.2.4.

10The DRSS evaluation is performed by the independent central imaging reading center.
11At visits 2a ( randomiz ation call), 3 and 4 a, the respective IMP kit number has to be allocated to the patient via 
IRT. At Visit EOT the IRT call is performed to close out the patient (Termination of medication).
12All patients will complete a trial medication diary during the treatment phase to document medication intake 
and treatment compliance. The diary will be dispensed to the patients and col lected and reviewed by site-staff 
at the following visits. Please refer to Section 6.2.2 .
13Site staff will call the patient in advance to the Visit 2 and EOT visit to remind of trial medication intake and 
time recording on the day before the visit. Please alsorefer to Section 6.2.2 . 
  
 
 
 
17Study c ompletion of patient participation also needs to be indicated in the eCRF if the patient withdraws 
prematurely following randomiz ation (see Section 3.3. 4).
18QuantiFERON®TB test and HBsAg test 
19If the last day of trial medication intake is different from the EOT visit, the date of the last day of trial 
medication intake will be used for calculation of the FU visit dates
20After the individual patient’s end of the trial the investigator should report only any occurrence of cancer, 
related SAEs and related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of and only via the SAE form, 
please see section 5.2.6.2.1 .
21Screening visit should be performed in tw o visits. After Informed consent is obtained, f undus photography 
should be performed and sent to central reading service. If patient is eligible based on the DRSS grading, the 
patient sho uld return to com plete the rest of the screening . In case of scheduling difficulty for certain patients, 
screening can be performed in one visit. If screening is done as one visit, fundus photography should be 
performed in line with other ophthalmological examinations .
22Alcohol, caffeine and tobacco at screening, Alcohol and caffeine at other visits.
23Refer to Section 6.2.1 for re -screening and re -test.
24For all ocular AEs (marked as Ocular Event in the CRFs), ocular s ymptoms present at the time of the event 
must be reported on the Ocular Symptoms CRF page ,including red and/or dry eye, eye pain, flashing lights, 
floaters, photophobia and w atering eyes .

Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) is developing BI 1467335, an oral, small -molecule inhibitor of 
amine oxidase copper -containing 3 (AOC3) also known as vascular adhesion protein -1 
(VAP -1) and semicarbazide -sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) for the indication non -
proliferative diabetic retinopathy  (NPDR) without center- involved diabetic macular edema 
(CI-DME).
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Diabetes mellitu s(DM) denotes a heterogeneous group of disease which share common 
elements of h ypergl ycemia due to lack of insulin (Ty pe 1) or glucose intolerance due to 
insulin deficiency , impaired effectiveness of insulin action, or both (Type 2) . The chronic 
hypergly caemia of diabetes is associated with long -term damage, d ysfunction and failure of 
various organs, foremost the ey es, kidney s, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.
In 2015, about 415million people suffered from diabetes worldwide (of which 95% hadType 
2 dia betes), and this number is predicted to increase to 642million patients by  the year 2040
with particularl y large increases in prevalence observed in the developing world [R16-
4703]. 
Duration of diabetes is a major risk factor associated to the development of diabetic 
retinopathy (DR). In the US A, the prevalence rate of DR is estimated at 28.5% of the patients 
with diabetes aged 40 and older [ R16-3206, R12 - 1768 ]. Worldwide prevalence is estimated 
at 34.6%. Approximately 10% (range between 5- 15%) of the patients with diabetes also 
suffer from diabetic macular edema (DME). DME is the leading cause of visual loss in the 
diabetic population. I t affects central vision and can lead to decline in vision ranging from 
slight visual blurring to blindness, substantially  affecting independence and quality  of life. In 
about 20 -25% of the patients with DME, vision is impaired to a level of 20/40 or worse.
The molecular mechanisms by which diabetes leads to DR and DME includes possible roles 
for h ypergl ycemia -induced oxidative stress, poly ol pathway  activation, and production of 
advanced gly cation end products [R17-0333] . However, the exact mechanism is u nclear. At 
the earl y phase of the disease the patient might be asymptomatic and the retina appear to be 
normal on clinical routine examination, however, on more detailed testing, the retinal 
thickness is reduced due to neuronal loss, and the color vision a nd contrast sensitivity  are all 
abnormal. In the NPDR stages, t he vascular retina begins to become abnormal, the vascular 
wall become sweaker, and small microaneury sms are formed (this is mild NPDR). These 
microaneury sms start to leak fluid into the retina , leading to the formation of exudates and 
further d ysfunction of the retinal neurons. Some of retinal blood vessels start to become 
occluded and localised hypoxia endure. Vascular sluggish leads to venous changes and 
haemorrhages , whilst hypoxia induces n ew vessel formation, initially  in form of intraretinal 
microvascular abnormalities (I RMA) (this is moderate orsevere NPDR) and eventuall y 
neovascularisation outside the retina (proliferative diabetic retinopath y, PDR). 
Patients with NPDR without center -involved DME (CI -DME) are in general not display ing 
visual impairment. Visual impairment usually  occurs with the development of CI -DME. It is 
important to distinguish DME and CI -DME in terms of treatment, as the latter is usually  
treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF ). While DME is known to

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 2017occur at an y point during the course of DR, it is associated with the degree of diabetic 
retinopathy  that is present: Visual function is usually  assessed b y testing visual acuity  (VA) 
using spec ialized reading charts (e.g. the Earl y Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy  Study  
(ETDRS) chart and Snellen acuit y chart). The term best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
means the best possible vision achieved b y the patient after corrective prescription glasses are 
used. Snellen acuit y chart is commonly  used in optician shop for prescription glasses, 
however, ETDRS chart is becoming the gold standard for clinical trial (e.g. the ETDRS 
visual acuity  score of 85 or Snellen 20/20 representing normal vision).
As visi on is still good in patients with NPDR without CI -DME, the usual standard of care is 
currentl y observation until either CI -DME or PDR develops. Upon onset of CI -DME, 
intravitreal injection with anti -VEGF therapy  is indicated, such as aflibercept (Ey lea®) or 
ranibizumab (L ucentis®). Patients who progress to PDR without DME are indicated for 
panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), which is associated with an initial vision loss but better 
long-term effects on vision compared to no treatment. Therefore, it is recom mended to 
initiate PRP only  in specific cases with severe or very  severe NPDR [ R17-0368 ].
Ranibizumab (L ucentis®)was recentl y approved by the FDA for treatment of DR with and 
without DME . Aflibercept is indicated for treatment of DR is in patients who have CI -DME.
Few trials are currently  investigating treatment options for patients with NPDR who do not 
have CI -DME. One trial is the EUROCONDOR study ,which investigates the effects of 
somatostatin and brimonidine (neuroprotective agents) on patients with mild NPDR or 
absence of DR (i.e. less than level 20 on the severity  scale) where anti -VEGF and laser 
therap y are not indicated. The preliminary  results showed topical treatment with somatostatin 
and brimonidine seems not useful for preventing the development of neurodegeneration, at 
least in a p eriod of 2 years of follow -up. Topical treatment with somatostatin and brimonidine 
is effective in arresting the progression of neurodegeneration after excluding patients in the 
low quarti le of IT values (best retinal function). That is, in those patients in whom some 
degree of neurod egeneration is alread y present. Somatostatin has a positive effect in 
microvascular disease b y arresting or maintaining the number of microaneurysms in 
compari son with placebo [R17-
1803 ].
Another ongoing study  (recruitment started in January  2016) is Protocol W from the Diabetic 
Retinopathy  Clinical Research Network , [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ]which 
will investigate the effect of aflibercept vs placebo on the progression of patients with 
moderate to severe NPDR (no CI -DME) to PDR or onset of CI -DME. Estimated time of 
completion of the first primary  endpoint (i.e. progression of disease) is 2020.
Lastl y, the Panorama study  in patients with moderate to severe NPDR without CI -DME has 
also 
started in 2016 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ].The primary endpoint is 
2-step improvement in Diabetic Retinopathy  Severity  Scale (DRSS )at 6 and 1 2 months. 
As patients with NPDR without CI -DME generally  still have good vision, their disease may  
go unnoticed in regions with limited check up by  ophthalmologists. Retinal camera is now 
commonly  used for screening of diabetic patients, and identificati on of these patients is now 
common in developed nations. Furthermore, it is expected that smartphones with specialized

Normally , NPDR patients will progress to prolif erative stages of the disease or onset of CI -
DME, triggering treatment with PRP, intravitreal injections with anti -VEGF therapies and/or 
focal/grid photocoagulation therap y [P12-13318] . Anti -VEGF injections are invasive and 
expensive, and more importantly  patient sneed frequent monitoring and multiple visit to the 
retinal specialists. On average, patients with CI -DME need 9 to 10 injections in the first 12 
months of treatment [R15-5225] . Laser treatment for PDR, especiall y PRP, is associated with 
risks of developing retinal side effects, including peripheral and central visual field loss, and 
mild visual loss. Furthermore, despite these treatments, many  patient s would still have 
bleeding inside the eye leading to visual loss from a few day s to a few months, and about 
15% of patients required surgical removal of the blood, risking significant visual loss [R17-
0293 ]. 
Therefore, there i s a great need for medications, in particular for patients with NPDR without 
CI-DME, which are non-invasive such as an oral compound, which will slow progression or 
even reverse the retinal damage. A 2 -step improvement of DRSS was shown to be possible 
by monthly  injection of anti
-VEGF agents in patients with moderate or severe NPDR as well 
as CI -DME [R17-0367]. The study was aimed to treat CI-DME, but the improvement of the 
retinopathy  was a bonus . The FDA approved the anti- VEGF agents as a treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy  in patients with CI -DME.
The moderately  severe / severe NPDR without CI -DME group is considered to be the most 
appropriate target group. Patients with CI -DME and / or PDR, would normally  be treated 
with anti-V EGF agents and / or PRP laser. In patients with milder NPDR, it is more difficult 
to get improvement due to the ceiling effect. 
Treatment with an oral AOC3 inhibitor is anticipated to become first -line therap y for patients 
with moderate / severe NPDR wit hout CI -DME. There are current studies using anti- VEGF 
agent sto treat these target patients using 2 steps improvement of DRSS as an endpoint .
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
AOC3 is a gl ycosylated trans -membrane protein with oxidative activity  towards primary  
amines [R15-6139]. I t is mainly  expressed on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and 
adipocy tes[R15-5788] . In the ey e, AOC3 immunoreactivit y can be found in the arteries of 
the optic nerve, retina and choroid [R17-1787] . Under inflammatory conditions ,the protein is 
exposed at the extracellular membrane of endothelial cells towards the lumen of the vessels , 
where immune cells can recognize and bind to the extracellular part of the enzy me, which 
leads to e.g. reduced rolling velocity  of neutrophils on the endothelium [R15-2803] . The 
enzy matic activity  is essential for the support of immune cell transmigration towards the 
interstitium. Besides the membrane -bound f orm, a soluble form of AOC3 (sAOC3) can be 
found in plasma as well as in the vitreous. The sAOC3 consists mainly  of the extracellular 
enzy matic domain of AOC3. Shedding from the membrane is catal yzed by metallo -
proteinases, which areincreased under endoth elial stress and inflammation [R15-5787]. 
Elevated levels of sAOC3 can be found in patients suffering from diabetes, atherosclerosis, 
myocardial infarction and nonalcoholic steatohepati tis. Especially  in proliferative diabetic

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 2017retinopathy , soluble AOC3 is elevated in plasma as well as in the vitreous of patients [R15-
5787 ]. 
In preclinical studies, it was shown that AOC3 is involved in the migration of ly mphocy tes, 
granulocy tes, leukocy tes and macrophages to the site of inflammation [ R15-6045; R15- 6047; 
R15-6048 ; R15-5654 ]. Inhibition of AOC3 by  an antibody  or small molecule reduced 
inflam mation in a variet y of disease models [ R15-1863; R15- 6059; R15- 1868; R15- 6056; 
R15-6058 ]. In support of the role of AOC3 as a mediator of inflammation, AOC3 -deficient 
mice have impaired rolling and transmigration of leukocy tes and reduced recruitment of 
granulocy tes to sites of inflammation [ R15-6045; R15- 2803]. 
Several literature experiments with AOC3 enzyme inhibitors in pre -clinical models of 
diabetes induced vascular permeability  and diabetic retinopath y have been published. A 
model of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes exhibited increased plasma sAOC3 levels as 
well as retinal vascular permeability  as measured by  fluorescein extravasation [R15- 1862 ]. 
Treatment of rats with reversible AOC3 inhibitors reduced the vascular permeability  in a 
dose dependent manner. In a model of laser -induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), 
treatment with AOC3 inhibitor reduced macrophage infiltration in the lesions as well as the 
lesion size in a dose dependent manner [R16-5320] . Further, the pathological 
neoangiogenesis could be reduced in an oxy gen induced retinopath y (OIR) mouse model by  
the treatment with reversible AOC3 inhibitors [R17-1786].
The observed effects of BI 1467335 on models of ocular diseases argue for an improvement 
of neuronal function and prevention of pathologic neoangiogenesis b y AOC3 inhibition. 
The data therefore argue for the treatment of patients with NPDR and progression to PDR 
with BI 1467335 for the prevention of loss of visual acuit y due to neuronal dysfunction and 
neovascularization.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
The current standard of care for patients with NPDR without DME is mostly  observation 
until the disease progresses significantly , while the treatment options in these advanced 
stages are either aggressive (laser treatment) and can damage the retina ,or they  are costly  and 
invasive (anti -VEGF injection therapy ).Therefore, there is a large unmet medical need for:

NPDR and PDR, thereb y delay ing the complications associated to progression to/of PDR, 
or progression to CI -DME and thereb y delay ing or preventing the need for intravitreal 
injections/focal photocoagulation or PRP
Improved/non- invasive route of administration (i.e. orals, topicals)
Treatment options for patients refractory  to anti- VEGF
Safer treatment options (i.e. no damage to chorioretinal structures)
Thus an oral medication capable to tre at the moderate/severe stages of NPDR could fill an 
important gap in which patients with NPDR could receive treatment and thereb y their disease 
progression could be slowed or even reversed. 
This study  is designed to assess the safety andtolerability  of the oral compound BI1467335 
and to investigate the changes in DR lesion morphology  as assessed b y the DRSS and visual 
acuity .
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
BI1467335 has not been previously  investigated in patients with NPDR or other ocular 
diseases, and the sponsor is not aware of an y clinical studies on the effects of orall y 
administered AOC3 inhibitors in patients with NPDR. Although NPDR without CI -DME is 
currentl y only observed until either CI -DME or PDR develops, a safe and eas y to administer 
compound to slow further disease progression would be beneficial to avoid invasive 
treatments in advanced stages . Treatments 
such as intravitreal injections require multiple 
injections over time and come with procedural risks, such as endophthalmitis, vitreous 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, traumatic cataract, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP).

Planned treatment is 12 weeks with 10 mg q.d. The 10 m g dose was selected based on t he 
available data and currently available PK and toxicology  data support the administration of 
BI 1467335 for 12 weeks. The planned 12 week treatment durat ion is considered sufficient to 
observe potential impact of BI 1467335 in patients with NPDR without CI-DME
.
This study  also includes a 12- week follow -up observation period after stopping the trial 
medication . While, based on itshalf-
life, BI 1467335 is expected to be eliminated from the 
blood much earlier, the 12- week follow -up was chose ndue to irreversible binding of t he 
BI1467335 to its target. This 12 -week follow -up would allow observation of an y prolonged 
effects of BI 1467335. 
This is a newly  developed drug at an earl y stage of testing and therefore an individual benefit 
cannot be guaranteed . As with any  new drug, unknown or unexpected adverse events may  
occur. Patients enrolled in this study  will have a 50% chance of r eceiving placebo or 
receiving the active drug. I t is not known whether there will be any  benefit on objective 
parameters such as the level of severit y determined by  the DRSS or on clinical sy mptoms 
such as visual acuit y for those patients following 12 week s of treatment with BI 1467335. 
This is a trial of short duration, and the assignment to the placebo arm is not associated with a 
higher risk to the patient due to slow progression of the NPDR
.However, both patients on 
active drug as well as patients on placebo may  receive rescue treatment according to local 
clinical standard of care if their visual acuit y worsens significantly or if a clinically 
significant progression of NPDR is detected during the trial (please also refer to Section 
4.2.1 ).
While individual patients may  benefit through study  procedures (monthly  assessment of 
disease severity , safet y monitoring) , they  may  also contribute to a better understanding of the 
underly ing disease , disease management, or better drug development in the future. 
Ophthalmological exams used in this study  are non -invasive and are standard procedures 
used inophthalmological practice and will be used in this study  accordi ng to usual medical 
practice. 
Some of the examinations, like BCVA, are used commonl y even in healthy p eople 
forvisual correction,

will be excluded from further examinations (see Section 3.3.4).
Some of the examinations require pupil dilatat ion, which may  lead to temporary  light 
sensitivity  and impaired vision. This is frequently done with ophthalmological exams and 
ophthalmological clinics should have sufficient experience forhandling this (patient 
instructions, disposable eye coverings, etc.).
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ 
safet y, see also Section 5.2.6.1.4, adverse events of special interest.
Continuous safet y monitoring will be performed in regular Medical Quality  Review Meetings 
according to the sponsor ’s Standard operating procedures (SOPs) (please refer to Section
8.7).

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
The trial is a randomiz ed, double -masked, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
proof of clinical principle study . Patients will be enrolled into the study  once they  have 
signed the informed consent form. Due to high probability  of patients screen failing due to 
DRSS grading on fundus photograph y, screening should be performed in two parts .Fundus 
photograph y should be performed first, a ndif patients a re eligible based on the fundus 
photograph y results, patients should return to complete the rest of the screening 
examination s. In case of scheduling difficulty  for certain patients, screening can be performed 
in one visit .Patients become eligible for randomiz ation if they  have met all inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria. Randomized patients will take 10 mg q.d. of BI 1467335 or 
matching placebo from Day 1 to Day  85(12 weeks). Following conclusion of a 12-week
treatment period, or upon withdrawal from trial medication , all patients will be eligible to 
receive local standard of care therap y at the discretion of the investigator . Patients will be 
followed up at three follow -up visits until twelve weeks after the End of treatment visit 
(EOT
).

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 2017for this patient group at t his stage of the disease, this trial aims to improve the level of disease 
severit y at earl y time points in the course of the disease.
The treatment period of 12 weeks is deemed adequate to evaluate safet y and tolerability , and 
is covered b y currently  avai lable toxicology  data.
A placebo control arm was chosen for this trial in order to compare BI 1467335 and placebo 
regarding safet y and tolerability in patients with NPDR. Approximately  equal numbers of 
patients will be randomized to both treatment groups. Randomiz ation will be stratified b y the 
level of disease severit y (please refer to Section 7) based on DRSS level s 47 or 53 as this may  
have impact on the expected effects regarding the primary  outcome.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A sufficient number of male and female patients with DM either ty pe 1 or ty pe 2 and NPDR 
without CI-DME will be screened to ensure the randomiz ation of 100 patients from approx. 
20-25 study  sites. Forconsistent evaluation of endpoints only  prequalified study  sites will 
participate, and retina images (  fundus photograph y,  will be evaluated b y 
an independent central reading center (CRC). 
It is expected that around 4 -5 patients will be randomiz ed at each study site. If enrolment is 
delay ed, additional sites may  be recruited. Permission to enroll more than 15 patients per site 
must be obtained from the Trial Clinical Monitor ( TCM) at BI. This will only  be allowed 
after a careful review of the enrolment status and of the site.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive across all countries within the study , i.e. 
screening for the trialwill stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of 
patient s has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will 
then not be allowed to screen additional patient s for this trial .
Re-screening and re -testing is described in Section 6.2 . 
A log of all patient s enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day  of enrolment), the sponsor should be contacted immediately .   
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Patients with NPDR without CI -DME at the Screening visit are eligible for inclusion if they  
fulfil all of the inclusion criteria ( Section 3.3.2 ) and none of the exclusion criteria ( Section 
3.3.3 ). Only  one study  eye per patient may be enrolled according to Section 3.3.1.1 (Study  
eye criteria). Ophthalmologic evidence of NPDR without CI -DME with DRSS level s 47 or
53 in the study  eye needs to be confirmed b y the CRC.
Please refer to Section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the in clusion and exclusion criteria.

The following procedure is to be applied for the selection of the study  eye at baseline:
If only one ey e meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, this ey e will 
qualify  for the study  eye. The fellow ey e will be examined for evaluation of safet y. 
If both ey esin an individual patient meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria, the eye with the higher (=worse) DRSS level at screening will qualify  
for the stud y eye.
oIf both ey es show the same DRSS level, the ey e with the worse BCVA letter score 
(as assessed b y ETDRS chart at screening )will qualify for the study  eye; 
oIf both ey es show the same DRSS level a nd the same BCVA letter score, the ey e 
with the clearer lens will qualify  for the study  eye;
oIf both ey es show exactly the same conditions mentioned above , the left ey e will 
be selected to be the study  eye.

must be documented in the patient files and Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ).If the 
reason for discontinuation is death, this should be reported on the SAE form as well, 
regardless of causal relationship.
3.3.4.1 Withdrawal from trial treatment
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from trialtreatment if:
The patient wants to withdraw from trialtreatment , without the need to justify  the 
decision
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product
(see Section 4.2.2.1)
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons ( such 
aseye surgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy )
Worsening of the disease that requires ey e treatment or procedures prohibited in the trial
(see Section 4.2.2.1)
The patient has repeatedly  shown to be non -compliant with important trialprocedures 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative , is not willing or 
able to stick to the trialrequirements in the future.
Patient develops QTc F> 500 ms or change from Visit 1 > 60 ms.
Given the patient ’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuation and follow up as outlined in the Flow Chart and Sections 6.2.2 . and 6.2.3 .
For all patient sthe reason for withdrawal from trial treatment (e.g. adverse events) must be 
recorded in the eCRF . These data will be included in the trial database and reported.
If a patient becomes pregnant during a trial, study  drug must be stopped and patient will 
follow the same procedure for earl y treatment discontinuation as outlin ed above. After the 
last study  follow -up visit, the patient will be followed up until birth or otherwise termination 
of the pregnancy . Patient’s data will be collected and reported in the clinical trial report until 
last patient last visit and any  events t hereafter , including outcome of the pregnancy , will be 
reported in the BI Pharmacovigilance database.
If patient develops clinically  significant adverse reaction, judged by  the investigator, related 
to FA procedure, further FA will not be performed for th at patient. Patient may  continue in 
the study  based on the investigator’s assessment.
3.3.4.2 W ithdrawal of consent for trial participation
Patients may  withdraw their consent for trial participation at any  time without the need to 
justify  the decision.
This will however mean that no further information may  be collected for the purpose of the 
trial and negative implications for the scientific value may be the consequence. Furthermore 
it may  mean that further patient follow up on safety cannot occur.

randomiz ation plan. The assignment will occur in a masked fashion via Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT). To faci litate the use of the IRT, the investigator will receive all necessary  
instructions. 
Note that the medication number is different from the patient number. Site personnel will 
enter the medication number in the eCRF .
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
IRT will allocate medication kit numbers at Visit 2a, 3 and 4 a. The m edication number will 
be different at each visit. At each visit, the 
medication box with corresponding medication 
number must be dispensed to the patient. The amoun t of trial medication dispensed and 
returned will be recorded on drug accountability  forms.
The first trial medication dose at Visit 2a is given to the patient by  the site staff at the 
investigational site, and trial medication isthen dispensed to the pa tient for home 
administration (please refer to Section 4.1.4.2). 
The medication will be administered once dail y, beginning on Day  1 (Visit 2a) until the day  
ofEOT Visit (Day  85 according to the visit schedule) , unless patient discontinues 
prematurel y. All treatments will consist of two tablets ( BI1467335 or placebo )to be taken 
orally  approximately  at the same time each day . This will not be changed during the entire 
study  treatment period (V isit 2a toEOT).
4.1.4.1 Trial med
ication administration at the study  site
At Visits 2a, 3 , 4aand EOT the administration of trialmedication is done at the study  site 
under the supervision of the 
investigator or qualified site staff. Two tablets of the trial drug
will be administered with a glass of water after predose blood sampling. The actual visit date 
and time of trialdrug administration at the visit will be recorded in the eCRF at each visit. 
At Visit s2a, 3 and 4a , new trial medication boxes will be used for administration of the 
morning dose at the clinical site and will be dispensed for home administration . At EOT visit 
trial medication will be taken from the box that the patient returns to the site.
Patients who erroneously take the morning dose of trial medication before coming to the 
clinic at visit s 3 and EOT (with scheduled PK samples ) should have the visit rescheduled as 
soon as possible, ideally  onthe following day .
The site staff will instruct and remind the patients :
how t o fill in the trial medication diary  and to bring the diary  to the next visit
not to take their trial medication at the morning of the next visit as they  will be dosed 
while at the sites after blood samples are taken (as described in Section 6.2.2 )
to bring all trial medication blisters within the box (regardless of whether empty  or not) 
back to the investigational site

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 20174.1.4.2 Trial medication administration at days without site visits
At home, trial medication will be self- administered by  the patients. Patients areto be 
instructed to take the tablets orally  with water in the morning at approximately  the same time 
every  day.Medication can be taken with or without food. Patients will record the 
administration dates and times of all doses with the help of a trial drug diary  as outlined in the 
Flow Chart and in Section 6.2.2 .
If a dose is missed b y more than 8 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose 
should be taken as scheduled. No double doses should be taken and dose reductions are not 
permitted.
In case medication runs out (or is lost) at home, the patient will go to the site for an additional 
visit in order to be provid ed with replacement medication. If a reserve trial medication is 
needed, the investigator or authorized site staff will assign reserve trial medication via the 
IRT s ystem.
Patients should be instructed to bring all unused drug and empt y study blisters to the study  
site at every  visit during the treatment period.
4.1.5 Masking (b linding) and procedures for un masking
4.1.5.1 Masking
Patient s, investigators and every one involved in trialconduct or analy sisor with an y other
interest in this double -masked trial will remain masked with regard to the randomiz ed
treatment assignments until after database lock with the exceptions noted below .Please refer 
to Section 4.1.5.2 for rules of breaking the code for patients in emergency  situations.
The randomiz ation code will be kept secret by  Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. The 
randomiz ation codes will be provided to bioanal ytics prior to last patient out to allow for the
exclu sion from the analyses of PK samples taken from placebo patients and to a member of 
the team conducting the interim PK/PD analy sis. Bioanal ytics will not disclose the 
randomiz ation code or the results of their measurements until the trialis officially  unmasked.
If a planned interim PK/PD analy sis is conducted, a ccess to unmasked data required to 
conduct the planned interim PK/PD analy sis will be 
restricted to members of the trial and 
project teams who are not directly  involved with study  conduct . The logistical aspects of 
conducting the interim PK /PD analysis, and th e plan to access interim results will be 
described in the Interim Analysis Logistics Planand Results Access Plan.
4.1.5.2 Unmasking and breaking the code
Emergency  unmask ingwill be available to the investigator / pharmacist / investigational drug 
storage manager
via IRT. It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of 
the trial drug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trialparticipants. The reason for un masking must be

5.1 A SSESSMENT OF EFFICAC Y
For the endpoints, baseline is defined as the value at V isit 2a ; if not measured at Visit 2a then 
baseline is the value at Visit 1. All ophthalmologic examinations will be performed on both 
eyes, as described below . 
Centrally  collected ophthalmological data (color fundus photography , 
will be transferred from the CRC to the sponsor’s database. The 
local measurement data will remain at the study  sites as source documents.
Ifclinicall y significant worsening is observed in the assessments of efficacy during the study ,
itwill be reported as adverse events in the eCRF and on the SAE form if applicable ( please 
also refer to 
Section 5.2.6.1.1).
Color Fundus Photography
Seven -field or modified 4 -field digital fundus photographs will be obtained from both ey es 
by a qualified person according to the imaging manual to collect all data for the assessment of 
the ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy  Severity  Scale (DRSS). The images will be sent to the 
independent CRC who performs the grading on the basis of the DRSS. This scale evaluates 
retinal hemorrhages, venous beading and IRMA and divides diabetic retinopathy  into 13 
levels; this scale can be used to desc ribe overall severity  of the retinopathy  and change in 
severit y over time. In addition, severity of retinopathy  in this ey e could be assessed as a risk 
factor b y using this grading s ystem [ R17-1872].

Visual Acuity  measured by  ETDRS letter charts
Best corrected visual acuity  (BCVA) will be determined by  using the ETDRS visual acuity  
chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read 
correctly  by the patient. The assessment will be performed by  a trained person under 
specified conditions regarding examination room and equipment.
 
 
5.2 A SSESSMENT OFSAFETY
For the standardized evaluation of ocular safet y parameters a complete eye examination will 
be performed at every  visit (please refer to Section 5.2.5.1) next to efficacy  parameters 
(Section 5.1) . In addition, the patients will be asked for s ymptoms that may have occurred 
since the last study  visit, according to Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE, see also Section 5.2.6).
5.2.1 Physical examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow 
Chart . It includes at a minimum general appearance, neck, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem,
abdomen, extremiti es, and skin. In addition, further phy sical examination should be 
performed if clarification of an AE is necessary .The results must be included in the source 
documents available at the site.
5.2.1.1 Body weight/height
Measurement of height and body  weight will be performed at the time points specified in the 
Flow Chart .The scale used to capture bod y weight for each patient should remain consistent 
during the trial. In order to get comparable bod y weight values, it should be performed in the 
following way : Shoes and coat/jacket should be taken off and pockets should be emptied of 
heav y objects (i.e. keys, coins etc .).
5.2.2 Vital 
signs
Arterial s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory  rate ( frequency  /min) and pulse rate 
(palpation
of the pulse ) will be measured after the patient has rested for at least 5 min utesin 
the sitting position. Measurement of vital signs should precede blood sampling to avoid the 
impact of blood sampling on the vital measurements. The measured vital signs will be 
documented in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 20175.2.4 Electrocardiogram
A centralized ECG assessment will be used for this study . Three ECGs are to be recorded as 
12-lead ECGs by a qualified person at the visits outlined in the Flow Chart approximately  60 
min after trial drug intake using equipment provided by  a central ECG vendor . All ECGs will 
be printed locall y and evaluated b y the investigator or a designee; in addition, there is a 
central cardiologist over -read. 
ECGs will be recorded for a10-second duration after the patients have rested for at least 5 
minutes in a supine position. Six limb leads, as specified b y Einthoven (I, II and
III) and 
Goldberger (aVR, aVL, aVF), and six pre -cordial leads (V1 –V6), according to Wilson, will 
be used. 
ECGs will be recorded but records may  be repeated for quality  reasons and the 
repeated recording will be used for anal ysis.If necessary , additional ECGs may  be recorded 
for safety  reasons. Information about the details of ECG collection will be provided in the 
ISF.
All three 
ECG s at screening (used as baseline before the first drug administration), and only 
the first of the three replicate ECGs at a remaining time points will be evaluated (signed, 
dated and commented upon) by  the treating physician/ investigator. The remaining second 
and third replicate ECGs will be printed and kept together with other medical records of the 
patient for additional analy ses if required at a later time point.
All ECGs recorded during trial conduct including the baseline ECG will also be transmitted
to a vendor for central evaluation and stored at an external central ECG d atabase. Onl y the
first of the three replicate ECGs at a single assessment time will be centrally evaluated and 
transferred to the sponsor. The results of the centralized evaluation will be sent from the ECG 
core lab to the sponsor according to a pre -speci fied data transmission agreement. The 
remaining second and third replicate ECGs will only  be stored at the ECG vendor for 
additional anal yses if required at a later time point
The ECG at the screening visit is regarded as baseline. Clinically  significant abnormal 
findings will be reported either as baseline condition (if identified at the screening visit) or 
otherwise as AEs and will be followed up and/or treated locally  until normal or stable 
condition. In addition to the AE reports from the investigators, quantitative data (interval 
lengths) as well as qualitative findings (indicators for arrhy thmia, conduction disturbances 
etc.) will be collected and will be transferred from the ECG reading center to the sponsor .
In the event of an y clinical cardiac s ymptoms (e.g. suspicion of heart rh ythm disorders or 
cardiac ischemia) during the trial, an additional ECG will be recorded at the investigator ´s 
discretion. The ECG recordings will be transmitted to a vendor for central evaluation and 
stored at an external central ECG database. The electronic versions of the ECGs are regarded 
as source data.
The results of central reading will be reported to the site. ECGs and the corresponding reports 
will be evaluated (signed, dated and commented upon) by the treating physician/ investigator 
and stored locall y.

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions

laboratory  test resul ts, if they  are judged clinicall y relevant b y the investigator.
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion, they  will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is defined as any  AE which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might h ave caused 
death if more severe;
-requires inpatient hospitalization ,or 
-requires prolongation of existing hospitalization,
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect, or
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based on 
appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above
definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization or development of dependency  or abuse. 
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in 
5.2.6.2, subsections “ AE Collection ”and“AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medi cal Events, 
BIhas set up a list of further AEs, which b y their nature, can alway s be considered to be 
“serious” even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the Electronic Data Capturing ( EDC)
system. These events should alway s be reported as SAEs and as described in 5.2.6.2, 
subsections “ AE Collection ” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and timelines”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see above .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 2017The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters: 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold Upper Limit of Normal ( ULN )combined with 
an elevation of total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, 
and/or
aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN .
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patient s showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the RDC .
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdom inal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analyzed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the proced ures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
5.2.6.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the eCRF
according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 
dated 14 June 2010 [ R10-
4848].
5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgments should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No me dicall y sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-existing or 
concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks of

concerned) .
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives). Of note, this 
criterion may  not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite
removing the original trigger.
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concer ned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.6.2.1 AE collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The follow ing must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF (s) by the 
investigator :
From signing the in formed consent onwards through the treatment period and the residual 
effect period (REP :period after last dose withmeasurable drug levels and/or 
pharmacod ynamic effects still likely  to be present )until the individual patient ’send of 
trial: 
oall AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
othe investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but 
should only  report an y occurrence of cancer and related SAEs and related AESI s 
of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, 
e.g. phone call. Those AEs should however, not be reported in the eCRF .
TheREP in this study  is considered as the entire FU period from last dose administration of 
trial medication until individual patient’s end of trial . All AEs that
occurred through the 
treatment phase until the end of the Follow -up period will be considered as on -treatment (see 
Section 7.3.4) . 
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
sponsor ’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact details will be provided in the I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the investigator could inform the s ponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.

For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form , if applicable . The investigator should determine the causal 
relationship to the trialmedication and an y possible interactions between the trial medication 
and the AMP (intravenous fluorescein d ye).
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trialmust be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been assesse d as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further 
information can be obtained.
The results must be included in the source documents available at the site.
5.2.6.2.4 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any  drug exposure 
during pregnancy  in a trial participant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  means of Part A of 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form to the sponsor ’s unique entry  point.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trial s (Part B).
The I SF will contai n the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trial s (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trial s and not the SAE form 
is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE 
form must be completed in addition.

Not applicable
5.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS
All measurements performed during this trial are standard measurements and will be 
performed in order to monitor patient s’ safet yand to determine pharmacod ynamic and 
pharmacokinetic parameters in an appropriate way. The scheduled measurements will allow 
monitoring of changes in vital signs, standard laboratory values, and ECG parameters that 
might occur as a result of administration of trial medication. The safet y assessments are 
standard, are accepted for evaluation of safet y and tolerability of an orall yadministered drug, 
and are widel y used in clinical trials. The pharmacokinetic parameters and measurements 
outlined in Section 5.3 are generally used for assessments of drug exposure.
The treatment with BI 1467335 is aiming to improve or stabilize retinal pathology . Therefore, 
a standard method that captures changes in retinal lesions is used for diagnostic purposes as 
well as to determine pharmacod ynamic effects. The ophthalmological assessments are widel y 
used for the asse ssment of the retina and other compartments of the ey e.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All trial visits should be initiated preferentiall y in the morning starting before 9:00 a.m. On 
scheduled site visits, patients should be instructed to avoid intake of the daily  dose of the 
trial
medication at home prior to visiting the site, as they will be dosed at the study site .
All drug administration at the study  site will be done under the direct supervision of the study  
personnel for documentation of precise administration times.
All patient visits should be scheduled according to the Flow Chart. In the event that visits are 
missed or delay ed bey ond the time window, the delay ed visit should be scheduled as soon as 
possible and documented with the actual date and the reason for the delay ed visit. S ubsequent 
visits should follow the original visit schedule.
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory  test result, the pat ient must be followed until complete resolution or stabilization
of the event or until follow -up is agreed adequate by  the investigator and BI Clinical Monitor.
Patients should make all efforts to complete the study , which includes the Visit EOT and all
follow -up visits FU1, FU2 and FU3. The procedures to be conducted at each visit are 
provided in the Flow Chart and are further described below.
Regarding removal of patients, please refer to Section 3.3.4 .
Order of ophthalmological assessments
For adequate evaluation of the ey e fundus it is necessary  to dilate the pupil with my driatic 
medication according to local standard (please also refer to Section 4.2.1).
Before pupil dilation, t he following assessments have to be performed: BCVA
After pupil dilation, the following assessments will be performed: color fundus 
photograph y 
  and slit lamp examination are inde pendent of the dilation.
Ocular tonometry  and gonioscopy (at the screening visit only , if needed per Section 3.3.3
exclusion criterion #4 ) should be performed after imaging. Goniscop y can also be 
performed before dilation, if preferred b y the investigator.
 
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECT ED VISITS
Study  procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart and in the
Appendix 10.2. Additional details regarding visit procedures are provided below.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 20176.2.1 Screening and run -in period (s)
Informed Consent prior to trial participation
All patients must sign an Informed Consent consis tent with I CH-GCP guidelines prior to an y 
study  specific procedures. Please refer to Section 8.1 for details.
Screening Period
The Screening period, i.e. the phase before the first administration of the trial drug, starts at
Visit 1. The Screening period may  be as long as 28 day s but should be kept as short as 
possible. The minimum time interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2a is 3 day s to allow receipt 
of the results of the central imaging reading, safety  laboratory  and ECG.
Screening visit should be performed in two visits . After Informed consent is obtained, fundus 
photograph y should be performed and sent to central reading service. If patient is eligible 
based on the DRSS grading, the patient should return to complete the rest of the screening . In 
case of scheduling difficulty  for certain patients, screening can be performed in one visit . If 
screening is done as one visit, fundus photography should be performed in line with other 
ophthalmological examinations.
 
 
Demographics and 
Baseline Conditions
Information on race will be collected because certain ethnic groups are at higher risk for DR; 
this demographic information is also required for the calculation of eGFR (CKD -EPI 
formula) . 
The following baseline conditions will be specifically  asked for: t ype of DM, arterial 
hypertension, metabolic syndrome and the level of DR in both ey es (as provided by  the CRC). 
In addition, information will be collected in the eCRF for relevant chronic diseases, current 
observable conditions and other relevant conditions (as pe r investigators judgment ) which 
may not be necessaril y manifest at the day of examination, e.g., because therap y is given.
Medical History
Information on DR risk factors and factors that may  influence AOC3 inhibition will be 
collected in the eCRF , such as duration of DM, history  of arterial hy pertension, history  of 
hyperlipidemia, caffeine and alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Furthermore, an y 
previous therap y of DR will be recorded.
In order to collect previous medical reports to keep record s of exact dates/diagnoses of 
relevant medical history  or prior medication, up to three documented attempts at different 
days should be made to get the reports before medical history  data will be used.
Level of DR 
Images (fundus photographs, angiograms and OCT) have to be sent to the CRC for 
assessment, see Section 3.3.2 .

Patients who do not fulfil all of the eligibility  criteria for a reason that later resolves and all 
eligibility  criteria can be met, can be re -screened up to one time. Patients can also be re -
screened if they  screen failed due to inclusion/exclusion criteria that has been changed in the 
current version of the protocol. For rescreening, patient must be registered in I RT, which will
then provide new patient number, and patient must sign a new ICF.  
 
 
Re-testing
Screening evaluations may be repeated once during the screening phase .
IRT
All patients who are screened must be registered with I RT. If the patient results in a screen 
failure, patient must be recorded as screen failure in IRT as soon as possible and within the 
28-day screening period. Details of IRT procedures can be found in the IRT Manual filedin 
the ISF.
6.2.2 Treatment period (s)
General remarks
As soon as eligibility  of enrolled patients is confirmed, patients may  enter the study  and Visit 
2a can be conducted including randomiz ation via IRT. 
IRT should not be called in advance of Visit 2a until eligibility  is full y confirmed, as 
randomiz ation of a patient cannot be reserved.
Unscheduled visits will be possible at the discretion of the investigator at any  time in order to 
check the safet y of the patient including a potential worsening of o cular function or to
perform safet y laboratory assessments.
 
At every  site visit d uring the treatment period (Visits 2a –EOT) patients are asked about their 
alcohol and caffeine consumption and information is recorded in the eCRF.

The patients will be instructed to complete trial drug diar iesduring the treatment phase to 
document date and clock time of drug intake at home between the on- site visits. I f the trial 
drug was not administered as planned, the reason should be provided in the diary  by the 
patient. 
A new diary  will be dispensed to the patients at every  visit during the treatment period and 
will be collected at the following visit by  the site (please refer to the Flow Chart ). Selected 
entries , i.e. drug administration date sand time sfrom the 3 day s prior to each visit , will be 
entered in the eCRF by  the site.
Visit 2a ( Randomi zation)
At the start of Visit 2a it should be ensured that all Visit 1 procedures have been successfull y 
completed within the past 28 day s and eligibility  has been confirmed including confirmation 
of eligibility  by the CRC.
Trial medication is administered after predose blood collection .  
 
 
 
Trial drug 
kits will be dispensed for home administration , and a trial drug diary  will be 
dispensed to the patients .
Visit 2b (Phone Visit)
This interim phone call will be performed one week after randomiz ation in order to collect 
AEs, changes in concomitant therap y, and to check handling of the trial drug diary . Patients 
should be reminded not to take medication in the morning prior to the ne xt visit . 
Visits 3 and 4 a:
At these visits the trial drug diary  will be checked and dates and times of drug administration 
at the 3 day s prior to the visits will be recorded in the eCRF . Unused trial medication, as well 
as empty  blisters and packaging , will be collected. 
Visit 4b (Phone Visit)
This interim phone call will be performed in advance to the EOT visit in order to collect AEs, 
changes in concomitant therap y, and to check handling of the trial drug diary . Patients should 
be reminded not to take medication in the morning prior to the EOT visit.
End of Treatment (EOT) Visit:
For patients who complete treatment as scheduled, t he day  of the EOT Visit is the last day  of 
treatment where trial drug will be administered at the site from the kitthat the patient returns 
to the site. 
The overall duration of the anticipated treatment period ( Randomiz ation to EOT) should not 
be less than 84 days;therefore the EOT visit is scheduled at Day 85 with a time interval of up 
to +6daysat maximum.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 2017If the trial drug intake needs to be permanently  stopped during the treatment period for any
reason prior to the scheduled EOT visit , including that patients are not willing to continue 
trial drug intake any  longer, the EOT visit will be completed instead of the planned treatment 
period visit as soon as possible after trial drug discontinuation. I n this case t he patient should 
be asked to further attend to the follow- up visits and assessments until the end of the trial 
unless they  withdraw consent to participate in the trial. I t is important to distinguish between 
premature trial drug discontinuation, i.e. earl y discontinuation, and complete withdrawal of 
consent to participate in further stud y proce dures. 
Withdrawal of consent
If a patient is not willing to continue in the trial prior to the end of the trial, Visit EOT should 
be scheduled and completed instead of the planned treatment period visit as soon as possible. 
Also one follow -up visit (FU1) should be performed to assess for safet y.
If the patient refuses to participate at an EOT Visit and withdraws consent for an y reason 
(without the need to justify  the decision) , the trial completion page of the eCRF has to be 
filled in.
All unused trial medication will be collected and trial drug diary  will be checked b y the site. 
If patient discontinues prematurel y for safet y reasons or withdraws consent, trial medication
administration will not be performed at EOT Visit.
6.2.3 Follow u p period and trialcompletion
For all patients who had at least one dose of trial medication the follow -up visits FU1, FU2 
and FU3 will be performed according to the Flow Chart 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the last 
intake of trial drug,respectively . If the last day  of trial drug intake is different from the EOT 
visit,the date of the last day  of trial drug intake will be used for calculation of the FU visit 
dates . 
Should it be not possible for the patient to attend a follow up visit at the study site, a visit out 
of time window should be performed as soon as possible; if a visit at the site is not possible at 
all, at least a phone contact should occur at the scheduled visit time point.
In case that standard of care DR treatment is adm inistered at these visits, this has to be 
documented in the eCRF.
The FU3 visit is the final visit and the 
Study completion page in the eCRF has to be entered.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(15.0)/Saved on:20Nov. 20177.3.4 Safety analyses
All findings noticed at ophthalmological examinations and/or clinicall y relevant symptoms 
(according to the judgment of the investigator) which arereported b y the patients will be 
recorded as o
cular adverse events according to the CTCAE classification . All adverse events 
will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA). 
Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. Consistent with the REP definition 
in Section 5.2.6.2.1, a ll adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and last 
follow up visit will be assigned to the on -treatment period for evaluation. Measurements 
(such as ECG, vital signs, or laboratory  parameters) or AEs will be assigned to treatments 
(see Section 4.1) based on the actual treatment at the planned time of the measurement or on 
the recorded time of AE onset (concept of treatment emergent AEs). Therefore, 
measurements planned or AEs recorded prior to first intake of tri al medication will be 
assigned to 'screening' and those between first trial medication intake until the last follow up
visit will be assigned to the treatment period. These assignments including the corresponding 
time intervals will be defined in detail in the TSAP.
All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descript ive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hy pothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and last follow up 
visit. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will 
also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ cla ss and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) at the database lock .
This also includes 
the primary  endpoint.
Laboratory  data will be analy zedboth quantitatively  as we ll as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarized . 
Treatment groups will be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as 
well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patient s with abnormal values or clinicall y 
relevant abnormal values.
Clinically  relevant ECG findings will be reported as baseline conditions or AEs. Quantitative 
and qualitative ECG data from the ECG reading center will be reported descriptively .
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trialand at the end -of-trialevaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.

7.4 I NTERI M ANALYSES
 
 
 
 
 
During the conduct of the interim anal ysis, access to unmasked data will be restricted to 
members of the trial and project teams not directly involved with study  conduct. The result s
of the interim analysis will not be used to make any adaptions of this trial,like sample size 
adjustments.
For steps to maintain blinding during the interim analy sis see Section 4.1.5.1.  
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
For the anal yses of efficacy  endpoints, if a patient misses a visit, the missing data will not be 
imputed and only  on-treatment data will be included. 
Additional details on the handling of missing data, including sensitivity  analy ses of the 
efficacy  endpoints and any  imputation rules for further endpoints will be specified in the 
TSAP prior to unmasking. No imputation is planned for the anal ysis of AEs, laboratory  data 
or vital signs. Rules for handling missing data are outlined in BI SOP s
.
7.6 RANDOMISAT ION
BI will arrange for the randomiz ation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication . 
The randomiz ation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -
random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both r eproducible and non -
predictable. The block size will be documented in the CTR . Access to the codes wil l be 
controlled and documented. Procedural aspects of assigning patients to treatment groups and 
controlling the randomization code are provide din Section 4.1.3 and Section 4.1.5.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
The primary  endpoint for the trial is occurrence of ocular adverse events.

should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions.
The consent and re-consenting process should be properl y documented in the source 
documentation.
8.2 D ATA QUALITY ASSURANC E
A risk -based approach is used for trial qualit y management. It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes for trial subject protection and reliabilit y of the results as well as 
identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integr ated Qualit y and Risk 
Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial 
conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing 
on areas of greatest risk. 
Continuous risk review and ass essment may  lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design 
or monitoring approaches.
A quality  assurance audit/inspection of this trialmay be conducted b y the sponsor ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by IRB /IECor by  regulatory  authorities. The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the investigator ’s trial-related files and correspondence, 
and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
eCRF sfor individual patient s will be provided b y the sponsor .See Section 4.1.5.2 for rules 
about emergency  code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements the investigator should pr epare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow good documentation practices and be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The current medical histo ry of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case the investigator must make three documented attempts to retr ieve 
previous medical records. If this fails a verbal history  from the patient , documented in their 
medical records, would be acceptable.
During the site visit the sponsor’s CRA or auditor must be granted access to the original 
patient file (please see Section 8.3.2 ). The investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers 
(e.g. patient ’sname, initials, address, phone number, social securit y number) have properl y 
been removed or redacted from an y cop y of the patient s’ source documents before sending 
them to the sponsor.

Concomitant therap y (start date, changes)
Originals or copies of laboratory  results and other imaging or testing results, with proper 
documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
Completion of patient ’s participation in the trial”(end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it)
Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trialparticipant 
meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet an y exclusion criteria. The absence of 
records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of th e patient or testing 
conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make 
the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The sponsor will monitor the conduct of the trialby regul ar on -site monitoring visits and in -
house data qualit y review. The frequency of site monitoring will be determined by  assessing 
all characteristics of the trial, including its nature, objective, methodology  and the degree of 
any deviations of the intervent ion from normal clinical practice.
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB /IEC review 
and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the eCRF and all source 
documents/data, including progress no tes, copies of laboratory  and medical test results, which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor and regulatory  inspector 
(e.g. FDA). They  may review all eCRF s and informed consents. The accuracy  of the data will 
be verified b y direc t comparison with the source documen ts described in Section 8.3.1 .The 
sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
8.3.3 Storage period of records
Trial site(s):
The trialsite(s) must retain the source and essential documents (including ISF) according to 
contract or the local requirements valid at the time of the end of the trial(whatever is longer).

Section to be changed FLOW CHART
Description of change Footnote 21 was added
Rationale for change Based on the screen failures observed so far, 
majority  of patients screen failed due to DRSS 
grading. Screening visit should be performed in 
two visits. Fundus photograph ywould be 
performed first. If patient is eligible based on the 
DRSS grading , the rest of the screening will be 
performed. Splitting the screening would reduce 
burden of performing the remaining screening 
procedures for patients who fail DRSS grading. 
Section to be changed 3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
Description of change The following t ext was added:
Due to high probability  of patients screen failing 
due to DRSS grading on fundus photograph y, 
screening should be performed in two parts. 
Fundus photograph y should be performed first, and 
if patients are eligible based on the fundus 
photograph y results, patients should return to 
complete the rest of the screening examinations. In 
case of scheduling difficulty  for certain patients, 
screening can be performed in one visit.
Rationale for change See above for splitting screening visit

 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  6 1 Introduction  
This document outlines the statistical analysis plan for the clinical trial TIRCON2012V1 -
EXT  at ApoPharma Inc . 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary  Objective  
To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of deferiprone in patients with PKAN . 
2.2 Secondary  Objective  
The secondary objectives are:  
 To evaluate the change in severity of dystonia over time in patients with PKAN 
treated with deferiprone ; 
 To evaluate  global improvement over time in patients wit h PKAN treated with 
deferiprone.  
3 Methods  
3.1 Study Design  
Study  TIRCON2012V1 -EXT is an 18 -month, multi -center, single -arm, open -label 
extension of study TIRCON2012V1.  In the initial study, patients with a diagnos is of 
PKAN were being randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 18 months of treatment with either 
deferiprone or placebo, respectively.  All participants who complete d TIRCON2012V1 
were  offered the opportunity to continue in the extension study, with the final  visit of the 
initial study being considered Visit 1 of the extension study.  Patients who had been 
randomized to receive deferiprone in study TIRCON2012V1  continue d to receive 
deferiprone in the extension study, while those who had been randomized to rec eive 
placebo were  switched to deferiprone. Since the initial study were still  in progress at the 
time that the first patients enter ed the extension study, patients and study staff  remain ed 
blinded until the initial study was over as to which product was r eceived for the previous 
18 months.  
In the TIRCON -EXT study , patients will have their hematology blood counts monitored 
weekly, and will return to the study site at 6 months (Visit 2), 12 months (Visit 3), and 18 
months (Visit 4) for assessments of safety  and efficacy .

Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  7 3.2 Determination of Sample Size  and Study Power  
There was no formal sample size and power calculation for this study.   All patients who 
complete d TIRCON2012V1  study were  invited t o enroll in the extension study . Among 
the 89 subjects randomized in TIRCON2012V1 study , 76 completed the study  and 68 
subjects were subsequently enrolled in this extension study  (44 originally randomized to 
the deferiprone group and 24 in the placebo group ). 
3.3 Analysis Populations  
The following study populations will be u sed for analysis:  Safety , Intent -to-Treat (ITT), 
and Per-Protocol (PP). The safety population will be used for the analysis of safety 
endpoints.  The ITT population will represent the primary analysis population for the 
evaluation of efficacy endpoints, an d the PP population will be the secondary efficacy 
analysis population.  
Safety Population  
The Safety population will include all patients who took at least one dose of study drug  in 
the extension study.  
ITT Population  
The ITT population will include all  enrolled patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug and have a baseline and at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment  in the 
extension study .  
PP Population  
The PP population will include all enrolled patients who complete the extension study 
and have an efficacy assessment at the end of the study, have no major protocol 
violations, and have no change in DBS and baclofen pump settings or medications that 
could have an impact on dystonia . Prior to database lock, protocol deviations and 
medi cations that could have an impact on dystonia will be reviewed for their seriousness, 
and patients with major deviations will be excluded from the PP populati on. 
3.4 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.   
3.5 Missing Data Handling and Derivation Rules  
For safety data analysis, no imputation will be performed on the missing data and 
analysis will  be based on observed cases .  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  8 For efficacy endpoints, t he continuous variables will be summarized  and analyzed as 
recorded on the case report forms (CRFs).   If statistically significant imbalances are 
detected  in the incidence of changes in DBS settings and outcome impacting medication 
use as well as the frequency of PRN drug or rescue medication between the initial study 
and the extension study , a Mixed -Effect Mo del Repeated Measure (MMRM) model  will 
be used as the analysis method to compare the change in  score from baseline between the 
initial study and the ext ension study for patients who received placebo in initial study 
(TIRCON2012V1 ) and the analysis will be based on observed cases. If no significant 
imbalance was detected, the paired t -test will be used as the analysis method and the last 
observed data will be used.  
For the efficacy analysis on all patients who received DFP during the initial and the 
extensio n study, the last observation will be used  to calculate the change from baseline 
for patients terminated early .  As a sensitivity analysis, f or early termination due to 
worsening of disease conditions or inadequate efficacy of the drug , as indicated in the  
CRF, the “worst score ” method will be used  for data imputation .  That is, for continuous 
variables such as BAD total score at a particular time point, the worst score of all patients 
will be used to impute the missing data  at that time point . For categori cal variable such as 
responder, the worst category (treatment failure) will be assigned.  For missing data due to 
missed visit, the  last observation  will be used to fill the void.   
For BAD total score, if one or several component scores cannot be measured , then the 
same component score from  the last visit will be carried forward  and if it is also missing, 
the score from the next visit  will be carried backward to fill the missing component 
score (s) before the total score is calculated .   
Date of exposure  will be defined  as day 1 for all duration calculations.  For example , age 
at entry will be calculated as the integer value of the expression: (date of exposure  – date 
of birth) / 365.25.  For patients on DFP in the initial study, the date of exposure during the 
initial study (TIRCON2012V1)  will be used while for those switched from placebo to 
DFP in the extension study (TIRCON2012V1 -EXT), the date of exposure during the 
extension study will be used.  
3.6 Statistical Software and Level of Significance  
All statistical analyses wil l be performed using SAS (version 9.3 or higher) on Windows 
operating system . Null hypotheses tested are that there are no difference s in true 
parameter between comparison groups, unless otherwise stated . A two-sided p-value of  
0.05 will be use d as the significance level for the determination of statistical significance 
in all statistical tests.    
4 Statistical Analyses  
The efficacy endpoints are defined as follows:  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  9 All patients:  
 Change in the BAD total score from baseline (defined as prior to th e start of 
deferiprone therapy) to Visit 4, as assessed by central evaluation of videotapes  
 Proportion of patients with improved or unchanged BAD scale total score 
between baseline and Visit 4 (responder analysis, responders defined as c hange in 
BAD total score to be ≤0 ) 
 Change from baseline to Visit 4 in BAD scale score per body region (eyes, mouth, 
neck, trunk, and each upper and lower extremity), as assessed by central 
evaluation of videotapes  
 PGI-I score at Visit 4  
 Proportion of patients showing an impr ovement on PGI -I at Visit 4 (responder 
analysis, responders are defined as patients whose conditions have not 
deteriorated; patients who have “no change”, or are “minimally improved”, 
“much improved” or “very much improved” in the PGI -I questionnaire at th e last 
study visit)  
The time points for these efficacy endpoints are defined as follows:  
 For patients who received deferiprone in the initial study, the baseline visit of that 
study will be treated as the baseline visit of TIRCON2012V1 -EXT as well.  Thus, 
Visit 1 of the extension study (Week 0)  will be Year 1.5 (month 18), and Visit 4 
(Week 78) will be Year 3 (month 36).  
 For patients who received placebo in the initial study, Visit 1 of the extension 
study (Week 0) will be the baseline visit. Thus, Visit 4  (Week 78) will be Year 
1.5 (month 18).  
Patients who received placebo in initial study:  
For this group only, for each measure, the changes seen between the start and completion 
of the initial study (TIRCON2012V1 ) (i.e., following 18 months on placebo) will  be 
compared against the changes seen between the start and completion of extension study 
(TIRCON2012V1 -EXT ) (i.e., following 18 months on deferiprone), as follows:  
 Comparison of change in BAD total score from baseline to completion of the 
initial study vs . change in BAD total score from baseline to completion of the 
extension study  
 Comparison of the proportion of patients with improved or unchanged BAD scale 
total score between baseline and completion of the initial study  vs. the proportion 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  10 with improved or unchanged BAD scale total score from baseline to completion 
of the extension study (responder analysis)  
 Comparison of the change in BAD score per body region between baseline and 
completion of the initial study  vs. change in BAD score per body region b etween 
baseline and completion of the extension study   
 Comparison of PGI -I score at the  completion of the initial study vs. PGI -I score at 
the completion of the extension study  
 Comparison of the proportion of patients showing an improvement on PGI -I at 
completion of the initial study vs. the proportion showing an improvement at 
completion of the extension study (responder analysis ) 
The following time window will be employed to classify the efficacy data into each  
scheduled  visit according to the time elaps ed from the first medication date (date of 
exposure) to the assessment date:  
 Month 6 visit:  3 to <9 months  
 Month 12 visit: 9 to <15 months  
 Month 18 visit: 15 to <21 months  
Month 24 visit:  21 to <27 months  
 Month 30 visit: 27 to <33 months  
 Month 36 vi sit: 33 to <39 months  
The exact calculation of time elapsed from the date of exposure to the sample assessment 
date is: Time elapsed = (date of sample assessment) – (date of exposure) +1. The 
resulting time elapsed will be expressed in months  and will be u sed for data tabulation 
and trend analysis . If multiple measurements for an outcome are available at the same 
visit for a subject, the average value will be used for that outcome for this subject at that 
visit.  
A paired t -test will be used to assess the st atistical significance of the changes in the 
efficacy outcomes from baseli ne to the end of study .  For the BAD total score and for 
PGI-I, the proportions of patients determined to be responde rs at the end of study  will be 
calculated and presented along wit h 95% confidence intervals.  
The incidence of changes in DBS settings and outcome impacting medication use as well 
as the frequency of PRN drug or rescue medication use will be tabulated by visit  and 
treatment group for patients on placebo in the initial s tudy. The incidence of changes in 
DBS settings and outcome impacting medication use as well as the frequency of PRN 
drug or rescue medication use  will be compared between the initial study and the 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  11 extension study . Continuous variables will be compared by p aired t -tests while 
proportions by McNemar’s test . If statistically significant imbalances are detected, they 
will be adjusted accordingly for the comparison of changes in BAD and PGI -I between 
the initial study and the extension study by using a MMRM  mode l approach that is 
consistent with the analysis of these two efficacy  measures in the initial study. The 
MMRM model is specified below.  
The MMRM  model  will be applied to non -imputed data from the observed cases (OC) 
data set. Let 
iy  denote the vector of 
in  continuous post -baseline measurements observed 
for study patient i. Each response (i.e., each element of 
iy ) will be defined as the 
patient’s score at that occ asion minus the baseline score.  
The model will assume that the distribution of
iy is multivariate norm al, 
), (~i i i XNy 
, 
where 
iX  is a design matrix of dimensions
pni , 
 is a vector of coefficients of length 
p
, and 
i  is an 
i inn  covariance matrix.  
The MMRM model will include  baseline value  of the outcome  as a covariate  and 
treatment group as the main factor in the model. A change in DBS settings or use of 
medication s that have the potential to affect dystonia symptoms during the study may 
confound the treatment effect assessment  (named outcome impacting medication use 
hereafter)  for DFP vs. placebo  between the initial study an d the extension study  for 
patients who were on placebo in the initial study . Hence, b oth variable s will also be 
included in the MMRM model as visit-dependent covariate s.  
The visit-dependent covariate for DBS setting s change is defined as follows : for pati ents 
with DBS at enrollment, if there is any DBS setting change since the previous  visit, it will 
be code d as ‘ DBS Setting Change ’ for the current  visit or ‘No DBS Setting Change ’ 
otherwise. For example, if a patient has a DBS setting change between the ou tcome 
assessment dates at month 6 visit and month 12 visit, it will be coded as ‘ DBS Setting 
Change ’ for month 12 visit in the model.  For those patients without DBS at enrollment, it 
will be coded as ‘No DBS’. A discrete variable , DBSCHG,  with three catego ries will be 
included in the MMRM model.  
The visit-dependent covariate for the outcome impacting medication use will be defined  
according to  whether the patient is on a regular dosing regimen  or on a PRN (as needed) 
dosing regimen  between two visits . For p atients treated on a regular dosing regimen , if 
there is a dose change or starting of new medication since the previous  visit, it will be 
coded as ‘Yes’ for the current  visit and the future follow -up visits or ‘No’ otherwise in 
the model. For patients who do not use any outcome impacting medication , it will be 
coded as ‘No’.  
For patients on a PRN (as needed) dosing regimen , the visit-dependent covriate will be 
defined according to the treatment impact period in the following table.  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  12  
Medication  Treatment impact period  
Baclofen  30 days  
Trihexyphenidyl  30 days  
Clonazepam  30 days  
Tizanidine  30 days  
Botox  60 days  
Tetrabenazine  90 days  
 
If the PRN drug is started within the treatment impact period prior to the assessment date 
of an outcome for a visit, it  will be coded  as ‘Yes’ for that visit. If the drug is started 
outside this time window but is not interrupted within this period, it will also be coded  as 
‘Yes’ for that visit. Under other conditions, it will coded  as ‘No’ in the model.  A binary 
variable for the outcome impacting medication use, RESMED, will be included in the 
MMRM model.  
The frequency of PRN drug or rescue medication use  between two outcome assessment 
dates of current visit and the previous visit will also be included in the  MMRM model as  
a quantitative visit-dependent covariate , NDRUG,  for the current  visit. 
The MIXED procedure in SAS will be used for the MMRM model analysis. Data within 
each patient at different visits will be considered repeated measures. AR(1)  
(autoregressive of order 1) covariance structure will be used to model the correlation 
between repeated measures within the same patient and Kenward and Roger’s method 
will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The 95% confidence 
interval ( CI) for the difference between the two treatments will be calculated  by the 
LSMEANS statement.  
A sample SAS code for the MMRM model  is presented in the box below:  
proc mixed;  
  class TREAT USUBJID VISIT DBSCHG RESMED ;

where TREAT is the indicator variable for treatment group  (DFP vs. Placebo),  USUBJID 
represents the patient ID,  VISIT is the discrete variable representi ng the scheduled study

RESMED is the binary variable for outcome impacting medication use  (Yes vs. No) , 
CHG is the change in value of efficacy outcome from baseline to the scheduled visit, 
BASE is the baseline value  of efficacy outcome, and NDRUG is the frequency of PRN 
drug or rescue medication use . 
PGI-I is already a measurement of change from b aseline and thus will be used directly as 
the outcome variable and baseline BAD score will be included as the baseline value  in all 
models.  
McNemar’s test will be used to compare the proportion of responders in the initial study 
with the proportion of resp onders in the extension study.   
For all patients who were on DFP in both studies , the longitudinal response profile for 
BAD  score will be explored by a  MMRM mdoel with time modelled as a continuous 
variable.  
For this model, AR(1) (autoregressive of order 1 ) covariance structure will be used to 
model the correlation between repeated measures within the same patient and Kenward 
and Roger’s method will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.  
A sample SAS code for this MMRM model is presented i n the box below:

4.1 Patient  Dispositions  and Drug Exposure  
Patient  disposition, based on the ITT population  , will be summariz ed and presented, 
including the number and percentages of patients who were enrolled, completed the 
study, and withdrew (inc luding reasons for withdrawals) .  
For each patient, the compliance on the study drug will be computed from the study drug 
dispensing  and accountability eCRFs obtained at each visit. The extent of exposure to the 
study medication taken during the study and the compliance will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics . 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  14 The number of enrolled patient s for each study site will be presented  and the number of 
subjects included in each population will be tabulated.  
4.2 Patient  Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics for continuous variables will be summarized by mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median, and maximum values; and baseline character istics for 
discrete variables will be summarized with frequency and percentages . 
4.2.1 Demographics  and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data such as age, sex, ethnic ity, and race will be summarized . Baseline 
characteristics at the initial study will also be  tabulated.  
4.3 Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the ITT population. The analyses will be 
repeated for PP population for outcomes defined for BAD total score and PGI -I as 
sensitivity analyses.  Detailed definition of BAD scale and PGI -I can be found in section 
7.1 of the study protocol.  
4.3.1 Efficacy  Endpoint s 
All patients:  
For the efficacy measures of BAD (total score and by body region) and PGI -I, the value 
at each of the measurement time points defined in section 4 will be determi ned and 
summarized using descriptive statistics  for all patients on DFP  treatment . Similar data 
will also be presented by the treatment group received in initial study.   
A paired t -test will be used to assess the statistical significance of the changes in these 
efficacy outcomes from baseline to the end of study (Visit 4, month 18 or 36 as defined in 
section 4 ).  
For the BAD total score and for PGI -I, the proportions of patients determined to be 
responders at the end of study (Visit 4) will be calculated an d presented along with 95% 
confidence intervals.  
The mean trajectory of BAD ( total score and by body region ) and PGI -I by time will be 
plotted. The longitudinal trend  for BAD total score and by body region will be explored 
by the  MMRM mdoel with time model led as a continuous variable  as defined in section 4 
for all time points where patients were on DFP . 
Patients who received placebo in initial study:  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  15 For the efficacy measures of BAD (total score and by body region) and PGI -I, the value 
at each of the measu rement time points defined in section 4 will be determined and 
summarized using descriptive statistics  for each study period .  
A paired t -test will be used to compare the change in BAD (total score and by body 
region) between the start and completion of th e initial study to that  between the start and 
completion of the extension study. The same test will be repeated for the PGI-I data.  
The incidence of changes in DBS settings and outcome impacting medication use as well 
as the frequency of PRN drug or rescue  medication use will be tabulated and compared 
between the initial study and the extension study. If statistically significant imbalances 
are detected, they will be adjusted accordingly for the comparison of changes in BAD 
and PGI -I between the initial stu dy and the extension study by using  the MMRM model 
as defined in section 4.  
For the BAD total score and for PGI -I, McNemar’s test will be used to compare the 
proportion of responders in the initial study with the proportion of responders in the 
extension study.  
4.3.2 Exploratory Analyses/Sensitivity Analysis  
In order to explore potential differences in the c hange in BAD from baseline to Visit 4  
and PGI -I at Visit 4  across popula tion subgroups, subgroup analyse s will be performed 
for the ITT population on the fol lowing factors  assessed at the baseline of the initial 
study : Age at onset of motor symptoms  (<6  years vs. ≥6 years), DBS (Deep Brain 
Stimulation, Yes vs. No), R egion  (US vs. Europe) , and Duration of disease (>5 years  vs. 
<=5 years ).    
Besides analysis for the ITT population, t he efficacy analys es will also be repeated for 
outcomes defined based on BAD total s core and PGI -I for the PP population  as 
sensitivity analyse s. 
As a sensiti vity analysis, the statistical analysis on the c hange in the BAD total score  
from baseline to Visit 4  and PGI -I at Visit 4  will be re peated with the missing data being 
imputed as des cribed in section 3.5  based on the ITT population.  
4.4 Safety Analyses  
The safety  endpoints include:  
 Adverse events (AEs):  Frequency, severity, time to onset, duration, and 
relatedness to study product  
 Serious adverse events (SAEs): Frequency, severity, time to onset, duration, and 
relatedness to study product  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  16  Number of discontinuations due to AEs  
 Hematology assessments  
 Blood chemistry assessments  
 ECG assessments  
All safety data collected will be presented in listings and summary tables or graphs to 
give an o verview of the safety findings.  All safety endpoints will be analyzed based on 
the safety population.  For patients continuing on deferiprone in the extension study, this 
time period will be from the start of TIRCON2012V1 to the completion of 
TIRCON2012V1 -EXT;  for those who received placebo in the initial study and are 
switching to deferiprone in the extension study, it will be from the start to the completion 
of the extension study.  
For those patients who do  not follow the scheduled time window exactly for  each visit  or 
withdraw from the study early , the following time window will be employed to classify

4.4.1 Adverse Events  
A summary table of adverse events  will include the following information:  
 number of patients exposed to study treatment,  
 number of patients experiencing at least one AE,  
 number of patients experiencing at least one severe AE,  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone in PKAN 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  17  number of patients experiencing at least one serious AE,  
 number of patients experiencing at least one drug -related AE,  
 number of deaths,  
 total number of patients withdrawn,    
 number of withdrawals due to AEs.  
All adverse experiences will be coded using M edDRA (Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities) and will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) 
and Preferred Term. Adverse events will be defined as: 1) AEs that occurred or worsened 
(increased in intensity and/or frequency) on or after the  first dose of study medication, 2) 
AEs with a missing start date or a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, 
3) AEs with both a missing start and stop date. Events that occur within 14 days after 
treatment discontinuation will also be c onsidered AEs. Serious adverse events that occur 
within 30 days after treatment discontinuation will be included in the database.  
Adverse events will be summarized using the total number of AEs, the total number and 
percent of patients who experience an A E, and the number and percent of patients who 
experienced an AE within each SOC (and preferred term within an SOC). The rate of 
each AE (per 100 patient years) will also be calculated. AEs will also be presented by 
intensity (mild, moderate, severe), by se riousness (serious, non -serious), and by 
relationship to study medication (at least possibly related, not related). The number and 
percentage of patients who are withdrawn from the study due to AEs will be calculated, 
and the AEs involved will be summarize d in a frequency table. Time to onset and 
duration of all AEs with an incidence of >5%, and of any AEs of special interest (e.g., 
worsening of dystonia), will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Patients who have experienced the same AE multiple ti mes will be counted only once for 
the corresponding preferred term. Similarly, if a patient experiences multiple AEs within 
the same SOC, that patient will be counted only once for that SOC. AEs will be tabulated 
by presenting SOCs alphabetically and, with in each SOC, presenting the preferred terms 
in decreasing order of the total number of patients who experienced each type of AE. In 
summaries presenting the incidence of AEs by intensity, seriousness, and relation to 
study medication, a patient with multip le events coded to a given preferred term or SOC 
will be counted only once for that preferred term or SOC according to the most severe 
event, the most serious event, or the event with the closest relationship to study 
medication.  
Listings of SAEs, of withd rawals due to AEs, and of deaths will be provided separately 
and described in patient narratives .

 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  18 4.4.2 Laboratory Data  
Descriptive statistics for each clinical laboratory test will be presented for each visit  as 
defined above for hemato logy and for blood bioche mistry . For each test, i f multiple 
measurements are taken on the same scheduled visit for a subject, average value will be 
used for this subject at that visit .  According to the laboratory normal ranges, laboratory 
test results will be categorized as low ( < lower normal limit), normal (within normal 
range), and high (> upper normal limit). Shift tables comparing the distributions of these 
three categories at baseline versus end of study for parameters of interest will be 
presented.  
Continuous d ata will also  be presented graphically for examination of possible trend s. 
Clinically significant laboratory values will be reported in the adverse event analysis.  
4.4.3 Vital Signs , Weight and Height  
Descriptive st atistics will be presented for temperature, heart rate, resp iratory rate, 
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, weight, height, at baseline and each 
relevant  visit. Data will also be presented graphically for examination of possible trend s. 
4.4.4 12-Lead ECG  
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities will be r eported. The number and percentage of 
patients with normal and abnormal ECG results will be provided.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for 12-lead ECG parameters at each relevant visit.  
4.4.5 Treatment Compliance  
Patients will be instructed on how to ta ke the study medication. Compliance will be 
evaluated  by calculating the volume of medication dispensed and the amount of unused 
drug supply remaining in the bottle. The compliance to the study medication at each visit 
will be summarized descriptively in a table . 
4.4.6 Concomitant  Medications  
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary . Medications taken during the course of the trial (on or after the first study 
drug dose and before or on the study termination date) will be considered as concomitant 
medications. Medications started after the study termination date will not be reported in 
tables, but will be presented in patient data listings. Concomitant medications used to 
treat adverse events will be differentiated from others.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Protocol TIRCON2012V1 -EXT  
 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  19 Concomitant medications will be summarized according to the preferred terms only. To 
count the number of patients who took a medication, a patient taking the same medication 
multiple times will only be counted once for that medication. Medications will be 
tabulated in decreasing order of the total number of patients who took each medication. 
In addition, the total number of patients to ever take any concomitant medications will be 
presented.  
Concomitant medications will be presented based on the Saf ety population .

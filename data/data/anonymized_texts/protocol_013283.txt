3.0 Background  
3.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and signific ance of the 
research  based on the existing literature an d how it will contribute to  existing 
knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include  relevant pr eliminary 
findings or prior research by the investigator.   
Response: Insomnia has devastati ng effects on health, function and well -being 
(1). Insomnia symptoms occur in one -third of the general population and 10 -15% 
meet criteria for insomnia disorder, marked by chronic sleep disturbances that 
causes distress and impair their daytime functioning  (2). Symptoms and side 
effects of cancer and cancer treatments render cancer survivors at increased risk 
for insomnia disorder (3 -5). An estimated 40% of cancer survivors report sleep 
disturbances years after completing treatment (6). Consequently, interv entions to 
address insomnia in cancer survivors are essential.  Treatments for insomnia 
include p harmacologic and non -pharmacologic therapies that are equally 
efficacious; however, hypnotic medications such as benzodiazepine receptor 
agonists have potentially serious adverse effects including tolerance, drowsiness 
and cognitive impairment  (7). Non -pharmacologic interventions, preferred by both 
patients and clinicians, include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI), 
considered the “gold standard,” which requires expert training to deliver and 
multiple individual sessions  (8, 9). Research in non -cancer populations revealed that 
CBTI  is safe, efficacious, and durable  (10, 11). However, CBTI is not widely 
available due to a lack of trained professionals and the high cost of treatment  (12). 
Thus, a major gap in the field of oncology is an alternative to CBTI that is nurse -
delivered, rigorously tested, low cost, durable, and having  high treatment fidelity.  
Our preliminary data using Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia ( BBTI) , a 
multicomponent intervention that integrates circadian science and behavioral 
principles of conditioned learning,  revealed cl inically significant improvements in 
insomnia severity, total sleep time, and sleep quality  without the negative effects 
commonly reported with hypnotic medications in lung cancer survivors  (13). 
Additionally, BBTI has been tested in several other pilot studies including older 
adults with chronic insomnia  (14),  treatment -resistant insomnia  (15), and 
veterans with  PTSD and insomnia  (16). However, before BBTI is ready for 
translation into cancer nursi ng clinical practice, additional research on efficacy 
 Page 6 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 and durability of BBTI is required. We hypothesize that exposing cancer 
survivors with insomnia to BBTI can help them self -manage their behavior to 
improve their sleep and quality of life.  
Preliminary S tudies  The multidisciplinary team assembled for the current project 
has conducted four  studies that involved a homogeneous sample of lung cancer 
survivors and patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer (43-46). 
These studies established that lung cancer survivors (n=76) experienced middle 
insomnia (i.e., difficulty maintaining sleep) while patients receiving 
chemotherapy for lung cancer (n=50) had early (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) and 
middle (difficulty staying asleep) insomnia (43, 46). Additionally, these studies 
revealed that lung cancer patients with poor sleep scored significantly lower on 
measures of quality of life than lung cancer patients with good sleep (47). Eighty -
five percent of patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a longitudinal 
mixed method study had pre -existing insomnia r elated to anxiety, canc er- and 
treatment -related symptoms, and poor sleep hygiene practices (45).  
The NI H-funded ( 1R15NR013779) pilot RCT involved lung cancer survivors 
who were more than 6 weeks post -surgery for stage I or II NSCLC and > 1-year 
since any other cancer treatment. Recruitment occurred during a routine 
survivorship clinic visit. Participants (n =44) were screened for sleep disorders 
with the Sleep Disorders Symptom Checklist (48), ApneaLink plus (AHI<15) and 
Insomnia Severity Index >8. BBTI was manualized and content about the impact 
of melatonin, cortisol and nicotine on sleep for lung cancer survivors was added 
and the attention control int ervention , Healthy Eating Program (HEP),  was 
developed (13). No significant differences in baseline ISI were noted between 
groups (p=0.11). Posttreatment ISI mean score was 15.07 +/ - 4.42 for the co ntrol 
group and 6.94 +/ -5.27 for the BBTI group (p<0.001; ES=1.61). Quality of life, 
using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lung  (FACT -L), revealed 
nonsignificant baseline scores (p=0.52), but control group mean scores decreased 
(74.67 +/ - 26.40 ) while BBTI group mean scores increased (90.73 +/ -21.35) 
which revealed a significant between group difference (p<0.046). Patients 
receiving BBTI improved FACT -L by 6.6 points and patients receiving the 
attention control declined by 14.5 points.      
Take n together these previous studies confirm that insomnia was common in this 
homogeneous sample of cancer survivors. BBTI significantly reduced insomnia 
and improved quality and QOL at the post treatment measure. However, 
durability in the efficacy of BBTI w as not assessed at 3 -months or 12 -months 
post-treatment. Additionally, current sleep literature does not include studies 
using BBTI in heterogeneous samples of cancer survivors with insomnia. This 
research team has the knowledge and experience to conduct a nd deliver the 
proposed RCT. In fact, this team  includes researchers with expertise in the areas 
of nursing, medical oncology, pulmonary/sleep medicine and biostatistics. The 
NIH-funded PI is an advanced practice nurse with more than 20 years of clinical 
experience and 15 years of cancer -related fatigue, sleep and circadian rhythms 
and QOL research. The PI is collaborating with Suzanne Dickerson, DNS, RN, 
Professor and Chair of Biobehavioral Health and Clinical Sciences, University at

4.0 Study Design  
4.1 Describe and explain the study design  (e.g. case -control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational).  
Response:  
This is a longitudinal, randomized, efficacy trial. The experimental intervention, 
BBTI (attached), is being used to help participants with insomnia to sleep better.  
To receive this treatment, participants need to be enrolled in the study. The 
attention control intervention, HEP (attached), is not expected to improve sleep.   
Baseline measures will be obtained prior to the intervention.  
All of the multi -components of  BBTI will be delivered individually in the clinic 
setting or online during a 45 -minute session.  
Outcome measures will be completed 1 -month and again at 3 -months and 
12-months post -intervention. Each participant will complete one -week of: 
1) Sleep diaries; 2) wrist actigraphy; and 3) a study packet with 
questionnaires on insomnia severity, sleep quali ty, insomnia symptoms, 
and beliefs about sleep, functional performance and quality of life. 
Additionally, two REDCap emails at 6 -months and 9 -months from the 
intervention will be sent to ensure patient safety and encourage participant 
retention. The emails  will ask the participants to answer a safety question 
we currently ask at each previous data collection with a "Yes" or "No" 
 Page 10 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 answer: Do you find that your sleepiness is bad enough that you are at risk 
of falling asleep while driving or doing something haz ardous or harmful?  
Additionally, we will ask 2 questions from the Sleep Diary about their 
sleep:  Please rate over the past week: Restful sleep 0 -4 (4=excellent) and 
Sleep quality 0 -4 (4=excellent).  
 
5.0 Local Number of Subjects  
5.1 Indicate the total number of sub jects t hat will be enrolled or records that will be 
reviewed  locally.  
Response:  
The total number of subjects enrolled in the study will be 158, with 79 subjects 
from each group (intervention and attention -control group)  
5.2 If applicable, indicate how many subjects you expect to screen to reach your target 
sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).   
Response:  
As the local study intends to enroll 158 participants, it is expected that 316 people 
will need to be screened.  
5.3 Justify the feasibility of recruitin g the proposed  number of eligible  subjects within the 
anticipated  recruitment period. For example, how many potential subjects do you have 
access to? What percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit?  
Response:  
There are approximately 4,0 00 cancer survivors scheduled for care in the 
RPCCC’ survivorship clinic annually. Half of these survivors will not be eligible 
for the study. That leaves approximately 2000 potentially eligible participants to 
recruit. As only 158 participants are needed over a 3 -year recruitment period, the 
pool of survivors appears feasible.  
6.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
6.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:  
1. Age ≥ 18 years of age  
2. ≥ 1 -month from surgery and ≥ 1 -month from any other treatment (except for 
hormone treatment or maintenance targeted therapies) for stages I through III: 
breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers  and stages I through IV: lung cancer.  
3. Meet published criteria for chronic insomnia: sleep latency > 30 minutes or 
wake after sleep onset of > 30 mins for ≥ 3 nights/week for at least 1 -month  
4. ApneaLink Screening Apnea Hyponea Index < 15  
 Page 11 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 5. Ability to complete data collection instruments  
 
6.2 Describe the criteria that define who will be excluded  from your final study sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:   
1. Other pre -existing sleep disorders except insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea 
who are CPAP -compliant => 4 -hours/night use  
2. Unstable medical or psychiatric illness, fibromyalgia, history of seizures, 
current substance abuse  
3. Engaged in night or rotating shift work  
4. Travel across two or more t ime zones within 1 month prior to study 
participation  
5. Inability to complete data collection measures independently  
6. Individuals with conditions affecting the non -dominant arm (use of wrist 
actigraph)  
 
6.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include any of the following special populations  
in your study using the checkboxes below.   
 
NOTE:  Members of special populations may not be targeted for enrollment  in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response:   
Not applicable: None  of the following special populations will be recruited in the 
current study.  
☐ Adults unable to consent  
☐ Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
☒ Pregnant women  
☐ Prisoners  
 
6.4 Indicate whether you will include non-English speaking individuals  in your study .  
Provide justification if you will exclude non -English speaking individuals .  
In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection 
of subjects, n on-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research  as a matter of convenience.  
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent  or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who 
may not speak English, the researcher is requi red to make efforts to recruit 
 Page 12 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 and include non -English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies 
in which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak 
English .  Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with 
validat ed instruments not available in other languages, studies with 
numerous questionnaires, and some non -therapeutic studies which offer  no 
direct benefit.  
Response:   
Persons who do not speak English are currently excluded from this research based 
on numerous questionnaires in this RCT.

8.0 Eligibility Screening  
8.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subjects’ eligibility.  Screening refers to 
determining if prospective participants meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
Include all relevant screening documents with your submission (e.g. screeni ng 
protocol, script, questionnai re).  
Response:  Screening for inclusion criteria includes a YES response to the 
following questions:  
Are at least 18 years of age?  
Insomnia Severity Index>7 and/or Holland Sleep Disorders Screening 
Questionnaire>4.0  
Do you have a diagnosis of breast, colorectal , or prostate cancer stage I, II 
or III ; or lung cancer stage I -IV?  
Have you had your cancer surgically removed at least 1 -month ago?  
Has it been more than one  month since you completed cancer treatment 
(except for hormone treatment or maintenance targete d therapies)?  
Screening for exclusion criteria includes a NO response to the following 
questions:  
Do you have sleep disorders other than insomnia  or obstructive sleep 
apnea who are CPAP -compliant => 4 -hours/night use?  
Do you have any poorly managed medical/psychiatric illnesses, 
fibromyalgia, or a history of seizures?  
Are you  currently exceeding alcohol or abusing drugs?  
Do you engage in shift work of traveled > 1 time zone past month?  

 Page 14 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 Are you able to wear an actigraph on your non -dominant wrist?  
1. The PI or Study Coordinator will use the Recruitment Script and 
Participant Eligibility Screening Form (instruments attached) to screen all 
eligible participants and the Holland Sleep Disorders Questionnaire 
(HSDQ), a valid, reliable and accurate diagno stic measure based on the 
International Classification of Sleep Disorder (ICSD -2) to determine the 
presence of insomnia, sleep apnea or any other sleep disorder. Depending 
on the scores, participants will be enrolled, require additional screening 
(sleep ap nea) or referred to their provider for additional sleep disorders 
diagnoses.  
2. Individuals who screen positive for sleep apnea and insomnia will be invited to 
wear the small portable ApneaLink Plus device overnight for one night in their 
home to screen f or sleep apnea before continuing in the study. All results of the 
ApneaLink Plus overnight studies will be reviewed by Drs. Aquilina (consultant) 
and Dean (PI) after electronic scoring. Participants with moderate -severe sleep 
apnea (≥ 15 episodes/hour) wil l be referred for further evaluation and possible 
positive airway pressure treatment. Patients with moderate -severe sleep apnea will 
not be recruited in the proposed study.  
3. If a participant’s result to the screening indicate that they are not eligible,  they 
will be thanked for their interest and provided 2 copies of the ApneaLink Plus 
report: one for themselves and a copy for their provider.  
In addition, Buffalo Research Registry, Research Match, and i2b2 have been 
added to screen for eligible particip ants. For i2b2, the Institute of Healthcare 
Informatics team will provide contact information for the eligible participants. 
The provider will be contacted for approval using the Physician Permission Letter 
(draft letter attached). If the provider does not  object, patients will be contacted by 
mail (draft letter attached) and then by telephone. As a result of HRP -611 Partial 
HIPAA Waiver, we will prescreen clinic patients at Roswell Park Comprehensive 
Cancer Center.  
☐ N/A:   There is no screening as part o f this protocol.  
9.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐ N/A:   This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select this option, please make sure that 
all records review procedures and inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequately descri bed in other sections.  
9.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study.  Include specific methods you will use (e.g. 
searchin g charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advertisements, etc.).  
Response:  
 Page 15 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 Recruitment flyers (attached) will be distributed to institutions/organizations in 
WNY where participants are likely to be encountered like C ancer centers, 
community centers, Senior centers, VFW posts, etc . Study recruiters will review 
clinic schedules and prescreen medical records for cancer diagnosis, stage of 
disease and last treatment date to highlight potentially eligible participants for 
clinic staff. Clinicians involved in medical management of cancer survivors and 
their staff, will identify potential eligible participants, briefly explain the study, 
and obtain agreement from potential participants to be contacted. The PI or Study 
Coordin ator will then contact the eligible participant to obtain their affirmative 
response of their interest in participating and then arrange to meet each potential 
participant in the clinic or at their home, if preferred. Additionally, given the 
shelter -in-place situation and some previous patients had difficulty returning to 
the clinic for the face -to face intervention, we will now offer the option of verbal 
consent and online teaching.  
The following Research Participants Groups will be added: Buffalo Researc h 
Registry, Research Match, and i2b2. For i2b2, following IRB approval, the 
Institute of Healthcare Informatics team will provide contact information for the 
eligible participants. The provider will be contacted for approval using the 
Physician Permission Letter (draft letter attached). If the provider does not object, 
patients will be contacted by mail (draft letter attached) and then by telephone.  
9.2 Describe how you will protect the privacy interests of prospective subjects during the 
recruitment process.   
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.    
Response:  
Prospective eligible participants will only be approached by clinic staff regarding 
their interest in study participation. Only after eligible participants g ive consent to 
clinic staff will the PI or Study Coordinator screen the individual. Interested 
participants will be contacted in person or by telephone for the initial screening 
with study personnel (PI or Study Coordinator). If approached in person, eligi ble 
participants will be screened in a private clinic room with or without family 
members. Each subject in all phases of the study will be assigned a unique study 
identification number to be used on all data forms. All personally identifiable 
information w ill be kept strictly confidential.  The HRP -611 Partial HIPAA 
Waiver has been added  to document how privacy will be protected during the 
recruitment process for the new recruitment methods.   
  
9.3 Identify any  materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.  
For advertisements, include the final copy of printed advertisements with your 
submission. When advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final 
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior 

 Page 16 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 to taping to ensure the re will be no IRB -required revisions, provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version.

Letter to eligible patients in i2b2 database attached. Research Match -Contact 
Message will be a recruitment flyer.  
 
10.0 Procedures Involved  
10.1 Provide a description of all research procedur es or activities  being performed and 
when they are performed  once a subject is screened and determined to be eligible . 
Provide as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and include enough detail 
so that anothe r investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.  
Response:  
Following informed consent, in order to rule -out sleep apnea as a 
confounder, all eligible participants will be offered screen ing for sleep 
apnea with the ApneaLink Plus for one night. Following a negative screen 
for sleep apnea, demographics, diagnoses, t reatments, comorbidities, etc. 
will be extracted from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) using the 
Medical Record Review Questionnaire  (to verify certain self -report data) ; 
beliefs about sleep  will be determined by Dysfunctional Beliefs and 
Attitudes about  Sleep; mood, anxiety and depression will be measured 
with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; pain and quality of life will 
be determined by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -G; sleep 
quality will be measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality  Index; daily sleep 
will be assessed with 7 -day sleep diary ; objective sleep will be evaluated 
with 7 -day actigraph; fatigue will be assessed with Profile of Mood States; 
and daytime sleepiness will be determined by the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (Johns 1991).  
One week, after baseline assessments, each participant will be randomized 
by the biostatistician. Participants will then be scheduled for either the 
brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTI) session (experiment) or the 
healthy eating program (HEP) session ( control). Each intervention is 
approximately 45 -minutes and will be delivered in the clinical setting, 
online teaching or home.   
At the end of the intervention s, each participant will be provided weekly 
sleep diaries to complete for 2 -weeks and arrange fo r 2-follow up 
telephone calls using the Telephone Follow Up Script (attached). Each 
telephone contact will begin by reminding participants that their 
participation is voluntary and they may skip items they wish. Telephone 
 Page 17 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 contacts are not recorded, but the  research assistant will orally ask the 
participant to respond to the questions in the Telephone Follow Up Script 
and record responses as described in 10.2. Study packets with 
questionnaires will be repeated approximately one-month,  3-months and 
12-months after the intervention.  Patient Evaluation Questionnaire will be 
administered 1 -month and at end of study. Following the one -month data 
collection, the interventionist will contact participants to provide feedback 
on sleep diary data. In addition, two REDC ap emails at 6 -months and 9 -
months from the intervention will be sent to ensure patient safety and 
encourage participant retention. The emails will ask the participants to 
answer a safety question we currently ask at each previous data collection 
with a "Y es" or "No" answer: Do you find that your sleepiness is bad 
enough that you are at risk of falling asleep while driving or doing 
something hazardous or harmful?  Additionally, we will ask 2 questions 
from the Sleep Diary about their sleep:  Please rate over the past week: 
Restful sleep 0 -4 (4=excellent) and Sleep quality 0 -4 (4=excellent).  
     
10.2 Describe what data will be collected.   
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long -term follow up, 
consider the addition of  a schedule or table in  your response.  
Response:  
Data include apnea/hypopnea index, movement (i.e. actigraphs), self -report sleep 
diaries and sleep, mood and quality of life questionnaires. Two -semi -structured 
telephone interviews will be conducted. For each interview, the data will be the 
participant’s oral responses to the questions of the interview instruments as 
recorded in the research assistant’s handwritten notes.

16.1 Describe how you will protect subjects’ privacy interests  during the course of this 
research.  
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.  
Privacy applies to the person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about 
individuals for the research will be protected by the researcher from release.  
Confiden tiality applies to the data.   
Examples of appropriate responses include:  “participant only meets with a study 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear ”, or “the 
 Page 24 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 participant is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that 
they do not feel comfortable answering. ”   
Response:   
To protect participants’ privacy interests during the course of this research, study 
team members will only meet with the participants in a private clinic room or 
privately via the intern et where no one can overhear  the conversation. 
Additionally, participant s will routinely be reminded that they are free to refuse to 
answer any questions that they feel uncomfortable answering  at each data 
collection period . 
 
16.2 Indicate how the research team  is permitted to access any sources of information 
about the subjects.    
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:  school permission for review 
of records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.  This question does apply  to 
records reviews . 
Respons e:  
Each participant who signs an informed consent will be asked permission by the 
PI or Study Coordinator to verify diagnostic and treatment information in their 
electronic medical record.  For clinic list prescreening, we have completed a 
Request for Limi ted Waiver of the Authorization for the Use of Individually 
Identifiable Health Information for Subject Recruitment Authorization.  
 
17.0 Data Management  and Analysis  
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.   This section 
applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response:  
Specific Aim 1.  The primary analyses involve the statistical assessment of 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at 1 month and will be based on an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) mo del. In taking this approach, we fit the dependent 
variable as a linear function of independent variables randomized treatment 
assignment, patient cancer type, the interaction between treatment assignment and 
cancer type, and baseline ISI level. Rather tha n utilizing the null distribution 
associated with the classic F -test for overall treatment differences within the 
ANCOVA framework, which is dependent on the validity of distributional 
assumptions, an exact permutation testing approach will be utilized. Th e 
randomization mechanism at work is a crucial component in this study in that it 
will be used to create the randomization distribution by which statistical 
significance will be determined.  For more on this approach see Gail, Tan, and 
Piantadosi (1988) (120). Reported p -values will be obtained from the permutation 
distributions of the test statistics based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. As 
additional ana lyses, subject covariates will be included as independent variables. 
 Page 25 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 The interaction of treatment group and subject covariates may also be examined 
in a secondary fashion in order to identify possible differential effects of 
treatment. The analysis of seco ndary outcomes will proceed in a similar fashion. 
All statistical tests will be two -sided and tested at a 0.05 nominal significance 
level.  
Specific Aim 2.  Standard multiple regression will be used to determine predictors 
of efficacious response to BBTI.  Standard diagnostic plots will be used to assess 
model fit and transformations of variables may be considered in order to meet 
statistical assumptions.   
Specific Aim 3.  Evaluation of BBTI implementation focused on (a) 
characterization of the patient - and pro vider -level facilitators and barriers; and (b) 
knowledge/skills transfer among staff nurses using focus groups with each of the 
implementation facilitator groups. Transcript -based analysis, the most rigorous 
and accurate type of qualitative analysis, will be performed on focus group data. 
Audio recordings of each focus group meeting will be professionally transcribed 
verbatim and this text will provide the data for analysis. Prior to analysis, 
accuracy of the transcripts will be verified by Dr. Dickerson. T he research team 
(Drs. Dean and Dickerson) will read all data repeatedly to achieve immersion and 
obtain a sense of the whole (121). Then data will be read by highlighting exact 
words that capture key thoughts or concepts. Next, the researchers will record first 
impressions, thoughts and initial analysis from the data. Labels fo r codes will 
emerge as the process continues. Codes may come directly from the text and 
become the preliminary coding scheme. Codes will be sorted into categories, 
which will be used to organize and group codes into meaningful clusters. Final 
codes will be  organized into a hierarchical structure, if possible. Findings will be 
used to plan for dissemination and sustainability of this intervention. The 
software, Nvivo, will be used to assist in data management. During years 3 and 5, 
we will engage implementat ion facilitators and submit an IRB amendment before 
implementing aim 3.  
 
17.2 If applicable, p rovide a power analysis.    
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.   
Response:  
The estimate of the variability used for sample size calculations was based on 
previous results, which sh owed the standard deviation to be approximately 4.8. 
Calculations show a sample size of 55 per group (110 total) will allow us to detect 
differences as small as 3 with 90% power. Since the actual analysis to be 
performed is based on a model, which incorpor ates baseline ISI and cancer type, 
which will account for some of the unexplained variability in the dependent 
variable, these calculations may be viewed as conservative. Based on our 
 Page 26 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 experience,  we expect a 30% drop out rate, thus a total of 158 patients will be 
enrolled into this study.  
 
17.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data.  
Response:  
Participants will receive detailed verbal and written instructions from the PI and 
study coordinator on how to wear the actiwatch, complete the sleep diaries and 
self-report questionnaires. Also provided will be how to contact the PI and study 
coordinator with questions. Reminders and prompts will be provided to 
participants to avoid unintentional missing data.

 Page 28 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 19.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of 
Subjects  
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects , or is limited to records review 
procedures only .  This section does not apply.  
 
NOTE:  Minimal risk st udies may be required to monitor subject safety if the research 
procedures include procedures that present unique risks to subjects that require 
monitoring.  Some examples include:  exercising to exertion, or instruments that elicit 
suicidality or substance abuse behavior.  In such cases, N/A is not an acceptable 
response.  
 
19.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms 
and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe.  
Response:  
The PI will be responsible for ensuring data integrity and safety monitoring 
for human subjects and communicating any negative outcomes or any 
serious events to the IRBs and other offices/agencies.  Because of the 
minimal to low risk associated with this pr otocol, the data safety and 
monitoring plan (DSMP) for this project involves a Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC).  The SMC will ensure participant safety, ensure the 
validity and integrity of the data, monitor study progress, and make 
recommendations regard ing appropriate protocol and operational changes 
which may have substantial effects upon the ultimate interpretation of the 
study. They will also be responsible for promptly report any serious 
adverse events to the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at Rosw ell Park 
Cancer Institute and the University at Buffalo . 
Weekly reviews of participant accrual will be conducted by the PI during 
weekly research meetings. If participant accrual and/or retention drop 
below what is required for successful completion of thi s study, the PI will 
alert the statistician and strategies will be developed to overcome the 
identified problems. Records from subjects recruited during that week will 
also be scrutinized to insure that all participants are eligible for 
participation in th e study. The PI and members of the research team will be 
monitoring developments in the literature and results of related studies that 
may have an  impact on the safety of participants or on the ethics for the 
research study.  
 
19.2 Describe what data are reviewe d, including safety data, untoward events, and efficacy 
data.  
Response:  
Data review includes eligibility, referral for sleep apnea, referral for low oxygen 
during sleep, completion of data collection instruments, adherence to intervention, 
number of follo w up phone calls accepted, and outcome measures of efficacy:  
 Page 29 of 42 IRB Version: JAN201 6 sleep, mood, functional status and quality of life. Daytime sleepiness will also be 
evaluated daily, but monitored weekly . Additionally, as previously mentioned, we 
are adding a 6 and 9 month fo llow up email to check on participants’ safety. If 
participants report that they are excessively sleepy, we will provide 
recommendations to reduce sleepiness by telephone or email.   
Because of the minimal to low risk associated with this protocol there ar e no life -
threatening anticipated adverse events for this proposed research project. In the 
event of an unanticipated adverse event, such as disease -related patient death, it 
will be reported to and reviewed by the PI, SMC, and referring physician within 
seven days. Next, the IRBs at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and 
the University at Buffalo as well as sponsoring agencies (NINR) will be notified 
within 15 days. A thorough investigation will be initiated, including review of the 
protocol to insur e no undue exposure to risk occurred.  
19.3 Describe any safety endpoints.  
Response:  
This low risk intervention may lead to emotional distress in participants who may 
become frustrated if insomnia does not improve. Anxiety and depression will be 
assessed at bas eline, one, three and 12 -months post -intervention. Scores greater 
than seven on either scale will be communicated to participants who will be 
encouraged to contact their health care provider for follow up care.

NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
Response:  
A reasonable foreseeable risk is excessive daytime sleepiness early in the study 
from having night -time sleep curtailed as part of the intervention. Daily sleep 
diaries provide daily daytime sleepiness measures and the PI and Study 
Coordinator will monitor for this risk. The known discomfort s associated with this 
study include the possibility that  participants may become upset thinking about 
some of the questions or topics in this study. If this occurs, the participant should 
notify the research assistant and will then be provided with an appropriate referral 
for assistance. The skin on the partici pant’s wrist may become irritated by 
wearing the actigraph. If this occurs, the participant will be advised to remove the 
actigraph, apply a thin layer of Eurcerin lotion to the affected area and wear the 
actigraph on the opposite wrist.  
All reasonable eff orts will be used to protect the confidentiality of the 
participants’ protected health information.  Identifiable data is immediately de -
identified and de -identified data is stored separately from identifiable data. The 
results of this research will be publ ished. However, we will keep participants’ 
names and other identifying information confidential.

Response:  
 
This study  involves web -based data collection triggered via email, a 45 -minute 
educational session about sleep and two follow up telephone calls from a nurse in 
graduate student. We want to offer verbal consent to participate because some of 
our participants are una ble to return to the clinic for consent. The identifiable 
private information collected electronically in this study is secured via password 
protection. The participants will be provided information about the study  from the 
PI/study coordinator , an opportu nity to ask questions about the study and if they 
need time to think about their participation or discuss with others before 
consenting to participate in the study.  Each participant contact will include a 
reminder of the participant’s “voluntary participat ion.”

Dear Sir or Madam:   We are conducting a study to investigate the effects of postures on time up and go. In this study, we will measure the time is required for you to stand up from a chair, walk for 10 feet, and return to sit down in the chair. We will take the aforementioned baseline measurements first, and then we will ask you to hold a certain posture for 20 seconds. Immediately after you have held the posture for 20 seconds, we will take the measurements again. We will also need to collect information to describe you such as age or gender.  You will meet with us for one session and your participation should take about ten minutes.   Standing	for	20	seconds	poses	a	minimal	risk	to	you.	The	outcome	measurement	is	routinely	used	in	physical	therapy	practice.	To	our	knowledge,	there	are	no	risks	or	other	adverse	events	associated	with	these	practices.	The	likelihood	that	you	will	be	harmed	is	minimized	because	we	will	monitor	all	physical	discomfort	throughout	the	study	and	no	personal	identifying	information	will	be	collected	that	could	be	connected	to	your	personal	results.		There	are	no	direct	benefits	to	participate	in	this	study.	Benefits	to	society	include	the	advancement	of	scientific	knowledge	for	the	profession	of	physical	therapy	by	improving	patient	outcomes.	Your privacy is important and we will handle all information collected about you in a confidential manner. We will report the results of the project in a way that will not identify you. We plan to submit the results to professional conference presentation and journal publication.  You do not have to be in this study. If you don’t want to, you can say no without any negative consequences. If you do agree, you can stop participating at any time. If you wish to withdraw just tell us or the contact person listed below.

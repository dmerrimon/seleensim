1.7 Study Design 
 
This is an open-label, single-arm phase II  study of Cy/GVAX in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with MMR-p, ad vanced colorectal cancer who have 
progressed on at least two lines of prior therapies. Subjects with microsatellite repair 
deficiency (MMR-d; MSI) are no t eligible for this study. 
 Therapy is administered on days 1 and 2 of a 21 day cycle. On day 1, participants will 
receive their first dose of cyclophosphamide (Cy) 200 mg/m
2 and pembrolizumab 200 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  8mg, both administered intravenously (IV). On day 2, participants will receive GVAX, 
administered as 8-9 intradermal injections for a final dose of 5x108 colon cancer cells 
+ 5x107 GM-CSF secreting cells. Participants may continue therapy every 21 days 
until there is disease progression. After comp leting four cycles of therapy, patients 
will continue pembrolizumab with every cycle of therapy and cyclophosphamide and GVAX will be administered every 4
th cycles of therapy.  
  Due to the expectation that some patients may experience delayed clinical responses 
to therapy, patients with disease progressi on by radiographic imaging or laboratory 
parameters during a 12 week evaluation period  but without rapid clinical deterioration 
or significant change in performance status  that requires additional immediate therapy 
may continue to receive treatment on study. In this setting, a repeat scans will be obtained at weeks 6 and 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter from time of initial 
radiographic progression. This extra scan  at 6 weeks after initial radiographic 
progression will allow earlier recognition of true progression and will ensure that the treatment is stopped adequate ly if not working. Subjects who meet the above criteria 
and continue to receive treatment on study despite disease progression by radiographic imaging must discontinue treatment upon documentation of disease 
progression on the second scan (week 6). The date of progression will be backdated 
to the time of first RECIST criteria progression. Tumor assessments will be made using RECIST 1.1 and immune-related response criteria (irRC). All patients will be 
followed by this protocol for at least 30 da ys after their last dose of study drug or 
until initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first.  NOTE: For patients who progress and remain on study, at the time of the next restaging, stable disease with clinical stability as determined by their treating 
physican/team can remain on study. Specifica lly, these patients do not have to have 
regression to <20% growth from baseline. If  they do not have 20% increase from the 
last restaging scan, th ey may remain on study. 
 Patients who are discontinued from the study due to an unacceptable drug-related AE 
will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0-1 or stabilization or until initiation of a new therapy for their cance r, whichever occurs first. Patients who 
discontinue from treatment will be contac ted every three months  to monitor overall 
survival. Information about other cancer therapies after discontinuation from the 
study treatment will be collected.   At the end of the study, subjects will be re quired to enroll in a long-term follow-up 
protocol, an FDA requirement for genetically  modified products, in which they will 
be followed for at least five years (or until death) after re ceiving the last dose of any 
investigational agent through this protocol  for disease progression, survival, and 
potential long term toxicity of gene thera py. The subjects will be asked to enroll in 
the study entitled, “Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients who Received the Allogeneic Colon Cancer Cell Vaccine Administered  with a GM-CSF Producing Bystander Cell 
Line.” 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  92.1 Disease Type 
 
Despite the existence of excellent screeni ng and preventative stra tegies, colorectal 
carcinoma remains a major public health proble m in industrialized countries and a rising 
health problem in developing countries. About 102,480 new cases of colon cancer and 
40,340 cases of rectal cancer are expected to  occur in the United States in 2013, with 
about 50,830 deaths, accounting for approxima tely 9% of cancer deaths. Colorectal 
carcinoma is the third leading cause of deat h from cancer in both males and females, 
comprising 9% of all cancers diagnosed in men and women. It also is the third most 
common malignancy in both men (after prostate and lung cancers) and women (after 
breast and lung cancers) [1]. Surgical rese ction of the primary colorectal lesions 
combined with adjuvant chemotherapy a nd radiation, when indicated, remain the 
mainstay of therapy. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of these patients will be diagnosed with metastatic di sease at initial presentation, and an additional 25-30% of 
patients will subsequently develop meta static disease. Am ong these patients, 
approximately 20% will have disease confined to the liver, which is the dominant site of metastatic involvement [2]. Despite r ecent advances in earlier detection and 
improvements in chemotherapy, the median surv ival for all patients  with metastatic 
colorectal carcinoma ranges from 11-20 months  with five-year survival < 5% [3-8].  
 
2.2 Vaccine Therapy (GVAX) 
 
Immunotherapy is a potentially effective th erapeutic approach to the treatment of 
colorectal carcinoma for several reasons. First, immune-mediated tumor killing acts by mechanisms distinct from standard chemothe rapy or radiation therapy and may represent 
a non-cross resistant treatment modality. S econd, the immune system is capable of 
recognizing a diverse array of potential antigen s while orchestra ting selective and 
specific cytotoxic responses. This may be pa rticularly important in the killing of a 
heterogeneous tumor population while avoiding normal tissue toxicit y. Third, preclinical 
animal models using a vaccine approach for immunotherapy have been able to eliminate small burdens of established tumors, a situat ion that corresponds to a state of minimal 
residual disease commonly found after resection of all gro ss disease [9-14]. Fourth, 
completed Phase I and II trials evaluating irradiated, GM-CSF secreting allogeneic 
pancreatic cancer tumor vaccines have de monstrated both clinical and immunologic 
response [15-17].   The use of whole-cell vaccines is promising because it delivers a range of peptide antigens without the need fo r specific knowledge of the relevant target antigens. 
Preclinical studies show that among tumor ce lls genetically modified  to express various 
cytokines, GM-CSF is the cytokine most eff ective in inducing anti-t umor immunity [18]. 
GM-CSF is an important growth and differen tiation factor for dendritic cells, which are 
potent antigen-presenting ce lls. The use of allogeneic tumor cells for vaccine 
development over autologous tumor cells is a ttractive for several reasons. Autologous 
tumor cells are not always available and the production of an autologous vaccine is technically difficult, costly, and inefficient.  Supporting the use of allogeneic tumor cells 
is the characterization of tumor-associated an tigens in melanoma, which revealed that 
regardless of human leukocyte antigen (H LA) type, 50% of tumors share common 
antigens [19, 20]. In addition, both preclinical  and human data support that the antigen-
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  10presenting cells important in GM-CSF based vaccination are host-deri ved suggesting that 
the vaccine cells and the host do not ha ve to be HLA compatible [21, 22]. 
 
Phase I Study of an Allogeneic GM-CSF-S ecreting Tumor Vaccine in Patients with 
Resected Pancreatic Cancer  
 
This study was the first clinical trial to  test the hypothesis that GVAX can prime a 
systemic immune response in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma [15]. 
Fourteen patients with stage II or III diseas e received an initial vaccination 8 weeks 
following resection. This was a dose escalati on study in which 3 patients each received 1 
X 107, 5 X 107, and 1 X 108 vaccine cells. An additional 5 patients received 5 X 108 
vaccine cells. Study patients were jointly enrolled in an adjuvant chemoradiation protocol for 6 months. Following the completion of adjuvant chemoradiation, patients were re-
assessed and those who were still in remission were treated with 3 a dditional vaccinations 
given one month apart at the same original dose that  they received for the first 
vaccination. Toxicities were limited to grade I/ II local reactions at the vaccine site, and 
self-limited systemic rashes, including one  documented case of Grover's syndrome. 
Systemic GM-CSF levels were evaluated as an indirect measure of the longevity of 
vaccine cells at the immunizing site. As was observed in pre-clinical studies, GM-CSF 
levels peaked at 48 hours following vaccinati on. In addition, serum GM-CSF levels could 
be detected for up to 96 hours following v accination. The vaccin e sites were also 
evaluated as a measure of the local immune r eaction to the vaccine. Eleven of 14 patients 
demonstrated a similar local inflammatory response to what has been observed in pre-
clinical models and autologous GM-CSF vacci ne clinical trials . Post-vaccination DTH 
responses to autologous tumor cells have be en used in previously reported vaccine 
studies as a surrogate to identify and charact erize specific immune responses that are 
associated with vaccination. In the pancreatic  cancer vaccine trial,  post-vaccination DTH 
responses to autologous  tumor cells were observed in 1 of 3 patients receiving 1X 10
8 and 
in 2 of 5 patients receiving 5X108 vaccine cells. 
 
Follow-up Phase II Study Integrating the Whole Cell Vaccine with Chemoradiation 
for Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma  
 
The follow-up phase II study of 60 patients w ith resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
based on the results of thei r phase I experience was comple ted [17]. The highest dose of 
vaccine from the phase I study (5 X 108 vaccine cells) was used. The common toxicities 
associated with the vaccine in this study incl uded: local vaccine site  skin reactions and 
systemic rashes similar in severity (grade 1- 2) to what was observed in the phase I trial. 
The results from this study include the following: 
  The administration of the whole cell vaccin e is safe and well-tolerated. Treatment 
related side effects included transient vacci ne injection site reactions. There has been 
no incidence of anaphylaxis secondary to the vaccine repo rted thus far. 
  Systemic GM-CSF levels were evaluated as an indirect measure of the longevity of 
vaccine cells at the immunizing site. As was observed in the phase I study, GM-CSF 
levels peaked at 48 hours following the first and second vacc ination but peaked 
earlier following the 3rd and 4th vaccination with diminution in amplitude. Serum 
GM-CSF levels following vaccine 5 peaked again at 48 hours and returned to vaccine 1 serum levels. The results would suggest the possibility that the potency of an 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  11allogeneic vaccine is diminished with repe ated monthly vaccinations, but returns to 
pre-treatment levels with an extended time interval between boosts.  
  Post-Immunotherapy induction of  mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cells with higher 
avidity and increased mesothelin epitope recognition (T cell repertoire expansion) 
correlates with disease free survival (DFS). 
 
Phase I and II Trials of Combining GM-CSF Secreting Allogeneic Vaccines in Sequence with Immune Modulating Do ses of Cyclophosphamide (CY)  
 
Immune tolerance remains a major barrier to effective vaccine therapies. In particular, 
regulatory T cells (CD4
+CD25+) have been shown to play a role in inducing CD8+ T cell 
tolerance. Manipulating the regulatory T cells may result in more effective vaccine 
strategies. In mouse models, immune modula ting doses of CY in combination with GM-
CSF based cell vaccines have been shown to  improve tumor rejection from 0% to 10 - 
30% in the HER-2/neu transgenic mouse model. The addition of CY allowed the 
activation of high-avidity RNEU 420-429 -specific CD8+ T cells in the mice, which rejected 
tumor. This effect was abrogated by CD4+CD25+ T cells derived from neu-N transgenic 
mice suggesting that CY before vaccination may block T regulatory cells allowing for 
recruitment of latent high -avidity neu-specific CD8+ T cells [23].  
 
A feasibility study of the GM-CSF-secreting, all ogeneic vaccine administered alone or in 
sequence with CY in patients with stage 4 pa ncreatic cancer, has been completed. This 
study consisted of two cohorts: Cohort A- 30 patients administered a maximum of six 
doses of vaccine using our two pancreatic cance r cell lines (2.5x108 of each cell line) 
intradermally at 21 day intervals; Cohor t B- 20 patients administered CY 250 mg/m2 IV 
one day prior to each vaccina tion (administered as in Cohor t A). Results from this study 
represent the first demonstration that integr ating immunomodulatory doses of CY with a 
GM-CSF-secreting vaccine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is safe and 
feasible to administer. These data suggest that the vaccin e given in sequence with CY 
results in anti-tumor activity, where median survivals in Cohort A and Cohort B were 2.3 
months and 4.3 months respectively in a pati ent population that had received > 2 prior 
chemotherapies. In additi on, mesothelin-specific CD8 + T cell responses can be detected 
in stage 4 patients treated with the vaccine and may correlate with time to progression 
and overall survival [24].   A phase I dose ranging study was completed that evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of administer ing an allogeneic HER2-pos itive granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF) secreting tumor vaccine in combination with low-
dose CY and doxorubicin in pati ents with metasta tic breast cancer. Patients received 
three monthly immunizations with a booster vaccine 6-8 months from study entry. This 
study found that low dose CY can augment th e magnitude of vaccine-induced humoral 
immunity, but the therapeutic window for enhancing immune responses was narrow. 
Specifically, 200 mg/m2 of CY augmented th e magnitude of HER2-specific humoral 
immunity, whereas doses above 200 mg/m2 we re more likely to suppress both delayed 
type hypersensitivity and an tibody responses. The addition of CY did not potentiate 
vaccine-related toxicity  [25]. Thus, these findings provide the scientific rationale to 
continue to test combinations of vaccine  with other more potent immune modifying 
agents.

Safety and Feasibility Study of an Allogeneic Colon Cancer Cell Vaccine 
Administered with a GM-CSF Secreting Byst ander Cell line in Combination with 
Cyclophosphamide in Patients with Metastatic Colon Cancer  
 
Nine patients were treated in this dose-esc alating safety and feasibility study. Prior to 
treatment, six patients underwent curative me tastasectomy for hepatic metastases of 
colorectal adenocarcinoma and the other thre e had nonresectable metastatic colorectal 
adenocarcinoma. The investigational colon can cer vaccine consists of three components: 
a) SW837 cell line derived from a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma, b) SW620 cell 
line derived from a lymph node metastasis of colorectal adenocarcinoma, and c) 
K562/GM-CSF cell line, which is a K562 cell lin e derived from a CML patient in a blast 
crisis and subsequently tran sfected with a plasmid vector encoding human GM-CSF. A 
classical ‘3+3’ dose escalation design was adopt ed in this trial. Three patients were 
treated at dose level 1 (5x107 colon cancer cells + 4 x 107 K562). No dose limited 
toxicities (DLT) were observed in the first 3 patients, therefore six patients were treated at dose level 2 (5x10
8 colon cancer cells + 2 x 108 K562). No DLTs were observed at 
dose level 2. Patients received up to four monthly vaccin ations. Patients received an 
immunomodulatory dose of cyclophosphamide 200mg/m2 intravenously one day prior to 
each vaccine administration.   Local reactions at vaccination sites includi ng erythema, induration, pruritis, and 
tenderness were observed with every vaccination in all patients, similar to those reported 
in patients who received GM-CSF producing tumor vaccine of other disease types. 
Minimal systemic toxicities were observed. The most common side-effects are transient, 
low grade fever, chill, nausea and headache. Fever and chill are likely attributive to the 
vaccine treatment; and nausea is likely attr ibutive to the cyclophosphamide treatment. 
Headache may be attributive to  ondansetron, which was given as an optional anti-emetic 
prophylactic treatment prior to the administ ration of cyclophosphamide. There has been 
no incidence of anaphylaxis secondary to the vaccine reported thus far. Grade 3 
lymphopenia was transiently observed in one patient, presumably attributive to the 
cyclophosphamide treatment. Thus, the hi gher dose level comprised of 2.5 x 10
8 cells per 
colon tumor cell lines and 2 x 108 GM-CSF-producing K562 cells is considered  to have 
an acceptable degree of safety. In addition, cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/m2 
intravenously was well tolerated. 
 
2.3 Anti-PD-1 /PD-L1 therapy (Pembrolizumab (MK-3475 or Keytruda))  
 
The importance of intact immune surveillanc e in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades  [26]. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumo r-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis in various malignancies. In  particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the 
ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with 
improved prognosis and long-term survival in solid malignancies such as ovarian, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, hepato cellular carcinoma, malignant MEL and RCC. 
TILs can be expanded ex vivo  and re-infused, inducing dura ble objective tumor responses 
in cancers such as melanoma [27, 28].  
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pem brolizu
mab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018 13The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control. The normal f unction of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to dow n-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. Th e ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) 
are constitutively expressed or can be i nduced in various tumo rs [29-32]. Binding of 
either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 in hibits T-cell activation trigge red through the T-cell receptor. 
PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various  non-hematopoietic tissu es, most notably on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protei n is only detectably expressed on antigen-
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD-L2 
is thought to cont rol immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves 
to dampen unwarranted T-cel l function in peripheral tissues [29]. Although healthy 
organs express little (if any)  PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of this  T-cell inhibitor. High expression  of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to 
a lesser extent of PD-L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in 
various cancer types, includi ng renal cell carcinom a (RCC) [33], pancreatic carcinoma 
[34], hepatocellular carcinoma [35], ovarian carcinoma [36]. Furthermore, PD-1 has been 
suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-ce ll expansion in patients with malignant 
melanoma [37]. The observed correlation of clinical prognosis with  PD-L1 expression in 
multiple cancers suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1  pathway plays a critical role in tumor 
immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly se lective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly  block the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM (pem brolizumab) has recently been approved 
in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic non-
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma.

2.4 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data 
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for Preclinical and Clinical Data 
 
2.5 Rationale 
PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors have shown durable re sponses in a wide variety of tumors. 
However, in colorectal cancer, single agent pd-1 blockade with pembrolizumab has little 
or no activity in the majority of patients . A small subset of advanced colorectal 
carcinoma (<5%) is MMR-deficient (MMR-d) colorectal carcinoma. MMR-d, also 
referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI), is biologically marked by genomic 
instability with the potential of high num bers of neo-antigens and well described 

 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  15increases in tumor-inf iltrating lymphocytes (TILs) co mpared to other subtypes. In 
exploratory clinical trials, single agent pembrolizumab has been shown durable objective 
responses in many patients with MMR-d cance rs. However, MMR-p co lorectal cancer is 
the largest subtype of colorectal cancer, es timated to be between 90-95% of advanced 
disease. How to overcome the ineffectiveness of pembrolizumab in MMR-p colorectal 
cancer is therefore an important objective.  
The preclinical/clinical researchers at Johns  Hopkins with GVAX in pancreatic cancer 
and colon cancer have sugge sted that GVAX may prime an immune checkpoint inhibitor 
insensitive cancer into a sensitive one. We recently reported the results of a novel study 
of GVAX given as both neo-adju vant and adjuvant therapy, e ither alone or with immune 
modulating doses of cyclophosphamide (Cyt oxan, Cy) to deplete regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) [38]. Pathological ex amination of PDA tumor tissu e resected just two weeks 
following a single neoadjuvant dose of GVAX identified the formation of novel vaccine-
induced, immunologically active, tertiary ly mphoid aggregates, organized lymph node-
like structures that are not observed in tumo r tissue resected from unvaccinated patients. 
Our study showed for the first time that a vaccine-based immunotherapy can reprogram 
an immunologically quiescent tumor microenvi ronment (TME) into an immunologically 
active TME.  However, activated T cells secrete interferon- , which in turn upregulates 
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. These data support  an emerging concept that vaccines are 
required to induce a T cell response that is capable of infiltrating the TME. However, 
vaccination is just the first step toward establishing an effective antitumor immune 
response, converting the TME into an environm ent similar to what is observed in MMR-d 
colon cancer exhibiting infiltrating but immunosuppressed T cells prior to 
immunotherapy treatment. Thus, we hypothesi ze that treatment with GVAX primes the 
TME for anti-PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy [39]. 
To support this hypothesis, we showed in a preclinical model of PDA that combining 
anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies with  GVAX+Cy enhances the infiltration of 
effector T cells into PDA tumors as well as the cure rate in PDA tumor-bearing mice 
[40]. Others have showed the synergistic effect of anti-PD-1 antibody and colon GVAX 
in colon tumor-bearing mice [41]. We found that GVAX treatment can also induce the 
membranous expression of PD-L1 in colon tu mors in the mouse model. Therefore, we 
propose a clinical trial concept to examine th e objective response rate  of the combination 
of pembrolizumab and GVAX in MMR- p, advanced colorectal cancer.

J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  20 
Please see Section 5.2  for guidance regarding dosing delays. 
 4.1.1  GVAX  GVAX is administered through a tota l of 8-9 intradermal injections. 
Because the spatial distribution of v accine cells among three or more lymph 
node regions primes a more potent an ti-tumor immune response distributed 
equally among the right and left thighs, and the non-dominant arm. In the event that the specified limb is contraindicated, the dominant arm may be 
used. 
No pre-medications will be administer ed except a lidocaine-based topical 
anesthetic (may include but is not limited to EMLA or ELA-MAX) cream, which will be applied to the injection site at least 1 hour prior to vaccination to diminish the discomfort associated with intradermal injections. The patient must be observed in the clinic for at least 60 minutes after the first vaccine and 30 minutes for subsequent vaccinati ons. Acute reactions will be managed 
using standard therapy for acute drug reac tions as per institu tional standard of 
care and reported to the sponsor. 
4.1.2 Cyclophosphamide (CY, Cytoxan
R) Cy is a FDA-approved and widely used 
chemotherapy agent. Subjects may be pr e-medicated prior to administration 
with anti-emetics per institutional guide lines. Acute reactions will be managed 
using standard therapy for acute drug reac tions as per institu tional standard of 
care and reported to the sponsor. 
4.1.3 Pembrolizumab  (KEYTRUDA®, MK-3475) is a potent and highly-selective 
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed 
to directly block the interaction betw een PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-
L2. It is FDA-approved for treating me tastatic melanoma and metastatic 
PDL1 positive non-small cell lung cancer. Pembrolizumab will be 
administered IV over 30 minutes at  200 mg. Antiemetic medications should 
not be routinely administered prior to dosing except as indicated by patient’s 
prior reaction. Acute reactions will be managed as described in Section 4.2.3.1 
below. 
 
4.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
In general, concomitant medications and therapies deemed necessary for the 
supportive care and safety of the subjec t are allowed, provided their use is 
documented in the subject records and on the appropriate case report form. If toxicity 
occurs, the appropriate treatment will be used to ameliorate signs and symptoms 
(including antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, anti-diarrheals for diarrhea and anti-
pyretics and anti-histamines for drug feve r). All supportive measures for optimal 
medical care will be given during the period of study.  
 
4.2.1 Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 
 
Cyclophosphamide is commonly used in chemotherapy to treat a variety of 
cancer diseases. Although cyclophosphamide  is administrated at low doses, 
subjects may still experience the side effects below, but generally the side 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  21effects tend to be milder than sta ndard dose cyclophosphamide. Side effects 
that have reported with cyclophosphamide, when it is given at a standard dose, 
include: 
 Common toxicities : leucopenia/neutropenia,  low appetite, nausea, 
vomiting, fatigue, and hair loss.   Less common toxicities:  hyponatremia, early menopause, hematuria, and 
pain due to inflammation in the bl adder, liver, lungs, or veins 
 Rare but clinical important toxicities: hives, blurry vision, numbness 
and tingling of the mouth and throat, pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment with 
Cytoxan can also increase the risk of other cancers (bladder and skin cancers, 
leukemia). 
 Acute reactions will be managed usi ng standard therapy for acute drug 
reactions as per inst itutional guidelines

Local skin reactions at v accine sites may be treated with cold packs, topical 
lotions (e.g. aloe vera or vitamin E). Pruritus can be managed with topical or 
systemic benadryl. Significant local in flammation leading to severe pain may 
be treated with oral analgesics. Local ulceration should be managed with local 
wound care, with or without antibiotics, and should be evaluated on a case-by-
case basis. 
 4.2.3 Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, MK-3475) 
 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monocl onal Ab. Subjects should be closely 
monitored for potential adverse reactions during antibody infusion and potential adverse even ts throughout the study.  
 Unexpected Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24-72 hours if clin ically indicated and mon itored as necessary to 
determine if event meets toxicity criteria.  
4.2.3.1 Infusion Reactions 
 Pembrolizumab infusion reactions may consist of fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, head ache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, 
vomiting, myalgia, dizziness or hyperten sion. Severe reactions may include 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular 
fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. Patie nts should be closely monitored for 
such reactions. Guidelines for patients who experience an infusion related or 
allergic reaction during or after infusion with pembrolizumab are shown below.

4.2.3.2 Immune-Related Adverse Events (IRAEs)  
 
Blocking PD-1 function may permit the emergence of auto-reactive T cells 
and resultant clinical autoimmunity. Rash/pruritis, diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and hypothyroidism were drug-related, presumptive autoimmune events, now termed IRAEs.   For the purposes of this study, an IRAE  is defined as an AE of unknown 
etiology, associated with drug exposure  and is consistent with an immune 
phenomenon. Efforts should be made to  rule out neopla stic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin or other etiologic caus es prior to labeling an AE an IRAE. 
Serological, immunological, a nd histological (biopsy) da ta should be used to 
support the diagnosis of an immune-med iated toxicity. Susp ected IRAEs must 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  24be documented on an AE or SAE CRF. Identification and tr eatment of IRAEs 
can be found in Appendix B .

should be within normal institutional limits) 
 Hemoglobin < 8 g/dL 
 ANC < 1000/uL  
 Platelets < 75 x 103/uL 
 
4.5 Definition of an Overdose for this Protocol 
 
Overdose of pembrolizumab is defined as: The patient has taken (accidentally or in tentionally) a dose of  pembrolizumab of 
≥1000mg ( ≥5 times the indicated dose).  No spec ific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In  the event of overdose, pembrolizumab 
should be discontinued and the subject should be obser ved closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provi ded if clinically indicated.

J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  25 
If an adverse experience(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of test 
drug or vaccine, the adverse experience(s) is  reported as a serious adverse experience, 
even if no other criteria for serious are met. 
If a dose of test drug or vaccine meeting th e protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical sympto ms or abnormal laboratory results, the 
overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest  (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse experience must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and Merck Gl obal Safety. Merck Global Safety (GS) 
contact information can be found in Section 6.5.1 . 
4.6 Contraception, Use in Pregnancy, Use in Nursing 
 
4.6.1 Contraception  The investigational agents may ha ve adverse effects on a fetus in utero . Furthermore, 
it is not known if the invest igational agents have tran sient adverse effects on the 
composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-br east-feeding women may be enrolled if 
they are considered highly unlikely to co nceive. Highly unlikel y to conceive is 
defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years 
of age and has not had menses for grea ter than 2 years will be considered 
postmenopausal), or 3) amenorrheaic fo r <2 years without a hysterectomy and 
oophorectomy and with a documented FSH value in the postmenopausal range, or 4) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study, or 5) heterosexually active and 
willing to use 2 methods of birth control (which is also required for the female 
partners of male patients). The 2 birth control methods can be 2 barrier methods or a 
barrier method plus a hormonal method to  prevent pregnancy, used throughout the 
study starting with Visit 1through 120 days af ter the last dose of study medication. 
Male patients enrolled in th is study must also agree to  use an adequate method of 
contraception starting with Visit 1 through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. 
 The following are considered adequate barr ier methods of contra ception: diaphragm, 
condom (by the partner), copper intrau terine device, sponge, or spermicide. 
Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed 
contraceptive agent that contains an estr ogen and/or a progestational agent (including 
oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine , or intramuscular agents). 
 Patients should be informed that taki ng the study medication may involve unknown 
risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnanc y were to occur duri ng the study. In order 
to participate in the study, they must a dhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) for the duration of the st udy. If there is any question that a patient 
will not reliably comply w ith the requirements for contraception, that patient should 
not be entered into the study.  4.6.2 Use in Pregnancy  
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  26The investigational agents may have adve rse effects on a fetus; therefore, women 
with a positive pregnancy test at screening will not be eligible for enrollment. If a 
patient inadvertently becomes pregnant  while on treatment with combination 
immunotherapy, the patient will immediatel y be removed from the study. The site 
will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminate d. The outcome of the pregnancy will be 
reported to the Sponsor and to Merck Globa l Safety without delay. The outcome must 
be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to Merck Global Safety if the outcome is a serious adverse experi ence (e.g., death, abortion, co ngenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). If a male 
patient’s partner becomes pregnant on study the pregnancy must be reported to the 
Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety as described in Section 6.5.1 . The study 
Investigator will make every effort to obt ain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condi tion of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor and to 
Merck Global Safety.  4.6.3 Use in Nursing Women  It is unknown whether the inve stigational agents are excreted in human milk. Since 
many drugs are excreted in human milk, a nd because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are br east-feeding are not 
eligible for enrollment. 
 
4.7 Dose Limiting Toxicity 
  
Unless otherwise specified below, un acceptable toxicities are defined as: 
 Treatment-related ≥ grade 4 AEs, or  
 Treatment-related grade 3 AEs that do not improve to ≤ grade 2 under 
supportive therapy within 3 weeks. 
 Death within 30 days of receiving inve stigational agent that is considered 
related to the agent as a study stopping criterion 
 Hematologic toxicity The only adverse hematologic events that will be considered dose limiting are: 
 Grade 4 anemia related to study therapy 
 Grade 4 neutropenia that lasts > th an 7 days or febrile neutropenia 
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia th at lasts greater than 7 days or has clinically 
significant bleeding 
 
Electrolyte aberrations 
 Unexpected Grade 3 or greater labor atory abnormalities should be repeated 
within 24-72 hours if clinically indi cated and monitored as necessary to 
determine if event meets toxicity criteria. 
 Patients may continue therapy without  interruption for any electrolyte 
abnormality that can be corrected with intervention to < grade 2.

4.8 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to  adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
indefinitely until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  30 Continued radiographic evidence of di sease progression on two subsequent 
imaging scans 6 weeks apart,  
 Clinical progression or  deterioration per Section 4.10 , 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) as described in Section 4.7 , 
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in th e judgment of the investigator, or 
 
 Achieved a complete response to therapy, and received 6 weeks of therapy 
beyond the date when the initial comp lete response was declared without 
evidence of disease recurrence, or 
 
 Completed 24 months of study medi cation or 35 administrations of 
Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab, whichever is later. Note: 24 months of study 
medication is calculated from the date of  first dose. Subjec ts who stop therapy 
after 24 months may be eligible for up to  one year of additional study treatment 
if they progress after st opping study treatment provide d they meet the initial 
study requirements. See Section 4.9  below. 
 
4.9 Off Treatment Evaluation and Retreatment Criteria 
 
If a patient is disc ontinued from study medication afte r completion of 24 months of 
treatment, a mandatory Off Treatment Evalua tion should be performed 30 days (+/- 7 
days) after the last treatment as  described in the Study Calendar ( Section 9 ). Patients 
should continue to be monitored for dise ase status by radiologic imaging and tumor 
marker(s) every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks). In addition, we will also continue to collect 
peripheral blood, serum, and plasma samp les every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) as 
described in the Study Calendar ( Section 9 ). Patients will also be monitored for AEs 
up to the Off Treatment Evaluation or to resolution of drug-related AEs to ≤ Grade 1, 
whichever occurs later. SAEs that occur with in 90 days of the last treatment or before 
initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment should also be followed and recorded.  
 Retreatment Criteria 
 Patients who stop therapy with SD or better may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional therapy with Cy/GVAX/pembroliz umab if they progr ess after stopping 
therapy and they meet the following criteria:  EITHER:  
 Stopped initial treatment with Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab  after attaining an 
investigator determined confir med CR according to RECIST 1.1 
o Was treated for at least 24 weeks with Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab before 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  31discontinuing therapy 
o Received at least two treatments with Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab beyond the 
date when the initial CR was declared 
 OR:  
 Subject had SD, PR or CR and stopped Cy /GVAX/pembrolizumab treatment after 24 
months of study therapy for reasons other th an disease progression or intolerability 
 AND:  
 Experienced an investigator-determined confirmed radiographic disease progression 
after stopping their initial treatment with Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab  
 Did not receive any anti-cancer tr eatment since the last dose of 
Cy/GVAX/pembrolizumab  
 Meets the initial study requirements as detailed in Section 3.1 
 
 Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum 
pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to re ceiving retreatment with study medication. 
 
Subjects who restart treatment should resume  at the same dose and cycle interval 
which they were receiving prior to di scontinuation. Study visit requirements are 
outlined in the Study Calendar ( Section 9 ). 
  
4.10 Duration of Follow Up   
 
Patients will be followed for 30 days after th eir last dose of study drug or until death, 
whichever occurs first. SAEs that occur w ithin 90 days of the last infusion of MK-
3475 or before initiation of a new antineopl astic treatment shoul d also be followed 
and recorded. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabil ization of the adverse event. 
 Patients who discontinue from treatment s hould be contacted every three months to 
monitor overall survival. In formation of other cancer th erapies after discontinuation 
from the study treatment will be collected.  At the end of the study, subjects will be re quired to enroll in a long-term follow-up 
protocol, an FDA requirement for genetically  modified products, in which they will 
be followed for  at least 5 years (or until death) after receiving the last dose of any investigational agent for disease progres sion, survival, and potential long term 
toxicity of gene therapy. The subjects will  be asked to enroll in the study entitled, 
“Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients who Recei ved the Allogeneic Colon Cancer Cell 
Vaccine Administered with a GM-CSF Producing Bystander Cell Line.” 
 
4.11 Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment 
 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  32Patients will be removed from study treatme nt when any of the criteria listed in 
Section 4.8  applies. The reason for study removal and the date the patient was 
removed must be documented in the Case Report Form.  Patients with disease progression by radiogr aphic imaging or laboratory parameters 
during the 12-week evaluation but without rapi d clinical deterioration or significant 
change in performance status that requires additional immediate therapy may 
continue to receive treatment on study. Subjects that meet the above criteria and continue on study therapy must discontinue  treatment upon documentation of disease 
progression on the second scan six weeks later, with the date of progression being 
backdated to the first RECIST  1.1 progression time point.  
 
NOTE: For patients who progress and remain on study, at the time of the next restaging, stable disease with clinical stability as determined by their treating 
physician/team can remain on study. Specifica lly, these patients do not have to have 
regression to <20% growth from baseline. If  they do not have 20% increase from the 
last restaging scan, th ey may remain on study. 
 
 
5. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
5.1  Dose Modifications 
 
Dose reduction or dose increase of CY, GVAX, and pembrolizumab will not be 
permitted in individual patients. 
 
5.2  Dosing Delays 
 
5.2.1 All scheduled cycles with in a course are to be given approximately 3 weeks 
apart. If necessary, a cycle may be de layed for up to 1 week. In this case, 
subsequent cycles should continue so that  a subject can still receive all cycles 
given that the cycles are a minimum of 3 weeks apart and they have not 
experienced an AE necess itating discontinuation. If de layed more than 1 week, 
the Principal Investigator must be c ontacted for further instructions on 
continued treatment. Additional delays or modifications to the treatment schedule must be approved by the Prin cipal Investigator  or IND Sponsor. 
 
If a delay occurs between Day 1 and 2 in a cycle: 
 Pembrolizumab-related infusion reactions must resolve to baseline prior to 
administration of GVAX. 
 Resume Day 2 treatment and assessme nt schedule without repeating Day 1 
study treatments if the delay is within 72 hours. 
 If the delay is longer than 72 hours, repeat Day 1 and Day 2 (if applicable) 
study treatments/assessments with a minimum of 1 week from the 
previous Day 1 treatment. This includes  steroid treatment requiring at least 
a 14 day washout prior to resu ming study-related treatments. 
 
Pembrolizumab will be withheld for drug-related Grade 4 hematologic toxicities, non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 including laboratory 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  33abnormalities, and severe or life-threatening AEs as per Table 5 . 
 
Table 5: Pembrolizumab Dose Del ay and Discontinuation Criteria 
  
General instructions: 
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Gr ade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks. 
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pemb rolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to 
Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not 
resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day 
within 12 weeks.  
3. For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first followed by oral steroid. Other 
immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  35In case toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks afte r last infusion, trial treatment 
should be discontinued after consultation with th e Sponsor. With Sponsor and Merck agreement, 
subjects with a laboratory adverse event still at Grade 2 after 12 weeks may continue treatment in 
the trial only if asymptomatic and controlled.  In the case that a participant develops intolerance or  side effect that is attributable to one agent 
(for example, intolerance only to Cy/GVAX or intolerance only to pembrolizumab), the 
participant may, at his or her discretion, continue to  receive the other ac tive agent on study as 
otherwise indicated as long as they have received at least 1 full dose of both Cy/GVAX and 
pembrolizumab.   
6. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST A ND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
This study will use the descriptions and gradi ng scales found in the revised National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events (CTCAE) Active version for 
adverse event reporting that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/proto colDevelopment/electroni c_applications/ctc.htm .  
 
Information about all adverse events, whethe r volunteered by the subject, discovered by 
investigator questioning, or dete cted through physical examinat ion, laboratory test or other 
means, will be collected, recorded, and followed as appropriate.   The PI has the primary responsibility for contin uous internal monitoring for safety, protocol 
compliance, and identification,  grading, coding, and required re porting of all anticipated and 
unanticipated adverse events and protocol pr oblems. Although this resp onsibility is usually 
shared among the PI, research nurse, and data manager, the PI is ultimately responsible for 
grading and attribution of all events. 
 All adverse events experienced by subjects will be collected and reported from the first dose of the investigational agent, throughout the study, and will only be followed for 90 days 
unless related to the investigational agent. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be 
collected for 90 days after the end of treatment.  Subjects who have an ongoing a dverse event related to the study procedures and/or 
medication(s) may continue to be periodically contacted by a member of the study staff until 
the event is resolved or determined to  be irreversible by the investigator. 
 Patients who experience a Grade 2 or higher ir AE should be discussed with the IND Sponsor. 
In addition, irAEs listed in Section 6.1.3  must be reported as an Ev ent of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) within 24 hours to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Sa fety even if no Serious Adverse 
Event Criteria are met.  Laboratory abnormalities:  Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will be 
recorded as pre-treatment si gns and symptoms. After study treatment administration, all 
grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an incr ease in severity from baseline 
will be reported as adverse events. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be 
reported as an adverse event only if it is considered clinically significant by the investigator. 
 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  366.1 Definitions 
 
6.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Adverse event is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug (or therapy) ev en if the event is not 
considered to be related to the stud y. An undesirable medical condition can be 
symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. , tachycardia, enlarged liver) or 
the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. , laboratory findings, 
electrocardiogram). Medical conditions /diseases present before starting the 
study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting 
the study treatment (any procedures specifi ed in the protocol). Adverse events 
occurring before starting the study tr eatment but after signing the informed 
consent form will not be recorded. Abnor mal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical  signs or symptoms or 
require therapy. 
 
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event is an undesira ble sign, symptom or medical condition 
which:  • Results in death  • Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or  causes prolongation of existing 
hospitalization (see note belo w for exceptions) > 24 hours 
• Results in persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defe ct (note: reports of congenital 
anomalies/birth defects must also be  reported on the Pregnancy Supplemental 
Form)  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospita lization but, based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other 
serious outcomes listed in the definition above.). Examples of such events 
include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dys crasias or convulsi ons that do not 
result in hospitalization.) 
• Is a new cancer (that is no t a condition of the study) 
• Is associated with an overdose 
 
Events not considered to be seriou s adverse events are hosp italizations for the:  
• Admissions as per protocol for a pla nned medical/surgical procedure or to 
facilitate a procedure 
• Routine health assessment requiring ad mission for baseline/trending of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  37• Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state 
and was planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is 
required in these cases  
• Admission encountered for another life ci rcumstance that carries no bearing on 
health status and requir es no medical/surgical inte rvention (eg, lack of 
housing, economic inadequacy, care-giver  respite, family circumstances, 
administrative). 
 
6.1.3 Adverse Events of Clinical In terest (ECI) for pembrolizumab 
 
Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) a nd must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and 
within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety using the form found in Appendix C . (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; ). 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes  the subject to be excluded from the 
trial, or is the result of a protocol-s pecified intervention,  including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment 
or a procedure. 
For the time period beginning at trea tment allocation/ra ndomization through 90 
days following cessation of treatment , or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject in itiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, 
any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whethe r or not related to Merck product, must 
be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 24 hours to Merck Global 
Safety. 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 
 An overdose of Merck's product, as defined in Section 4.5 , that is not 
associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
 An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the 
upper limit of normal and an elevated tota l bilirubin lab value that is greater 
than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an 
alkaline phosphatase lab value that is  less than 2X the upper limit of normal, 
as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note:  These criteria are based  upon available regulatory guidance 
documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a th reshold of abnormal 
hepatic tests that may require an additional eval uation for an underlying 
etiology.  
6.2 Relationship 
 
The relationship of an AE to the administ ration of the study drug is to be assessed by 
the investigator according to  the following definitions:  
 

 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  38 No (unrelated, not related, no relation):   The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurr ence or worsening of the adverse event 
rules out a causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, 
complications, etc.) is suspected.   
 Yes (related):  The time course between the admi nistration of study drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the adverse even t is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (concomitant drugs, th erapies, complications, etc.) can be 
identified.   The following factors should also be considered:  
 The temporal sequence from study drug ad ministration - The event should occur 
after the study drug is given. The length of  time from study drug exposure to event 
should be evaluated in the clin ical context of the event.  
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent dis eases - Each report should be evaluated 
in the context of the natural history and c ourse of the disease being treated and any 
other disease the subject may have.  
 Concomitant medication - The other medi cations the subject is taking or the 
treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them 
might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug - Clinical and/or preclinical 
data may indicate whether a particular res ponse is likely to be a class effect.  
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresse s - The exposure to stress might induce 
adverse changes in the recipi ent and provide a logical a nd better explanation for the 
event.   The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug - The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distri bution, metabolism, and excretion) of the 
study drug should be considered.  Assessment of Grade:  The investigator will make an assessment  of grade for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, which will be recorded in the CRF. The assessment will be based on 
the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE (Ver sion 4.03) and graded as shown below: 
 • Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; inte rvention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental  activities of daily living 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significan t but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-
care activities of daily living • Grade 4: Life-threatening consequen ces; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE 
 Any AE that changes in grade during its cour se will be recorded in the CRF at the 
highest level experi ence by the subject.

J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  39 
6.3 Expectedness 
 
Unexpected adverse event: An adverse event, which varies in nature, intensity or 
frequency from information on the invest igational drug/agent provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, package insert or safety reports. Any a dverse event that is 
not included in the informed consent is considered “unexpected”.  
 Expected (known) adverse event: An advers e event, which has been reported in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. An adverse event is considered “expect ed”, only if it is 
included in the informed consent document as a risk.  
6.4 Handling of Expedited Safety Reports 
 
In accordance with  local regulations, the Sponsor will  notify investigators of all SAEs 
that are unexpected (i.e. not previously de scribed in the Investigator Brochure), and 
definitely, probably, or po ssibly related to pembrolizumab, cyclophosphamide, or 
GVAX. This notification will be in the form of an expedited safety report (ESR) that 
is to be faxed to the investigators and the study coordinators within 48 hours. Upon 
receiving such notices, the investigator mu st review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator’s Brochure and wh ere required by local regulati ons, the investigator will 
submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The i nvestigator should also comply with the 
IRB procedures for reporting any othe r safety information. Where required, 
submission of ESRs by the investigator to  Health Authorities should be handled 
according to local regulations.  
 
6.5  Reporting 
 
6.5.1  General 
 
All adverse events (both expected and unexpected) will be captured on the appropriate study-specific cas e report forms (CRFs).  
 In addition, all serious adverse events, regardless of causality to study drug, will be reported promptly to the IND Sponsor (Dr. Lei Zheng, 
) within 24 hours of recognition of the adverse event 
using the form found in Appendix D . If this falls on a weekend or holiday, an 
email notification is acceptable but must  be followed by an SAE reporting form 
on the next business day.  All serious adverse events, regardless of causality to study drug and/or 
administration will be forwarded to Merck’s Global Safety (“Merck GS”) group within 24 hours of l earning of the event.  
 After the initial SAE report, the investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide further information to the safety department  in regards to the 
subject’s condition.   

 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  40All SAE(s) will be followed until: 
•         Resolution 
•         Th e condition stabilizes 
•         The event is otherwise explained •         The subject  is lost to follow-up 
 Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, a follow-up SAE report will be 
submitted to the IND Sponsor, Merck GS. 
 Non-serious Events of Intere st will be forwarded to Me rck GS and will be handled 
in the same manner as SAEs.   Although pregnancy and lactat ion are not considered ad verse events, it is the 
responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or 
lactation in a subject (spont aneously reported to them), including the pregnancy of 
a male subject's female partner who has provided written consent to provide information regarding pregnancy, that occu rs during the trial or within 120 days 
of completing the trial. All subjects who b ecome pregnant must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnanc y. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous 
abortion, missed abortion, beni gn hydatidiform mole, blig hted ovum, fetal death, 
intrauterine death, miscarriag e and stillbirth must be reported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also  be reported to Merck GS.  
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to Merck GS facsimile number: . 
 
6.5.2  Institutional Review Board (IRB) an d Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)  
 
All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and IBC per institutional standards. Follow-up information will be given to the IRB and IBC as soon as 
relevant information is available, per institutional standards.  
6.5.3  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
 
All reporting to the FDA will be completed by the sponsor. 
 6.5.3.1 Expedited IND Safety Reports: 
 
7 Calendar-Day Telephone or Fax Report :  
The Sponsor is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or  life-threatening 
adverse event that is unexpected and asse ssed by the investigat or to be possibly 
related to the investigati onal agent. Such reports ar e to be telephoned or faxed 
(  to the FDA within 7 calendar days of first learning of the event.  
 
15 Calendar-Day Written Report :  
The Sponsor is required to  notify the FDA of any serious adverse event that is 
unexpected and possibly related to the i nvestigational agent in a written IND 
Safety Report.  

 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  41 
Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32. A ll safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed. The new report should contain comments on the significan ce of the new event in light of the 
previous, similar reports.   Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be submitted to the FDA within 15 calendar days of first learning of the event.  
 6.5.3.2 IND Annual Reports  
In accordance with the regulation 21 CFR § 312.33, the Sponsor shall within 60 days of the anniversary date  that the IND went into effect submit a brief report 
of the adverse events and progress of the investigation. Please refer to Code of 
Federal Regulations, 21 CFR § 312.33 for a lis t of the elements required for the 
annual report. All IND annual reports will be submitted to the FDA by the 
Sponsor-Investigator. 
 
6.5.4 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)  
Unexpected SAEs believed to be rela ted to GVAX will be reported to RAC by 
email if fatal or life-threatening within 7 calendar days or by written report if related and unexpected to GVAX within  15 calendar days. SAEs that are 
unrelated or related and expected with  GVAX will be reported to RAC in the 
Annual Report. Follow-up information will  be submitted to the RAC as soon as 
relevant information is available. 
 
7. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
7.1  Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan
®, CY) 
 
7.1.1 Agent Accountability The IND Sponsor or the Sponsor’s represen tative shall take re sponsibility for and 
shall take all steps to maintain appropria te records and ensure  appropriate supply, 
storage, handling, distribution and usage of  investigational product in accordance 
with the protocol and any app licable laws and regulations. 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  42 
7.1.2 Mode of Action  CY is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. CY is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed 
function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of 
susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant  cells. The mechanism of action is thought 
to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.  7.1.3 Description  CY (CYTOXAN®; cyclophosphamide for injec tion, USP) is a sterile, white powder 
containing cyclophosphamide m onohydrate and is supplied in vials for single-dose 
use.  7.1.4 Packaging and Labeling Information  CY is commercially available.  7.1.5 Preparation  Parenteral drug products should be inspec ted visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to admi nistration, whenever solution and container permit. Add 
the diluent to the vial and shake it vigor ously to dissolve. If the powder fails to 
dissolve immediately and comple tely, it is advisable to al low the vial to stand for a 
few minutes. Use the quantity of diluen t shown below to constitute the product: 
 
Dosage Strength CYTOXAN Contains 
Cyclophosphamide Monohydrate Quantity of Diluent 
 
500 mg 534.5 mg 25 mL 
1 g 1069.0 mg 50 mL 
2 g 2138.0 mg 100 mL 
 
CY may be prepared for parenteral use by infusion using any of the following methods: 
1. CY constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused without further 
dilution. 
2. CY constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused following further 
dilution in the following: 
 
 Dextrose Injection, USP (5% dextrose) 
 Dextrose and Sodium Chlo ride Injection, USP (5% dextrose and 0.9% sterile 
sodium chloride) 
 5% Dextrose and Ringer’s Injection 
 Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP 
 Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.45% sterile sodium chloride) 
 Sodium Lactate Injection, USP (1/6 molar sodium lactate)  
 
7.1.6 Storage 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5 / January 17, 2018  43 
Store vials at or below 77° F (25° C).  7.1.7 Stability  CY (prepared for either direct injection or  infusion) is chemically and physically 
stable for 24 hours at room temperature or for 6 days in the refr igerator; it does not 
contain any antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the 
sterility of prepared solutions.  7.1.8 Route of Administration  CY is administered by IV  injection over 30 minutes. 
 7.1.9 Subject Care Implications  During treatment, the subject ’s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and 
platelets) should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic 
suppression.  The rate of metabolism and th e leukopenic activity of CY reportedly are increased by 
chronic administration of high doses of phenobarbital. The physician should be alert 
for possible combined drug actions, desira ble or undesirable, involving CY even 
though CY has been used successfully concu rrently with other drugs, including other 
cytotoxic drugs. CY treatment, which cause s a marked and persis tent inhibition of 
cholinesterase activity, potentiates the e ffect of succinylcholine chloride. If a subject  
has been treated with CY within 10 days of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist 
should be alerted.  CY may interfere with normal wound healing.

8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES 
 
Sample collection, processing, a nd storage instructions will be provided in the Laboratory 
Manual. The specimens below will be stored and evaluated in Dr. Zheng’s laboratory. 
 
8.1 Tumor Tissue Studies 
 
Tumor biopsies will be performed on subjects  with accessible tumor at baseline and 
during treatment (during week 6 or 7). Ho wever, tumor biopsy will not be performed 
either at baseline and/or during treatment if  the tumor is not accessible or if biopsy is 
considered not in patient’s best interest. An additional biopsy at the time of response 
and/or progression is optional. Tumor sample s will be collected by core biopsy from 
accessible tumor tissue. A maximum of 6 core biopsies (or fine needle aspirates, if 
cores are considered unsafe) will be obtained from each subject.  
Attempts will be made to obtain archived tissue samples from all subjects  
 
8.2  Whole Blood Peripheral Blood Lym phocytes (PBLs) and Circulating Tumor 
Cells (CTCs) 
 
Up to 180 cc of whole blood w ill be collected for isolation of PBL at baseline (C1D1) 
and at every 6 weeks (with every other cycl e of treatment) up to and including C5D1. 
After C5D1, blood will then be collected every 12 weeks (every 4
th cycle; C9D1) and 
at the off study visit. In additi on, up to 20 cc of whole blood may be 
collected/aliquoted for circul ating tumor cell analyses.  
 
8.3  Serum and Plasma Marker Studies 
 
Whole blood for serum (20 cc) and plasma (20 cc) will be collected at baseline 
(C1D1) and at every 6 weeks (with ever y other cycle of treatment) up to and 
including C5D1. After C5D1, blood with then  be collected ever y 12 weeks (every 4th 
cycle; C9D1) and at the off study visit to  identify potential therapeutic targets, 
biomarkers, circulating DNA analyses, and predictors of response and autoimmune 
toxicity through proteomic approaches.

after progression (+/- 7 day window), 12 weeks after progression (+/- 7 days), and every 12 
weeks thereafter (+/- 7 days). If  the off study visit occurs early, s cans do not need to be repeated 
if one has been perfor med within 6 weeks. 
13) Baseline serum and plasma collection should be performed at C1D1 prior to the administration of therapy. Please see sect ion on correlative studies (section 8). 
14) Only for subjects with tumor that is sa fely accessible for biopsy, a biopsy should be 
performed prior to initiation of therapy, and again at 6-7 weeks after initiation of therapy, and 
(optional) at the time of progr ession. Refer to section on corre lative studies. Optional tumor 
biopsies may be performed at the time  of clinical response as well. 
15) Follow-up peripheral blood collection will be performed at every other cycle of 
immunotherapy, (e.g. at C1D1, C3D1, C5D1) prior to the administration of therapy, up to and 
including C5D1 and then only on cycles wher e the patient receives GVAX therapy (e.g. every 4
th 
cycle). 16) Patients will undergo the Off Treatment Eval uation if they completed 24 months of study 
medication ( Section 4.9 ). 
17) Patients should continue to be monitored for disease status by radiologic imaging and tumor 
marker(s) every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks). 18) Peripheral blood, serum, and plasma samples s hould continue to be co llected every 12 weeks 
(+/- 2 weeks). 
19) 30 days after their last dose of study drug or within 7 days pr ior to initiation of a new anti-
cancer treatment, whichever comes first. Patie nts who discontinue from treatment should be 
contacted every three months to monitor overall su rvival.  Information of other cancer therapies 
after discontinuation from the study treatment will be collected. SAEs that occur within 90 days 
of the last infusion of pembrolizumab or before initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment should also be followed and recorded. 20) MRI brain with contrast performed in the 8 w eeks prior to day 1 can be used to fulfill these 
criteria. 21) After cycle 4, cyclophosphamide and GVAX will be administered with  every 4th cycle (12 
weeks), restarting with cycle 8. Similar to cycles  1-4, pembrolizumab will administered on cycle 
day 1. For cycles that include cyclophospha mide and GVAX, cyclophosphamide will also be 
administered on day 1 and GVAX on day 2.  The treatment window for cycles beyond 4 is +/- 7 
days.

 5210. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
 
10.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors 
 
10.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity. All subjects are ev aluable for toxicity after receiving first 
dose of combined immunotherapy. 
 
Evaluable for objective response. All pa tients who have rece ived at least two 
doses of immunotherapy and have had th eir disease re-evalu ated with imaging 
will be considered evaluable for response. Response criteria will be classified by RECIST and irRECIST criteria ( Appendix E and F) 
 10.1.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and record ed in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be  performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 14 days before the beginning of 
the treatment. Subjects will be eval uated for anti-tumor effect by follow-up 
imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis w ith IV contrast; noncontrast CT 
chest/abdomen/pelvis or CT Chest and MR I Abdomen/pelvis will be performed in 
subjects with contrast allergies, into lerance, elevated creatinine, or other 
contraindication). All subsequent scans (pos t-treatment) will be compared to the 
same pretreatment scan that was used prior to initiating of study treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline an d during follow-up. 
Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot  be imaged but are assessable by 
clinical exam.  CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MR I has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, ther e are many image acquisition variables 
involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and 
measurement. Furthermore, the availability  of MRI is variable globally. As with 
CT, if an MRI is performed, the tec hnical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for th e evaluation of the type and site of 
disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 53same as was used at baseline and the le sions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence. It is beyond th e scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence para meters for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body 
scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
10.1.3  Overall Survival (OS)   
OS is defined as the duration of time from start of study treatment to time of 
death. Individuals will be censored at the date of the last study visit if no event 
occurs. 
  
11.  DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 
Adverse event guidelines a nd instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 6 
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements) . 
 
11.1 Data Management 
 
All information will be collected on study- specific case report forms (CRFs) by study 
staff. These data will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy by the Principal 
Investigator.   
11.2 Safety Meetings 
 
Scheduled meetings will take place weekly and will include the protocol principal 
investigator, study coordinator(s), research  nurse (s), and sub-investigators (as 
appropriate). During these meetings matters related to the following will be discussed: safety of prot ocol participants, validity and integrity of the data, 
enrollment rate relative to expectation, ch aracteristics of participants, retention of 
participants, adherence to protocol (poten tial or real protocol violations), data 
completeness, and progress of data for objectives.  Quarterly teleconferences w ill be scheduled to include the Investigator and Merck 
representatives. During these meetings, the I nvestigator shall provide Merck with study 
progress updates. The Investigator will provide a summary of key points from the weekly meetings with a focus on safety of th e protocol participants, enrollment status, 
and progress of data for objectives. In addition, Merck will provide safety and applicable program updates to the Sponsor. 
 
11.3  Monitoring  
 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 54This is a DSMP Level III study unde r the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC). Data  monitoring of this protocol will occur 
on a regular basis with the fr equency dependent on the rate  of subject a ccrual and the 
progress of the study. The protocol will be  monitored internally by the Principal 
Investigator. The protocol will be m onitored externally by the SKCCC CRO in 
accordance with SKCCC guidelines. Additional data and safety monitoring oversight 
will also be performed by the SKCCC Sa fety Monitoring Committee (SMC - as 
defined in the DSMP) and a Medical Expe rt Committee (MEC) as detailed below. 
  
The Medical Expert Committee (MEC) for this  clinical study cont ains three medical 
oncologists from other disciplines who are not affiliated with this clinical trial protocol. The MEC will review safety data on at least a semi-annual basis. The MEC will provide a written summary of each as sessment to the IND Sponsor after each 
meeting. In turn, the study team will forward these summaries to the JHU and other participating site IRBs and JHU SKCCC SM C. The operating plan of the MEC will 
be as follows:  
 Meetings will be held at least semi-annua lly, and potentially more frequently if 
needed.  
 Meetings will be conducted in-person or via video/teleconference, with a 
participant sign-in sheet collected at each meeting.  
 Approximately one week prior to each MEC meeting, the study team will submit 
the following items to MEC personnel for review and discussion at the meeting 
(The PI may join the MEC meeting in order to answer a ny questions the MEC 
might have):  
o A summary of the clinical trial’s progress to date;  
o The latest IRB-approved consent document;  
o A summary of all adverse events, se rious adverse events, deaths, and 
withdrawals to date; 
  Note that the MEC reserves the right to halt  trial accrual or all st udy activity if, after 
review, serious safety concerns warrant this action. If the MEC halts study accrual or all study activity, then the study team must  notify the JHU SKCCC SMC, JHU IRB, 
JHU IBC, RAC and the FDA immediately. 
  
Dr. Lei Zheng will be holding the IND fo r this study. He will comply with all 
regulated reporting requir ements to the FDA. 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1  Overview 
 
The proposed study is an open-label, single-arm phase II study of GVAX in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients  with metastatic colorectal cancer who 
have progressed at least two lines of therap ies. Subjects with microsatellite instability 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 55(MSI) would not be eligible for this study. The primary objective of the trial is to 
determine whether the combination of GVAX  with pembrolizumab administered in 
this patient population yields a clinically compelling ant itumor activity measured as 
objective response rate (ORR, assessed by RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints 
include safety, duration of response (DOR), progression-f ree survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), and immunologic correlates.  The study is planned with 25 evaluable 
subjects based on a two-stage design that allows early termination for lack of 
efficacy. A safety run-in phase will be in cluded to ensure that the combination of 
GVAX and pembrolizumab is safe. The study will be continuously monitored for adverse events after the safety run-in phase.  
  At the beginning of the study, GVAX plus pembrolizumab will be tested in the first 6 patients in the safety run-in portion of the study. These subjects will be monitored for unacceptable toxicities (defined in Section 4.7) through Cycle 1 of treatment before 
continuation with further accrual. The study will continue without pause to complete 
the accrual goal for the first stage if no more than 1 of the first 6 subjects experiences 
unacceptable toxicities (as defined as dose –limiting toxicities in cycle one in section 4.7) in the run-in. If 2 of the 6 subjects experience unacceptable toxicities, the study 
will be paused for a review. If 3 or more of the first 6 subjects experience unacceptable toxicities with the combination therapy during the run-in, the study will 
be discontinued. The probability of observi ng 2 or more patients with DLT among the 
first 6 subjects is greater than 64% if th e true incidence rate is greater than 33%. 
 
12.2  Sample Size and Accrual 
 
Approximately 25 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed at 
least two lines of therapies will be enrolled according to this single-arm, Phase 2 trial, 
with ORR as the primary endpoint. Enrollment will be carried out in 2 stages so that 
the study can terminate early if GVAX in combination with pembrolizumab is not 
sufficiently effective. A recently published phase III study showed that TAS-102 resulted in an ORR of 1.6% (95% confid ence interval 0.7-3%) and the agent had an 
overall survival benefit vs. placebo in a similar patient population [42]. Simon’s 
minimax two-stage design will be employed to  test the null hypothesis that the true 
ORR is 3% or less (not cons idered clinically compelling for this combination). In the 
first stage, 15 subjects will be accrued. If none of these 15 subjects respond, the study 
will be terminated. Otherwise, 10 additional subjects will be accrue d to target a total 
of 25 treated and response evaluable subjects.  If 3 or more responses are observed in 
these 25 subjects, we will conclude the combination of pembrolizumab with GVAX 
is promising and warrant further investig ation. The study could also be terminated 
early as soon as 3 responses with the combination treatment are confirmed. The 
probability of stopping the trial early for futility is 63% if the true ORR is 3% or less. 
This design yields 89% power at a one-sided type I error rate of 5% when the true 
response rate is 20%. Subjects who are wit hdrawn from the study prior to receiving 
one cycle of the combination treatme nt of cyclophosphamide, GVAX, and 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 56pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression will be replaced. The study 
may enroll 28-30 subjects to ensure 25 woul d be evaluable for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. 
 
More than 300 colorectal cancer patients  seek primary oncology care at JHH and an 
additional 200 patients or more come to JHH for consultation each year. The majority 
of these patients have MMR-p metastatic di sease. We estimate that approximately a 
third of the colorectal cancer patients seen  at JHH would be poten tially eligible for 
enrollment for the proposed study. We expect  to enroll 2-3 patients per month. We 
estimate that we could reach the accrual goal within 1 year. 
 
12.3 Statistical analysis  
    
12.3.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  The objective response rate defined as the proportion of response evaluable subjects 
who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 criteria at any time during the study. The evaluable population includes all subjects 
who have completed at least two dose of combination therapy and have received at 
least one follow-up scan. It is known that  this crude proportion underestimates the 
true ORR due to the adaptive nature of Simon’s two stage design. Thus we will also report the bias-reduced estimator for ORR due to Whitehead [43] and the adjusted 
95% confidence intervals that account for the adaptiveness of the study design [44]. 
 12.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from start of study treatment to 
time of death. For subjects lost to follow- up or whose vital stat us is unknown, every 
effort will be made to determine the date such subjects were last known to be alive. 
Such efforts may include phone calls, cer tified mail, and the checking of public 
records. Subjects who are alive or lost to fo llow-up as of the data analysis cutoff date 
will be right-censored. The censoring date wi ll be determined from the date the 
subject was last known to be alive.  Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from cycle 1, day 1 of immunotherapy until first documented local progression or death due to any cause. 
Disease progression will be assessed usi ng RECIST (version 1.1). RECIST evaluation 
will be performed by the radiology staff de signated for completing RECIST reads for 
GI Oncology clinical trials conducted at the SKCCC at Johns Hopkins University.  Due to the expectation that some patients may experience delayed clinical responses 
to therapy, patients with disease progressi on by radiographic imaging or laboratory 
parameters during a 12 week evaluation period  but without rapid clinical deterioration 
or significant change in performance status  that requires additional immediate therapy 
may continue to receive treatment on study. S ubjects that meet the above criteria and 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 57continue on study therapy must discontinue  treatment upon documentation of disease 
progression on the second scan. The date of pr ogression will be b ackdated to the time 
of first RECIST criteria progression. Tumo r assessments will be made using RECIST 
1.1 and immune-related respons e criteria (irRC). Local Progression-Free Survival 
(LPFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first 
documented local progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Individuals will be censored at the date of the last scan for PFS and LPFS if no event 
occurs. 
 
Duration of response (ROR) will be calculate d for subjects who achieve a best overall 
response of CR or PR with GVAX in combination with pembrolizumab. For such subjects, duration of response is defined as the number of weeks from the start date 
of PR or CR (whichever response is recorded  first) and subsequently confirmed to the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is  documented. In such cases, 
recurrent or progressive disease will be assessed relative to the smallest tumor measurements recorded since the start of study treatment. The pr imary analysis of 
duration of response will be based on the time point responses, best overall response, 
and PD status that are determined by the review of th e investigator.  
 OR, PFS, LPFS, and DOR will be summarized  descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Analysis of PFS, LPFS, and DOR will be restricted to evaluable individuals 
who complete at least two doses of combination therapy and have at least one follow-up scan, while the analysis of OS will be performed on all evaluable patients as well as all the individuals who complete at least one dos e of pembrolizumab/GVAX. 
Median event-free survival will be repor ted and the associat ed 95% confidence 
interval will be estimated using the method of [45]. 
  
12.3.3 Analysis of Safety Endpoints   The safety analysis will be performed in all subjects who receiv e any amount of study 
drug. A baseline measurement and at least 1 laboratory or othe r safety-related 
measurement obtained after at least 1 dos e of study treatment may be required for 
inclusion in the analysis of a specific safety parameter (e .g., lab shifts from baseline). 
A complete list of all AE data will be provided along with an assessment of NCI 
CTCAE grade and relationship to study drug. The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by subgroups of interest (e.g. grade 3 or high er, organ class, relationship to study 
drug). For analyses at the indi vidual level, the highest grad e and relationship to study 
drug will be assumed if multiple events have occurred. Toxicity will be tabulated by type and grade and will be summarized with  descriptive statistics . Other safety data 
will be assessed in terms of physical exam ination, clinical chemistry, hematology, 
vital signs, and ECGs. Negative binomial  regression and Cox proportional hazards 
models will be used to assess the rate of AE and time to first toxicity, respectively.

J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 5812.3.4 Biomarker Analysis 
 Intratumoral changes in pre- and post-treatm ent core biopsy specimens at week 6 and 
at the time of progression, if  available, will be studied  using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and transcriptional analysis. The immune parameters include suppressive 
pathways (including PD-L2, LAG3, BTLA , TIM3, IDO1, CTLA-4, and Tregs), 
activation pathways (inclu ding CD137, OX40, CD40, CD40L), 
cytokines/chemokines or their recepto rs (including CCL12, CXCR4, CCL2, CCL5, 
CCR2, CCR5). Change standard protein biomarkers such as CEA will be evaluated after each pembrolizumab/GVAX treatment. De scriptive statistic s for both pre and 
post administration of each immunotherapy and the differences in immune parameters 
will be computed. Plots will be used to show the changes in immune response over 
time both for each individual and for each  arm. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with means or medians and standard deviations. Dichotomous and 
categorical variables will be summarized using proportions with exact 95% confidence intervals and counts. For each im munotherapy, comparisons in the pre and 
28 day post-immunotherapy responses will be compared using paired t-tests (or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests if appropriate) for continuous variables and McNemar's 
tests for dichotomous variables. Associations between immune parameters will be explored graphically (e.g. scatterplots, boxplots) and nu merically (e.g. correlations, χ
2 
tests). Regression techniques (linear, logis tic, linear mixed effects models) will be 
used to explore the differences between the treatment arms cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. The associations betw een immune parameters and clinical 
outcomes (OS and DFS) will be evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Analyses will be perfor med using data from all evaluable patients 
and from the subgroup of patients who receive at least one immunotherapies. 
Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to ev aluate the extent to which results of data 
analyses can be affected by early dropouts. The significance level is set at 0.05 for all 
tests in this phase 2 study.

 71APPENDIX E: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Criteria for 
Evaluating Response in Solid Tumors 
 
RECIST version 1.1 will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT 
or MRI may be used utilized, as  per RECIST 1.1, CT is the pref erred imaging tec hnique in this 
study.  
Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are define d as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest di ameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm 
with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clin ical exam. All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a prev iously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable unless there is evid ence of progression in the irradiated site. 
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered path ologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >15 mm in short axis when asse ssed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater th an 5 mm). At baseline and in  follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or si tes of disease), includin g small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pat hological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short ax is), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, infla mmatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by CT or MRI), ar e considered as non-measurable. 
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neith er measurable nor non-measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic me tastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurab ility described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these ar e preferred for selecti on as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involv ed organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of  all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repe ated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itsel f to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest fo r non-nodal lesions, short axis fo r nodal lesions) fo r all target 
lesions will be calculated and re ported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 72included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characteri ze any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of  disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions  should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these le sions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of  each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must ha ve reduction in shor t axis to <10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in  the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative incr ease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the a ppearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage  to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all no n-target lesions and no rmalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
 Note: If tumor markers are in itially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.   Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one  or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of  overall disease status ch ange, not a single lesion 
increase.    Although a clear progression of “ non-target” lesions on ly is exceptional, the opinion of the 
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 73treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and th e progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review  panel (or Principa l Investigator). 
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is th e best response recorded from th e start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as refe rence for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both meas urement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterior ation of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment wit hout objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after disc ontinuation of treatment.

 75APPENDIX F: Immune Rela ted Response Criteria 
 
For all patients who experien ce disease progression on study, th e date noted for of disease 
progression is the time of the scan where it is originally detected, and not the following date of 
the confirmatory scan.  
Definitions of measurable a nd non-measurable disease  
Measurable disease: Neoplastic masses that can be precisely measured in 2 in-plane 
perpendicular diameters. Both its longest diameter  and its longest perpendicular must be greater 
than or equal to 10 mm. Lymph nodes must  have a short-axis line-length of ≥ 15 mm. Malignant 
lymph nodes must be measurable in  2 perpendicular diameters. Both its longest diameter and its 
longest perpendicular must be greater than or equal to 15 mm. The quantitative endpoint will be 
defined as the product of the longest diam eter with its longes t perpendicular.  
Non-measurable disease : Non-measurable lesions are those th at are not suitabl e for quantitative 
assessment over time. These include: 
1) Neoplastic masses that are too small to measur e, because their longest uninterrupted diameter 
or longest perpendicular are less than 10 mm. 
2) Neoplastic masses whose boundaries cannot be distinguished. This includes masses which 
cannot be demarcated from surrounding tissue becau se of inadequate contrast, masses with 
overly complex morphology, or those with hi ghly heterogeneous tissue composition.  
3) Other types of lesions that ar e confidently felt to represent ne oplastic tissue, but difficult to 
quantify in a reproducible manner. These in clude bone metastases, leptomeningeal 
metastases, malignant ascites, pleural/pericardi al effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesi ons, ill-defined abdominal masses, etc. 
For irRC, only target lesions selected at base line and measurable new lesions are taken into 
account.  
At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and five 
cutaneous index lesions ) is calculated.  
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of  the index lesions and of new, measurable 
lesions (≥ 5 X 5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ:  5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral 
lesions) are added together to provide the total time-point tumor burden.  
  
 
Phase 2 Study of GVAX (with CY) and  pembrolizum ab in MMR-p advanced colorectal cancer 
J16154/Version 5/ January 17, 2018  
 
 76Overall response using irRC: 
 Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (whether 
measureable or not, and no new lesions). CR must be confirmed by repeated, consecutive 
assessments made no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented.  
 Partial Response (irPR): Decrease in SPD of 50% or greater by a consecutive 
assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation.  
 Stable Disease (irSD): Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD.  
 Progressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir (minimum 
recorded tumor burden) Conf irmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 
weeks from the data first documented.  
Please note other key differences between  irRC and the original WHO criteria: 
New measurable lesions will be incorporated into the SPD  
New non measurable lesions do not de fine progression but  preclude irCR 
Non-index lesions contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required). 
See the Investigators Imaging Operations Manual (IIOM) for more details.

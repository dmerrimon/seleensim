Corrections of minor typographical errors and inconsistencies, grammar, improvement for comprehension, or corrections of abbreviations are not listed within the summary of changes. Major changes are reflected below:  Summary of Changes, Amendment 4, Version 5.0 (17 October 2022):  Section Number and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale 4 SYNOPSIS, ENDPOINTS, Primary Endpoints  7.2.1 Primary Endpoints  10.2.2.1 Asthma Related Events    Added text in bold:  o Baseline SABA use (defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by the subject) will be determined by the average use in the 7 days preceding Visit 2, o An asthma exacerbation requiring use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days o a hospitalization or emergency room visit because of an asthma exacerbation  Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter as well as to align the definition of an asthma related event with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement: asthma control and exacerbations: standardizing endpoints for clinical asthma trials and clinical practice (Reddel, 2009).   4 SYNOPSIS, Study Entry Criteria  8.5.1 Inclusion Criteria  Added text in bold: 5. Subjects must have had at least one asthma exacerbation in the last 24 months prior to Screening An asthma exacerbation is defined as follows:  o a course of oral corticosteroids because of worsening asthma symptoms, and/or o at least a doubling of the subject’s inhaled corticosteroids for at least 14 days because of worsening asthma symptoms.  If a subject’s medical experience satisfies either or both statements, the Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter. 
17OCT2022 Page 5 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 subject has experienced an asthma exacerbation.    SYNOPSIS, Study Entry Criteria  8.5.2 Exclusion Criteria Added text in bold: 3. Subjects who: • Are current smokers, users of inhaled cannabis and/or e-cigarettes/vaping devices or, Wording updated to clarify that inhaled cannabis and e-cigarettes/vaping are also under the umbrella of smoking and are prohibited during study based on their ability to be an airway irritant. Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments Added: • Footnote 17: Site regular assessment of diary completion for compliance  • Footnote 18: SABA use is defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by the subject. • Requirement for AVTX-002 Plasma (PK blood draw) at the Early Termination Visit.  This has been added to the table as well as Footnote 16.  Additional footnotes made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter as well as to ensure regular review of diary data by sites.  PK blood draw added as part of Early Termination visit in order to ensure information is available on AVTX-002 drug levels post last dose in subjects who discontinue from study early.  Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments Updated (change noted in bold): Footnote 1  If confirmation of eligibility is not available within 7 days from the date of Screening, the study Sponsor should provide approval for the subject to continue.  TO If confirmation of eligibility is not available within 14 days from the date of Screening, the study Sponsor should provide approval for the subject to continue.   Widened window for confirmation of eligibility to allow time to receive and review all screening visit data. 
Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments  8.2 Discussion of Study Design    Clarified that: Visit 1a may be completed either by telephone or as an in-clinic visit, depending upon the needs of the site or subject.  Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter. 8.5 Study Entry Criteria   Added: Subjects are to be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.  The diagnosis of NEA is determined at Screening Visit 1 based upon Inclusion Criteria 2 through 5. At Baseline Visit 2, a review of all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria should be done to ensure continued eligibility prior to randomization and dosing the subject. As long as the subject qualifies as having NEA per protocol at the Screening Visit, there is no expectation that their diagnosis be re-confirmed at Baseline Visit 2, and therefore changes in eosinophil count and/or ACQ score within the period of time between Screening Visit 1 and Baseline Visit 2 Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter. 
17OCT2022 Page 6 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 would not reverse their diagnosis and would not disqualify the subject.    Although chemistry and hematology labs must be drawn as part of Baseline Visit 2 procedures, there is not an expectation that these test results be available during the visit to re-confirm eligibility (Exclusion Criteria 12 and 13).    Per the schedule of assessments, a urine pregnancy test must be completed and show negative results at Baseline Visit 2 prior to randomization and dosing. Subjects with a positive urine pregnancy test should NOT be randomized and dosed with AVTX-002.    8.7 Premature Subject Withdrawal  12.3.1.1 Disposition and Withdrawals  Added: Any subject who receives three doses of AVTX-002 or placebo by definition is considered as completing study therapy.   Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or other non-study drug for treatment of their asthma should be considered to have lack of efficacy and withdrawn from study drug.   Subjects who meet one of the other protocol definitions of an asthma related event should also be considered to have lack of efficacy and be considered for withdraw from study drug.  Instances where the Investigator feels that a subject meeting these criteria should continue receiving study drug should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor.   Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug should be followed up as instructed in the schedule of assessments.   Given each dose of study drug equates to 4 weeks of therapy, clarified that subjects who receive all 3 doses are considered as completing study therapy.   Also provided requirements for study drug discontinuation based upon meeting criteria for an asthma related event. 
9.11.4 Prohibited Therapies Added: Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or another non-study asthma medication to treat an asthma exacerbation should be withdrawn from the study.  If a subject receives a systemic corticosteroid for another reason (e.g., bee sting), the Medical Monitor should be consulted regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. Additions made for clarification of withdrawal criteria previously omitted. 10 STUDY PROCEDURES Added: In the event a subject cannot be in-clinic for a study visit after randomization due to pandemic, natural disaster, or other kinds of unforeseeable situations, sites should attempt to complete as many visit procedures as possible that can be done remotely, by phone or telehealth/video, on time and per protocol windows. This Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter. 
17OCT2022 Page 7 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 includes completion of study-required questionnaires which should be provided to the subject or reviewed via phone prior to the visit, if possible, so that the subject can be prepared with appropriate responses.   The medical monitor should be consulted for decisions regarding dosing, laboratory testing, and other protocol procedures which are unable to be done remotely.   If a visit is done remotely, it should be documented as such in subject source records.      10.2.2.4 Peak Flow Meter  10.2.2.7 Asthma Symptom Diary  10.2.2.11 Short-Acting Beta Agonist Use Added: The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by the site and will be considered protocol deviations if an overall compliance rate of less than 80% is reached.    Additions made for clarification of diary compliance previously omitted. 11.1.1 Adverse Event Collection  Updated: Previous wording: Lack of effect, including worsening of symptoms, disease progression, or lack of improvement, should not be recorded as an AE unless it meets the definition of the criteria for an SAE.    New Wording: Events that meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event are captured as part of the primary efficacy endpoint for the study, and therefore need not be recorded as an AE unless they meet the definition of an SAE.  Asthma exacerbations that do not meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event should be captured as AEs. Clarifications of AE capture related to primary endpoint events.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AVTX-002   will   be   supplied   in single-use vials containing 300-mg AVTX- 002 (concentration 150 mg/mL). AVTX-002 will be administered by a subcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen in a zone of 4 to 10 cm from the umbilicus with the injection site rotated based on the number of syringes used. REFERENCE PRODUCT Placebo will be sourced locally and provided as volume matched normal saline for injection and will be administered by an SC injection in the abdomen in a zone of 4 to 10 cm from the umbilicus with the injection site rotated based on the number of syringes used. TREATMENT REGIMEN AND DURATION 600 mg of AVTX-002 or placebo will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). A subject must be dosed with the Week 8 dose no later than Day 56. The investigational product will be prepared by an unblinded pharmacist or appropriately qualified individual. Fourteen days after randomization (Day 0), subjects in each treatment group will discontinue salmeterol therapy at Visit 4 (Day 14). After an additional 14 days, at Visit 5 (Day 28), all subjects will taper fluticasone dose to 50%. At Visit 6 (Day 42), all subjects will discontinue the use of fluticasone therapy completely. COORDINATING PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR / PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR  
   CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION Efficacy: • The efficacy of AVTX-002 will be determined by the occurrence of asthma  related events (primary endpoint), time to asthma related events, and change from baseline in the following parameters: FEV1; FeNO; ACQ; AQLQ(S)+12; Asthma Symptom Diary Score; European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire; Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGI-C/S); Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity (CGI-I/S); and incidence of short-acting beta agonist (SABA) use. Safety: The safety of AVTX-002 will be determined by monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, and physical examinations. Pharmacodynamics: The PD of AVTX-002 will be determined by measuring the serum levels of LIGHT biomarker patterns. Immunogenicity: The immunogenicity of AVTX-002 will be determined by measuring ADA levels. Exploratory: • Evaluation of the primary endpoint in subjects with <150 eosinophils/µL • Sputum soluble LIGHT and gene expression (select subset of sites/subjects only) • Inflammatory proteins including but not limited to: IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α • AVTX-002 plasma concentrations at select timepoints 
17OCT2022 Page 12 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 STATISTICAL METHODS For the primary variable, comparison of the proportions of subjects that had an asthma-related event will be via a Wald Z-test (continuity corrected).  Summary statistics will be provided via a 2x2 table showing the number and percentage with and without asthma-related events in each treatment group. The test statistic, its associated p-value and a 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference will also be provided. All other efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics for continuous data will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries of change from baseline variables will include only subjects who have both a baseline value and corresponding value at the timepoint of interest. Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequencies and percentages.  AE data will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The overall incidence of subjects having at least one AE will be summarized. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment group, system organ class (SOC), and preferred term (PT). Each subject will be counted only once per SOC and PT. For all continuous safety variables (e.g., laboratory and vital sign measures), descriptive statistics for all reported values and change from baseline values will be summarized by treatment group. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The sample size in this study will be approximately 80 with 40 subjects per treatment arm, randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The sample size estimate was based on the estimated proportions of patients in the two treatment groups expected to have an asthma related event as defined by the primary endpoint. In a study with another product, rates of 6% in the active group and 44% in the placebo group were observed (Wenzel, 2013). If these estimates were used as is, then a study with 40 subjects per group would have over 95% power.  Considering likely variations from the cited study, estimates of sample were assessed assuming a Type I error of 5% and the proportion of subjects with an asthma related event ranging from 30% to 50% in the placebo group and 5% to 8% in the active group. In the 20 such scenarios examined, only in the cases in which the difference between treatments gets below 23% does the power fall slightly below 80%. In the vast majority of cases examined the power is greater than 90%. STUDY AND TREATMENT DURATION After the Screening visit, subjects will complete a 30-day, stable therapy, run-in until randomization at the Baseline Visit (Day 0). AVTX-002 or placebo will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). The final visit will be on Day 98. The overall study duration will be up to approximately 135 days.

Documentation of eligibility on all Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria is required before a subject can enter the study 30-day run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Randomization) when the subject is switched to stand alone Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Confirmation of eligibility should take place within a reasonable amount of time after the Screening Visit. If confirmation of eligibility is not available within 14 days from the date of Screening, the study Sponsor should provide approval for the subject to continue. 2. If a subject discontinues from the study/study drug, the Visit 9/ET procedures will be performed 4 weeks post last dose (+3 days). 3. A subject must be dosed with the Visit 7 (Week 8) dose no later than Day 56. 4. After Visit 2 (Day 0), visits should be scheduled relative to Visit 2 (Day 0).  Visit 7 (Week 8) must not be performed later than Day 56. 5.  Baseline visit to occur the day following completion of the 30-day run-in period with a window of an additional 3 days. 6. Visit 1a (Day -7) may be completed either by telephone or may be completed as an in-clinic visit, depending on the needs of the site and/or each individual subject. Visit 1a should occur with 7 days remaining in the 30-Day Run-In (-2 Day window for Visit 1a). During this phone call/onsite visit, the subject should be reminded to begin daily peak flow testing, and daily completion of their diary to capture asthma symptoms, SABA use and daily peak flow values.   7. At Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56), pre- and post-dose vital signs will be measured: Pre-dose vital signs should be taken within 60 minutes before dosing. Post-dose vital signs should be taken at least 60 minutes after dosing, prior to discharge. 8. Height will only be recorded at the Screening Visit. 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 15 of 58  
 9.  Subjects should record the best result of 3 attempts daily at home. Subjects should perform daily peak flow at approximately the same time each day between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Subject should also bring peak flow meter to clinic visits. If peak flow has not been completed at home by the subject on the day of a clinic visit it should be completed at the clinic during the visit. 10. In addition to ADA collection timepoints per the schedule of events, an ADA sample will be collected if an immunologically related adverse event is reported (e.g., a skin reaction, lupus-like syndrome, unexplained thrombocytopenia). 11. Select subset of sites/subjects only. 12. For females of childbearing potential. A subject is not considered to be of childbearing potential if at least 6 weeks have passed since sterilization, defined as females having undergone one of the following surgeries: hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy; and males who are vasectomized. Contraception is not required where females are postmenopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and age ≥51 years). 13. On the day of Randomization when the first IP administration is required (Visit 2/Day 0), all visit procedures should be completed prior to IP administration. At the other IP administration Visit dates (Visit 5/Day 28 and Visit 7/Day 56), only the pharmacokinetic (PK), anti-drug antibody (ADA), Serum soluble LIGHT, inflammatory proteins and immunophenotyping samples must be collected prior to dosing. Other procedures can be performed as needed in the clinic on the visit day. 14. Subjects will be required to remain in the clinic for at least 60 minutes after study drug administration for adverse event monitoring. 15. Investigational product will be prepared by an unblinded pharmacist or appropriately qualified individual. 16. Immunophenotyping and PK only required if an Early Termination visit is completed. Immunophenotyping and PK not required at Visit 9/Day 98. 17. Site regular assessment of diary completion for compliance. 18. SABA use is defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by the subject.

 6 INTRODUCTION 6.1 Background and Rationale in Non-Eosinophilic Asthma Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs characterized by airway inflammation causing swelling and excess mucous production, and as a result, patients experience difficulty breathing which can be life threatening in severe cases (Boulet et al. 2000). Asthma affects approximately 25 million patients in the US and over 300 million globally (Centers for Disease Control, 2021, IHME, 2019). There are classifications of asthma based on the inciting factors (allergic versus non- allergic) and the nature of the immune-inflammatory response (Th2 or low/no Th2) (Ray and Kolls 2017, Wenzel et al., 1999, Woodruff et al., 2009). An allergic or Th2 biased response is associated with eosinophilic classifications and related to type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Lambrecht, Hammad, and Fahy 2019). Non-allergic or low/absent Th2 response is associated with neutrophilic and pauci-granulocytic classifications, which as a group are called non- eosinophilic asthma and account for 40% - 50% of all asthma patients (Douwes et al. 2002, Stokes et al., 2016).  The long-term control of asthma is typically accomplished through the use of long-acting bronchodilators in combination with inhaled corticosteroids as needed. For patients specifically with severe allergic asthma, biologic agents have been approved for treatment which target IgE (omalizumab) or the Th2-related cytokine pathways of IL-4 and IL-5 (mepolizumab, resilizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab). The cytokine pathways identified as contributing to NEA include IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFNγ, TNFα, and G-CSF (Lambrecht, Hammad, and Fahy 2019). For NEA patients with severe disease, there are no approved agents related to these pathways and, as such, there remains a significant unmet medical need for these patients. Previously it was demonstrated that human bronchial epithelial cells express receptors for LIGHT (LTbR) and upon LIGHT stimulation of BEC there is a resulting broad gene expression of proinflammatory mediators, with these proinflammatory changes in gene expression being resistant to corticosteroid treatment; consistent with the clinical presentation of NEA (da Silva Antunes et al. 2015).  Human BEC cells express receptors for LIGHT (LTβR) and upon LIGHT stimulation of BECs in vitro there is a resulting broad gene expression of proinflammatory mediators (da Silva Antunes et al. 2015), which are resistant to corticosteroid treatment, consistent with the clinical presentation of NEA. Soluble proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, OSM, and MCP- 1 were also detected in this in vitro system. In the clinic, administration of an oral CXCR2 antagonist resulted in lowered sputum neutrophil counts and fewer mild exacerbations (Nair et al. 2012). Separately, sputum levels of soluble LIGHT positively correlated with increased sputum Th1 cytokine levels and neutrophil counts and negatively correlated with lung function (Romeo 2013). Along with soluble LIGHT detected in sputum, others have observed elevated serum levels of DcR3 in asthma patients, which are even greater during asthma exacerbations suggesting a response to elevated LIGHT levels in relation to asthma and disease activity (Kowal et al., 2019).  6.2 Nonclinical Experience

 8 STUDY DESIGN 8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVTX-002 for the treatment of poorly controlled NEA. Upon confirmation of eligibility, subjects will complete a 30-day, salmeterol and fluticasone stable dose, run-in prior to randomization. At Baseline subjects will be randomized to receive either three doses of AVTX- 002 at 600 mg (Days 0, 28 and 56) or they will receive 3 doses of placebo at the same time points.    Subjects will then begin a withdrawal of salmeterol and fluticasone therapies. Subjects will discontinue salmeterol at Day 14 and then taper fluticasone use to 50% dose at Day 28. Fluticasone use will be completely discontinued at Day 42.  Subjects will be followed until Day 98. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled to ensure approximately 80 subjects complete the study. All subjects will undergo efficacy, safety, PK/PD, and immunogenicity assessments. The efficacy  of AVTX-002 will be determined by the occurrence of an asthma related event (primary endpoint), time to asthma related event, and change from baseline in the following parameters: FEV1; FeNO; ACQ; AQLQ(S)+12); Asthma Symptom Diary Score; European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire; Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGI-C/S); Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity (CGI-I/S); and Incidence of short-acting beta agonist (SABA) use. All subjects will be monitored for AEs and will undergo physical exams, vital signs, and routine safety laboratory tests. The PK/PD of AVTX-002 will be determined by measuring the levels of AVTX-002 and LIGHT in addition to other biomarkers of NEA. Finally, the immunogenicity of AVTX-002 will be determined by measuring ADA levels. The study schema is displayed in Figure 1.  Figure 1:      Study Schema 
    8.2 Discussion of Study Design This study will assess safety and efficacy of AVTX-002 in subjects with poorly controlled non- eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will be evaluated for enrollment at the Screening visit. If considered eligible for enrollment, subjects will undergo a 30-day, stable dose, run-in period with a LABA (salmeterol) and an ICS 

17OCT2022 Page 28 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 (fluticasone). Documentation of eligibility on all Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria is required before a subject can enter the study 30-day run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Randomization) when the subject is switched to stand alone Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Confirmation of eligibility should take place within a reasonable amount of time after the Screening Visit. If confirmation of eligibility is not available within 14 days from the date of Screening, the study Sponsor should provide approval for the subject to continue. During the 30-day run-in, a visit (Visit 1a) should occur 7 days prior to Baseline, at Day  -7 (-2 day window).  Visit 1a may be completed either by telephone or as an in-clinic visit, depending upon the needs of the site or subject.  During this visit, the subject should be reminded to begin daily peak flow measurements as well as completion of the daily diary to capture ASD, SABA use and daily peak flow values.   After the run-in period, subjects will be randomized at the Baseline Visit (Day 0) to either AVTX-002 administered at 600 mg or placebo. Subjects will receive AVTX-002 or placebo at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28) and Visit 7 (Day 56). Over the        course of the first 42 days after randomization subjects will taper or discontinue use of products administered during their run-in period. Salmeterol will be discontinued at Visit 4 (Day 14), fluticasone use will be tapered to 50% dose at Visit 5 (Day 28) and fluticasone will be discontinued completely at Visit 6 (Day 42). All subjects will proceed on AVTX-002 or placebo monotherapy until Visit 9 (Day 98), which is also the end of study visit. Efficacy will be assessed from Baseline Visit (Day 0) through Visit 9 (Day 98) per the schedule outlined in schedule of assessments (Table 1). The run-in period after Screening and before Baseline must be completed with a stand-alone LABA (salmeterol) and an ICS (fluticasone). Principal investigators will ensure subjects are transitioned to these stand-alone products at Run-In if the subject is not already on these products. If a subject must discontinue the study prior to Visit 9 (Day 98) for any reason, the subject will be required to complete an Early Termination Visit (Day 98 procedures). 8.3 Study Sites The study will take place at approximately 25 study sites in the US.  8.4 Selection of Study Population Subjects diagnosed with NEA (<300 eosinophils/µL) will be randomized into the study. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled to ensure approximately 80 subjects complete the study. A screening log of study candidates will be maintained at each study site.  8.5 Study Entry Criteria Subjects are to be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.  The diagnosis of NEA is determined at Screening Visit 1 based upon Inclusion Criteria 2 through 5. At Baseline Visit 2, a review of all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria should be done to ensure continued eligibility prior to randomization and dosing the subject. As long as the subject qualifies as having NEA per protocol at the Screening Visit, there is no expectation that their diagnosis be re-confirmed at Baseline Visit 2, and therefore changes in eosinophil count and/or ACQ score within the period of time between Screening Visit 1 and Baseline Visit 2 would not reverse their diagnosis and would not disqualify the subject.  Although chemistry and hematology labs must be drawn as part of Baseline Visit 2 procedures, 
17OCT2022 Page 29 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 there is not an expectation that these test results be available during the visit to re-confirm eligibility (Exclusion Criteria 12 and 13).  Per the schedule of assessments, a urine pregnancy test must be completed and show negative results at Baseline Visit 2 prior to randomization and dosing. Subjects with a positive urine pregnancy test should NOT be randomized and dosed with AVTX-002.    8.5.1 Inclusion Criteria Subjects must fulfill the following requirements to be randomized into the study: 1. Subject is ≥18 years of age at the time of informed consent. 2. Documented non-eosinophilic asthma diagnosis (<300 eosinophils/µL). 3. Symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of asthma that is poorly controlled as determined by an ACQ score ≥ 1.5. 4. Poorly controlled asthma despite the use of a LABA and ICS for at least 3 consecutive months immediately prior to the Screening Visit. 5. Subjects must have had at least one asthma exacerbation in the last 24 months prior to Screening.  An asthma exacerbation is defined as follows:  • a course of oral corticosteroids because of worsening asthma symptoms, and/or • at least a doubling of the subject’s inhaled corticosteroids for at least 14 days because of worsening asthma symptoms.  If a subject’s medical experience satisfies either or both statements, the subject has experienced an asthma exacerbation.   6. Non-pregnant, non-lactating female subjects of childbearing potential who are heterosexually active and non-sterile male subjects with female sexual partners of childbearing potential agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during the treatment period and for 28 days following the last dose of study medication. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., <1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as oral/injectable/inserted/implanted/transdermal contraceptives, condom with diaphragm, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine hormone- releasing system, or intrauterine device (IUD), or sexual abstinence. Contraception is not required where at least 6 weeks have passed since sterilization, defined as females having undergone one of the following surgeries: hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy; and males who are vasectomized. Contraception is not required where females are postmenopausal (defined as 12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and age ≥51 years). Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test as part of the screening assessment. 7. Subject can understand and provide informed consent to participate in this study.  8.5.2 Exclusion Criteria The presence of any of the following criteria excludes a subject from the study: 1. Pulmonary disease other than asthma. 2. Currently on biologic therapy. Previous biologic therapy is permitted with adequate washout (12 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer). 
17OCT2022 Page 30 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 3. Subjects who:  • Are current smokers, users of inhaled cannabis and/or e-cigarettes/vaping devices or, • Have a history of smoking >/=10 pack years or, • Have a history of inhaled cannabis >4 days/week for the most recent 3 months prior to screening or, • Use e-cigarettes or vaping devices >4 days/week for the most recent 3 months prior to screening. 4. Current suspected drug or alcohol abuse. 5. Use of systemic immunosuppressants within the last 6 months. 6. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 6 weeks prior to Screening or use of antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to Screening. 7. Subjects that are pregnant or breastfeeding. 8. Subject has a history of neoplasia (except for a curatively treated non-melanoma skin tumor or carcinoma of the cervix treated in situ with no indication of recurrence) within the10 years prior to Visit 1. 9. Subject has a chronic, active infection or another disease, which entails a tendency towards infection. 10. Subject has a chronic severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that might confound the results of safety assessments conducted in this study. 11. Subject has a history of unresolved latent tuberculosis. 12. Subject has alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or serum creatinine concentration >1.5 mg/dL. 13. Subject has hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL, neutrophils ≤1,500/µl, and/or platelets ≤75,000/µl. 14. Subject has received a live vaccine within 12 weeks prior to Visit 2. 15. Subject has used an investigational product, including Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) vaccines, within 30 days of Visit 1. 16. Subject has known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product(s), closely related compounds, or any ingredients of the investigational product. 17. There is any concern on the part of the investigator regarding the subject’s safety, compliance, or suitability with respect to his/her participation in the study.  8.6 Screen Failures Subjects who fail inclusion and/or exclusion criteria may be rescreened for the study with Sponsor approval. 8.7 Premature Subject Withdrawal All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable attempt should be made by the investigator to keep subjects in the study; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if they withdraw consent to participate. Investigators must attempt to contact subjects who fail to attend scheduled visits by telephone or other means to exclude the possibility of an AE being the cause of withdrawal. Should this be the cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section 11.1.1. 
17OCT2022 Page 31 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 Subjects can decline to continue receiving study drug at any time during the study. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the completion of the Early Termination Visit to occur 4 weeks (±3 days) post last dose. If the subject refuses this visit/procedures associated with this visit, data on concomitant medications and AEs will be collected if the subject agrees.                                  Data on concomitant medications and AEs can be collected via a telephone call if the subject refuses an in-person visit. Withdrawal of consent for a study means the subject does not wish to receive further protocol- required treatment or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.   Any subject who receives three doses of AVTX-002 or placebo by definition is considered as completing study therapy. The Sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol deviations or other reasons. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for any reason. If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the subject should be followed-up as instructed in the schedule of assessments (Table 1). The reason for withdrawal must be determined by the investigator and recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the electronic case report form (eCRF) as well as the date of discontinuation. If a subject is withdrawn for more than 1 reason, each reason should be documented in the source document and the most clinically relevant reason should be entered on the eCRF. Reasons for discontinuation include but are not limited to: • Lack of efficacy • Adverse event • Death • Protocol deviation • Physician decision • Sponsor request • Withdrawal by subject • Lost to follow-up • Other (specify). For example, pregnancy.  Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or other non-study drug for treatment of their asthma should be considered to have lack of efficacy and withdrawn from study drug.   Subjects who meet one of the other protocol definitions of an asthma related event should also be considered to have lack of efficacy and be considered for withdraw from study drug.  Instances where the Investigator feels that a subject meeting these criteria should continue receiving study drug should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor.   Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug should be followed up as instructed in the schedule of assessments.  
17OCT2022 Page 32 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 9 TREATMENTS 9.1 Identification of Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration The following investigational product will be used in this study: • AVTX-002 will be supplied in single-use vials containing 300 mg AVTX-002 (concentration 150 mg/mL). • Placebo will be sourced locally and provided as volume-matched normal saline for injection. • AVTX-002 or placebo will be administered by SC injection in the abdomen in a zone of 4 to 10 cm from the umbilicus, with the injection site rotated based on the number of syringes used. • AVTX-002 or placebo will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). AVTX-002 will be administered at a dose of 600 mg.  9.2 Labeling and Packaging All packaging and labeling operations will be performed by the Sponsor or designee per Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The investigational product will be sent to the study site by the Sponsor or designee. Labeling will be in local language and dependent upon local regulations.  9.2.1 Labeling The AVTX-002 vials will have affixed a label that meets the applicable regulatory requirements and may include the following: name of compound, dosage strength, medication identifier, protocol number, caution statement (“New Drug – Limited by Federal (or United States) Law to Investigational Use”), storage conditions, and Sponsor identification. The investigator will be asked to save all used or unused vials for final disposition by the Sponsor. Syringes used for dosing must be treated as biologic waste and disposed of properly.  9.2.2 Packaging AVTX-002 will be supplied in single-use, 2.0 mL vials containing 300 mg AVTX-002 (concentration 150 mg/mL). Vials will be packaged separately into bulk, open-labeled cartons. Placebo will be sourced locally and supplied as volume-matched normal saline for injection.  9.3 Treatment Preparation Preparation of syringes will be described in the pharmacy manual.  9.4 Treatments Administered Eligible subjects will receive 600 mg AVTX-002 or placebo SC on Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56).  
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 33 of 58  
 9.5 Dispensing and Storage AVTX-002 supplied by the Sponsor is to be used exclusively in this clinical study per the instructions of this protocol. Placebo will be sourced locally and provided as volume-matched injection of normal saline. The investigator is responsible for dispensing the investigational product per the dosage scheme and for ensuring proper storage of the investigational product. The unblinded pharmacist or appropriately qualified individual must confirm the receipt of the investigational product with his/her signature. A copy of this receipt must be kept by the unblinded pharmacist or appropriately qualified individual, and another copy will be stored at the Sponsor and/or designee. Until the investigational product is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 2°C to 8°C (35.6 °F to 46.4 °F) and protected from light. Investigators or other authorized persons (e.g., pharmacists) are responsible for storing the investigational product provided by the Sponsor in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, institutional policies, and procedures. Control of storage conditions for the investigational product provided by the Sponsor, especially control of temperature (e.g., refrigerated storage) and daily temperature monitoring, and information on in-use stability and instructions for handling the investigational product must be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor in the pharmacy manual. 9.6 Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment This is a double-blind study. All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment assignment except as outlined in study specific blind management plans.  Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. Unblinding is permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment. Whenever possible unblinding should be discussed with the medical monitor. For emergency unblinding, the investigator can unblind in the IRT/eCRF. If the investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding with the medical monitor in advance of the unblinding, then they should notify the medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment. The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for study discontinuation on the appropriate eCRF for that subject. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator should discuss the event with the medical monitor prior to unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment. If the treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, the investigator will be notified of that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the study.  9.7 Selection of Doses in the Study     Based on the PK data and favorable 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 34 of 58  
 safety profile of , the AVTX-002 dose in AVTX-002-NEA-201 will be 600 mg once monthly for a total of 3 doses. This dosing regimen is expected to provide higher serum AVTX-002 concentrations prior to discontinuation of salmeterol at study day 14 with the 28-day dosing interval limiting the potential for accumulation with the 2 subsequent doses.  9.8 Dose Adjustment Criteria No dose adjustments are allowed.  9.9 Drug Accountability The investigator must ensure that adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, or other disposition of the investigational product including the date, lot identifier, dosage, volume administered to each subject, and identification of subjects (subject number and initials) who received the investigational product are maintained by an unblinded pharmacist. The investigator will not supply the investigational product to any person except those named as sub-investigators on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form FDA 1572 and designated study personnel, and subjects in this study. The investigator will not dispense the investigational product from any study locations other than those listed on Form FDA 1572. If any of the investigational product is not dispensed, is lost, stolen, spilled, unusable, or received in a damaged container, this information must be documented and reported to the Sponsor and appropriate regulatory agencies, as required. Upon completion of the study, unused investigational product, partially used investigational product and all empty packaging (e.g., vials) must be left in the original packaging for return and final disposition by the Sponsor or their designee or destroyed locally per the site’s standard practice after receiving approval from the Sponsor.  9.10 Handling and Disposal Investigational product reconciliation must be performed at the site by the unblinded pharmacist(s) or appropriately qualified individual(s) using treatment log forms or within the IRT system.  After reconciliation authorization by the Sponsor, all used, partially used, and unused vials and all original packaging will be disposed of by the Sponsor or per the site’s standard practice. This process will be provided to the site by the Sponsor’s designee. 9.11 Permitted and Prohibited Therapies All non-study therapies including but not limited to over the counter and non-pharmacological treatments from the time of Screening (Visit 1) and through the end of study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  Record of ICS and LABA use should be captured for the three months immediately prior to Screening.  9.11.1 Prior Therapies Prior therapies include all therapies received from the Screening Visit (Visit 1) to just prior to 1st dose of study drug, with the exception of ICS and LABA which should also be recorded for the 3 months immediately prior to Screening (Visit 1). Prior therapy information must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 9.11.2 Concomitant Therapies Concomitant therapies refer to all therapies taken on or after the first dose of study drug through 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 35 of 58  
 the last visit. Concomitant therapy information must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  9.11.3 Permitted Therapies Medications considered necessary for the subject’s welfare, may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. The medical monitor should be contacted in the event the site is in a situation where further clarity is needed. Acceptable methods of birth control considered to be highly effective (e.g., results in a low failure rate [i.e., <1% per year]) when used consistently and correctly, include oral/injectable/inserted/implanted/ transdermal contraceptives, condom with diaphragm, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine hormone-releasing system or IUD, or sexual abstinence.  9.11.4 Prohibited Therapies During the study, new initiation of investigational compounds or concomitant treatment with other asthma therapy is not permitted. The use of systemic corticosteroids, biologics, immunosuppressants and inhaled anticholinergics is not permitted.   Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or another non-study asthma medication to treat an asthma exacerbation should be withdrawn from the study.  If a subject receives a systemic corticosteroid for another reason (e.g., bee sting), the Medical Monitor should be consulted regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. Leukotriene inhibitors are not allowed to be added to a subject’s treatment regimen after they are screened for the study.  Subjects who are on leukotriene inhibitors as part of their prior therapy at Screening (Visit 1) may continue on leukotriene inhibitors during the course of study participation.  9.12 Treatment after End of Study Subjects will be treated per standard clinical practice following completion of participation in the study. 10 STUDY PROCEDURES Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study-related procedures are initiated. For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the study, refer to the schedule of assessments (Table 1). Throughout the study, every reasonable effort should be made by study personnel to follow the timing of assessments and procedures in the schedule of events for each subject. Visits performed after Visit 2 should be scheduled relative to Visit 2. If a subject misses a study visit for any reason, the visit should be rescheduled as soon as possible. Permitted visit windows are noted in the schedule of assessments (Table 1). In the event a subject cannot be in-clinic for a study visit after randomization due to pandemic, natural disaster, or other kinds of unforeseeable situations, sites should attempt to complete as many visit procedures as possible that can be done remotely, by phone or telehealth/video, on time and per protocol windows. This includes completion of study-required questionnaires which should be provided to the subject or reviewed via phone prior to the visit, if possible, so that the subject can be prepared with appropriate responses.  The medical monitor should be consulted for decisions regarding dosing, laboratory testing, and other protocol procedures which are unable to be done remotely.  If a visit is done remotely, it should be documented as such in subject source records.    
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 36 of 58  
 10.1 Study Duration AVTX-002 and placebo treatment will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). A subject may not be dosed after Day 56. The duration of the treatment period is considered 84 days, with each dose of study drug considered to be 28 days of treatment.  The overall study period is approximately 135 days, including Screening and the 30-day, stable dose, run-in period.  10.2 Assessments  10.2.1 Medical History A medical and surgical history will be taken at Screening. All significant medical history findings that have been present or active within the 5 years prior to screening will be entered into the eCRF. Medical history findings that have not been present within the 5 years prior to screening will be recorded if deemed clinically relevant by the investigator to the conduct of the study. Additionally, the subject’s overall NEA history will be captured at Screening. This includes but is not limited to the approximate date of diagnosis and prior treatment including approximate start and stop dates.  10.2.2 Efficacy Efficacy response will be assessed by the procedures listed below at the time points mentioned in the schedule of assessments (Table 1). 10.2.2.1 Asthma Related Events The proportion of patients who experience any of the following asthma related events and time to the asthma related event will be determined:  o  ≥6 additional reliever puffs of SABA (compared to baseline) in a 24-hour period on 2 consecutive days or, • Baseline SABA use (defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by the subject) will be determined by the average use in the 7 days preceding Visit 2, o increase in ICS dose ≥4 times than the dose at baseline or, • Baseline ICS dose is defined as the dosage the subject received during the 30-day run-in period, o a decrease in peak flow of 30% or more (compared to baseline) on 2 consecutive days of treatment or, • Baseline peak flow will be determined by the average of measurements in the 7 days preceding Visit 2. o an asthma exacerbation requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or o a hospitalization or emergency room visit because of an asthma exacerbation.  Time to event will be measured in days using the first day of the event above to denote the day of the overall asthma related event occurrence.  Subjects meeting any of the above criteria for an asthma related event will be permitted to restart background (pre-study) therapy, or alternate asthma therapy. If background/alternate therapy is reinitiated/started, the patient must be withdrawn from the study.   
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 37 of 58  
 10.2.2.2 Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) The FEV1 is the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second, measured in liters by a spirometer and reported as a percent of expected volume. 10.2.2.3 Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) A FeNO test measures the levels of nitric oxide during exhalation. A FeNO test will be done by breathing into a tube attached to a hand-held monitor. 10.2.2.4 Peak Flow Meter A peak flow meter measures how well lungs are able to expel air. Subjects will measure peak flow daily on a device provided by the Sponsor and record the results in their diary. The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by the site and will be considered protocol deviations if an overall compliance rate of less than 80% is reached.   10.2.2.5 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) This is a simple questionnaire to measure the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control. ACQ has a multidimensional construct assessing symptoms (5 items, self-administered), rescue bronchodilator use (1 item, self-administered), and FEV1 (1 item, completed by study staff). Scores range between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) (Juniper et al, 2005). 10.2.2.6 Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) The AQLQ(S)+12 is a modified version of the standardized AQLQ, which was developed to measure functional impairments experienced by adults aged ≥17 years. The AQLQ(S)+12 is valid for patients aged 12 to 70 years and includes 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) (Juniper et al, 1992; Wyrwich et al, 2011). Subjects will be asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and score each of the questions on a 7-point scale, where 7=not at all limited and 1=totally limited. The overall score of the AQLQ +12 will be derived as the average of the 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates "total impairment") to 7 (indicates "no impairment"). 10.2.2.7 Asthma Symptom Diary The Asthma Symptom Diary is a 6-item daily measure of asthma symptom severity that assesses three core categories of asthma symptoms: breathing symptoms (difficulty breathing; wheezing; shortness of breath), chest symptoms (chest tightness; chest pain), and cough. The Asthma Symptom Diary is intended for twice daily completion and comprises a morning diary (for completion upon waking and referring to asthma symptoms during the nighttime) and an evening diary (for completion before going to bed and referring to asthma symptoms during the day). Subjects are required to rate the 6 symptoms at their worst during the respective timeframes using an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (‘None’) to 10 (‘As bad as you can imagine’) (FDA, n.d.). The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by the site and will be considered protocol deviations if an overall compliance rate of less than 80% is reached.   10.2.2.8 European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 38 of 58  
 VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the subject’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS, where the endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’ (EuroQol, 2017). 10.2.2.9 Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity The Patient Global Impression of Change or Severity (PGI-C, PGI-S) scale is a global index that can be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (a single-state scale) from the patient’s perspective. The PGI-C is a single question scale asking the patient to rate the overall status of their specific condition on a 7-point scale. The PGI-S is a single question scale asking the patient to rate current state of their specific condition on a 7-point scale. 10.2.2.10 Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity The Clinician Global Impression of Improvement or Severity (CGI-I, CGI-S) is a global index that can be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (a single-state scale) from the clinician’s perspective. The CGI-I is a single question scale asking clinician to rate the overall status of the patient’s specific condition on a 7-point scale since the beginning of the research study. The CGI-S is a single question scale asking the clinician to rate current state of the patient’s specific condition on a 7-point scale.  10.2.2.11 Short-Acting Beta Agonist Use The number of times a short-acting beta agonist (number of inhalations/puffs) is used will be assessed by reviewing the diary maintained by the subject. The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by the site and will be considered protocol deviations if an overall compliance rate of less than 80% is reached.    10.2.3 Safety Safety and tolerability assessments will include the frequency and severity of AEs as well as the evaluation of changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination findings. 10.2.3.1 Clinical Laboratory Safety Assessments  10.2.3.1.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests to be Performed Samples for the following clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the time points specified in the schedule of assessments (Table 1).

Consequently, appropriate blood and body fluid precautions should be employed by all study personnel involved in the collection of blood and handling of specimens in both the clinic and laboratory settings. Refer to current recommendations of the appropriate authorities. In addition to appropriate handling of subject samples, specific regulations exist regarding the shipment of biologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and shipping of infectious samples are outlined in the site and/or study laboratory manual. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study samples that are to be transported to another location are appropriately packed and shipped per the applicable regulations.

 10.2.3.1.4 Evaluation of Laboratory Values The normal ranges of values for the central laboratory assessments in this study will be provided to each site as part of the lab manual. For assessments performed locally, the normal ranges of values for the local laboratory will be provided to the Sponsor’s designee. They will be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions will be made for the specific site. If a laboratory value is out of the reference range, it is not necessarily clinically relevant. The investigator must evaluate the out-of-range values and record his/her assessment of the clinical relevance in the subject’s source documentation. All laboratory values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor, as necessary, and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. All measurements described in this section are recognized standard methods. 10.2.3.2 Clinical Examinations  10.2.3.2.1 Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, Respiratory Rate, and Temperature Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiration rate, height, and body weight, will be collected as shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). Pre-dose vital signs should be taken within 60 minutes before dosing. Post-dose vital signs should be taken at least 60 minutes after dosing, prior to discharge. Additional blood pressure and pulse measurements may be performed, as determined by the investigator, to ensure appropriate monitoring of subject safety and accurate recording of vital sign measurements. Any changes from baseline deemed clinically significant by the investigator are to be recorded as AEs.  10.2.3.2.2 Electrocardiogram A standard 12 lead ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for approximately 5 minutes, at time points shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). All ECG recordings will be identified with the subject number, date, and time of the recording and a copy will be included with the subject’s source documentation. All ECG values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. 10.2.3.2.3 Physical Examination, Weight, and Height A complete physical examination, including measurements of height and weight, will be conducted by a qualified licensed physician, physician’s assistant, or a nurse practitioner at Visit 1 through Visit 9/ET (see Table 1). Any clinically significant physical examination findings are to be reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. Height will be measured only at Visit 1.  10.2.3.3 Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE described below. At each visit, the subject will be allowed time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. Any clinically relevant observations made during each visit will also be considered AEs. AEs will 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 41 of 58  
 be collected from the time of informed consent through the last study visit. 10.2.4 Immunogenicity Analyses Blood samples for ADA analysis will be collected at time points shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). The Visit 2 sample is to be collected prior to dosing. Additionally, an ADA sample will be collected if an immunologically related AE is reported. Samples for ADA will be processed according to the methods and directions set forward in the laboratory manual(s) and guidance(s). ADA sample analysis will be performed by a laboratory defined in the laboratory manual(s) and guidance(s), according to their standard operating procedures (SOPs) using a validated method. Assay and analysis details will be described in the method validation and bioanalytical information.  10.2.5 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Assessments Blood samples will be collected for assessment of PK, PD activity and mechanism of action of AVTX- 002 in NEA. Blood samples will be used to isolate serum, which will be subjected to analysis of soluble LIGHT levels in circulation using a relevant immunoassay for PD activity measures. Additionally, for a selected subset of sites or subjects, sputum samples will be analyzed for soluble LIGHT levels and gene expression. Biomarkers associated with inflammation such as (including but not limited to) IL-6, IFN-y, and TNF-α may be evaluated using relevant immunoassays. Serum may be also used for novel biomarkers analyses as the rationale evolves. Blood samples collected for PBMC isolation may be used for comprehensive immunophenotyping of immune cell subsets in circulation by flow cytometry or CyTOF to study the effects of AVTX- 002 on these cell types. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis may be performed in PBMC as needed. All these exploratory biomarkers as listed in Table 1 will be performed at the laboratories specified in the laboratory manual(s) and/or guidance(s).  11 ADVERSE EVENTS  11.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events  11.1.1 Adverse Event Collection An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether related to the product. An AE will be considered treatment-emergent if it occurs after the first dose of investigational product and within 28 days of a subject’s last dose of investigational product. Additionally, an AE that occurred prior to dosing with study medication and increased in severity after start of dosing and within 28 days of a subject’s last dose of investigational product will also be considered treatment emergent. All AEs are collected from the time of the informed consent is signed until the end of study (Day 98/ET). This includes events occurring regardless of whether investigational product is administered. Note: Clinically significant observations noted during screening procedures (labs, physical examination, vital signs, etc.) should be entered as medical history. Only if the clinically 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 42 of 58  
 significant observation is clearly related to the performance of a screening procedure should it be entered as an AE (e.g., a hematoma because of drawing blood for screening labs). Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs must be followed to closure, regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached or stabilization achieved (i.e. the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event). When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of an event(s) can be documented.  Events that meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event are captured as part of the primary efficacy endpoint for the study, and therefore need not be recorded as an AE unless they meet the definition of an SAE.  Asthma exacerbations that do not meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event should be captured as AEs. An AE that changes in severity over time should be recorded in the eCRF once at the highest severity with two exceptions: • Worsening of non-NEA-related pre-treatment events after initiation of investigational product must be recorded as new AEs. E.g., if the subject experiences mild, intermittent headaches prior to dosing with investigational product; however, the headache intensity increases to moderate after the first dose of investigational product, a new AE of moderate intermittent headaches is to be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. • An AE which begins as a non-serious event, which later meets the definition of an SAE, should be entered once for the non-serious portion of the AE, and then be re-recorded as a new event with the start date the day it became serious.  11.2 Severity of Adverse Events The medical assessment of clinical severity of an AE will be determined using the definitions outlined in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 (Published November 27, 2017, by the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute): Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; or clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate; or minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; or hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; or disabling; or limiting self-care ADL Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death related to AE The above grading guidelines should be used whenever possible. For AEs that cannot be graded using CTCAE, the severity should be graded using mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life threatening (Grade 4), and fatal (Grade 5). Please refer to the above-referenced CTCAE document for full description of CTCAE terms and instrumental and self-care ADLs. It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 43 of 58  
 described in Section 11.2.2.3.  11.2.1 Relationship Categorization A physician investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, the AE should be categorized per the guidelines below. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document and the eCRF (Table 3). Table 3: Assessment of Relationship to Investigational Product  Relationship Description Not Related Exposure to investigational product has not occurred. OR The administration of investigational product and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time OR The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the investigational product, that is, there are no facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the investigational product. Possibly Related The administration of the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time. AND The AE could not be explained equally well by factors or causes other than exposure to investigational product Probably Related The administration of investigational product and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time. AND The AE is more likely explained by exposure to investigational product than by other factors or causes. AE = adverse event. 11.2.1.1 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: • Recovered/resolved • Recovered/resolved with sequelae • Recovering/resolving • Not recovered/not resolved • Fatal* • Unknown *See Section 11.2.3.  11.2.2 Serious Adverse Events 11.2.2.1 Investigational Product Safety Information The IB is the reference document for safety information pertaining to this study. The IB is provided separately.  11.2.2.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Initial and follow-up SAE reports must be completed by the investigator or designee and sent to 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 44 of 58  
 the CRO within 24 hours of the first awareness of an SAE. The investigator or designee must complete, sign and date the appropriate SAE form and verify the accuracy of the information against corresponding source documents. This information is to be sent to the CRO Pharmacovigilance Department by e-mail as noted below. For questions on SAE reporting, please e-mail the drug safety mailbox noted below. •  11.2.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, whether considered to be related to investigational product or not, that at any dose: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. NOTE: Inpatient hospitalization is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an overnight stay. An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the test drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due to transportation, organization, or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to be considered an SAE. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Is a congenital anomaly. NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the investigational product during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received an investigational product is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the investigational product(s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. • Is an important medical event. NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  11.2.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs, regardless of the relationship to study, are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the End of Study/Early Termination Visit. The investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to CRO within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event. Any SAE(s), regardless of relationship to study, which occurred during the study but is not discovered by the site until after the study has been completed must be reported to CRO within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. Please see individual study site documentation (study binder) for forms and contact details.  11.2.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 45 of 58  
 The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date an outcome is reached or stabilization is achieved (i.e. the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event).  Any signs or symptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form and assent form (if applicable) or leading up to the onset date of the SAE or following the resolution date of the SAE must be recorded as an AE.  11.2.3 Fatal Outcome Fatal should only be selected as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than 1 AE is possibly related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. Any AE that results in the subject’s death must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. AEs resulting in death must be reported within 24 hours as a SAE, if not already reported as such. In the event of a subject’s death, data should be collected on whether the death occurred after the withdrawal of care and, if so, the reason for the withdrawal of care. For other AEs, ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 11.3 Special Considerations  11.3.1 Pregnancy All females of childbearing potential, and males with female partners of childbearing potential, who participate in the study should be counseled on the need to utilize a highly effective method of birth control throughout the study and for 28 days following the last dose of study drug, and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., <1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as oral/injectable/inserted/implanted/ transdermal contraceptives, condom with diaphragm, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine hormone-releasing system or IUD, or sexual abstinence. Contraception is not required where at least 6 weeks have passed since sterilization, defined as females having undergone one of the following surgeries: hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy; and males who are vasectomized. Contraception is not required where females are postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and age ≥51 years). Females and males with female partners should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff immediately if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. Pregnancy testing will be conducted on every female as per the schedule of assessments (Table 1). A female who is found to be pregnant at screening will be excluded from the study and considered to be a screening failure. A female who is found to be pregnant after receiving investigational product is required to be discontinued from the study and the end of study visit assessments performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. The investigator must report the pregnancy of any female (study participant or female partner of male study participant) who becomes pregnant during investigational product treatment or within 28 days of discontinuing the investigational product (permission must be obtained from the pregnant female partner of a male subject to follow the pregnancy to conclusion and report the results). The pregnancy must be reported within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy to the CRO 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 46 of 58  
 using the Pregnancy Data Collection Form via the same email address as for SAE reporting. The investigator should contact the designated individual(s) who receive pregnancy notification and record information related to the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Form/other designated form provided by the Sponsor or its designee. The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. These findings must be reported on the Pregnancy Data Collection Form and forwarded to the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital anomaly.  11.3.2 Reporting to Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (EC) and Site The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities and if applicable, US central institutional review board (IRB) of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Sponsor and the CRO are responsible for notifying active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the development program. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local ethics committee (EC), or the relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his/her site, as required.  12 STATISTICS  12.1 Sample Size Determination The sample size in this study will be approximately 80 with 40 subjects per treatment arm, randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  The sample size estimate was based on the estimated proportions of patients in the two treatment groups expected to have an asthma related event as defined by the primary endpoint. In a study with another product, rates of 6% in the active group and 44% in the placebo group were observed (Wenzel, 2013). If these estimates were used as is, then a study with 40 subjects per group would have over 95% power.  Considering likely variations from the cited study, estimates of sample were assessed assuming a Type I error of 5% and the proportion of subjects with an asthma related event ranging from 30% to 50% in the placebo group and 5% to 8% in the active group. In the 20 such scenarios examined, only in the cases in which the difference between treatments gets below 23% does the power fall slightly below 80%. In the vast majority of cases examined the power is greater than 90%. A sample size re-estimation may be performed at a point in time when an adequate number of subjects has been enrolled to provide meaningful data.  Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.     12.2 Analysis Populations This study will have the following populations of interest: • The Randomized Analysis Set will include all subjects who are randomized in the study. Subjects will be categorized according to their randomized treatment group. The Randomized Analysis Set will be used for all disposition, protocol deviations, and demographic and other baseline characteristics analyses. • The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who are randomized in the study and 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 47 of 58

 13 STUDY CONDUCT Steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, periodic monitoring visits, and meticulous data management. 13.1 Sponsor and Investigator Responsibilities  13.1.1 Sponsor Responsibilities The Sponsor is obligated to conduct the study in accordance with strict ethical principles (Section 15). The Sponsor reserves the right to withdraw a subject from the study (Section 8.7), to terminate participation of a study site at any time (Section 13.5), and/or to discontinue the study (Section 13.4). The Sponsor agrees to provide the investigator with sufficient material and support to permit the investigator to conduct the study per the study protocol.  13.1.2 Investigator Responsibilities, Protocol Adherence, and Investigator Agreement By signing the Investigator’s Agreement, the investigator indicates that she/he has carefully read the protocol, fully understands the requirements, and agrees to adhere to the protocol as detailed in this document. The investigator also agrees to conduct this study in accordance with all laws, regulations, and guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorities, including and in accordance with the April 1996 International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidance for Industry E6 GCP and in agreement with the 1996 Version of the Declaration of Helsinki. While delegation of certain aspects of the study to sub-investigators and study coordinators is appropriate, the investigator will remain personally accountable for closely overseeing the study and for ensuring compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelines. The investigator is responsible for maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated study-related responsibilities (e.g., sub-investigators and study coordinators) and their specific study-related duties. Investigators should ensure that all persons who have been delegated study-related responsibilities are adequately qualified and informed about the protocol, investigational products, and their specific duties within the context of the study. Investigators are responsible for providing the Sponsor with documentation of the qualifications, GCP training, and research experience for themselves and their staff as required by the Sponsor and the relevant governing authorities. To ensure compliance with the guidelines, the study may be audited by an independent person. The investigator agrees, by written consent to this protocol, to cooperate fully with compliance checks by allowing access to all study documentation by authorized individuals. Per local laws and regulations, the investigator, Sponsor, or designee will communicate with the IRB/EC to ensure accurate and timely information is provided throughout the study. 13.2 Study Documents All documentation and material provided by the Sponsor for this study are to be retained in a secure location and treated as confidential material.  13.2.1 Case Report Forms By signing the Investigator’s Agreement, the investigator agrees to complete the eCRFs and maintain source documentation as part of the case histories for all subjects who sign an ICF. 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 50 of 58  
 Case report forms are considered confidential documents and should be handled and stored accordingly. The Sponsor or its designee will provide the necessary training on the use of the specific eCRFs used during the study to ensure that the study information is captured accurately and appropriately. To ensure data accuracy, eCRF data for individual subject visits should be completed as soon as possible after the visit. All requested information must be entered in the eCRF per the completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor or its designee. All data will have separate source documentation; no data will be recorded directly into the eCRF. The eCRFs will be signed by the investigator or a sub-investigator to whom this authority has been delegated. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained in the eCRF is accurate and true.  13.2.2 Recording and Retention of Source Data and Study Documents All study information must be recorded in the subject’s medical records and no data will be recorded directly onto the eCRF. Data recorded in the eCRF must be supported by corresponding source documentation. Examples of acceptable source documentation include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory reports and notes, and recorded data from automated instruments, memoranda, and pharmacy dispensing records.  13.3 Data Quality Control The Sponsor and its designees will perform quality control checks on this clinical study.  13.3.1 Access to Study and Source Documents The Sponsor and/or designee will conduct site visits to monitor the study and ensure compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. The consent form includes a statement by which the subject agrees to the monitor/auditor from the Sponsor or its representatives, national or local authorities, or the IRB/EC, having access to the source data (for example, subject’s medical records, appointment books, original laboratory reports, radiographic exams, and reports, etc.) The assigned CRA(s) will visit the investigator and study site at periodic intervals and maintain periodic communication. The investigator agrees to allow the CRA(s) and other authorized Sponsor personnel access. The CRA(s) will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the investigator and staff. While on site, the CRA(s) will review: • Regulatory documents, directly comparing entries in the eCRF with the source documents. • Consenting procedures. • Adverse event procedures. • Storage and accountability of study materials. • Storage and accountability of investigational product (performed by the unblinded CRA). The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction of any noted inconsistencies. Procedures for correcting eCRFs will be described for the study personnel as part of training. As representatives of the Sponsor, CRAs are responsible for notifying project management of any noted protocol deviations. By signing the Investigator’s Agreement, the investigator agrees to meet with the CRA(s) during

Information included in clinical study registries may include participating investigator information (e.g., site name, investigator name, site location, site contact information).  15 ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  15.1 Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the April 1996 ICH Guidance for Industry E6 GCP (including archiving of essential study documents), the 1996 Version of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the applicable regulations of the country(ies) in which the study is conducted. 15.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that written informed consent is obtained from the subjects before any activity or procedure is undertaken that is not part of routine care including baseline assessments. All consent documentation must be in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP. Each subject is requested to sign and date the subject informed consent or a certified translation, if applicable, after the subject has received and read (or been read) the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study involves, included but not limited to: the objectives, potential benefits and risks, inconveniences, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities. A signed copy of the informed consent and assent documentation (if applicable [such as a complete set of subject information sheets and fully executed signature pages]) must be given to the subject. This document may require translation into local language. Signed consent/assent forms must remain in each subject’s study file and must be available for verification at any time. The principal investigator provides the Sponsor with a copy of the consent and assent (as applicable) form which was reviewed by the IRB/EC, and which received favorable opinion/approval. A copy of the IRB/EC’s written favorable opinion/approval of these documents must be provided to the Sponsor, prior to the start of the study unless it is agreed to and documented (abiding by regulatory guidelines and national requirements) prior to the study start that another party (such as the Sponsor or coordinating principal investigator) is responsible for this action. If the IRB/EC requires modification of the sample subject information and consent document provided by the Sponsor, the documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to the Sponsor.  15.3 Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committees A properly constituted, valid IRB/EC according to local laws and regulations must review and approve the protocol, the investigator’s informed consent and assent (as applicable) document, and related subject information and any other study materials requiring review (such as recruitment information) before the start of the study. Until written approval by the IRB has been received by the investigator, no subject may undergo any study procedure solely for determining eligibility for this study. Investigational product will 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 54 of 58  
 not be released until the Sponsor, or its designee has received written IRB/EC approval. Prior to implementing changes in the study, the Sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve and provide documentation of favorable opinion/approval of any revisions to informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a subject safety issue. Depending on location (outside European Union [EU] or inside EU) the IRB/EC will be apprised of the progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol at least yearly. This may be done by the investigator (outside EU and in some cases, inside EU) or the Sponsor (in some cases inside EU). These updates include information on any serious or significant AEs. Upon study completion, the investigator will provide the IRB/EC with final report/summary as required.  15.4 Financial Disclosure The investigator is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year after where the outcome of the study could be influenced by the value of the compensation for conducting the study, or other payments the investigator received from the Sponsor. The following information is collected: any significant payments from Sponsor or subsidiaries such as grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consulting or honoraria; any proprietary interest in investigational product; any significant equity interest in the Sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 CFR 54 (b) (1998).  15.5 Privacy and Confidentiality All US-based sites and laboratories or entities providing support for this study, must, where applicable, comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. A site that is not a covered entity as defined by HIPAA must provide documentation of this fact to the Sponsor/CRO. The confidentiality of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. After subjects have consented to participate in a study, the Sponsor and/or its representatives reviews their medical records and data collected as part of the study. These records and data may be reviewed by others including the monitor/auditor from the Sponsor or its representatives, national or local authorities, or the IRB/EC which gave the approval for the study, third parties with whom the Sponsor may develop, register, or market the investigational product. The Sponsor and its representatives will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities. Subjects are assigned a unique identifying number; however, the initials and date of birth may also be collected and used to assist the Sponsor to verify the accuracy of data. The results of the studies, containing the subjects’ unique identifying number, relevant medical records and possibly initials and dates of birth, will be recorded. They may be transferred to and used in other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the countries where the study is conducted. The purpose of such transfer would include supporting

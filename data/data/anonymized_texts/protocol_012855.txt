N1539 (meloxicam) Injection, for 
intravenous use  Protocol Title:  A Phase 3b , Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Placebo -Control, Multicenter, Evaluation of the Safety 
and Efficacy of N1539 Administered Preoperatively in 
Open Unilateral  Total Knee Arthroplasty  
Name of Active Ingredient:   
Meloxicam  Phase of Development:   3b 
Objectives:   The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of preoperative administration 
of N1539 on opioid consumption in subjects undergoing open unilateral total knee arthroplasty compared to placebo.  
Secondary objectives are to assess:  
• The safety and  tolerability of preoperative administration of N1539 compared to placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on postoperative pain compared to 
placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on healthcare utilization costs 
compar ed to placebo.  
Methodology:   This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in 
adult subjects undergoing elective open unilateral total knee arthroplasty .  The surgical procedure will 
be conducted in an inpatient hospital setting that is expected to result in a hospital stay of ≥24 hours.  
Each subject will be screened for eligibility within 28 days before undergoing surgery on Day 1.   
Before surgery, approximately 200 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
N1539 30 mg or placebo administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection in ≤15 seconds.   
As part of multimodal pain management, subjects will receive oral acetaminophen 650 mg and oral 
gabapentin 600 mg 30 to 90 minutes before the scheduled surgical procedure.  Subjects will continue 
to receive acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q8H through last study dose + 1 day (LSD+1).  S ubjects will 
also receive an appropriate  prophylactic IV antibiotic and tranexamic acid 1 gram IV  30 to 90 minutes 
before surgery  (Appendix B ). 
Following administration of spinal anesthesia and before the start of surgery (ie, time of first incision), 
subjects will receive the first dose of study drug according to randomization.  All subjects will then 
undergo the surgical procedure according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with 
institutional standards. 
Just prior to wound cl osure, bupivacaine HCl 0.5% 30 mL with epinephrine 0.5 mg expanded in a 
volume of 90 mL  normal saline will be  injected  locally  into various areas of the surgical site as 
described in Section  5.2.3.   
At the end of the surgical procedure (Hour 0, defined as the time of last suture, staple, or steri- strip 
placement ) and through hospital discharge, postoperative pain management will be according to the 
protocol (Section  5.13).  Other standard of care procedures associated with the surgical procedure will 
be carried out according to the investigator’s  clinical practice and in accordance with institutional 
standards.  Subject s may also receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV)  according to FDA prescribing information .

Additional doses of study drug will be admini stered every 24 hours (±1 hour) after the first dose .  
Dosing will continue until the subject is either discharged from the hospital or until IV study drug 
analgesia is no longer clinically appropriate.  
In addition to study drug, all subjects will have access to IV and/or oral (PO) opioid medication as needed for the management of breakthrough pain starting at Hour 0 and continuing through hospital 
discharge. 
Subjects will remain as inpatients for at least 24 hours or until inpatient care is no longer clini cally 
indicated.  Upon discharge, subjects will be provided a standard of care regimen for pain management  
and for physical therapy as determined by the investigator. 
Twenty -four hours and 48 hours after  hospital discharge qualified study staff will conduct telephone 
interviews to assess opioid medication use, pain intensity, physical therapy visits, and utilization of 
healthcare resources (ie, hospital readmission, use of skilled nursing facilities, unscheduled phone 
calls and/or office visits related to pain, and emergency room [ER ] visits related to pain  and/or other 
medical issues) .   
Subjects will visit the clinical site between Postoperative Days (PODs) 10 and 14 to be assessed for 
adverse events, wound healing, and utiliza tion of healthcare resources .    
A final telephone interview will be conducted on POD 30 to assess for AEs , opioid use, and utilization 
of healthcare resources.  After  the POD 30 telephone interview, subjects will be discharged from the 
study.  
Number of subjects to be enrolled:  Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled (N1539: 100; 
placebo, 100).  
Number of study sites:  Up to 20 sites  
Study country location:  United States  
Inclusion  criteria :  No subject should be assigned to treatment until all eligibility criteria have

Sample Size:   The sample size for this study (100 subject s per group) will have at least 90% power to 
detect the difference between N1539 30 mg versus placebo in total opioid consumption based on the 
results observed in a Phase 3 safety study that evaluated all major surgeries.  The study results 
suggested that the total opioid consumption was lower in subjects treated with N1539 30 mg 
compared to placebo, and that  the observed effect size in total opioids consumption measured by IV 
morphine equivalent dose (IVMED, mg) ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 in this subgroup.   
Study populations:   
Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT) :  The ITT population will include all subjects who qualify for the 
study and are randomized for treatment prior to surgery.  ITT subjects may or may not receive 
randomized treatment.  
Safety population: The safety population will consist of all subjects w ho receive at least one injection 
of study drug.  All safety evaluations will be based on the safety population. The efficacy population ( ie, modified intent- to-treat [mITT] ):  The efficacy population will consist of 
all subjects who receive at least one injection of study drug and have the scheduled surgery.  All 
efficacy evaluations will be based on the efficacy population.

Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy analysis:  Efficacy endpoints will be tabulated by treatment groups and time points as 
appropriate; descriptive statistics will be provided, including sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, or frequency (number of subjects and 
percentage) distribution of each category for categorical variables.   
Treatment effect will be evaluated using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for opioid consumption 
related endpoints, pain intensity related endpoints, and OBAS related endpo ints; the ANCOVA model 
will include treatment effect and investigational sites as a covariate.  Difference in LS means will be 
compared between the treatment groups. 
Kaplan -Meier survival analysis will be carried out for time to event endpoints, including survival 
curves, 25%, 50% and 75% tiles estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and log-
rank test.  Cox proportional hazards analysis will also be performed for time to event endpoints; the 
model will include the treatment effect and the  investigational sites; hazards ratio and corresponding 
95% CI will be presented. 
Treatment effect on PGA scores will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated their pain 
control as good, very good, or excellent using CMH test controlling for anal ysis center.  CMH test 
will apply to other category variables, such as proportion of subjects who took any opioids or who 
were opioid  free at various time periods.   
Safety analysis:   The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 20 or higher) will be 
used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term.  AEs will be summarized by treatment group.  Clinical laboratory parameters collected after th e first dose of study 
drug w ill be evaluated by comparing t o baseline; subjects with potentially clinically significant 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be identified and tabulated by treatment 
group.   The number and proportion of subjects with abnormal wound healing observations will be 
summarized b y treatment group. 
Healthcare Utilization analysis: A separate SAP will be constructed for analysis of Health Care 
Utilization and total costs as recorded on the UB 04.  This SAP wil l detail the objectives, methods for 
conducting the relevant analyses, and the format for presentation of the findings.  Subject cohorts of interest will be defined and the variables to be measured as well as the steps in data processing and analyses will also be presented .

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. N1539 (meloxicam) Injection, for  Intravenous Use  
Meloxicam , a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory (NSAID) of the enolic acid class, was first 
approved for oral use in the United States in 2000 and has a well- established safety 
profile in commercial use as an effective treatment for osteoarth ritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis.  
Meloxicam administered orally has a slow onset of action, largely due to poor water 
solubility, and is not currently approved for the treatment of acute pain.  It has a 
prolonged absorption, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration ( Tmax) 
approximately 5 -6 hours following oral administration ( Degner  1997; Turck  1997a ), 
which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility.  By increasing the dissolution rate of the active meloxicam moiety  using the proprietary NanoCrystal technology, N1539 
administered by (intravenous) IV bolus injection has been shown to have a rapid onset of action . 
In the N1539 clinical studies, m eloxicam exposure was consistently greater after 
administration of N1539 via IV bolus injection compared to oral administration of Mobic 
at equivalent doses.  As expected, N1539 administered as an IV bolus injection resulted 
in substantially higher maximum observed concentration (C
max) and earlier  time to 
maximum concentration ( Tmax) compared with oral administration of Mobic at equivalent 
doses over a range of 15 to 60 mg.  Eight to 12 hours after administration of equivalent doses of IV and oral meloxicam, plasma concentration -time curves were similar.  The 
C
max and area under the concentration- time curve ( AUC ) for N1539 administered IV 
were similar across studies.   
Ad hoc analyses from the Phase 1 studies demonstrated that a single dose of N1539 
30 mg administered by IV bolus injection resulted in a slightly more than 2 -fold high er 
AUC ∞ and 4.65-fold higher C max relative to a single dose of Mobic 15 mg, the highest 
FDA approved dose, administered orally .  Importantly meloxicam p lasma concentrations 
were sustained for 24 hours after N1539 IV administration  making N1539 suitable for 
once a day dosing. 
In the clinical program for N1539 for the management of moderate to severe acute pain, a 
total of 2075 subjects were evaluated for safety in 11 clinical studies: 109 subjects were 
healthy volunteers who were enrolled in the four Phase 1 studies and 1966 were postoperative subjects who were enrolled in the seven Phase 2/3 efficacy and safety studies. 
In clinical studies, subjects who received N1539 by IV bolus injection had a rapid onset 
of pain relief.  Improvement in pain intensity scor es was observed as early has 10 minutes 
after N1539 dosing and the treatment effect was sustained over the 24-hour dosing 
interval.  The reduction in pain intensity after treatment with N1539 30 mg was 
associated with less opioid rescue medication utilization.   
The safety data from the 1045 subjects who received two or more doses of N1539 
postoperatively including the 743 who received two or more doses at the commercial  
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002

 dose of 30 mg support N1539 administered IV once daily as a safe treatment for the 
management of moderate to severe pain in adults.  The safety data demonstrate that 
N1539 30 mg has a safety profile similar to approved drugs in this NSAID class. 
1.2. Total Knee  Arthroplasty  
Total knee arthroplasty, also known as total knee replacement, is one of the most 
commonly performed orthopedic procedures. As of 2010, total knee replacements were 
becoming increasingly common with over 600,000 performed annually in the Unit ed 
States (UpToDate®). Among older patients in the United States, the per capita number of 
primary total knee replacements doubled from 1991 to 2010 (from 31 to 62 per 10,000 Medicare enrollees annually) (Cram 2012) and this number is expected to grow by 673 
percent to 3.48 million procedures by 2030 ( Kurtz 2007). A variety of pathologic 
conditions affecting the knee can be treated with total knee replacement, leading to pain relief, to restoration of function, and to mobility.   
Severe postoperative pain, which remains  one of the main problems after total knee 
arthroplasty , can  negatively affect postoperative recovery .  Over the last 10 years, 
surgeons have prescribed  IV patient -controlled analgesia, femoral nerve block, and 
continuous epidural infusions for 24 and 48 hours with and without a femoral block 
(Maheshwari 2009). Unfortunately, these techniques have been found to have 
shortcomings, not the least of which has been  suboptimal pain control and unwanted side 
effects  (Maheshwari 2009 ).  
Improvements in pain management techniques in the last decade have had a major impact 
on the practice of total hip and knee arthroplasty; however, a gold standard has not been established .  Although there are a number of treatment options for postoperative pain, 
there appears to be a shift towards multimodal approaches using systemic, local, and 
regional analgesia to minimize opioid consumption and to avoid opioid- related side 
effects  (Maheshwari 2009 ). 
In a double-blind, randomized study by Motififard et al, (2017) a m ultimodal pain 
management regimen that included injections of bupivacaine, morphine, and the NSAID 
ketorolac was shown to provide postoperative pain relief and resulted in less opioid 
consumption and better early rehabilitation 48 hours after t otal knee ar throplasty 
compared to a control group that  received epinephrine only.    
This study is designed to evaluate the effect of N1539 administered preoperatively and 
postoperatively as part of a multimodal pain management plan .  It is expected that N1539 
adminis tered as an IV bolus injection before and after surgery will reduce the 
requirement for opioid analgesia and will improve the rehabilitation course in subjects 
undergoing total knee arthroplasty. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of this study is to as sess the effect of preoperative administration 
of N1539 on opioid consumption in subjects undergoing open unilateral  total knee 
arthroplasty compared to placebo. 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 22 of 65 
 Secondary objectives are to assess:  
• The safety and tolerability of preoperative administration  of N1539 compared 
to placebo  
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on postoperative pain 
compared to placebo 
• The effect of preoperative administration of N1539 on healthcare utilization 
costs compared to placebo . 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in 
adult subjects undergoing elective open unilateral total knee arthroplasty.  The surgical 
procedure will be conducted in an inpatient hospital setting that is expected to result in a hospital stay of ≥24 hours.  Each subject will be screened for eligibility within 28 days before undergoing surgery on Day 1.   
Before surgery, approximately 200 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive eith er N1539 30 mg or placebo administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus 
injection in ≤15 seconds.   
As part of multimodal pain management, subjects will receive oral acetaminophen 650 
mg and oral gabapentin 600 mg 30 to 90 minutes before the scheduled surgical procedure.  Subjects will continue to receive acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q8H through last study dose + 1 day (LSD+1).  Subjects will also receive an appropriate prophylactic IV antibiotic and tranexamic acid 1 gram IV 30 to 90 minutes before surgery ( Appendi x 
B). 
Following administration of spinal anesthesia and before the start of surgery (ie, time of first incision), subjects will receive the first dose of study drug according to randomization.  All subjects will then undergo the surgical procedure according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.  
Just prior to wound closure, bupivacaine HCl 0.5% 30 mL with epinephrine 0.5 mg expanded in a volume of 90 mL normal saline will be injected locally into various area s 
of the surgical site as described in Section  5.2.3.   
At the end of the surgical procedure (Hour 0, defined as the time of last suture, staple, or 
steri-strip placement) and through hospital discharge, postoperative pain management 
will be according to the protocol (Section  5.13).  Other standard of care procedures 
associated with the surgical procedure will be carried out according to the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.   Subject s may also 
receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for PONV  according to FDA prescribing 
information . 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 23 of 65 
 Additional doses of study drug will be administered every 24 hours (±1 hour) after the 
first dose.  Dosing will continue until the subject is either discharged from the hospital or until IV study drug analgesia is no longer clinically appropriate.  
In addition to study drug, all subjects will have access to IV and/or oral (PO) opioid medication as needed for the management of b reakthrough pain starting at Hour 0 and 
continuing through hospital discharge. 
Subjects will remain as inpatients for at least 24 hours or until inpatient care is no longer 
clinically indicated.  Upon discharge, subjects will be provided a standard of care regimen for pain management and for physical therapy as determined by the investigator.  
Twenty -four hours and 48 hours after hospital discharge qualified study staff will conduct 
telephone interviews to assess opioid medication use, pain intensity, physic al therapy 
visits, and utilization of healthcare resources (ie, hospital readmission, use of skilled nursing facilities, unscheduled phone calls and/or office visits related to pain, and emergency room [ER] visits related to pain and/or other medical issue s).   
Subjects will visit the clinical site between Postoperative Days (PODs) 10 and 14 to be assessed for adverse events, wound healing, and utilization of healthcare resources.    
A final telephone interview will be conducted on POD 30 to assess for AEs, opioid use, 
and utilization of healthcare resources.  After the POD 30 telephone interview, subjects 
will be discharged from the study. 
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups  
The double-blind, placebo -controlled study design for N1539 30 mg adminis tered 
preoperatively and followed by once daily dosing in a population of subjects undergoing open unilateral total knee arthroplasty is intended to avoid potential bias from subject or investigator knowledge of assigned treatment  that could confound the interpretation of 
the efficacy and safety findings .

 5.2.4. Study Drug Administration 
Appropriately qualified study personnel will prepare all doses of study drug according to 
subject ran domization .  All doses of study drug will be administered as an IV bolus 
injection in  ≤15 seconds.  Start time of IV push should be recorded.  Additional details on 
study drug preparation and administration will be provided in the study specific 
pharmacy manual.  
Each subject is expected to receive at least two doses of study drug during their participation in the study.  Randomized subjects will receive their first dose of study drug 
(Dose 1) after administration of spinal anesthesia and  prior to the start of surgery (defined 
as time of first incision).  Additional doses of study drug will be administered every 24 
hours ± 1 hour from Dose 1 (ie, 24 hours and 48 hours) until hospital discharge or until 
IV study drug analgesia is no longer clinically appropria te, whichever is first.   
The investigator may administer a final dose of study drug up to 4 hours ahead of 
schedule in subjects who are to be discharged. Subjects who do not rec eive a dose of 
study drug for more than 28 hours following their previous dose will be considered off 
treatment, and will not receive further doses of study drug.    
5.3. Identity of Study Drug  
N1539 (meloxicam) Injection for intravenous use will contain:  30 mg meloxicam in each 
1 mL of solution, as well as excipients including povidone, sodium deoxycholate (deoxycholic acid), sucrose, and water for injection. 
Placebo injection for intravenous use will contain:  soybean oil, egg y olk phospholipids, 
glyceri n, fluorescein sodium, sodium folate, edetate disodium, benzyl alcohol, 
polysorbate 80, dextrose and water for injection .  Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium 
hydroxide may be used for pH adjustment. 
5.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
A computer-generated randomization scheme will be prepared prior to study initiation.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IV treatment with N1539 30 mg or 
placebo according to the randomization scheme.  A block randomization will be generated stratified by center .  Investigators and site staff will not be aware of the size of 
the block.  All doses of study drug administered will be according to the original assignment.  
5.5. Selection of Doses  
The proposed commercial dose of N1539 30 mg administered once daily  by IV bolus 
injection and matching placebo have been chosen for this study.   
Based on the findings from multiple adequate and well-controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies, along with supportive PK/PD modeling, N1539 30 mg administered once daily  by IV 
bolus injection has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of moderate to severe pain.    
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 30 of 65 
 5.6. Selection of Timing of Dose  
In the Phase 2 and 3 registration studies, N1539 was administered once daily by IV bolus 
injection in the postoperative period to manage (reduce) moderate to severe pain.  
This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety  of N1539 30 mg administered 
preoperatively and followed by once daily dosing in a population of subjects undergoing 
open unilateral total knee arthroplas ty.  It is expected  that preoperative administration of 
N1539 30 mg followed by once daily dosing will reduce the need for postoperative 
opioid analgesics and will result in an improved postoperative recovery course , a shorter 
length of hospital stay, and higher degree of subject satisfaction  with pain control.   
5.7. Blinding and Unbinding of Study Drug  
All doses of study drug will be prepared by an appropriately qualified member(s) of the 
healthcare team at the research center according to the subject’s randomization.   
Doses of study drug will be administered by staff members who will be blinded to the treatment assignment.  
The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan for that subject depends on which study drug he or she received.  Unless the subject 
is at immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to contact the sponsor before unblinding the subject’s data.   
If a subject’s data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the sponsor, the 
investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next 
business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
Blinded study personnel will administer each dose of study drug .  The exact date and 
time each dose is administered will be recorded in the subject’ s eCRF.  
5.9. Drug Accountability 
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study drug s when they are received.  The 
study drug must be handled and stored as described and dispensed only to those subjects formally entered into the study. 
At the completion  of the study, and after reconciliation of all delivery and usage records, 
any unused study drug  supplied by the sponsor will be returned to the sponsor (or 
designee) or destroyed per written instructions from the sponsor. 
5.10. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study drug  will be provided in study labeled packaging for preparation for use in this 
study.  
N1539 will be provided in single use vials containing 30 mg per mL.   
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 31 of 65 
 Placebo will be provided in single use vials. 
Directions for preparation of study drug will be provided as pharmacy instructions prior 
to initiation of the study.  
Study drug  should be stored at the study site at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F), although a 
range of 15ºC to 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF) will be permitted.  Study drug should be protected 
from light. 
All study drug at the study site(s) should be stored in a locked area with restricted access.  
A temperature log or chart should be maintained to monitor the environment at the study 
site. 
5.11. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications and other treatments taken by subjects within 5 days before 
administration of the first dose of study drug and during the study through POD 30 will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
All medications that have not been at a stable dose for at least 7 days prior to the 
scheduled surgical procedure on Day 1 will be prohibited within five half -lives of the 
specific medication (or, if half-life is unknown, within 48 hours) before the surgical 
procedure, with exception of medications utilized in the preparation of the subject for surgery. 
5.12. Concomitant Interventions and Procedures  
All interventions or procedures, whether diagnostic or therapeutic, will be recorded through POD 30, along with time, date, and reason for the intervention or procedure.  If an intervention or procedure is impleme nted to treat an AE, the event must be recorded as 
an AE, along with all relevant information. 
5.13. Opioid Medication  
5.13.1. Intraoperative 
Fentanyl and morphine or other morphine derivatives may be administered  
intraoperatively (during the course of the surgical procedure); however, dosing with 
fentanyl (and  morphine or other morphine derivatives ) is to be avoided within the 30 
minutes prior to the anticipated conclusion of the surgical procedure.  The time and dose 
of fentanyl (and morphine or other morphine derivatives) administered will be recorded.  
Other opioid analgesics are not to be administered pre- or intraoperatively, as this may 
confound or influence the subjects’ demand for opioid analgesia during the postoperative 
period (Hour 0 through hospital discharge). 
5.13.2. Inpatient  
Starting at Hour 0 and continuing through hospital discharge, pain intensity that is not 
adequately controlled with study drug may be treated with IV and/or PO opioids as 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 32 of 65 
 follows.  Conversion from IV to oral analgesia should be made once subjects are 
tolerating liquid intake.  
• Morphine 1 to 4 mg IV every 10 minutes for the first hour and then 1 to 8 mg 
IV Q1H PRN  
• oxycodone immediate  release (IR) 5 mg PO Q4H (maximum of 10  mg Q4H 
PRN)  
No other analgesic agents except for study drug, the opioids des ignated  above, 
acetaminophen, and aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis at the discretion of the investigator and according to institutional standards are permitted (Section  5.14).  
5.13.3. Follow- up

Page 34 of 65 
 6.2.3. Physical Examination 
The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination by body system during 
the screening visit, before surgery on Day 1, and during the follow-up visit ( POD 10 to 
14).   
Body weight and height will be measured  and body mass index (BMI) will be c alculated 
during the screening visit only.    
Physical examination results collected within 7 days prior to the screening visit may be 
utilized to evaluate subject eligibility at screening.  
6.2.4. Physical Therapy Assessments  
Within 2 to 4 hours after discharge f rom the PACU a physical therapy consult will be 
initiated.  Each subject will meet with the physical therapist and a physical therapy rehabilitation plan will be implemented.  Follow- up physical therapy assessments will be 
made at least once daily starting  on POD 1 and continuing through hospital discharge. 
As part of discharge planning, subjects will meet with the physical therapist to determine an outpatient physical therapy rehabilitation plan.    
6.2.5. Ambulation 
Within 12 hours after Hour 0 on Day 1, each  subject will be assisted out of bed to 
ambulate with assistance  (ie, with the assistance of hospital staff and with or without a 
walking aid [eg, walker]) .     
Starting on POD 1, subjects will be encouraged to continue to progress with assisted and 
unassisted ambulation at least three to four time s each day  through hospital discharge.  
Study staff will document the time of each postoperative ambulation through hospital 
discharge or LSD +1 , whichever occurs first, including first assisted ambulation and first 
independent ambulation.   
First assisted ambulation is defined as first time walking with the assistance of hospital 
staff (with or without a walking aid).  First unassisted ambulation is defined as first time 
walking without the assistance of hospital staff (with or without a walking aid). 
Pain intensity will be recorded before and during ambulation as described in 
Section  6.2.6. 
6.2.6. Pain Intensity (PI)  
Subjects will be questioned regarding pain intensity us ing an 11-point numeric pain 
rating scale (NPRS; 0 - 10) where 0=no pain, and 10=the worst pain imaginable as 
follows: 
• Upon arrival at the PACU 
• Timepoints relative to first dose of study drug :  4 hours ± 15 minutes, 6 hours 
±15 minutes, 8 hours ± 30 minutes, 10 hours ± 1 hour, 12 hours ± 1 hour, 16 ± 1 hour, 20 hours ± 1 hour, 24 hours ± 1 hour (before study drug

 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as 
provided in this protocol.  During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs a nd SAEs, as detailed in 
this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether 
or not considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value deemed clinically  significant by the investigator, regardless of causal 
relationship, must be reported as an AE. 
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or 
indication under study 
• Exacerbation of a chroni c or intermittent preexisting condition, including either 
an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination finding) 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not wor sen 
• The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of causality, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study drug through end of the study (ie, Day 30).   
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 43 of 65 
 7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE i s defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (ie, presents an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred; this does not include an AE had it occurred in a more serious 
form may have caused death).   
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to perform normal life functions.   
• Results in hospitalization.  
•  Results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization. 
•  Is a congenital anomaly or bi rth defect (in the offspring of a subject using the 
study drug regardless of time to diagnosis). 
•  Is considered an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is 
serious when considering importa nt medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed that define 
a SAE. Examples of such medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of a SAE. Social or convenience admission to a hospital or prolongation of a hospitalization for 
social or convenience reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE does not meet the definition of a SAE. 
SAEs will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF after the signing of informed consent 
through the end of the study (ie, Day 30). If an investigator becomes aware of a SAE or death that occurs more than 30 days after the subject receives study drug and the 
investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug, he/she is obligated to 
report the SAE to the sponsor. 
7.3. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 44 of 65 
 7.3.1. Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, using his or her clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE 
recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with everyday activities 
• Moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on the 
subject’s or event’s outcome or on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning (s ee Section  7.2).  
7.3.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator must record the causal relationship of each event  in the eCRF, and 
additionally for SAEs, on the SAE reporting form .  An investigator's causality assessment 
is the determinatio n of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused or contributed to an AE .  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug 
and the AE .   
• Not related: The AE  is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another 
drug or event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not sugges t a causal relationship).    
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before transmitting the SAE reporting form and  completing the AE eCRF page(s). The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his or her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and amend the SAE report ing form and AE eCRF page(s) 
accordingly.  
7.3.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator will assess the o utcome of the event(s) by using the following terms: 
• Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject returned to baseline.  
• Resolving:  At last observation, the event was improving. 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 45 of 65 
 • Resolved with sequelae:  The event resolved but the subject is left with residual 
problems (eg, functional deficits)  
• Not resolved: At the last observation, the event was unchanged.  
• Unknown:  There were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) of the event, and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death ( Fatal):  To be selected for the one AE, which in the judgement of the 
investigator was the primary  cause of death.  
7.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition. All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit or contact that are designated as ongoing will be reviewed 
at subsequent visits or contacts until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event 
is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Any additional events that are relevant to the ongoing event will be documented. 
The investigator will ensure that follow -up information relevant to SAEs is provided to 
the sponsor and includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or  updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting 
form and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by the 
investigator. The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor 
within the time  frames outlined in Section  7.5. 
7.5. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within 24 hours. 
ANY SAE OR ANY OUTCOME OF DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE, WHICH 
OCCURS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY, REGARDLESS OF RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY DRUG, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours).  
COMPLETE THE SAE DETAILS REPORTING FORM AND FORW ARD BY 
EMAIL TO THE FOLLOWING SPONSOR CONTACT : 
Medical Safety Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Telephone: 484 -395-2470 
eFax: 484-395-2472 
email: AE@recropharma.com
 
 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 46 of 65 
 In the initial email , the investigator must provide to the sponsor the following eCRF 
pages, completed to the greatest extent possible: 
• AE record  
• Medical history  
• Prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test 
results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information. In rare 
circumstances and in the absence of e- mail capacity, notification by fax or telephone is 
acceptable, with a copy of the SAE reporting form sent by overnight m ail. Initial 
notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the 
SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event. The form must be updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information 
received on all SAEs must be forwarded to the sponsor by using the same procedure and 
timelines as for an initial report.  
7.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section 7.5 “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the 
Sponsor.” The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the appropriate 
project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that SAEs that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence, be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met. 
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, expectedness of the SAE will be assessed by 
the sponsor.  A SAE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
The s ponsor will determine whether the SAE meets regulatory reporting criteria (ie, 7 - or 
15-day report) in compliance with loca l and regional law. If so, the sponsor (or the 
sponsor’s representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
The sponsor will report SAEs to the central IRB/EC and the investigator will be report 
SAE to their local to institutional review board (IRB) /EC. Investigator letters are 
prepared according to sponsor policy and are forw arded to the investigators as necessary. 
An investigator letter is prepared for any SAE that is attributable to study drug, serious, 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 47 of 65 
 and unexpected. The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) r equirements regarding the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  
7.7. Special Reporting Situations: Pregnancy  
Any s ubject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study drug 
administration and should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject should be instructed to also notify the investigator immediately if she beco mes 
pregnant within 30 days after receiving study drug.  The sponsor must be notified of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see Section  7.5 for contact information). 
Any uncomplicated pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be 
reported for tracking purposes only. All subject pregnancies that are identified during or 
after this study, where the estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred 
within 30 days of receiving study drug need to be reported, followed to conclusion 
(delivery or termination), and the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued 
from the study. The investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form, according to the usual timelines and directions for 
SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5. Monitoring of the pregnancy should continue 
until conclusion of the pregnancy; and follow-up detailing the outcome of the pregnancy submitted using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless ther e is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication. Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs.  
Any SAEs associated with pregnancy (eg, congen ital abnormalities/birth 
defects/spontaneous miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be 
reported as such using the SAE report form according to the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5.

 8. STATISTICAL  METHODOLOGY AND DETERMINATION 
OF SAMPLE SIZE  
The following outlines some of the key elements of the data analysis approach.  A formal 
statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study in which statistical models, 
data derivation methods and rules will be described in detail.  A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed for the healthcare utilization endpoints detailed in this 
study ( Section  8.5). 
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for this study (100 subjects per group) will have at least 90% power to detect the difference between N1539 30 mg versus placebo in total opioid consumption 
based on the results observed in a Phase 3 safety study that evaluated all major surgeries.  
The study results suggested that the total opioid consumption was lower in subjects 
treated with N1539 30 mg compared to placebo, and that the observed effect size in total 
opioids consumption measured by IV morphine equivalent dose (IVMED, mg) ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 in this subgroup.

8.1. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis  
8.1.1. Analysis Populations 
8.1.1.1. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include all subjects who qualify for the study and are randomized for treatment prior to surgery.  ITT s ubjects may or may not receive 
randomized treatment.  
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 51 of 65 
 8.1.1.2. Safety Population 
The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one injection of 
study drug.  All safety evaluations will be based on the safety population. 
8.1.1.3. Efficacy Population (Modified Intent -to-Treat)  
The efficacy population (ie, modified intent- to-treat [m ITT]) will consist of all subjects 
who receive at least one injection of study drug and have the scheduled surgery.  All efficacy evaluat ions will be based on the efficacy population. 
8.1.2. Test Hypothesis and P Value Justification 
Each efficacy analysis will be performed to assess the differences between the 2 
treatment groups; N1539 30 mg vs Placebo.     
The null hypothesis is that there is not difference between the examined treatment groups.  
The alternative hypothesis is that the treatment groups are different.  Differences between the 2 groups will be evaluated via 2-sided 2- sample t -test at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Nominal p -value will be reported as is .   
8.1.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise,  no imputation will be done for missing data.  However, AEs 
with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and AEs with missing relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related ” for the purpose of analysis; and the 
missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
8.1.4. Definitions for Assessment Windows  
For the purpose of data analysis, baseline  measures will be the last measurements taken 
before the subject receives the first do se of  study drug . 
8.1.5. Derived Variables  
The study SAP will provide detail d escription for each endpoint derivation methodology, 
including censoring rules for each time to events, mapping of opioid dose in IV morphine 
equivalence dose (mg) for each time period,  missing data (time) imputation rules, total 
pain intensity for each period, OBAS total score and sub-score for opioid di stress 
dimension.   
8.2. Study Population Summaries  
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set  included in this study. 
8.2.1. Disposition  
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated 
subjects, subjects who completed the study, subjects who discontinued from the study, 
and reason for discontinuation) by treatment group and study overall.   
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 52 of 65 
 Disposition in terms of number of subjects excluded from each analysis sets ( ITT, safety , 
and mITT) will also be provided by treatment groups and study overall. 
8.2.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age, sex, race, weight, 
height, and BMI for the overall and by treatment group.  
Baseline characteristics will include history of tobacco and alcohol use, surgery duration, 
time from first dose to start of surgery, duration in PACU, and additional surgery related 
variables  (eg, estimated blood lost, number of transfusions). 
8.2.3. Protocol Violations 
All protocol violations and deviations will be identified.  Tabulation may be provided if 
data warrant.  
8.2.4. Treatment Compliance  
Doses of study drug  will be administered by  designated study personnel to study subjects 
while  subjects are confined to the study site.  The exact time of administration of study 
drug will be documented within each subject’s eCRF .  No formal summary of treatment 
compliance will be produced. 
8.2.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated for the overall study population.   
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded to the therapeutic drug classes and 
generic drug names using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug classifications 
version 1Q2017 or higher. 
8.3. Efficacy Summaries  and Analysis 
Efficacy endpoints will be tabulated by treatment groups and time points as appropriate; descriptive statistics will be provided, including sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, or frequency (number of 
subjects and percentage) distribution of each category for categorical variables.    
Treatment effect will be evaluated using Analysis of Covaria nce (ANCOVA) for opioid 
consumption related endpoints, pain intensity related endpoints, and OBAS related endpoints ; the ANCOVA model will include treatment effect and investigational sites as 
a covariate.  Difference in LS means will be compared between t he treatment groups. 
Kaplan -Meier survival analysis will be carried out for time to event endpoints, including 
survival curves, 25%, 50% and 75% tiles estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and log-rank test.  Cox proportional hazards a nalysis will also be 
performed for time to event endpoints; the model will include the treatment effect and the investigational sites; hazards ratio and corresponding 95% CI will be presented. 
Treatment effect on  PGA  scores  will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated 
their pain control as good, very good, or excellent using CMH  test controlling for

 analysis center .  CMH test will apply to other category variables, such as proportion of 
subjects who took any opioids or who were opioid free at various time periods .   
8.4. Safety Summaries  
8.4.1. Extent of Exposure 
The extent of exposure for the study drug treatment will be assessed via number of doses 
received . 
8.4.2. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 20 or higher) will be used to 
classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term.  An event is 
considered treatment emergent if the event onset date/time is on or after the first dose of 
study drug or if a prior condition is worsened after the first dose of study drug.  AEs will 
be summarized by treatment group.  AE summaries will be provided for all treatment 
emergent AEs, study drug related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs. 
AEs that lead to premature discontinuation from the study or to death wil l be listed 
separately via data listings.    
8.4.3. Subjects with Clinically  Significant Laboratory Values 
Clinical laboratory parameters collected after the first dose of study drug will be 
evaluated by comparing to baseline.  S ubjects with potentially clinicall y significant 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be identified and tabulated 
by treatment group.    
8.4.4. Wound Healing  
The number and proportion of subjects with abnormal wound healing observations will 
be summarized by treatment group . 
8.5. Healthcare Utilization Summaries  
A separate SAP will be constructed for analysis of  Health Care Utilization and total costs 
as recorded on  the UB -04.  This SAP will detail the objectives, methods for conducting 
the relevant analyses, and the format for presentation of the findings.  Subject cohorts of interest will be defined and the variables to be measured as well as the steps in data processing and analyses will also be presented.

 9. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
9.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
9.1.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted according to the clinical research guidelines established by 
FDA Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 54, 56, and 312, ICH GCP and other regulations as applicable.  
9.1.1.1. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this 
protocol, the site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be 
presented to potential subjects ( eg, advertisements or information that supports or 
supplements the informed consent form) are reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
IRB or IEC.  If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the 
IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the 
study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these amended documents prior to implementation of any 
changes. The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining 
to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the new version of the form. 
For study sites with IECs that comply with ICH G CP, but not US FDA 21CFR Part 56, a 
waiver request will be submitted to the FDA.  If granted, the FDA’s letter documenting 
the waiver will be provided to the Investigator.   
In addition, the investigator will be responsible for the following: 
• Providing wri tten summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC 
annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and 
procedures established by the IRB/IEC 
• Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required 
by IRB/IEC safety procedures  
• Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC and all other applicable regulations 
9.1.1.2. Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated  prior to the individual’s agreeing to 
participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Template informed consent forms will be provided by the sponsor but may be adapted to 
meet the needs of the institution.  Final consent forms will be IRB/IEC approved and 
accepted by the sponsor. The subject will be asked to read and review the consent 
document.  The investigator or designee will explain the study to the subject and answer 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 55 of 65 
 any questions that may arise.  A verbal ex planation will be provided in terms suited to the 
subject’s comprehension of the purpose, procedures, and potential risks of the study and 
of their rights as research subjects.  Subjects will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The subjects should have the 
opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to 
agreeing to participate.  The subject will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Subject must be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records.  The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the 
source document and the form signed before the subject undergoes any study- specific 
procedures.  The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in the study.    
9.1.1.3. Subject Confidentiality  
 Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor.  Any subject records or data that are transferred  to the sponsor will contain the identifier; subject names or any 
information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.  The investigator will keep a Master Subject List on which the identifier and full name, address, and telephone number of each subject are listed.  The Master Subject List will be 
stored in a secure location at the site and will not be shared with the sponsor.  It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to inform subjects as part of the informed consent process that r epresentatives of the sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory agencies may review all 
records that support their participation in the study.  The Investigator will comply with all privacy laws to which he/she is subject. 
9.1.1.4. Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate 
financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  Investig ators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
9.2. Quality Assurance  
• All subject data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRFs unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically ( eg, 
laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the CRF.  
• The investigator must maintain accur ate documentation (source data) that 
supports the information entered in the CRF.  
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 56 of 65 
 • The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC 
review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source 
data documents. 
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checks of the data. 
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that that data entered into the CRF by site personnel are accurate, complete,  and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the 
current approved version of the protocol, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
9.3. Study and Site Closure  
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions 
arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site 
should be closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study 
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, study monitor, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP ( eg, ICH guidelines, regulatory 
agency guidelines)  
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study 
that one could believe with a high degree of certainty that subjects are being 
exposed to the investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable 
data 
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
9.4. Records Retention  
9.4.1. Archiving of Study -Related Documents  
Records related to this clinical study must be retained either for at least 2 years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have 
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 57 of 65 
 elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product.  The sponsor will notify the investigator as to when these documents no longer 
need to be retained for this use.  No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to and approval of the sponsor. 
9.5. Information Disclosure  
9.5.1. Publication  
For multicenter studies, the first publication o r disclosure of study results shall be a 
complete, joint, multicenter publication or disclosure coordinated by Recro Pharma, Inc.  Thereafter, any secondary publications will reference the original publication(s).  If no 
multicenter publication is submitte d for publication within 18 months of study database 
hard lock, then the site shall be free to disclose its own results, subject to sponsor rights 
under the written contract executed for the conduct of the study.  Authorship will be 
determined by mutual agreement and in line with the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors authorship requirements. 
Before submitting material for publication, presentation, or use for instructional purposes, 
or before otherwise disclosing the study results generated by the site (collectively, a 
“publication”), the investigator shall provide Recro Pharma, Inc. with a copy of the proposed publication and allow Recro Pharma, Inc. a period of at least 90 days to review 
the proposed publication.  Proposed publications shall not include either Recro Pharma, 
Inc. confidential information (other than the study results) or the personal data (such as name or initials) of any subject.

 APPENDIX B:   CLINICAL CARE PROTO COL  MEDICATIONS    
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis:  
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis before and after surgery will be administered 
according to standard practice, based on the subject’s individual needs, at the discretion 
of the investigator and surgeon, and taking into consideration the American College of 
Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)  
guidelines for orthopedic surge ry. 
Perioperative  Concomitant Medications:  
• 30 to 90 minutes before surgical procedure administer : 
− Acetaminophen 650 mg by mouth ( PO) (administered with sips of water)  
− Gabapentin 600 mg PO (administered with sips of water)  
− Tranexamic acid 1 gram IV  (a second dose of tranexamic acid may be given 
approximately 3 hours after the first, at the discretion of the surgeon). 
− Prophylactic IV antibiotic  
• Before the start of the surgical procedure: 
Following adminis tration of intrathecal anesthesia (ie, 7.5 mg to 15 mg bupivacaine HCl) 
and before the start of surgery, administer 1st dose  of study drug by IV bolus injection in  
≤15 seconds according to randomization. 
• Intraoperative 
Fentanyl and morphine or other morphine derivatives may be administered 
intraoperatively (during the course of the surgical procedure); however, dosing with fentanyl (and morphine or other morphine derivatives) is to be avoided within the 30 
minutes prior to the anticipated conclusion of the surgical procedure.  The time and dose of fentanyl (and morphine or other morphine derivatives) administered will be recorde d. 
Other opioid analgesics are not to be administered pre- or intraoperatively, as this may 
confound or influence the subjects’ demand for opioid analgesia during the postoperative 
period (Hour 0 through hospital discharge). 
Anxiolytics, sedatives, and other medications (except for analgesic agent s) that are used 
for subject well -being during the intraoperative period may be administered according to 
the investigator’s clinical practice and in accordance with institutional standards.  The 
time and dose of a ny medication administered during the intraoperative period will be 
recorded.  
• Intraoperative:  Prior to wound closure administer : 
Local infiltration of bupivacaine HCl 0.5% 30 mL with epinephrine 0.5 mg expanded in a 
volume of 90 mL normal saline and drawn up into six 20 mL syringes each with a 
22-gauge needle.  
Protocol REC- 17-025 with Amendment 002  
24JAN2018  
Page 61 of 65 
 Local infiltrate should be administered so that each needle stick delivers approximately 
1 mL of the drug to the intended area.  The tissue should visibly expand with minimal 
leakage.  Infi ltrate should be injected into the prescribed locations based on the areas of 
highest nerve density as shown in Table 4 .

 Postoperative  Concomitant Medications:  
• Opioid pain medications: 
Starting at Hour 0 and continuing through hospital discharge, pain intensity that is not 
adequately controlled with study drug may be treated with IV and PO opioids as 
follows.  Conversion fro m IV to oral analgesia should be made once subjects are 
tolerating liquid intake.  
− Morphine 1 to 4 mg IV every 10 minutes for the first hour and then 1 to 8 
mg IV Q1H PRN 
− Oxycodone im mediate release (IR) 5 mg PO Q4H (maximum of 10  mg 
Q4H PRN)  
• Acetaminophen : 
All subjects will receive 650 mg of acetaminophen Q8H PO as tolerated until 24 hours 
following the last dose of study drug (LSD+1) . 
No other analgesic agents except for study drug, the opioids (described above), acetaminophen (through LSD+1), and aspirin f or venous thromboembolism prophylaxis 
according to the investigator and institutional standards (Section  5.1) are permitted . 
• Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting: 
Subject s may receive IV ondansetron 4 mg as needed for postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV)  according to FDA prescribing information . 
Study Drug: 
Additional doses of study drug will be administered every 24 hours (±1 hour) after the 
first dose.  Dosing will continue until the subject is either discharged from the hospital or until IV study drug analgesia is no longer clinically appropriate.   The investigator may 
administer a final dose of study drug up to 4 hours ahead of schedule in subjects who are to be discharged.

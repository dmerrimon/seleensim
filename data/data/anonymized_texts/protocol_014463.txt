Trial period: Planned date of enrolment of first subject: October 2013. Planned date of completion of last subject: October 2015. 
Main objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of once 
daily use of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) plus betamethasone  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 4 of 123
  
 (0.5 mg/g) (as dipropionate) gel in adolescent subjects 
(aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of once 
daily use of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) plus betamethasone 
(0.5 mg/g) (as dipropionate) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
Methodology: An international, multi-centre, prospective, non-
controlled, open, single-group, 8-week trial in adolescent 
subjects (aged 12 to 16 years,  11 months) with scalp and 
body psoriasis  
Psoriatic lesions on the scalp and body will be treated with calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as 
dipropionate) gel applied once daily for up to 8 weeks under maximal use conditions on the body. 
 
The duration of the trial for each subject will be a 
maximum of 20 weeks, consisting of a screening period of 
7 days to 8 weeks followed by a 4- or 8-week treatment 
period and, if required, a 2-4-week follow-up period. 
 Prior to Visit 1 (Day 0), a wash-out period (up to 8 weeks) 
should be completed if the subject is being treated or has 
recently been treated with an ti-psoriatic treatments or 
other relevant medication, as defined by the exclusion criteria.  
 
During the trial, the subset of subjects performing HPA 
axis assessments will be allo wed to use non-steroid topical 
treatments without expected systemic effects to treat 
psoriasis lesions on the face and sensitive areas (armpits, groin, under the breasts and in other skin folds around the 
genitals and buttocks).  Subjects not performing HPA axis assessments will be allowed to use any topical treatment  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 5 of 123
  
 allowed except potent or very potent (WHO groups III-
IV) corticosteroids to treat psoriasis lesions on the face 
and skin folds. Bath oils and moisturizing soaps are 
allowed. Topical vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol, 
calcitriol or tacalcitol) are limited to a maximum of 50 g, 
75 g or 100 g of ointment/gel/cream per week depending 
on the subject’s age and body surface area (BSA).  This 
includes the amount of investigational product used.   
The study will consist of a wa sh-out period (if required), 
2 screening visits; SV1 and SV2 (to be conducted within 
8 and 1 weeks prior to Visit 1, respectively) followed by a 
4-or 8-week treatment period (Days 0-56). Subjects whose 
psoriasis is clear after 4-week treatment will stop the 
investigational produc t and leave the tria l. Subjects who 
have signs of psoriasis after 4 weeks of treatment will continue treatment for another 4-week period. During the 
treatment period, the study visits will be on Days 0, 14, 
28, 42 and 56 (Visits 1 to 5).  
 
Each subject will receive the investigational product and 
will be instructed to  apply it once daily.  
 Calcium metabolism evaluation will be performed at SV2 
and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment (Day 28 and 
Day 56). The evaluation will include measurements of 
serum calcium, albumin, phosphate, plasma parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) level and cal culation of the albumin-
corrected serum calcium concentration. Also, 24-hour urine will be collected and urinary volume, calcium-, 
phosphate-, and creatinine excretion will be measured and 
the calcium:creatinine and phosphate:creatinine ratios 
calculated.   
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed to evaluate if any potential adverse events could be correlated to the 
investigational product. A blood sample for  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 6 of 123
  
 pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn at Visit 3 (Day 
28) for the measurement of plasma LEO 80185 when the 
investigational product is at a steady state concentration. 
 In the U.S. only, subjects will perform hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function assessments until 
30 evaluable subjects are obtained. These subjects will 
have their HPA axis function assessed at SV2 and after 
4 and 8 weeks of treatment (Day 28 and Day 56). The 
adrenal function will be asse ssed with a rapid standard 
dose synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (CORTROSYN
®) challenge test. The test consists of 
blood sampling starting at 8 a.m. (± 30 minutes). Following the blood sample, an intravenous bolus injection of 250 mcg CORTROSYN
® is given at time zero 
(t=0). Serum cortisol concentration at 30 and 60 minutes will reflect the stimulat ion induced by CORTROSYN
®. 
Subjects will not be included in  the study if serum cortisol 
concentration at SV2 is 5 mc g/dl or lower before the 
CORTROSYN® injection or if serum cortisol 
concentration, obtained at 30 minutes after 
CORTROSYN® injection, is below or equal to 18 mcg/dl. 
At Week 4, subjects with serum cortisol below or equal to 18 mcg/dl at 30 min af ter administration of 
CORTROSYN
® will discontinue the treatment and will 
perform a follow-up visit 2 (Visit FU2). 
 
Visit FU2 will be conducted for subjects with possible 
HPA axis suppression 28 days after possible suppression 
is reported (i.e. 28 days after Visit 3 or 5). This follow-up 
will involve a repeat HPA axis suppression test to assess if 
the possible suppression has reversed. 
 
A follow-up visit (Visit FU1) will be conducted 14 days 
after the last on-treatment visit for subjects with any 
ongoing adverse event(s) classi fied as possibly/probably 
related/not assessable relationship to the investigational  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 7 of 123
  
 product. FU1 will also be performed for subjects with 
albumin corrected serum calcium above  the reference 
range at the last on-treatment visit.  
A window of ± 2 days will be allowed for Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 
FU1 and FU2. The overall treatment period should be 4 or 
8 weeks (28 or 56 days ± 2 days). 
Number of subjects  
to be enrolled: In total, a sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to 
ensure 100 subjects are evaluable for calcium metabolism.  
Thirty of the 100 subjects will also be evaluable for HPA 
axis suppression. At least 30 subjects will be evaluable for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
 
In the U.S. only, subjects will perform hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function assessments until 30 evaluable subjects  are obtained.   
 
Power of the study 
No formal sample size calcul ation evaluating the power of 
the study has been performed, but further considerations 
regarding sample size have been made as described 
below. 
 
The upper limit of an exact two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the probability of observing a specific adverse 
event, when 0 out of 100 possible events have been 
observed, is approximately 4% assuming a binomial 
distribution. 
 
With 100 subjects and an assumed response rate 
(percentage of subjects who achieve “Clear” or “Almost 
clear” according to the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity on the body at end of treatment) 
of approximately 30%, the 95% confidence interval for 
the estimated response rate will be approximately ± 9%. 
Main criteria for inclusion for 
all subjects: 1. Signed informed consent given by parent(s), or legal 
guardian(s), or by the subject (according to national

treatment.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 16 of 123
  
 Statistical methods: The percentages of subjects with a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes, and at both 30 
and 60 minutes, after the ACTH-challenge at Week 4 and Week 8 will be calculated. The mean serum cortisol 
concentration at time 0 and at 30 and 60 minutes after 
ACTH-challenge at baseline (S V2), Week 4 and Week 8, 
respectively, will be calculated.  
The number of subjects experiencing each type of adverse 
event and each type of a dverse drug reaction will be 
tabulated.  
The mean change from baseline (SV2) to Week 4 and 
Week 8 in haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis parameters except in the urinary glucose and ketones will 
be calculated. For the albu min-corrected serum calcium 
and 24-hour urinary calcium ex cretion, the mean change 
from baseline to end of treatme nt will also be calculated 
and the 95% confidence interv al of mean change from 
baseline to Week 4 and Week 8 and end of treatment will 
be presented. For the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio, the 
95% confidence interval of m ean change from baseline to 
Week 4 and Week 8 will be presented. Laboratory 
parameters will also be categorised according to the 
reference range, and shift tables will be produced. 
 
The following will be presented with the 95% confidence 
interval: 
- the percentage of subjects with “Controlled disease” 
according to the investigator’s global assessment of 
disease severity on the b ody at end of treatment 
- the percentage change in PASI from baseline to end of treatment 
- the percentage of subjects with “Controlled disease” according to the patient’s global assessment of disease severity on the body at end of treatment

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 28 of 123
  
 5.2 Ethical Conduct of the Trial 
This clinical trial will be conducted to conf orm to the principles of the World Medical 
Association (WMA), Declaration of Helsinki, Ethical Princi ples for Medical Research 
Involving Human Subjects adopted by the 18th WM A General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 
June 1964 and last revised in Seoul in Oc tober 2008 by the WMA General Assembly (see 
Appendix II ). 
5.3 Ethical Consideration Statement 
Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic a nd recurrent skin disorder. At pr esent, no curative treatment is 
available for the disease. Psoriasis is a disab ling disease, with a significant impact on the 
quality of life comparable with that observed  in other chronic medical conditions such as 
diabetes and depression ( 1) (2).  
Approximately 35% of patients with psoriasis develop the disease before the age of 20 and 
25% are diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age ( 3). Involvement of the scalp is more 
common in children (4 ) (5). Based on this, it is evident that scalp psoriasis is also prevalent in 
the adolescent age group (12-17 years).  
Most preparations are greasy and messy to apply, have an unpleasant smell and may cause 
staining of clothes and fabrics and skin irritation ( 6). Patient’s compliance is therefore often 
poor, leading to a bad th erapeutic result. Therefore, there is a need for a patient acceptable 
topical treatment in this age group. 
LEO 80185 gel is a fixed combination product containing the vitamin D 3 analogue 
calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, for topical treatm ent of psoriasis vulgaris on 
scalp and body in subjects aged 18 years and above.  
Daivobet® gel was approved for the treatment of scalp psoriasis in adults in several countries 
in the EU and the US in 2008 and is launched under the trademarks Daivobet®, Dovobet®, 
Taclonex®, and Xamiol®. Since then it has been approve d in the remaining EU countries 
(2009) and in several other countries in the rest  of the world (more than 40 countries outside 
EU), including Canada and Australia; approvals ar e pending in several count ries in the rest of 
the world. The product has been launched with the indication scalp psor iasis in adults since 
2008.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 29 of 123
  
 The marketing authorisation application for treatment of ‘non-scalp’ psoriasis vulgaris in 
adults was approved in several countries in the EU in July 2009. Since then, the indication of 
non-scalp psoriasis vulgaris in adults has been approved in the remaining EU countries 
(Dec 2011), in US October 2012, and in several other countries in the rest of the world. 
Approvals are pending in several countries in the rest of the world. The product was launched 
in the first European country, Denmark, in March 2010 under the trademark Daivobet® gel. 
Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-
17 years) with psoriasis on the scalp have recently been completed. In a total of 
109 adolescent subjects using up to 69 g/week , LEO gel was safe and effective in the 
treatment of psoriasis vulgari s on the scalp.  The effects on calcium metabolism were 
investigated; no cases of hypercalcaemia and no clin ically relevant changes in urinary calcium 
were reported. The adrenal response to ACTH  challenge was assessed in a subset of 30 
patients; one patient showed a decrease in cort isol response to ACTH challenge after 4 weeks 
of treatment which was considered mild ( 7) (8). 
All subjects in the trial will receive LEO 80185 gel to use once-daily for up to 8 weeks. This 
application frequency and treatment duration have  been shown to be safe and effective in 
adults for the approved products Taclonex® and Xamiol®.  
At the end of the trial, subjects will have received treatment with LEO 80185 gel for up to 8 weeks. Continued use of LEO 80185 gel at the en d of the trial will not be available to the 
subjects.   
Following the 4-week or 8-week treatment peri od and the follow-up examinations, subjects 
will leave the trial and, if required, resume the treatment they received prior to the wash-out 
period or start a treatment according to the i nvestigator’s discretion, whichever is most 
appropriate. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of  the subjects will give informed  consent, and subjects must 
give their assent, or subjects may give info rmed consent as appropriate and according to 
national laws and regulations. 
Laboratory evidence of adrenal insu fficiency due to the use of t opical corticosteroid treatment 
has been reported ( 9), due to systemic absorption of  the corticosteroid.  LEO 80185 gel 
contains the corticosteroid betamethasone dipr opionate and is why ad renal function will be 
assessed in the present trial, although the risk of adrenal suppression with LEO 80185 gel is 
expected to be low.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 30 of 123
  
 In this trial, treatment for up to 8 weeks is e xpected to be safe. The application area of LEO 
80185 gel for subjects in the trial is expected to decrea se with time as thei r psoriasis decreases 
in severity. Thus, the amount of investigational product required is expected to be less by the 
end of the trial. Adrenal function will be asse ssed by an ACTH-challenge test before, during, 
and at the end of trial treatm ent. This test involves injec ting a synthetic subunit of ACTH 
(CORTROSYN®) into the subject, and measuring the co rtisol produced by the adrenal glands 
30 and 60 minutes after the injection.  
The use of CORTROSYN® in this trial will be in keeping with that detailed in the US 
Prescribing Information ( Appendix III ); therefore this is expected to be of low risk.   
The risk of hypercalcemia due to systemic ab sorption of the calcipotri ol component of LEO 
80185 gel is expected to be low when the medication is used in the doses specified in the trial. 
Any potential effects of LEO 80185 gel on calcium metabolism will be assessed by 
measurement of the concentrations of serum calcium and -phosphate and plasma parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) and the urinary calcium-, phos phate-, and creatinine excretion based on 
collection of 24-hour urine and the calcium:creatinine and phosphate:creatinine, ratios will be 
calculated before, during and at the end of treatment.  
The expected total blood volume collected wi ll be approximately 46.5 ml for subjects 
performing HPA axis assessments and 31.5 ml  for subjects not performing HPA axis 
assessments. This excludes any follow-up assessment of abnormal values. Topical anaesthetic will be provided at study sites to decrease disc omfort and pain for the subjects when having 
placed catheters at the (sub)investigator’s discretion. 
Recruitment for the trial will be continued until  100 subjects are available for evaluation of 
calcium metabolism.  This includes the 30 subjec ts (in the US) without adrenal suppression at 
baseline who is to undergo ACTH-challenge test at end of treatment (Visit 3 or 5). 
Since all subjects will receive the LEO 80185 gel, the prospect of subjects experiencing an 
improvement of their psoriasis during the trial will be good. Subjects will be under the careful 
supervision of a dermatologist wi th paediatric experience during the entire course of the trial. 
Subjects performing HPA axis assessments w ill be allowed to use non-steroid topical 
treatments without expected systemic effects to treat psoriasis lesi ons on the face and skin 
folds.  Subjects not performing HPA axis asse ssments will be allowed to use any topical 
treatment allowed except potent or very poten t (WHO groups III-IV) corticosteroids to treat 
psoriasis lesions on the face and skin folds. Bath oils and moisturizing soaps are allowed.   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 31 of 123
  
 The results from this trial could help make  LEO 80185 gel available to adolescent subjects 
suffering from psoriasis. It is therefore concl uded that the expected benefits of conducting this 
trial will compensate for the inconveniences for the participating subjects. 
5.4 Subject Information and Informed Consent 
The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of subjects will receive written and verbal information 
concerning the trial or subjects may give info rmed consent as appropriate and according to 
national laws or regulations. This information will emphasise that participation in the trial is 
voluntary and that the subject may withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason. The 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be given an opportunity to ask questions and will be given 
sufficient time to consider before consenting. Signed and dated informed consent for the subject to participate in the trial will be obtai ned from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), or by 
the subject in accordance with national laws or regulations, prior to any trial related procedure 
being carried out.  
All subjects will also receive appropriate wr itten and verbal information, be given an 
opportunity to ask questions and sufficient time  to consider, before providing written assent. 
The subject’s decision not to participate or to wi thdraw will be respected, even if consent is 
given by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s).  
If during the trial a subject who has previously given assent becomes legally emancipated i.e. 
ceases to be a minor, the subject should be asked to provide their written consent.  
All Investigators will sign an  “Investigator’s Agreement” to confirm the above. 
5.5 Handling of Personal Data 
Subjects (or their legally acceptable representati ve) shall be asked to consent that their 
personal data are recorded, collected, processe d and may be transferred to EU and non-EU 
countries in accordance with any national legisl ation regulating privacy and data protection. 
Personal data shall be handled and processed by a ll relevant parties involved in the clinical 
trial in accordance with any nati onal legislation regulating privacy  and data protection as well 
as in accordance with the gene ral terms and conditions of the authorisation granted by the

8 Introduction and Rationale 
8.1 Psoriasis 
Psoriasis is one of the most common chroni c skin diseases, with a prevalence generally 
estimated at between 1 to 3%  of the world’s population ( 10). Psoriasis is characterised by 
sharply marginated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red and scaly, and may itch. This appearance is produced by a greatly increased rate of epidermal proliferation with 
impaired differentiation of keratinocytes. De rmal blood vessels are dilated and there is 
infiltration of the skin with immunologically active cells ( 11) (12). The pathogenesis is 
incompletely understood, but the disease is t hought to be triggere d by activation of the 
cellular immune system with i nvolvement of T cells, dendritic  cells, and various cytokines 
and chemochines ( 13). 
 
The most common clinical type of psoriasis,  affecting 80-90% of pa tients, is psoriasis 
vulgaris (plaque-type psoriasis) (14). Sites of predilection are the hairy scalp (30% initially and 75% over the course of the disease), the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees and 
the sacral region ( 15). The nails are involved in about 30% of patients with psoriasis and in 
about 20% psoriatic arthritis arises, usually many years after the initial cutaneous 
manifestation.  
Psoriasis can be treated either  by topical therapy, phototherapy, or by systemic methods ( 10) 
(16). Systemic treatments and phototherapy are generally reserved fo r extensive disease 
unresponsive to topical treatments du e to concerns over toxicity ( 13) (16 ). 
 Most preparations are greasy and messy to a pply, have an unpleasant smell and may cause 
staining of clothes and fabrics and skin irritation ( 6). Patient’s compliance is therefore often 
poor, leading to a bad therapeutic result. 
 
There is a need for a patien t acceptable topical treatment.

8.2 Investigational Product Description 
LEO 80185 (Calcipotriol plus Beta methasone Dipropionate) Gel  
LEO 80185 gel, containing calcipotriol 50 mc g/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as 
dipropionate), is a topi cal therapy indicated for treatment of psoriasis vulgaris on the scalp 
and body. It obtained marketing approval in 2008 in the U.S., Canada, and 16 European 
countries, and since then has been marketed in the U.S. and Europe under the trade names 
Taclonex® Scalp Topical Suspension and Daivobet®/Dovobet®/Xamiol® gel, respectively. In 
this Clinical Study Report, ‘LEO 80185 gel’ is used  in text ‘LEO 80185’ is used in the tables, 
figures, and listings. 
 Calcipotriol is a vitamin D
3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate is a topical 
corticosteroid. Both the active components in LEO 80185 gel have been widely available world-wide for many years and their efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of psoriasis 
are well-known.  
Numerous trials have been conducted with LEO  80185 gel as described in the Investigator’s 
Brochure. Overall, it can be concluded that LEO 80185 gel is considered to be effective and 
safe in the treatment of psor iasis vulgaris on scalp and body. 
 
8.3 Trial Rationale 
The FDA has approved Taclonex® Gel for the treatment of body psoriasis in adults. The 
objective of the present phase 2 trial is to ev aluate the safety and efficacy of LEO 80185 gel 
for the treatment of both body and scalp psoria sis in adolescent subjects and has been 
undertaken as a post-marketing commitment to  the FDA (for NDA 22-185). The FDA requires 
the trial to be conducted in 100 evaluable paediatric patients (ages 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with psoriasis vulgaris on the scalp and body, to  evaluate the safety and effect of Taclonex
® 
Gel on calcium metabolism. In a subset of a least 30 patients treated under maximal use 
conditions, evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituit ary axis and pharmacokinetics is required. 
LEO 80185 gel has marketing approval in many count ries for the treatment of scalp psoriasis 
in adults. Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL 0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-17 years) have recently been completed. In these trials in a total of 109 adolescent 
subjects, LEO gel was safe and effective in th e treatment of psoriasis vulgaris on the scalp ( 7) 
(8). 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 37 of 123
  
 Approximately 35% of patients with psoriasis develop the disease before the age of 20 and 
25% are diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age ( 3). Involvement of the scalp is more 
common in children (4 ) (5). Based on this, it is evident that scalp psoriasis is also prevalent in 
the adolescent age group (12-17 years).  
Only 10% of psoriasis patients devel op psoriasis before the age of ten ( 3). The clinical 
appearance of psoriasis in child ren (ages 2-11 years) may differ  from the classical picture 
seen in older patients. Facial psoriasis is more  common in children than in adults and may be 
the only site affected; guttate and flexural forms are particularly common in children ( 20) (21) 
(22) (23 ). Children have a higher body surf ace area (BSA) to body mass ratio than 
adolescents and adults which increases the potential for adverse drug reactions due to 
absorption of topically applie d compounds through the skin ( 24). This limits the use of potent 
topical corticosteroids in this age group (25). Hence children below 12 years of age will not be enrolled into this study. 
 
To evaluate the safety of the LEO 80185 gel in th is trial, all adverse events reported by the 
subject or observed by the investigator will be  recorded. In addition, any effects resulting 
from systemic absorption of  the active components, betamethasone dipropionate and 
calcipotriol, will be evaluated by assessing adrenal function and calcium metabolism, 
respectively. 
 
Laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency due to  the use of topical corticosteroid treatment 
has been reported ( 9).  This is due to systemic absorption of the corticosteroid, which then 
induces suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitar y-adrenal (HPA) axis due to a negative 
feedback effect on the pituitar y gland and the hypothalamus ( 9) (26). This results in a 
decrease in the secretion of ACTH from the pituitary gland. The adrenal glands depend on 
ACTH as a tropic hormone in such a way that  ACTH deficiency results in a reversible 
inability to produce cortisol (27). Hence, the adrenal glands lose the capacity to produce 
cortisol in response to an ACTH-challenge. Adrenal function can therefore be measured by 
injection of a synthetic  subunit of ACTH into the subject,  and then measuring the production 
of cortisol by the adrenal glands in response to this. A serum cortisol concentration of 18 mcg/dl or less at 30 and 60 minutes afte r the injection indicates possible adrenal 
suppression ( 26). 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 38 of 123
  
 The effect of LEO 80185 gel on adrenal function in adult subjects has been assessed by the 
ACTH-challenge test in a previous trial ( 28). The subjects included in the trial had extensive 
psoriasis on both scalp (at least 30% of scalp affected) and no n-scalp regions of the body (15-
30% of body surface area). Subjects applied LE O 80185 gel to lesions on the scalp and the 
corresponding ointment product Daivobet®/Taclonex® ointment to the lesions on the trunk 
and limbs. After a total of 32 subjects had received treatment with LEO 80185 gel for 4 
weeks, 5 had a serum cortisol concentration ≤18mcg/dl at 30 minutes after ACTH-challenge, 
and out of 11 subjects who continued treatment fo r 8 weeks, 2 subjects had a serum cortisol of 
≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after ACTH challenge . The cortisol value was >18mcg/dl at 60 
minutes after ACTH-challenge for all subjects.  
 
In the two trials MBL 0801 a nd MBL 0412 INT, no cases of hype rcalcaemia and no clinically 
relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported.  The adrena l response to ACTH challenge 
was measured in 30 patients; one patient showed  a decrease in cortisol response to ACTH 
challenge after 4 weeks of treatment which was considered to be mild ( 7) (8). 
 In the present study LEO 80185 gel will be applied to lesions on both scalp and body. The 
risk of adrenal suppression with LEO 80185 gel is expected to be low with LEO 80185 being 
applied under maximal use conditions as system ic exposure is known to be low and the drug 
concentration is expected to be below the lim it of quantification (Inve stigator’s Brochure). 
 Subjects participating in the present study will perform ACTH-challenge test before and after 
treatment. The pre-treatment test is to ensure that adrenal function is normal before starting 
investigational product. Serum cortisol concentrations at  30 and 60 minutes after injection 
will be measured in order to show the maximum cortisol level achieved ( 26). 
 
Overdosage with topical calcipotri ol can cause hypercalcemia ( 27), due to the systemic 
absorption of calcipotriol, which then affects calcium metabolism as it is a vitamin D analogue. However, extensive experience with topical  use of calcipotriol in psoriasis has 
demonstrated no significant impact on calcium  metabolism when used in the recommended 
amounts (maximum weekly dose in adults of 10 0 g of a 50 mcg/g concentration). Doses up to 
300 g have been used with serum calcium remaining within the normal range ( 29). 
 
Two studies with calcipo triol ointment have been conducted in children 2-14 years of age and 
did not show effects on calcium metabolism ( 30) (31). One trial with Daivobet
® Ointment, 
MCB 0501 INT, has been conducted in adolescent subjects and did not show any effects on 
calcium or HPA axis.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 39 of 123
  
  
Calcium metabolism will be evaluated in the present study by 24-hour urinary collection and 
measurement of serum calcium, -phosphate a nd plasma PTH before, during and/or after 
treatment. 24-hour urine will be collected and the urinary calcium-, phosphate- and creatinine 
excretion will be measured and the calcium: creatinine and phosphate:creatinine ratios 
calculated. Subjects who report an incomplete  24-hour urinary collection will be excluded 
from the analyses of 24-hour urinary calcium  and phosphate excretion but will still be 
analysed for calcium:creatinine and phosphate:c reatinine. To identify any severe, non-
reported sampling errors the daily creatinine ex cretion/kg body weight will be calculated as 
proposed by Remer et al. ( 32).   
 It is well established that there is a relati onship between dietary calcium intake and the 
urinary calcium excretion in adults. However, in rapidly growing adolescents, it appears that only dietary calcium intake a bove a certain threshold of approximately 1500 mg/day will 
result in an increase in urinary calcium excretion ( 33). As this study includes adolescents 12 
to 16 years, 11 months of age, some of the subj ects may not be in phase of rapid growth and 
some subjects might consume large amounts of  dairy products. Therefore, there is a 
possibility of an effect of the diet on the calcium excretion.  
 
A review of the subject’s normal diet w ill be done. As dairy products account for 
approximately 73% of the total dietary calcium co ntent, and as the calcium from other sources 
such as vegetables and grains are less easily absorbed ( 34), the review will focus on the intake 
of dairy products. The subjects will be asked to keep a diary of the daily intake of dairy products and calcium-fortified products (e.g. brea d, cereals, orange juice or soy milk). The 
number of daily servings of calcium defined as one cup (240 ml) or 1.5 ounces of cheese 
(43 g) in dairy products such as milk, yoghurt or  cheese or of a calcium -fortified product with 
corresponding calcium content (300 mg calcium/cup) will be estimated ( 35). The subjects will 
be asked to keep the same number of daily servings three days prio r to and during each 24-
hour urine collection. The number of daily ca lcium servings should not exceed five (i.e. 
1500 mg calcium). 
 
The combination of high calcium intake with vitamin D supplementation, or extreme calcium 
intake alone, has been shown to significan tly increase urinary calcium in adults (36 ). Hence, 
the use of calcium or vitamin D supplem ents will be excluded in this study.

 Subjects will apply the LEO 80185 gel once daily  for up to 8 weeks. This application 
frequency and treatment duration has been shown to be safe and effective in adults with 55-
70% of subjects achieving controlled disease after 4-week treatment ( 37) ( 38). Only subjects 
who have signs of scalp and/or body psoriasi s after 4 weeks of treatment will continue 
treatment in the study. As the application ar ea and the amount of i nvestigational product 
required is expected to decrea se with time as lesions heal, continued treatment for up to 8 
weeks is expected to be safe in those subjects who need it.   
 
The maximum weekly dosage approved for adults is 100 g. In the present trial, the maximum 
weekly dose will be determined by age and BSA at  baseline. For subjects aged 12 to 14 years 
with a BSA ≤ 1.3 m2, the maximum weekly dosage will be 50 g of LEO 80185 gel per week. 
For subjects aged 12 to 14 years with a BSA > 1.3 m2 and subjects aged 15 to 16 years, 11 
months with a BSA ≤ 1.7 m2, the maximum weekly dosage will be 75 g of LEO 80185 gel per 
week. For subjects aged 15 to 16 year s, 11 months with a BSA > 1.7 m2, the maximum 
weekly dosage will be 100 g of LEO 80185 gel per week.  
 
To be eligible for the study, all subjects are to have an extent of scalp and body (trunk and /or 
limbs) psoriasis of 10-35% BSA.  In addition,  subjects performing HPA axis assessments are 
to have an extent of scalp psoriasis that is more than or equal to 20% of the scalp area.  
Subjects not performing HPA axis assessments are to  have an extent of scalp psoriasis that is 
more than or equal to 10% of the scalp area. The disease severity of  body psoriasis and scalp 
psoriasis is to at least moderate according to the investigator’s global assessment. It is expected that many adolescent subjects with psor iasis will have less extensive and less severe 
disease. However, since the main purpose of the pr esent study is to evaluate the safety of the 
investigational product, th e exposure to treatment has to be as close to maximum as possible. 
 A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled in th is study.  All subjects will undergo assessments 
on safety, pharmacokinetic analysis, calcium  metabolism and efficacy. A subgroup of 30 
subjects providing data for the ACTH-challenge test at the end of treatment will be included 
in the study.  This number of subjects has been requested by the FDA for an HPA axis evaluation.  Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed to evaluate if any adverse events 
could be correlated to the investigati onal product. A blood sample (2 x 6mL) for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation will be drawn at Visit 3 (4 weeks of treatment) prior to the 
application of LEO 80185 on the day of the visit.  Validated bioanalytical assays will be used 
for quantification of calcipotri ol, betamethasone dipropionate and the metabolites MC1080  
and betamethasone 17-propionate in the plasma sample. 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 41 of 123
  
 Subjects will have a washout period of up to 8 w eeks if they are using treatments which could 
have an effect on (or be affected by) the ACTH -challenge test (e.g., corticosteroids, enzymatic 
inductors, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, hypoglyc emic sulfonamides, antidepressive medica-
tions, estrogen), calcium metabolism (e.g., vitamin D, calcium supplements, antacids, 
diuretics and antiepileptics) or the psoriasis to be trea ted with investigational product (e.g., 
systemic/topical/ ultraviolet anti-psoriatic  therapy, although emollients are allowed). 
 
9 Trial Objectives 
9.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety  of once daily use of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g) 
plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as dipropiona te) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 
years, 11 months) with scalp and body psoriasis. 
9.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objective is to ev aluate the efficacy of once da ily use of calcipotriol (50 
mcg/g) plus betamethasone (0.5 mg/g) (as dipr opionate) gel in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 
16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body psoriasis. 
10  Investigational Plan 
10.1 Trial Design 
This will be an international,  multi-centre, prospective, non-c ontrolled, open, single-group, 8-
week trial in adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 16 years, 11 months) with scalp and body 
psoriasis. 
 
The subjects will receive topical treatment with  calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 
mg/g (as dipropionate) gel once daily for up to 8 weeks.  
Washout/Screening Period
 
Depending on the prior use of disallowed treatments, the washout/screening period will last for 7 to 56 days prior to the first ad ministration of LEO 80185 gel (Visit 1).  
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 42 of 123
  
 Prior to attending any study proced ure, a signed informed consent must be obtained from the 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of the subject, or by the subject (as appropriate and according to 
national laws and regulations). Written assent should also be obtained from the subject. There 
are two screening visits: Screening visit 1 (S V1) and screening Visit 2 (SV2). Depending on 
the subjects’ use of excluded treatments, SV1 is  performed up to 7 weeks before SV2; SV2 is 
performed at 3 to 7 days before Visit 1. 
 
Treatment Period  
The treatment period will last for up to 8 weeks. There are up to 5 visits: Visit 1 (day 0), Visit 
2 (day 14), Visit 3 (day 28), Visit 4 (day 42) and Visit 5 (day 56). Visits 2-5 should be 
performed within ±2 days of the scheduled time relative to Visit 1; if they are outside this window, the (sub)investigator should record th e reason in the subject’ s medical record.   
 LEO 80185 gel will be applied onc e daily to scalp psoriasis lesions. Subjects should be 
instructed to discontinue treatm ent on individual lesions if/whe n a lesion has cleared. Subjects 
whose psoriasis clears after 4-week treatment will stop the investigational product and leave 
the trial.  
 
Subjects who have psoriasis after 4 weeks of treatment will continue treatment for another 4-
week period. 
 
Subjects whose psoriasis clears at Visit 2 or Visit 4 according to the (sub)investigator should 
discontinue treatment but will stay in the study. During periods of discontinuation of 
treatment the subject should restart the treatment if psoriasis reappears. 
 
Follow-up
 
If applicable, the treatment period will be followed by a follow-up (FU)  period consisting of 
visit FU1 and/or visit FU2.  
 
Visit FU1 will take place 14 days after the last visit in the treatment period, but only if there 
was an ongoing adverse event at this time of pos sible/probable/not assessable relationship to 
the investigational produ ct. At the (sub)investigator’s disc retion, the information required at 
this visit may be obtained over the telephone, an d the subject need not make the visit. FU1 
should also be performed if album in corrected serum calcium is above the reference range at 
the last on-site visit. A new blood sample should then be collected. 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 43 of 123
  
 Visit FU2 will take place 28 days after the ACTH-c hallenge test performed at Visit 3 or Visit 
5, but only if this test showed  a serum cortisol concentration ≤ 18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after 
ACTH-challenge. 
 
Visits FU1 and FU2 should be performed within ±2 days of the scheduled time; if they are 
outside this window, the qualified site staff person should record the reason in the subject’s 
medical record/source document.  
For details, see Section 10.8 for the schedule of trial procedures.   
10.1.1  Overall Chart 
 
There should be at least 4 days between SV1 a nd SV2 so dietary information (diary) can be 
collected.

 Enrolment of subjects will continue until data from 100 subjects are available for evaluation 
of the effect of LEO 80185 on calcium meta bolism (i.e. the measurement of the serum 
calcium concentration and the 24-hour urin ary calcium excretion and/or the urinary 
calcium:creatinine ratio is available before and at Visit 3 and/or Visit 5). Therefore, the 
number of enrolled subjects can exceed 100 subjects.  
 
The 100 subjects include the enrolment of 30 eval uable subjects in the U.S. without adrenal 
suppression at baseline who undergo the ACTH-chall enge test at end of treatment (Visit 3 or 
Visit 5). At the time the sponsor confirms 30 ev aluable subjects has been obtained, there may 
be other subjects ongoing in the trial that ha ve not yet had the ACTH-challenge test. Such 
subjects will be allowed to complete the trial without the ACTH-challenge test. 
 
The primary objective of the trial is to eval uate the safety of LEO 80185 gel. No formal 
sample size calculation evaluating the power of th e trial has been performed. However, a few 
considerations regarding the sample size have been made as described below. 
 
The upper limit of an exact two-sided 95% c onfidence interval for the probability of 
observing a specific adverse event, when 0 out of  100 possible events have been observed, is 
approximately 4% assuming a binomial distribution. 
 
With 100 subjects and an assumed response rate (percentage of subjects who achieve “Clear” 
or “Almost clear” according to the investigator ’s global assessment of disease severity on the 
body at end of treatment) of approximately 30%, the 95% confidence interval for the 
estimated response rate will be approximately ± 9%.  
Each centre should aim to enroll a minimum of three subjects. As the subjects are anticipated 
to be difficult to recruit, the suggested mini mum number of subjects per centre is based on 
practical considerations rather than statisti cal robustness of estimates given per centre.  
10.4 Criteria for Subject Selection (In- and Exclusion) 
Following receipt of verbal and written informa tion about the trial, the parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) or the subject (as appropriate and according to national laws  or regulations) must 
provide signed and dated informed consent  before any trial related activity is carried out, 
including activities relating to washout periods. 
 
Any implementation of national requirements/law for the trial subject’s participation in the 
clinical trial will be ensured and will be  described in submission documentation to 
authorities/ethics committees, as applicable.

 10.4.3  Subject Screening Log 
All subjects screened for this study will be logged on a screening l og. This log will list 
whether subjects were included or not. If a subj ect is not enrolled, the main reason will be 
listed. The list will be prepared according to lo cal regulations about personal data protection. 
10.4.4  Subject Registration 
At SV1, each subject will be assigned the next  (ascending) CRF book numb er available at the 
trial site. The CRF book number is a unique subject identifier used throughout the trial, in lieu 
of the subject’s name. 
10.5 Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw for any of the following reasons: 
1. Unacceptable treatment  efficacy : the investigator is free to withdraw the subject at any 
time for medical reasons. 
2. Unacceptable adverse events : any adverse event that the investigator or the subject 
considers unacceptable. 
3. Exclusion criteria : any exclusion criteria which em erge/become apparent during the 
subject’s participation in the clinical trial. 
4. Voluntary withdrawal: subjects will be free to withdraw from the clinical trial at any 
time and for any reason. 
5. Other reasons: other reasons than stated above whic h requires the subject to (be) with-
draw(n) should be specified. 
Subjects must be withdrawn if they are found to  have become pregnant or experience an 
allergic reaction to CORTROSYN®. 
Subjects who are discovered, after enrolment, not to have fulfilled all in-/exclusion criteria at 
time of enrolment, should be withdrawn from  treatment unless the investigator, based on 
clinical and ethical evaluation, finds withdrawal  inappropriate.  The final efficacy assessment 
(at the correct scheduled time) should, however, be  attempted to be completed for all subjects.  
Such deviation(s) from the (Consolidated) Clin ical Study Protocol must be reported to LEO 
Pharma A/S (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate) and recorded in the Clinical Study Report. 
In case of premature withdrawal prior to vis it 5, the additional tests scheduled for visit 5 
should be done at the end of treatment, with the exception of the 24- hour urine collection. 
Reason(s) for withdrawal w ill be recorded in the CRF.

visit. 
The number of bottles dispensed at each dispensing visit (Visit 1, 2, 3 and 4) is dependent on 
the subject’s age and BSA at Visit 1.  
 For subjects aged 12 to 14 years with a BSA ≤ 1.3 m2, the maximum weekly dosage 
will be 50 g of LEO 80185 gel per week.  Thes e subjects will be dispensed 2 bottles at 
each dispensing visit.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 52 of 123
  
  For subjects aged 12 to 14 years with a BSA > 1.3 m2 and subjects aged 15 to 16 
years, 11 months with a BSA ≤ 1.7 m2, the maximum weekly dosage will be 75 g of 
LEO 80185 gel per week.  These subjects wi ll be dispensed 3 bottles at each 
dispensing visit. 
 For subjects aged 15 to 16 years, 11 months with a BSA > 1.7 m2, the maximum 
weekly dosage will be 100 g of LEO 80185 ge l per week.  These subjects will be 
dispensed 4 bottles at each dispensing visit. 
 
At Visit 1, a treatment instruction will be  handed over to the s ubject/parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) of the subject. On this sheet, the subject/parent(s)/legal guardian (s) will be instructed how to apply the investigational product. 
 
10.6.5  Precautions/Overdosage 
LEO 80185 
Overdosage with calcipotriol may be associ ated with hypercalcaemia. In such cases 
administration of the investigational produc t will be stopped and the subject will be 
withdrawn from the trial. Clinically impor tant hypercalcaemia will be managed at the 
investigator’s discretion with rehydration, bi phosphonate administration or according to local 
instructions. Hypercalcaemia should rapidly subside when treatment is discontinued. 
 
Overdosage with betamethasone dipropionate may result in suppression of the pituitary 
adrenal function causing secondary adrenal insufficiency which is usually reversible. In such 
cases symptomatic treatment is indicated. In case of chronic toxicity the corticosteroid 
therapy must be discontinued gradually. 
 
If severe skin irritation or skin infections develop, LEO 80185 gel s hould be discontinued and 
appropriate therapy instituted.  
Allergic contact dermatitis with corticostero ids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to 
heal rather than by noting any clinical exace rbation as with most topical products not 
containing corticosteroids. Such an observa tion should be corroborated with appropriate 
diagnostic patch testing. 
10.6.6  Treatment Assignment 
Subjects who have been found to comply with all the protocol’s inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will start treatment a nd be dispensed investigational pr oduct at Visit 1.  Each bottle  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 53 of 123
  
 will have a unique identification number.  When  a bottle is dispensed to the subject, the 
unique identification number for th at bottle will be recorded in  the subject’s medical record 
and the CRF. 
10.6.6.1  Randomisation Code List 
Not applicable 
10.6.6.2  Subject Identification List 
The investigator will maintain a list of all subj ects included in the trial at the trial site 
including each subject's iden tity, date of enrolment and corresponding CRF book number so 
that any subject may be identified if requi red for any reason. The list is kept by the 
investigator and will not be copied to LEO Pharma A/S.

10.6.9  Drug Accountability a nd Compliance Checks 
The investigator is fully res ponsible for the investigationa l products at the trial site. 
Dispensing of investigational products may be  delegated to, e.g. a hospital pharmacy as 
locally applicable. 
The person responsible for dispensing the invest igational products will  be responsible for 
maintaining adequate control of  the investigational products and for documenting all transac-
tions with them. Investigational pr oducts must be stored in a sa fe and secure place, and proper 
dispensing arrangements must be made. 
10.6.9.1  Sponsor-Investigator Drug Accountability  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 54 of 123
  
 All investigational pr oducts supplied by the Contract Ma nufacturing Organisation (CMO) on 
behalf of LEO Pharma A/S will be returned to the CMO and be fully accounted for by the 
monitor with the help of the person responsible for dispensing the investigational products. 
Accountability will be documented by use of drug accountability forms. 
Investigational products  may be returned from the trial site  either to the CMO directly or via 
the LEO Pharma A/S affiliate/ CRO responsib le for the running of the clinical trial. 
10.6.9.2  Investigator-Subject Drug Accountability 
At each visit, investigational product, including (empty) containers, dispensed at the previous 
visit must be returned by the subject. An inventory (Individual Drug Accountability Form) 
will be kept of all investigational product give n to and returned by each subject enrolled in the 
trial. This inventory must be available for inspection during monitoring visits and will be 
checked by the monitor to ensure correct dispensing of investigational product. 
10.6.9.3  End of Trial Drug Accountability 
All investigational product supplies returned to the CTS CMO will be reconciled with the 
Individual Drug Accountability Fo rms. All returned bottles wi ll subsequently be weighed by 
the CTS CMO to determine the amount of investigational product used. 
10.6.9.4  Treatment Compliance 
At all on-treatment visits, the subject will be  asked if she/he has used the medication as 
prescribed. If this is not the case, the degree a nd nature of non-compliance will be specified. 
10.6.10  Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
Use of concomitant treatment should be recorded  in the subject’s medical record and the CRF 
(treatment/drug name, dose, indica tion and dates of start and stop). 
Use of non-marketed/other investigational prod ucts one month prior to SV1 and during the 
trial is not  permitted. 
 
Changes of doses (including starting) of drugs  that, while not specifically indicated for 
treatment of the indication being studied, are known to have an effect (positive or negative) on the indication, are not
 permitted.

Prior to injection of CORTROSYN®, the investigator and staff mu st be prepared to treat any 
possible anaphylactic/allergic/hype rsensitivity reaction. Severe  anaphylactic reactions to 
CORTROSYN® can be minimised by discontinuing the IV injection at the earliest sign of any 
local or general reaction such as redness, urtica ria, pruritus, flushing of the face, malaise or 
dyspnoea. In the rare event of a serious allerg ic/anaphylactic reaction, local procedures should 
be followed and IM/IV epinephrine (adrena line), IV high dose corticosteroids, IV 
antihistamines and intravenous fl uids must be readily availa ble and immediately used as 
appropriate. Protection of the ai rway must also be considered and managed appropriately.  
Because of the risk of an allergic reaction,  the injections should be given under medical 
supervision and the subject kept under observation for approximately one hour. If subjects experience an allergic reaction to CORTROSYN
® they should be withdrawn from the trial. 
Repeat administration may increase the risk of hypersensitivity. Subjects should be instructed to inform subsequent physicians of previous use of corticotropic hormones. See the 
Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN
® in Appendix III for further details. 
10.7.1.5  Drug Accountability 
The investigator is fully re sponsible for the CORTROSYN® at the trial site. Dispensing of

neurological assessment and ot her appropriate  system.   
 
Vital Signs 
Recording of vital signs comprises: 
 Heart rate (beats per minute) , supine after 5 min rest 
 Blood pressure, systolic and diastoli c (mmHg), supine after 5 min rest 
 
The same arm will be used for all measurements. The arm (right or left) used for 
measurement will be recorded in the CRF.  
 
Assessment of vital signs resulti ng in abnormal values will be repe ated in order to exclude an 
erroneous assessment. Individual results will be classified as “normal”, “abnormal with no 
clinical significance” or “abnorma l with clinical significance”. 
 
Dietary calcium intake – diary instructions 
The (sub)investigator/site staff s hould perform a review of the s ubject’s normal dietary intake 
of calcium-rich nutrients  – mainly milk and dairy products, but also a high in take of calcium-
fortified products. The subject will be instructed to keep a diary of the daily intake of calcium-
rich nutrients in the 4-day period prior to SV2 (3 days prior to and during the baseline 24-hour 
urinary collection).   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 64 of 123
  
 At SV2, the number of daily servings of dair y (or calcium fortified) products defined as one 
cup (240 ml) of milk or yoghurt, 1.5 ounces (43 g) of cheese or any calcium-fortified product 
with a calcium content of 300 mg/c up will be estimated. The subjec t will be instructed that the 
number of daily calcium servings should not ex ceed five. Also the subject should keep the 
intake of calcium-rich nutrients the same three days prior to and during each subsequent 24-
hour urine collection. At the following visit,  i.e. Visit 3 and Visit 5 respectively, the 
(sub)investigator/site staff should review the inta ke of calcium-rich nutrients with the subject. 
Based on the diary entries the (sub)investigator/site staff should estimate the number of daily 
calcium servings for each day and these will be recorded in the CRF.  
Instruction on 24-hour urine collection 
In addition to the instructions on dietary calciu m intake, the (sub)inves tigator/site staff should 
instruct the subject on how to perform the 24-hour urine co llection. The procedure for 
collecting a 24 hour urine sample should be for subject to pass th eir first urine of the day as 
normal and then to collect all urine passed in  the next 24 hours which should include their 
first urine on the second morning.  
 
10.8.3  Clinical Assessment 
10.8.3.1  Investigator Assessments 
The (sub)investigator will make the clinical assessments listed below. Ideally, all assessments for a subject should be made by the same (sub)investigator. 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of Di sease Severity – Scalp Psoriasis and Body 
Psoriasis 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5, and early withdrawal (if applicable), the (sub)investigator will make 
a global assessment of the dis ease severity of the scalp psoriasis and body psoriasis 
(separately) by use of the 5-point scale below. The assessment will be based on the condition 
of the disease at the time of ev aluation and not in relation to th e condition at a previous visit. 
(0) Clear Plaque thickening = no elevat ion or thickening over normal skin 
Scaling = no evidence of scaling Erythema = none (no residual red coloration but post-inflammatory 
hyperpigmentation may be present) 
 
(1) Almost clear Plaque thickening = none or possible th ickening but difficult to ascertain 
whether there is a slight elevation above normal skin level  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 65 of 123
  
 Scaling =  none or residual surface dryness and scaling  
Erythema = light pink coloration 
 
(2) Mild Plaque thickening = s light but definite elevation  
Scaling = fine scales partially  or mostly covering lesions  
Erythema = light red coloration  
(3) Moderate Plaque thickening = moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges  
Scaling = most lesions at least partially covered  
Erythema = definite red coloration 
 
(4) Severe Plaque thickening = marked or ve ry marked elevation typically with hard 
or sharp edges  
Scaling = non-tenacious or thick tenaci ous scale, covering most or all of 
the lesions  
Erythema = very bright red coloration;  extreme red coloration; or deep red 
coloration 
 
Note : IGA of the scalp should include all
 scalp psoriasis lesions, defined as those areas of the 
scalp where there are any signs of redness, th ickness or scaliness caused by psoriasis. 
The scalp is defined by the hair line. Parts of scalp psoriasis lesions that extend outside the 
defined area of the scalp should not  be included in the assessments.  
At SV2 and Visit 1 the disease severity of scalp psoriasis a nd the disease severity of body 
psoriasis must be graded at least as moderate  in order to meet the inclusion criteria.  
 Subjects with disease severity classified as “Clear” or “A lmost clear” disease after the 
treatment period will be rated as having “Controlled disease”. 
 
Investigator’s Assessment of the Extent of Psoriasis Vulgaris 
In order to obtain baseline data of psoriatic se verity for all the subjects enrolled in the trial, 
the (sub)investigator will also assess the extent of the subject’s  total psoriatic involvement at 
SV2 and Visit 1. 
 
The total psoriatic involve ment (e.g., the arms, the legs, the trunk, the scalp and the face) will 
be recorded as a percentage of the total BSA, estimating that the surface of the subject’s full, 
flat palm (including the five fingers) corre lates to approximately 1% of the BSA.

Investigator’s Assessment of the Extent of Scalp Psoriasis 
A baseline assessment of the extent of scalp psoriasis as percentage of the total scalp area will 
be done at SV2 and Visit 1, estimating that the surface of the subjec t’s full, flat palm 
(including the five fingers) correlates to  approximately 25% of the scalp area. 
 
Investigator’s assessment of the extent and sev erity of clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris 
(Redness, Thickness, Scaliness) 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5 and early withdrawal (if applicable), th e (sub) investigator will make 
assessments of the extent and severity of clinical signs of the subject’s  psoriasis on specific 
areas of the body in terms of three clinical  signs: redness, thickne ss and scaliness.  
 
The extent  of psoriatic involvement will be recorded for each of the four areas: head*, 
arms**, trunk*** and legs**** using the following scale: 
0  =  no involvement 1  =  < 10% 
2  =  10 - 29% 
3  =  30 - 49% 
4  =  50 - 69% 
5  =  70 - 89% 
6  =  90 - 100% 
 
*) head includes the neck  **) arms include hands 
***) trunk includes flexures 
****) legs include buttocks and feet 
 
The severity  of the psoriatic lesions in each of the f our areas will be recorded for each of the 
signs of redness, thickness and scaliness. For ea ch clinical sign, a single score, reflecting the 
average severity of all psoriatic lesions on the given body region, will be determined 
according to the scale below:  
 
Redness 
0 = none (no erythema) 
1 = mild (faint erythema, pink to very light red) 
2 = moderate (definite light red erythema) 3 = severe (dark red erythema)  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 67 of 123
  
 4 = very severe (very dark red erythema) 
 
Thickness 
0 = none (no plaque elevation) 
1 = mild (slight, barely perceptible elevation) 
2 = moderate (definite elevation but not thick) 
3 = severe (definite elevation, thick plaque with sharp edge) 
4 = very severe (very thic k plaque with sharp edge) 
 
Scaliness 
0 = none (no scaling) 
1 = mild (sparse, fine-scale lesions, only partially covered) 
2 = moderate (coarser scales , most of lesions covered) 
3 = severe (entire lesion co vered with coarse scales) 
4 = very severe (very thick co arse scales, possibly fissured) 
 
PASI is calculated using the formula given be low based on the Investigator’s assessment of 
the extent and severity of the disease locally (head, trunk, arms, legs). 
The following formula will be used to calculate the P ASI: 
 
Head 0.1 (R + T + S)E = W Arms 0.2 (R + T + S)E = X 
Trunk 0.3 (R + T + S)E = Y 
Legs 0.4 (R + T + S)E = Z 
 Where: R = score for redness; T = score for thickness; S = score for scaliness; E = 
score for extent  
The sum of W+X + Y + Z gives the total P ASI, which can range from 0 to 72.  
 
10.8.3.2  Subject Assessments 
The subjects will make the following clinical assessments: 
Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Seve rity – Scalp Psoriasis and Body Psoriasis 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5, and early withdrawal  (if applicable), the subject will make a global 
assessment of the disease severity of scalp psor iasis and body psoriasis (separately) by use of 
the 5-point scale below.   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 68 of 123
  
  
The assessment will be based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not 
in relation to the conditio n at a previous visit. 
 
The qualified site staff person will explain the categories of the scale to the subject and the 
subject will tell the qualified site staff person which category to tick. This assessment must be 
made prior to the investigator’s assessments. 
Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity Scale 
Clear No psoriasis symptoms at all 
Very mild Very slight psoriasis symptoms, does not interfere with daily life 
Mild Slight psoriasis symptoms, interferes with daily life only 
occasionally 
Moderate Definite psoriasis symptoms, interferes with daily life frequently 
Severe Intense psoriasis symptoms, interferes or restricts daily life very frequently 
 
Note : Subjects with disease severit y classified as “Clear” or “Very Mild” disease after the 
treatment period will be rated as having “Controlled disease”. 
Patient’s Assessment of Itch and Sleep 
At SV2 and Visits 1 to 5 and early withdrawal (if applicable), subjects will complete the itch 
and sleep questionnaire consisting of three questions (Appendix V ).  Subjects will be asked to 
rate the intensity of their itc h and sleep loss during the last  24 hours by marking a line on the 
scale. 
10.8.3.3  Imaging Assessments 
Not Applicable 
10.8.4  Laboratory Assessments 
10.8.4.1  Central Analysis  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 69 of 123
  
 Samples for analysis of the parameters listed below will be taken as scheduled in the 
flowchart (cf. 10.8.1) or at early withdrawal from the treatment period of the study. 
 It is recommended that indwelling catheters in troduced under topical anaesthesia are used for 
the repeated blood sampling, to minimise discomfort for the subject, unless the 
(sub)investigator judges that th ere are reasons for not doing it. 
 A 6.5 ml sample of venous blood and a 30 ml spot urine sample will be taken at SV2, Visit 3 
and Visit 5. The 6.5 ml sample of blood will consist of 2 ml for haematology analysis, 2.5 ml for serum biochemistry analysis and 2 ml for analysis of plasma parathyroid hormone. The 
samples will be taken before the ACTH-challenge test that is also scheduled for these visits 
(for U.S. only). Measurement of serum cortisol concentration will be included in the 
biochemistry analysis, and this value will be the baseline serum cortisol concentration for the 
ACTH-challenge test. 
 At Visit 3, a 12mL (2 x 6 mL) blood sample  will be taken for pharmacokinetic analysis. 
 Prior to SV2, Visit 3 and Visit 5, subjects will co llect 24 hour urine. It is allowed to collect the 
24-hour urinary sample up to three days prior to the study visit.  
The Central Laboratory will provide the materials and instructions necessary for the collection 
and transport of the samples.   
 
The following analyses will be performed on the blood samples: 
 Haematology
 
Haemoglobin Haematocrit 
Red blood cell (RBC) count 
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 
White blood cell (WBC) count, including differential count 
Platelet count  
Serum/plasma Biochemistry
 
Cortisol Urea Creatinine  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 70 of 123
  
 Albumin 
Sodium 
Potassium 
Chloride 
Calcium 
Phosphate 
Parathyroid hormone (plasma)  
 
Urinalysis  
The following will be analysed quantita tively in the collec ted 24 hour urine: 
Calcium 
Phosphate 
Creatinine 
Vo l u me  
 The following analyses will be performed on the spot urine sample by dipstick test: 
Glucose 
Ketones 
 
The laboratory will also report: 
Albumin-corrected serum calcium in mmol/l using the formula: 
serum calcium (total) in mmol/l + (0.02 x [40-serum albumin in g/l]) 
 
For the 24 hour urine sample the following will be calculated: 
Total calcium excretion 
Total phosphate excretion 
Total creatinine excretion 
Calcium: creatinine ratio 
Phosphate: creatinine ratio 
 
If any laboratory results are a bnormal, the (sub)inve stigator should follo w-up the subject as 
clinically appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
 
A 12 mL (2 x 6mL) blood sample for PK analysis will be collected Visit 3 prior to the application of investigational pr oduct on the date of the visit. 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 71 of 123
  
 A blood sample (2 x 6mL) for pharmacokinetic ev aluation will be drawn at Visit 3 (4 weeks 
of treatment) prior to the application of LEO  80185 on the day of the visit.  Validated 
bioanalytical assays will be used for quantification of calcipot riol, betamethasone 
dipropionate and the metabolites MC1080 and be tamethasone 17-propionate in the plasma 
sample. Full details for taking, storing and shipping the samples for PK analysis will be 
provided separately.  
 
ACTH Challenge test  
The ACTH-challenge test will be performed at SV2, Visit 3 and Visit 5. If the subject withdraws prior to completing treatme nt, the ACTH-challenge test should not be performed at 
early withdrawal.    
If the result of the ACTH-challenge test at Visit 3 or Visit 5 shows a serum cortisol 
concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes after the AC TH-challenge, a further ACTH-challenge 
test is required 28 days later at visit FU2. If the results of the ACTH-challenge test at Visit 
FU2 continue to show a serum cortisol concentration ≤ 18mcg/dl at 30 minutes after ACTH-
challenge, further ACTH-challenge  tests should be performed, but  not more often than at 4-
weekly intervals, until the adrenal suppression resolves (i.e., serum cortisol concentration 
>18mcg/dl at 30 minutes after the ACTH-challenge).  
The following procedures should be performed pr ior to the ACTH-challenge tests at SV2 and 
Visit 3 and 5: Blood pressure/heart rate m easurement, blood/urine sampling for central 
laboratory analysis (haematology/biochemistry/uri nalysis) and urine pregnancy test (in female 
subjects of child-bearing potential).    
To perform the ACTH-challenge test, a 2.5 ml sample of venous blood will be drawn at 08.00 
a.m. ±30 minutes. This sample is also the one on which the biochemistry analyses are performed, as detailed above. After this, CORTROSYN® is injected, as described in Section  
10.7. Two further 2.5 ml samples of venous bl ood will be drawn exactly 30 and 60 minutes 
after the injection (counting from  the end of the period over which the injection is given). 
Serum cortisol concentrations will be determined for each blood sample by the Central Laboratory. 
 
The time of injection and of blood samp ling will be recorded in the CRF.  
 The following blood volumes will be drawn per subject performing HPA axis assessments:  6 ml for Haematology;   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 72 of 123
  
 13.5 ml for Biochemistry  
15 ml for ACTH challenge testing 
12 ml for PK analysis 
Total amount of blood drawn per subj ect, for central analysis: 46.5 ml 
 The following blood volumes will be drawn per subject not performing HPA axis 
assessments:  6 ml for Haematology;  
13.5 ml for Biochemistry  
12 ml for PK analysis 
Total amount of blood drawn per subj ect, for central analysis: 31.5 ml 
 Follow-up testing: 
A 7.5 ml sample will be collected from subjects requiring additional ACTH challenge testing 
at FU2 if HPA-axis suppression is observed at Vi sit 3.  A 2.5 ml sample will be collected from 
subjects at FU1 if laboratory results suggest albumin corrected serum calcium above reference 
range at the last on-treatment visit. 
 
10.8.4.2  Local Analysis 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at the trial site at SV2, Visit 3 and 5, and, if 
applicable, at FU2, in female subjects of child-bearing potential. The test  kits will be provided 
by the Central Laboratory. 
10.8.5  Adverse Events 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or  clinical investigati on subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can ther efore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6 (R1)).  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is a ny untoward medical occurrence that 
 results in death 
 is life-threatening  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 73 of 123
  
  requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of exis ting hospitalisation 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
or  
 other medically important conditions*) 
*) Events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but 
may jeopardise the subject or may require interv ention to prevent one of  the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above. Examples of su ch events are allergic broncospasm, blood 
dyscrasias and convulsions. 
Global Pharmacovigilance, LEO Pharma A/S is re sponsible for the assessment of headquarter 
expectedness according to LEO Pharma A/S procedures. The relevant reference document for 
this clinical trial is Investigator’s Brochure, edition 12 and subsequent updates as agreed between the head of Medical Departme nt, and the medical director, Global 
Pharmacovigilance, LEO Pharma A/S.  
At all visits, the subject will be asked a non-leading question by the investigator: “How have 
you felt since I saw you last?” No specific symptoms will be asked for. If there are no AEs to record, no further questions will be asked and “NO” should be stated. In 
case there are one or more AEs to record, “YES ” should be stated and the investigator will 
record the event term, intensity, duration, suspected causal relationship to the investigational 
product and outcome. 
It is important that the investigator also obs erves the subject for any changes not reported by 
the subject and records these changes. Only medically qualified pe rsonnel must assess AEs. 
10.8.5.1  Reporting of Adverse Events 
Events reported by the subject or observed by th e (sub)investigator and that fall into any of 
the above definitions must be recorded on the adverse event page of the CRF and should be 
described in the following manner: 
 
The nature  of the event will be described in preci se English medical terminology (i.e. not 
necessarily the exact words used by the subjec t). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis 
should be stated (e.g. allergic contact dermatitis).  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 74 of 123
  
  
For cutaneous adverse events the location  must be part of the a dverse event description and 
may be described as either the face, scalp or trunk/limbs. Additionally, the location will be 
described using the following terminology:  
 
 lesional/perilesional ( ≤2 cm from the border of lesion(s)  treated with investigational 
product) or  
 distant  (>2 cm from the lesion border) 
 
The intensity  of the event will be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the investigator’s clinical judgement. 
  Mild: The adverse event does not interfere in  a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level and requi res no medical intervention. 
 Moderate:  The adverse event interferes with th e subject’s normal functioning level and 
may or may not require medical intervention. 
 Severe:  The adverse event produces significant impa irment of the subject’s functioning or 
requires medical intervention. 
 
The duration  of the event will be reported as the start date and stop date of the event. 
 
The causal relation  of the event to the use of the inve stigational product w ill be described in 
terms of probable, possible, not related or  not assessable according to the following: 
 
Probably related 
 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the investigational 
product 
 Could not be reasonably explained by the subj ect’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors or other therapies ad ministered to the subject 
 Follows a known pattern of respons e to the investigational product 
 Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduc tion in dose of the i nvestigationa l product 
 Reappears or worsens upon re-challenge 
 
Possibly related 
 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the investigational 
product  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 75 of 123
  
  Could also be reasonably explained by the subj ect’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors or other therapies ad ministered to the subject 
 Follows a known pattern of respons e to the investigational product 
 
Not related 
 Does not  follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product 
 Is better explained by other factors like the su bject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors or other therapies ad ministered to the subject 
 Does not  follow a known pattern of respons e to the investigational product 
 
Not assessable 
 The adverse event cannot yet be judged otherwise because present information is 
insufficient or contradictory. A final assessm ent (i.e. probably, possibly or not related) 
shall be made as more information becomes available, at the latest when the subject has completed the trial. 
 The outcome  of the event will be classified and handled as follows: 
 
Recovered/resolved The event has stopped. The stop date of the event  
must be recorded. 
Recovering/resolving The subject is clearly recove ring from an event. The 
event is, however, not yet completely resolved. 
Follow-up on the event is required until final 
outcome is established. 
Not recovered/not resolved Event is still ongoing.  
Follow-up on the event is required until final outcome is established. 
Recovered with sequelae The event ha s reached a state where no further 
changes are expected and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke. 
The stop date of the event must be recorded. 
Fatal The subject has died as a consequence of the event.  
Date of death is recorded as stop date for the adverse event.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 76 of 123
  
 Unknown Unknown to investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow-
up. 
 
Once a subject has completed the clinical trial,  the investigator should follow up for outcome 
on all non-serious adverse events classified as possibly/probably related to the investigational 
product or not assessable for 14 ± 2 or until final outcome is determined, whichever comes 
first. 
10.8.5.2  Other Events to Be Reported 
Pregnancy 
Pregnancy which occurs during a clinical tria l with an investigational product must be 
reported to LEO Pharma A/S within one calenda r day of first knowledge using the Pregnancy 
Follow-up Form supplied by LEO Pharma A/S. All pregnancies must be followed up until 
delivery or termination. 
Please also confer with chapter 10.5, withdrawal criteria. 
Overdose 
Any overdose defined as any higher dose than pres cribed for the individual subject must be 
reported on the adverse event form of the CRF book. AEs originating in the overdose must be 
documented on a separate line. 
Aggravation of condition 
Any clinically significant aggr avation/exacerbation/worsening of the initially treated 
condition compared to baseline, judged by an overa ll medical assessment, must be reported as 
an AE. 
10.8.6  Serious Adverse Events 
10.8.6.1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), related or unr elated to the investig ational product or any 
trial procedure after signature of the Inform ed Consent Form must be reported to LEO 
Pharma A/S on the (paper) Serious Adverse Event Form – Clinical Trial  within 24 hours .  
Note:   Planned hospitalisation or planned prol onged hospitalisation do not  fulfil the criteria 
for being an SAE. The elective nature of th e event must be clearly documented in the 
subject’s medical record.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 77 of 123
  
 SAEs must be reported on the a dverse event form of the CRF book. Additionally reports must 
be made using the paper Serious Adverse Event Form – Clinical Trial, supplied by LEO 
Pharma A/S. Apart from the assessment of the intensity, causal relationship to the investiga-
tional product(s) and/or trial pr ocedures, the action taken and th e outcome to date, this report 
must contain a comprehensive narrative desc ription of the course of the event.

The IRB(s)/IEC(s), regulatory authorities a nd concerned investigator s will be notified of 
SAEs according to current regulation and local requirements. 
All Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse R eactions (SUSARs) are subject to expedited 
reporting to regulatory authorities.   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 78 of 123
  
 SAEs must be followed indefinitely until a final outcome has been established, i.e. the follow-
up may continue beyond the e nd of the clinical trial. 
10.8.7  Source Data 
Source data: All information in original  records and certified copies  of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activitie s in a clinical trial necessary for the recon-
struction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copies).  (ICH E6, 1.51). 
Source documents:  Original documents, data, and record s (e.g., hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, s ubjects diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data fr om automated instruments, copies or 
transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-ra ys, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico-techni cal departments involv ed in the clinical 
trial).  (ICH E6, 1.52). 
Source Data Verification (SDV) is a key function in assuring the sponsor that clinical trial 
information is recorded and handled in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation 
and verification. Monitors will, during the c onduct of the clinical trial, perform SDV to 
confirm the accuracy and completeness of CRFs by verifying selected (as specified below) 
data recorded in the CRF against data recorded  in source documents to ensure such records 
are consistent.  
To enable SDV , it is essential that what constitutes source data/documents (see definition 
above) for the clinical trial data to be collected  in the CRF as well as where such data can be 
found at the trial site is establ ished and agreed with the inves tigator at each trial site and 
documented prior to initiation of the clinical trial.  
Source data cannot be entered dire ctly into the CRF. Source data should as a general rule be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record or ot her defined document norma lly used at the trial 
site. Source data may be entered on a worksheet on ly if the clinical trial requires capture of 
data, which are normally not part of the subject’s medical record. 
For this clinical trial,  the following parameters collected in  the CRF should be verifiable from 
source documents available at the trial site: 
 Date of trial visits and date leaving the clinical trial 
 Relevant medical hi story and diagnosis  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 79 of 123
  
  Nature of contraception used  by the subj ect and result of pregnancy test(s), when 
applicable 
 Data for evaluation of eligibility criteria 
 Dispensation/administration of investigational product 
 Concomitant medication (incl uding changes) and diagnoses 
 Subject demographics (sex, date of birth) 
 Adverse events, (nature, dates) 
In addition to the above, the following should be added to the subject’ s medical record in 
chronological order, i.e. when th ese are allocated to the subject: 
 Date(s) of conducting the informed consent pro cess including date of  provision of subject 
information 
 Date of enrolment 
 CRF book number 
 The fact that the subject is part icipating in a clinical trial in psoriasis with a treatment arm 
of calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g gel for up to 8 weeks. 
After un-blinding the clinical trial, the inves tigators will be notified of the actual treatment 
allocation and be asked to record this in the subject’s medical record.

10.11  Statistical Analysis 
10.11.1  Subject Qualification for Analysis 
All subjects enrolled into the trial (i.e., si gned informed consent obtained and a CRF number 
assigned) will be accounted for in the clinical study report. 
 
All subjects who apply any IP will be include d in the full analysis set and analysed for 
efficacy. Exclusion from the full analysis set wi ll be carefully consid ered for subjects who 
apply no IP or who provide no efficacy data following start of treatment. 
 All subjects who apply any IP and for whom th e presence or confirmed absence of adverse 
events is available will be included in the safety analysis set and analysed for safety, except 
the analysis of the results from the ACTH-challenge test. 
 
For the analysis of the results from the ACTH-challenge test a per protocol analysis set will be 
defined by including the subjects performing HPA axis assessments from the full analysis set, 
however excluding the subjects who do not: 
 apply any IP   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 81 of 123
  
  meet the inclusion criterion concerning evidence of adrenal function at baseline 
 provide any results for the ACTH-c hallenge test after receiving IP 
 
The decisions regarding inclusion/exclusion of subjects and/or subject data from the trial 
analysis sets will be documented in the clinical study report. 
10.11.2  Reasons for Leaving the Trial 
The reasons for leaving the trial will be presen ted separately for subjects who apply any IP 
and for enrolled subjects not assigned to treatment. 
10.11.3  Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics of demographics and othe r baseline characteristics will be presented for 
all subjects in the safety analysis set and per protocol analysis set as these are the datasets 
used for primary response criteria. 
 
Demographics include age, sex, ethnicity, race  and skin type. Other baseline characteristics 
include duration of psoriasis vulgaris, physical examination, i nvestigator’s global assessment 
of disease severity on body , PASI (calculated from the investigator’s assessment of extent and 
severity of the clinical signs) , investigator’s  assessment of extent of psoriasis (BSA and 
scalp) , patient’s global assessment of diseas e severity on body, concomitant medication and 
concurrent diagnoses. 
 
Age and sex will also be presented by centre. 
10.11.4  Compliance 
Compliance with treatment instructions will be  tabulated for all subjects who apply any IP. 
The number and percentage of subjects who comply and who do not comply with the trial 
treatment regimen will be summarised. The ex tent of non-compliance as categories of the 
percentage of applications missed (e.g. ≤  10%, > 10 to 20%, etc.) wi ll also be presented. 
10.11.5  Analysis of Safety 
The analysis of safety will be based on the safety analysis set according to the defined response criteria, except the analysis of the re sults from the ACTH-challenge test which will 
be based on the per protocol analysis set. 
10.11.5.1  Adverse Events  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 82 of 123
  
 Adverse events will be coded in accordance with the current version of the MedDRA 
dictionary. 
 
All adverse events recorded during the course of the trial will be included in the subject data 
listings. An event will be considered emergent w ith the trial treatment if it started after the 
first application of the investig ational product or if it started before this and increased in 
intensity after the first application of investigational product. The tabulations described below 
will only include the events that are emergent with the trial treatment. 
 
The number of subjects experiencing each type of adverse event (according to MedDRA 
Preferred Terms within Primary System Organ Cl ass) will be tabulated regardless of the 
number of times each adverse event is reported by each subject.   
An overview summary of the number of subjec ts with any adverse events, adverse drug 
reactions, lesional/perilesional adverse events, serious advers e events and adverse events 
leading to withdrawal from the trial will be produced.  
The causal relationship to IP for each type of adverse event (according to the Preferred Term) 
will be tabulated. Where there are several record ings of causal relationship to IP for a given 
type of adverse event, causal relationship will be taken as the most-related recording from the 
last report of that adverse event, since that is  when the investigator will be in possession of 
most information and so best able  to judge causal relationship.  
 The intensity for each type of adverse even t (according to the Preferred Term) will be 
presented. Where there are several recordings of  intensity for a given type of adverse event 
the most severe intensity will be selected.  
 
Adverse drug reactions are defined as advers e events for which the investigator has not 
described the causal relationship to IP as “not related”. The number of subjects experiencing 
each type of adverse drug reaction (according to the Preferred Term) will be tabulated. The 
intensity for each type of adverse drug reaction will be presented.   
The number of subjects experiencing each type of lesional/perilesional adverse event, 
lesional/perilesional adverse event on the body and lesional/perilesional adverse event on the 
scalp (according to the Preferred Term) will be tabulated.   

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 83 of 123
  
 Serious adverse events and adverse events lead ing to withdrawal from the trial will be 
evaluated separately, and a narr ative for each will be given. 
10.11.5.2  ACTH-Challenge Test 
The following percentages will be calculated: 
 Percentage of subjects with a serum cortisol concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at 30 minutes 
after ACTH-challenge at Week 4 and at Week 8. 
 Percentage of subjects with a serum cortisol concentration ≤18 mcg/dl at both 30 and 
60 minutes after ACTH-challenge at Week 4 and at Week 8. 
 
The serum cortisol concentration at time 0 (just before the ACTH challenge) and at 30 and 60 
minutes after ACTH-challenge at baseline (SV2),  Week 4 and Week 8, respectively, will be 
summarised for the per protocol analysis set.  
The serum cortisol concentration at time 0 (just before the ACTH challenge) and at 30 and 60 
minutes after ACTH-challenge and also the ch ange in serum cortisol from time 0 to 30 
minutes and 60 minutes recorded at baseline (S V2), Week 4, Week 8 and FU2 respectively, 
will be listed for each subject with a value ≤18 mcg/dl at either 30 or  60 minutes after ACTH-
challenge for the per protocol analysis set. Values ≤ 18 mcg/dl at 30 or 60 minutes after 
ACTH-challenge will be flagged. 
10.11.5.3  Exposure 
The duration of exposure (weeks) and extent of exposure (subject-treatment-weeks) to IP will 
be summarised. 
10.11.5.4  Drug Accountability 
The amount of IP used (g) and the average weekly amount of IP used (g) will be summarized 
for three different treatment periods (first f our weeks, second four weeks and the total 
treatment period). 
10.11.5.5  Laboratory Examinations 
For the haematology, biochemistry and urinalys is parameters except the urinary glucose and 
ketones, the absolute value by visit and the chan ge from baseline (SV2) to Week 4 and Week 
8 will be summarised. In addition, the values will be categorised as “low”, “normal” or “high” 
depending on whether they are below, within or above the laboratory reference range, 
respectively. Shift tables will be produced show ing the categories at baseline (SV2) against 
those at Week 4 and Week 8. 
  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 84 of 123
  
 For the urinary calcium:creatinine ratio, the 95%  confidence interval of mean change from 
baseline to Week 4 and Week 8 will also be presented. 
 
For the albumin-corrected serum calcium and 24- hour urinary calcium excretion, the end of 
treatment values and the change from baseline to end of treatment will also be summarised 
and the 95% confidence interval of mean change from baseline to Week 4 and Week 8 and 
end of treatment will be presented. For these two parameters the end of treatment category 
will also be included in the shift tables. 
 
The albumin-corrected serum calcium and 24-hour urinary calcium will be listed by visit for 
all subjects with any of these values out of reference range at  any visit. Values outside the 
reference range will be flagged.  
For the urinary glucose and ketones, the values  will be categorised by visit as absent or 
present. Shift tables will be  produced showing the presence/absence at baseline (SV2) against 
presence/absence at Week 4 and Week 8.  
The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion will be presented also for the subjects with complete 
urinary collection. A 24-hour urin ary collection is considered incomplete if it is either 
reported to be incomplete by the subject or if the creatinine excretion is below 0.1 mmol per kg body weight as proposed by Remer et al (32 ). 
10.11.5.6  Other Observations 
PK evaluation 
The plasma concentrations above the lower li mit of quantification will be presented. 
Vital signs For systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hear t rate, the absolute va lue by visit and change 
from baseline (SV2) to Week 4 and Week 8 will be summarised.  
 
Clinically significant abnormalities in the vital signs  at baseline (SV2), Week 4 and/or Week 8 
will be presented. Any abnormalities at Week 4 and/or Week 8 that were not present at baseline will be highlighted. 
10.11.6  Analysis of Efficacy 
The statistical analysis of efficacy will be ba sed on the full analysis set according to the 
defined response criteria.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 85 of 123
  
  
The percentage of subjects who achieve “Controlled disease” according to the investigator’s 
global assessment of disease severity on the body will be presented by visit and at end of 
treatment. The 95% confidence interval (CI) which is based on a binomial distribution will be 
presented for the proportion of subjects with  “Controlled disease” at  end of treatment.  
 The percentage of subjects who achieve “Controlled disease” according to the investigator’s 
global assessment of disease severity on the body at end of treatment will  also be tabulated by 
age-group, sex, centre and baseline disease seve rity according to the investigator’s assessment 
of body psoriasis.  
 
The percentage change in PASI from baseline to each visit and to end of treatment will be 
summarised. The 95% CI for mean percentage change in PASI based on a normal distribution 
will be calculated for end of treatment. 
 The percentage of subjects who achieve “Controlled disease” according to the patient’s global 
assessment of disease severity on the body will be presented by visit and at end of treatment. 
The 95% CI based on a binomial distribution will  be calculated for th e proportion of subjects 
with “Controlled disease” at end of treatment.  
The percentage of subjects who achieve “Controlled disease” according to the investigator’s 
global assessment of disease severity on the scalp will be presented by visit and at end of 
treatment.  
 
The percentage of subjects who achieve “Controlled disease” according to the patient’s global 
assessment of disease severity on the scalp will be  presented by visit and at  end of treatment.  
 The investigator’s global assessment of disease severity on the body and on the scalp, PASI 
and patient’s global assessment of disease severity on the body and on the scalp will be 
summarised by visit and at end of treatment.  
Patient’s assessment of itching and sleep will be summarised by visit and at end of treatment. 
In addition, the change from baseline to each visit and end of treatment will be summarised. 
10.11.7  General Principles 
Categorical data will be summa rised using the number and per centage of subjects in each 
category. Continuous data will be summarised using the mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum and maximum values.  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 86 of 123
  
  
All confidence intervals will be two-sided a nd presented with 95% degree of confidence, 
unless otherwise stated.   
The data recorded during the course of the tria l will be presented in individual data listings, 
according to ICH E3.  
For tabulations on changes from baseline, baseline will be defined as the last assessment 
performed before application of IP. 
 
The end of treatment value for a particular parameter will be defined as the last value 
recorded for that parameter up to and includ ing Visit 5 (Week 8). However, for laboratory 
parameters this will be the last value recorded after baseline (SV2) up to and including Visit 5.  
 All efficacy data will be tabulated by visit using an observed cases approach (i.e. involving 
only those subjects who attended each specific visit) except for the tabulation of end of 
treatment values.   
All laboratory data will be tabulated by visit using an observed cases approach except for the 
tabulation of end of treatment values which will be presented for the primary response criteria.  
10.12  Trial Committees 
LEO 80185 gel has obtained marketing authorisa tion in 2008 and has been marketed in the 
U.S., several European countries and more th an 40 other countries worldwide, including 
Canada and Australia. The clinical trial programme for LEO 80185 gel has so far included 
more than 6000 psoriasis patients, of whom  more than 3000 were treated with LEO 80185 
gel. LEO 80185 gel has since launch in 2008 to  December 2012, been prescribed for 
approximately 4.8 million treatment courses.  
Two non-controlled trials, MBL 0801 and MBL 0412 INT, in adolescent subjects (aged 12-
17 years) with psoriasis on the scalp have recently been completed. In a total of 
109 adolescent subjects using up to 69 g/week , LEO gel was safe and effective in the 
treatment of psoriasis vulgari s on the scalp.  The effects on calcium metabolism were 
investigated; no cases of hypercalcaemia and no clin ically relevant changes in urinary calcium 
were reported. The adrenal response to ACTH  challenge was assessed in a subset of 30 
patients; one patient showed a decrease in cort isol response to ACTH challenge after 4 weeks 
of treatment which was considered mild ( 7) (8).  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 87 of 123
  
 In this trial, patients 12-14 years with a BSA of ≤ 1.3 m2 will receive up to 50 g/week.  
Patients 12-14 years with a BSA > 1.3 m2  and patients 15-16 years, 11 months with a BSA ≤ 
1.7 m2 will receive up to 75 g/week.  Patients 15- 16 years, 11 months with a BSA > 1.7 m2 
will receive up to 100 g/week.  The maximum approved dose in adults is 100g/week. 
The use of CORTROSYN® in this trial will be entirely in  keeping with the licensed conditions 
for use as described in the U.S. Prescribing Information, therefore its use in this trial is also 
not expected to reveal any new safety findings. 
It is hence not considered necessary to have a Data Monitoring Committee for this trial. 
10.13  Quality Assurance/Audit 
LEO Pharma A/S has implemented a system of quality assurance, including all elements 
described in this protocol. Within this sy stem company Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) are implemented to ensu re that clinical trials are conducted in compliance with 
regulatory requirements and Good C linical Practice (GCP). Qualit y control is applied to each 
stage of data handling to ensure that data are accurate, reliable and processed correctly. 
Trial sites, facilities, laboratories and all da ta (including sources) and documentation must be 
available for GCP audit by LEO Pharma A/S or inspection by competent authorities. Any aspect of the clinical tria l may be subject to audit by LEO Pharma A/S and/or inspection 
by regulatory authorities (national or foreign) or IEC/IRB. Such audits/inspections may take 
place at the sponsor’s site(s) or at any trial site including laboratories, pharmacies etc. 
The monitor will, in case of audit, announce this  in advance to the (sub)investigator and be 
present at the particular trial site during the audit. 
The site staff should assist in all aspects of audit/inspection. 
10.13.1  Trial Monitoring 
LEO Pharma A/S, as sponsor of this clinical tr ial, is responsible to the regulatory authorities 
for assuring the proper conduct of the clinical trial with regard  to protocol adherence and 
validity of the data recorded in the CRFs. The company has therefore assigned persons to 
monitor this trial. Their duties are to serve as  the principal link between (sub)investigators and  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 88 of 123
  
 LEO Pharma A/S and advise the investigator on the collection and maintenance of accurate, 
complete, legible, well organised and easily retrievable data for the clinical trial. In addition, 
they will explain to the investig ators any aspect of the (conduct of  the) clinical trial, including 
interpretation of the protocol , the purpose of colle cting the specified data and reporting 
responsibilities. 
In order to perform their role effectively, m onitors and persons involved in quality assurance 
and inspections (see above) will need direct access  to primary subject data, e.g. medical 
records, laboratory reports, appointment books etc. Because this aff ects the subject’s confi-
dentiality, this fact is included on the Subject  Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form. 
This clinical trial is organised by LEO Pharma  A/S and all enquiries should be made to a 
member of LEO Pharma A/S staff (see section [ 6.3], LEO Pharma A/S Personnel).  
10.14  Case Report Form Books and Data Handling 
10.14.1  Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
In this clinical trial data will be collected  by means of Remote Data Capture (RDC). The 
investigator or staff authorised by the investigat or will enter subject data into electronic CRFs 
designed by LEO Pharma A/S. A uniquely numbe red CRF book will be used for each subject 
enrolled. Data recorded in the electronic CRFs will be accessible to site staff through a secure 
internet connection immediately after entry. The CRFs must be maintained in an up-to-date 
condition at all times by the investigator.  
The investigator, or sub-inves tigator(s) authorised by the investigator, will electronically sign 
all sections of CRFs used. This signature information (incl. date of signature) will be kept in 
the audit trail and cannot be altered. Only me dically qualified (sub)inve stigators can sign data 
on clinical assessments/safety. A ny correction(s) made by the inve stigator or authorised site 
staff to the CRF after original entry will be documented in the audit trail. Changes to data 
already approved, requires the re-s ignature of the investigator or  authorised staff. The person 
making the change and the date, time and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail.  
The trial monitor will check the CRFs for accur acy and completeness and perform source data 
verification preferably no late r than eight weeks after each subject visit. For archiving 
purposes each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the CRFs, for all subjects enrolled  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 89 of 123
  
 at the trial site, via an electronic medium at completion of the trial. Audit trail information 
will be included. CRFs will be available for in spection by authorised representatives from 
LEO Pharma A/S (e.g. audit by the quality assura nce department), from regulatory authorities 
and/or IEC/IRBs. 
10.14.2  Data Handling 
Subject data should be entered in to the electronic CRF in a ti mely manner by authorised site 
staff. Data will be entered by site staff and systematic data validation will be performed 
through the discrepancy management system with in the data collection software. Queries for 
discrepant data may be generated automati cally by the system upon entry or generated 
manually by the monitor or the study data mana ger. All queries, whether generated by the 
system or by a user, will be in an electronic form at. This systematic validation will ensure that 
a clean and consistent database is provided prior to the statisti cal analysis being performed.  
10.15  Protocol Amendments 
Neither the investigator(s) nor LEO Pharma A/S will change the Clinical Study Protocol 
without written agreement between LEO Pharma A/S and the international co-ordinating 
investigator. Any modification considered substantial requires approva l/favourable opinion by 
the appropriate regulatory authority and IEC/IRB. 
Protocol amendments are issued as Consolid ated Clinical Study Protocols comprising all 
current amendments. Consolidated Clinical Study Protocols become effective when written 
approval has been provided by the international co-ordinating investigator, the head of 
Medical Department and the head of Biostatis tics and Data Management, LEO Pharma A/S, 
and approval/favourable opinion from regulatory authorities and/or IEC/IRB has been obtained, as required. 
Alternatively, a protocol addendum may be issu ed to comply with national/regional specific 
requirements. A protocol addendum becomes effective when written approval has been 
provided by the international co-o rdinating investigator, the head  of Medical Department and 
the head of Biostatistics and Data Ma nagement, LEO Pharma A/S, and the and 
approval/favourable opinion from the relevant regulatory authorities and/or IEC/IRB has been 
obtained, as required. 
10.16  Completion of Trial 
10.16.1  Trial Completion Procedures  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 90 of 123
  
 End of trial should be defined. In most cases this will be the date of the last subject’s last visit 
in each participating country and overall (all countries).  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease. 
Trial enrolment will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for 
the clinical trial has been obt ained, irrespective of the specific site’s planned inclusion 
number. 
Upon completion of the clinical  trial, LEO Pharma A/S will undertake arrangements for 
collection and disposal of any unused trial materi al that the investigator  is not required to 
keep in his/her files. 
LEO Pharma A/S may stop the clinical trial pr ematurely after consultation with the interna-
tional co-ordinating investigator, e.g. if the subjec t recruitment is so slow that the clinical trial 
cannot be completed within a reasonable time frame. Such premature termination/suspension 
of the trial will be notified to regulator y authorities and IECs/IRBs, as required. 
10.16.2  Provision for Subject Care Following Trial Completion 
After the completion of the trial, the subjects wi ll be treated at the inve stigator’s discretion or 
referred to other physician(s) a ccording to sta ndard practice. 
10.16.3  Archiving of Trial Documents 
The investigator at each trial site must make arrangements to store th e essential trial docu-
ments, (as defined in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6, 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice)) including the Investigator Trial File, until LEO Pharma 
A/S informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained. 
In addition, the investigator is  responsible for the archiving of  all relevant source documents 
so that the trial data can be compared against source data after completion of the trial (e.g. in 
case of inspection from regulatory authorities). 
The investigator is required to ensure the c ontinued storage of the documents, even if the 
investigator, for example, leaves the clinic/pract ice or retires before the end of the required 
storage period. 
At present according to ICH Guideline:  

LP0076-1017  17-Apr-2013 Page 91 of 123
  
 Essential documents should be retained until  at least 2 years after last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or at  least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical d evelopment of the investigati onal product. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period however  if required by the applicable regulatory 
requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to 
inform the investiga-tor/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained . (ICH E6, 4.9.5)

and international health a nd medicines authorities accord ing to national and interna-
tional law on reporting of adverse events in clinical trials. 
2. Only data required in the specific s ituation concerned may be disclosed. 
3. The data may be disclosed to the recipient only in a form that does not identify indi-
vidual persons. It must thus not be possible for the recipient on the basis of the received 
data alone to identify the persons related to the data. 
4. The Company shall at any time be able to ve rify to the Data Protection Agency which 
transfers of data have been made. 
 
AUTHORISATION to transfer personal da ta to third countries 
In connection with its notification the Company has applied for authorisation to transfer 
personal data to third countries. The company wish es to transfer data for the purpose of data 
processing to be carried out by named data processors in third countries. 
Furthermore, the Company wishes to transfer data to health and medicines authorities in third 
countries to comply with these countries’ law on reporting of adverse events in clinical trials 
and in connection with applications for a marketing authorization. 
According to Section 50(2) of Act on Processing of  Personal Data, transfer of sensitive data to 
third countries can take place with the authoris ation of the Data Protection Agency. According 
to section 50 (5), the Data Protection Agency  may lay down more detailed conditions for the 
carrying out of the processing operations for reasons of protecti on of the privacy of the data 
subject in question. 
The Data Protection Agency hereby grants authorisation to transfer data to third

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, He lsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 
the: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983 
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989

added) 55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008 A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has deve loped the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, 
including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should not be applied without considerat ion of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Although the Declaration is a ddressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages 
other participants in medical  research involving human subj ects to adopt these princi-
ples. 
3. It is the duty of the physicia n to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including 
those who are involved in medical resear ch. The physician's knowledge and conscience 
are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 106 of 123
  
 4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA bi nds the physician with the words, "The 
health of my patient will be my first c onsideration," and the In ternational Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician sh all act in the patient's best interest when 
providing medical care." 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
6. In medical research involving human subjects , the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests. 
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is  to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseas es and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments ). Even the best current 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effective-
ness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research , most interventions involve risks and bur-
dens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly 
vulnerable and need special protection. Thes e include those who cannot give or refuse 
consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influ-
ence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, le gal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as  applicable interna-
tional norms and standards. No national or in ternational ethical, legal or regulatory re-
quirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for re search subjects set 
forth in this Declaration. 
 
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of phys icians who participate in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self-deter mination, privacy, and c onfidentiality of per-
sonal information of research subjects.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 107 of 123
  
 12. Medical research involving hum an subjects must conform to generally accepted scien-
tific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scie ntific literatu re, other rel-
evant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal ex-
perimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in th e conduct of medical research that may 
harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research  study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described in a research  protocol. The protocol shoul d contain a statement of the 
ethical considerations involved and should indi cate how the principles in this Declara-
tion have been addressed. The protocol s hould include information regarding funding, 
sponsors, institutional affiliations, other poten tial conflicts of inte rest, incentives for 
subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a 
consequence of participation in the resear ch study. The protocol should describe ar-
rangements for post-study access by study subject s to interventions identified as bene-
ficial in the study or access to ot her appropriate care or benefits. 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to a research ethics committee be fore the study begins. This committee must 
be independent of the resear cher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must 
take into consideration the la ws and regulations of the country or countries in which 
the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards 
but these must not be allowed to reduce or e liminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. Th e committee must have the right to monitor on-
going studies. The researcher must provide  monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any serious a dverse events. No change to the protocol 
may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. 
16. Medical research involving human subject s must be conducted only by individuals 
with the appropriate scientific training and qualifications. Research on patients or 
healthy volunteers requ ires the supervision of a compet ent and appropriately qualified 
physician or other health care professional.  The responsibility for the protection of 
research subjects must always rest with th e physician or other health care professional 
and never the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a di sadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is 
only justified if the research is responsive to  the health needs and priorities of this pop-
ulation or community and if there is a reasonab le likelihood that th is population or 
community stands to benefit from the results of the research.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 108 of 123
  
 18. Every medical research study involving huma n subjects must be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burden s to the individuals and communities in-
volved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other in-
dividuals or communities affected by the condition under investigation. 
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in  a publicly accessible database before recruit-
ment of the first subject. 
20. Physicians may not participate in a res earch study involving hu man subjects unless 
they are confident that the ri sks involved have been adequa tely assessed and can be sat-
isfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive 
and beneficial results. 
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance 
of the objective outweighs the inherent risk s and burdens to the research subjects. 
22. Participation by competent individuals as subj ects in medical research must be volun-
tary. Although it may be appropriate to cons ult family members or community leaders, 
no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees. 
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on 
their physical, mental and social integrity. 
24. In medical research involving competent hum an subjects, each potential subject must 
be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible 
conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits 
and potential risks of the study and the discom fort it may entail, a nd any other relevant 
aspects of the study. The potential subject must  be informed of the right to refuse to 
participate in the study or to withdraw c onsent to participate at any time without 
reprisal. Special attention should be give n to the specific information needs of 
individual potential subjects as  well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician 
or another ap-propriately qualified individua l must then seek the potential subject's 
freely-given in-formed consent, preferably  in writing. If the consent cannot be 
expressed in writing, the non-written cons ent must be formally documented and 
witnessed.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 109 of 123
  
 25. For medical research using identifiable hum an material or data, physicians must nor-
mally seek consent for the collection, analysis , storage and/or reuse. There may be situ-
ations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or 
would pose a threat to the validity of the res earch. In such situations the research may 
be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. 
26. When seeking informed consent for partic ipation in a research study the physician 
should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under dures s. In such situations the informed con-
sent should be sought by an appropriately qu alified individual who is completely inde-
pendent of this relationship. 
27. For a potential research subj ect who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed 
consent from the legally authorized represen tative. These individua ls must not be in-
cluded in a research study th at has no likelihood of benef it for them unless it is intend-
ed to promote the health of the population represented by the potential subject, the re-
search cannot instead be perf ormed with competent persons, and the research entails 
only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed  incompetent is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in 
addition to the consent of the legally author ized representative. The potential subject's 
dissent should be respected. 
29. Research involving subjects who are physica lly or mentally incapable of giving 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental 
condition that prevents giving informed cons ent is a necessary characteristic of the 
research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If  no such representative is available and if 
the research cannot be delayed, the st udy may proceed without informed consent 
provided that the specific r easons for involving subjects w ith a condition that renders 
them unable to give informed consent have b een stated in the research protocol and the 
study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possibl e from the subject or a legally authorized 
repre-sentative.

 30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethi cal obligations with regard to the publica-
tion of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the re-
sults of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. They should adhe re to accepted guidelines for ethical report-
ing. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or oth-
erwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and con-
flicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Re ports of research not in ac-
cordance with the principles of this Decl aration should not be accepted for publication. 
 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR ME DICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE 
31. The physician may combine medical research wi th medical care only to the extent that 
the research is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and 
if the physician has good reason to believe that participati on in the research study will 
not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects. 
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiven ess of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best cu rrent proven intervention, except in the following circum-
stances: 
33. The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven 
intervention exists; or  
34. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of pla-
cebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients 
who receive placebo or no treatment will not be  subject to any risk of serious or irre-
versible harm. Extreme care must be ta ken to avoid abuse of this option. 
35. At the conclusion of the study, patients en tered into the study are entitled to be in-
formed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for 
example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appro-
priate care or benefits. 
36. The physician must fully inform the patient wh ich aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to partic ipate in a study or the patient's decision to 
withdraw from the study must  never interfere with the patient-physician relationship.  

Declaration of Helsinki last amended Seoul 2008 Appendix II, Page 111 of 123
  
 37. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expe rt advice, with inform ed consent from the 
patient or a legally authorized representati ve, may use an unproven intervention if in 
the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of 
research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appr opriate, made publicly available.

 CORTROSYN®™ 
FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY  
(cosyntropin) for Injection  
 
DESCRIPTION  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for In jection is a sterile lyophilized  powder in vials containing 
0.25 mg of CORTROSYN™ and 10 mg of mannitol to be recons tituted with 1 mL of 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Administration is by intravenous or intramuscular injection.  
Cosyntropin is α 1 - 24 corticotropin, a synthetic s ubunit of ACTH. It is an open chain 
polypeptide containing, from the N terminus, th e first 24 of the 39 amino acids of natural 
ACTH. The sequence of amino acids in  the 1 - 24 compound is as follows:  
 
Ser - Tyr - Ser - Met - Glu - His - Phe - Arg - Trp - Gly - Lys - Pro - Val - Gly - Lys - Lys - Arg - Arg - Pro - Val - Lys - V al - Tyr - Pro

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhib its the full cortico-steroidogenic activity of 
natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the 
N-terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1 - 20 amino acid residue is the minimal 
sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete  loss of activity is noted with progressive 
shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residues. For example, the decrement from 20 
to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency.  
 
The pharmacologic profile of CORTROSYN™ is si milar to that of purified natural ACTH. It 
has been established that 0.25 mg of CORTROSYN™ will stimulate the adrenal cortex 
maximally and to the same extent as 25 units  of natural ACTH. This dose of CORTROSYN™ 
will produce maximal secretion of 17-OH corticosteroids, 17- ketosteroids and / or 17 - ketogenic steroids.  
 The extra-adrenal effects which natural ACTH  and CORTROSYN™ have in common include 
increased melanotropic activity, increased grow th hormone secretion and an adipokinetic 
effect. These are considered to be without  physiological or clin ical significance.   

US Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN® (cosyntronin) for 
injection  Appendix III, Page 114 of 123
  
 Animal, human and synthetic ACTH (1-39) which all contain 39 amino acids exhibit similar 
immunologic activity. This activity resides in th e C-terminal portion of the molecule and the 
22-39 amino acid residues exhibit the greatest degr ee of antigenicity. In contrast, synthetic 
poly-peptides containing 1-19 or  fewer amino acids have no de tectable immunologic activity. 
Those containing 1-26, 1-24 or 1-23 amino acids  have very little im munologic although full 
biologic activity. This property of CORTROSYN™ assumes added importance in view of the known antigenicity of natural ACTH.

 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the 
screening of patients presumed to have adrenoc ortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid 
effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function 
(plasma cortisol response) as an office or out patient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).  
 
Severe hypofunction of the pitu itary - adrenal axis is usua lly associated with subnormal 
plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of ad renal insufficiency and 
does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have 
normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason 
a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to 
adequate corticotropin stimulation. When pres umptive adrenal insuffic iency is diagnosed by a 
subnormal CORTROSYN™ test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or 
secondary.  
 
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addi son’s disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, 
such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient 
despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises 
as the result of defective produc tion of ACTH leading in turn to  disuse atrophy of the adrenal 
cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan’s syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation.  
 
The differentiation of both types is based on th e premise that a primarily defective gland 
cannot be stimulated by ACTH wh ereas a secondarily defective gl and is potentially functional 
and will respond to adequate stimulation with AC TH. Patients selected for further study as the 
result of a subnormal CORTROSYN™ test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment 
with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units tw ice daily for 3 days. U nder these conditions 
little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison’s disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases  with secondary adrenal insufficiency.  
 
CONTRAINDICATION  
The only contraindication to CO RTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for In jec-tion is a history of a 
previous adverse reaction to it.

 PRECAUTIONS  
General  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection exhi bits slight immunologic activity, does not 
contain animal protein and is th erefore less risky to use than  natural ACTH. Patients known to 
be sensitized to natural ACTH with markedly positive skin tests will, with few exceptions, re-
act negatively when tested intradermally with CORTROSYN™. Most patients with a history 
of a previous hypersensitivity react ion to natural ACTH or a pre- existing allergic disease will 
tolerate CORTROSYN™. Despite this however, CORTROSYN™ is not completely devoid of immunologic activity and hypersensitivity reactions including rare anaphylaxis are 
possible. Therefore, the physician should be pre-pared, prior to in jection, to treat any possible 
acute hypersensitivity reaction.   
Drug Interactions  
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte lo ss associated with diuretic therapy.  
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Long term studies in animals have not been pe rformed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic 
potential or impairment of fertility. A study in  rats noted inhibition of reproductive function 
like natural ACTH.  
 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection. It  is also not known whether CORTROSYN™ 
can cause fetal harm when ad-ministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction 
capacity. CORTROSYN™ should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.  
 
Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether this drug is excr eted in human milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, caution should be ex ercised when CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for 
Injection is administered  to a nursing woman.

 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Since CORTROSYN®™ (cosyntropin) for Inje ction is intended fo r diagnostic and not 
therapeutic use, adverse reactions other th an a rare hypersensitiv ity reaction are not 
anticipated. A rare hypersensitivi ty reaction usually associated with a pre-existing allergic 
disease and/or a previous reacti on to natural ACTH is possible. Symptoms may include slight 
whealing with splotchy erythema at the injec tion site. There have been rare reports of 
anaphylactic reaction. The following adverse reactions have been re ported in patients after the 
administration of CORTROSYN®™ and the asso ciation has been neither confirmed nor 
refuted:  
o bradycardia  
o tachycardia  
o hypertension  
o peripheral edema  
o rash  
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
CORTROSYN™ (cosyntropin) for Injection may be administered intramuscularly or as a 
direct intravenous injection when used as a ra pid screening test of ad renal function. It may 
also be given as an intravenous infusion ove r a 4 to 8 hour period to provide a greater 
stimulus to the adrenal glands. Doses of CORT ROSYN™ 0.25 to 0.75 mg have been used in 
clinical studies and a maximal respons e noted with the smallest dose.  
 
A suggested method for a rapid screening test of  adrenal function has been described by Wood 
and Associates (1). A control blood sample of 6 to 7 ml is collected in a heparinized tube. 
Reconstitute 0.25 mg of CORTRO SYN™ with 1mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 
and inject intramuscularly. The reconstituted dr ug product should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to  injection. Reconstituted CORTROSYN™ should 
not be retained. In the pediatric population, aged  2 years or less, a dos e of 0.125 mg will often 
suffice. A second blood sample is collected exactly 30 minutes later. Both blood samples 
should be refrigerated until sent to the laboratory for determination of the plasma cortisol 
response by some appropriate method. If it is no t possible to send them to the laboratory or 
perform the fluorimetric procedure within 12 hou rs, then the plasma should be separated and 
refrigerated or frozen according to need.  
 
Two alternative methods of administration are intravenous inje ction and infusion. 
CORTROSYN™ can be injected in travenously in 2 to 5 mL of saline over a 2-minute period. 
When given as an intravenous infusion: CORT ROSYN™, 0.25 mg may be added to glucose  

US Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN® (cosyntronin) for 
injection  Appendix III, Page 118 of 123
  
 or saline solutions and given at the rate of approximately 40 micrograms per hour over a 6-
hour period. It should not be added to blood or  plasma as it is apt to be inactivated by 
enzymes. Adrenal response may be measured  in the usual manner by determining urinary 
steroid excretion before and after treatment or by measuring plasma cortisol levels before and 
at the end of the infusion. The latter is prefer able because the urinary steroid excretion does 
not always accurately reflect  the adrenal or plasma co rtisol response to ACTH.  
 
The usual normal response in most cases is an approximate doubling of the basal level, 
provided that the basal level does not exceed the normal range. Patients receiving cortisone, 
hydrocortisone or spironolactone should omit thei r pre-test doses on the day selected for test-
ing. Patients taking inadvert ent doses of cortisone or hydr ocortisone on the test day and 
patients taking spironolactone or women taking drugs which contain estrogen may exhibit abnormally high basal plasma cortisol levels.  
 
A paradoxical response may be noted in the co rtisone or hydrocortisone group as seen in a 
decrease in plasma cortisol values follo wing a stimulating dose  of CORTROSYN™.  
In the spironolactone or estrogen group only a normal incremen tal response is to be expected. 
Many patients with normal adrenal function, however, do not respond to the expected degree 
so that the following criteria have been established to denote a normal response:  
 
1.    The control plasma cortisol level should exceed 5 micrograms/100 ml.  
2. The 30-minute level should show an increment of at least 7 micrograms/100 ml above the 
basal level.  
3. The 30-minute level should exceed 18 micrograms/100 ml. Compar able figures have 
been reported by Greig and co-workers 
 Plasma cortisol levels usually peak about 45 to 60 minutes after an injection of CORTROSYN™ and some prefer the 60-minute interv al for testing for this reason. While it is 
true that the 60-minute values are usually hi gher than the 30-minute values, the difference 
may not be significant enough in most cases to outweigh the disadvantage of a longer testing 
period. If the 60-minute test period is used, the criterion for a normal response is an 
approximate doubling of the basal plasma cortisol value.  
 
In patients with a raised plasma bilirubin or  in patients where the plasma contains free 
hemoglobin, falsely high fluorescence measurements  will result. The test may be performed at 
any time during the day but because of the physiol ogical diurnal variation of plasma cortisol 
the criteria listed by Wood cannot apply. It has been shown that basal plasma cortisol levels  

US Prescribing Information for CORTROSYN® (cosyntronin) for 
injection  Appendix III, Page 119 of 123
  
 and the post CORTROSYN™ increment exhibit diurnal changes. However, the 30-minute 
plasma cortisol level remains unchanged throughout the day so that only this single criterion 
should be used (3).  
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
whenever solution and container permit. Reconstituted CORTROSYN™ should not be 
retained.

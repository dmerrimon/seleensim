General Information  
 
1.0 Purpose 
1.1 The purpose of this clinical study is to validate the SpO2 accuracy of the Stryker Sustainability 
Solutions pulse oximetry sensors during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 
as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO -Oximetry. Th e end goal is to provide 
supporting documentation for the SpO2 accuracy validation of the reprocessed sensors.  
In this study, the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by reducing the concentration of oxygen the study volunteer breathes. The accuracy of a noninvasive 
pulse oximeter sensor will be assessed by comparison to the oxygen saturation measurements 
from a laboratory blood gas analyzer.  
It is required that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) performance of the Stryker pulse oximetry sensors will meet a specification of +/ -3% with a target of +/ -3% or better in non -motion 
conditions for the range of 70 - 100% SaO2 (typically, saturation is determined once with air 
breathing and then at three or six  levels , e.g. 94%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75% and 70% or 95%, 85% 
and 75% saturation for about 30- 60 seconds  or 60- 90 seconds  at each level), thereby 
demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification.  This study should utilize 
a three level structure (95%, 85% and 75%).    
1.2 T his study is being conducted to support regulatory body approval  of pulse oximeter probes 
sterilized and/or decontaminated with Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide.

Reference sensors from the reprocessed oximeter 
device will be placed on each subject to evaluate the 
SpO2 accuracy and performance.  Device: Stryker Sustainability Solutions Reprocessed Masimo 
RD SET  Pulse Oximetry Sensors 
An oximeter is a device used to transmit radiation at a known 
wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen 
saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard 
physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in 
everyday situati ons to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. 
Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the 
measurement, the pulse oximeter can provide non- invasive 
real time information.  
Sham Comparator:  Radiometer ABL -90 multi -
wavelength oximeter 
A whole blood analyzer (CO -Oximeter) is used as the 
reference standard device for obtaining the 
functional SaO2 value from arterial blood samples 
obtained during the study.  Device: CO- OXIMETRY SENSORS 
A whole blood analyzer (CO -Oximeter) is used as the reference 
standard device for obtaining the functional SaO2 value from 
arterial blood samples obtained during the study.  
Primary Outcome Measures:  
1. Accuracy of Sensor by Arms 
Calculation [  Time  Frame:  1-5 
hours  ] 
 Percentage of SpO2 (oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry) measured by the Reprocessed Oximeter pulse oximetry sensors during non -motion conditions over 
the range of 70 -100% SaO
2 as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO -
Oximetry.

The Accuracy root mean square (ARMS) between measured SpO 2 and reference 
SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) must meet the 3 % specification for each Stryker 
Sustainability  Reprocessed pulse oximetry sensor style.  
 
Accuracy will be determined by comparing the noninvasive blood oxygen saturation measurement of the pulse oximeter to that obtained from a blood 
sample and calculating the arithmetic root mean square error (Arms) value. In 
order to obtain the Arms value, the blood oxygen saturation measurement is subtra cted from the pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurement for a number 
of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the sum of the squares of  bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.  
 
Fo
r each range specified, SpO2 ACCURACY of the PULSE OXIMETER EQUIPMENT 
shall be stated in terms of the root-mean -
square (rms) difference between 
measured values ( SpO2i) and reference values ( SRi), as given by the following 
formula.

8.0 Product Description  
8.1 Intended Use: Reprocessed Masimo RD SET  Pulse Oximeter Sensors are indicated for single 
patient use for continuous noninvasive arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate monitoring.  
8.2 Principle of  Operation:  The principle of operation of pulse oximetry is based upon the 
fundamental principle that hemoglobin bound to oxygen (oxyhemoglobin) and hemoglobin 
unbound to oxygen (deoxyhemoglobin) vary in the absorption of different wavelengths of the light  
and the absorptions can be used to estimate SpO2 and PR.  The mechanism by which this process occurs is the use of red and infrared wavelengths of light delivered by an emitter and the 
detection of the signal from the light absorption of oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood to determine functional oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SpO2).  
8.3 Mechanism of Action for Achieving the Intended Effect: The Reprocessed Pulse Oximeter 
Sensor provides the intended effect equivalent to the previously cleared pulse oximeter sensor in that it utilizes an optical sensor that is applied to the patient’s finger or toe through which light is 
transmitted to the photodetector that detects the signal transmission.  The signal transmission is 
processed by the Pulse Oximeter to provide SpO2 and PR .

9.0 Worst Case Justification  
9.1 The pulse oximeter sensors which are identified in Table 1 as subject devices are pending FDA 
clearance for a maximum of four (4) reprocessing cycles.  Sensors used in this study were  
subjected to the maximum number of reprocessing cycles. Catalog number 4000 Adt consists of a 
non-woven butterfly style tape and catalog number 4003 Neo consists of a woven style tape.  
There is no worse case model in that the characteristics of both tape types are equivalent within 
the model family and do not present different  challenges during the tape removal process when 
reprocessing .   
10.0 Sample Size Designation  
10.1 A typical study will inclu de at least 10 subjects (up to 24 if needed to reach the 200 necessary 
data points to meet the ISO 80601-2- 61:2017 ). Per FDA guidance, at least 2 or 15% of the 
subjects  will have dark skin pigmentation. Skin pigmentation will be assessed using the Fitzpatrick 
scale by UCSF study personnel.  
10.2 Each study subject will have two reprocessed sensors attached to their fingers. Two Reprocessed 
Masimo RD SET sensors should be placed on one side of the subject; however, sensors may be 
placed opposite sides. Digits selected should be two of the three middle fingers on each hand 
avoiding the thumb or pinky fingers as test sites.   
11.0 Preliminary Investigations and Justification of the Study  
11.1 Stryker Sustainability Solutions has developed a process to reprocess pulse oximeters that cleans 
and disinfects the devices active element components and device cord and replaces all patient 
contacting tapes.  The foam covering the cable is cleaned and disinfected but not replaced during 
reprocessing.  
11.2 The manufacturing process for reprocessing includes 100% visual inspection and functional assessment.   
11.3 As part of the product development and validation phases of this project, Stryker  has performed or 
is currently performing the following studies:  
• Cleaning  
• Disinfection  
• Biocompatibility  
• Performance

12.2 Packaging and Labeling  
 Research conducted for this study will utilize investigational devices. The Sponsor is 
responsible for packaging and labeling of the devices for delivery to the study site. 
Investigational devices or its immediate package shall bear a label with the following information:  
“CAUTION – Investigational device. Limited by Federal (or United States) law to 
investigational use”.  
13.0 Procedure 
13.1 If the principal investigator deems it necessary, the subject may be asked to run hot water over hands and arms for 5 minutes to improve perfusion. After injection of a local anesthetic, a 22 -
gauge catheter is inserted in one radial artery. Pulse oximeters are attached to fingers  with 
adequate spacing between fingers  or shielding to minimize device cross -talk. Subjects are in a 
comfortable semi -recumbent position.  Subjects then breathe air mixtures containing reduced 
amounts of oxygen to produce the desired level of hypoxemia. Stable, safe and controlled hypoxia is adjusted manually by an anesthesiologist that permits the inspired gas mixture to be adjusted to achieve a level of lung alveolar gas that will achieve the desired degree of saturation.   
13.2 Typical ly, saturation levels involve one period with air breathing and then at one of three or six 
levels , e.g. 94%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75% and 70% or 95%, 85% and 75% saturation.  Each level of 
saturation is held for 30 -60 seconds  or 60 -90 seconds respectively . At a ppropriate intervals and 
when oxygen levels are stable, arterial blood samples are obtained from the radial arterial catheter.   The operator then changes the inspired oxygen concentration to attain the next desired 
stead -state level of hypoxia.  This study  should utilize a three level structure (95%, 85% and 75%).   
A "run" consists of several stable steady -state hypoxia levels and together takes approximately 20 
minutes . Each run is terminated by a breath of 100% O2 followed by room air.  Two runs together 
enable obtaining a total of 20- 25 blood samples, 4 samples at each plateau.  Saturation of each 
arterial blood sample is determined by direct oximetry in a Radiometer ABL- 90 multi -wavelength 
oximeter. The precise target levels of saturation can be adjusted to suit the sponsor, but typical 
testing is done to satisfy ISO and FDA standards for testing, which is 70% to 100%.  
13.3 The study takes about 1 hour of each subject's time.  Analysis of the data requires several days. Manufacturer’s representatives (Stryker) will be present for these tests, and to mount the probes.  
14.0 Sponsor Pulse Oximeter Study D ata 
14.1 Data from test pulse oximeters for comparison to blood values can be obtained in several ways.  In every case, the goal is to obtain a reading from the oximeter that corresponds to the associated 
blood sample or a reference oximeter.  Because of circulation delays and instrument averaging 
time, attempts will be made to create steady state conditions at each level of oxygenation.  Therefore, a means should be provided to record the instrument reading at each blood sample.  
This instrument reading may be obtained with several different approaches. Some instruments 
have no digital or analog output and the instrument reading may be recorded manually or recorded by a video of the instrument display.  Other instruments may have an analog output.  
The laboratory can record analog data by use of LabView.  Digital recording of output can also be 
obtained via LabView but this requires information from the sponsor concerning the structure of 
the digital signal.   
14.2 If a manufacturer prefers to collect and analyze the data, the continuous digital signal of each oximeter should be read, for comparison with the blood sample, 9 seconds before the record shows a sudden fall or rise in oxygen saturation, not at the time of blood sampling.  This 
procedure accounts for the delays of finger circulation and uses the estimated delay from the lung 
to the sample site.  There is no useful correlation between the actual time of blood sampling and

the oximeter recording because of the variability of tissue blood flow lag.  As mentioned, steady -
state hypoxia avoids the concern that oximeter reading is not aligned with a blood sample reading.  
15.0 Statistics  
15.1 The number of subjects and the number of comparisons (paired pulse oximeter readings and 
arterial saturation values) is determined by current FDA guidance requirements. This is a 
minimum of 200 data points and 10 subjects . In the course of this type of study, some subjects 
may drop out, some readings can be lost due to motion or other interference and occasionally some do not consent.   
15.2 The following demographic data will be collected on the subjects:  
 Gender (male, female, other)  
 Age  
 Skin pigmentat ion (dark, medium, light) preferably 1- 6 using the Fitzpatrick scale 
 Height (cm)  
 Weight (kg)  
 Wrist circumference (cm)  
 Dominant hand (left or right)  
 
16.0 Data Analysis 
16.1 In all cases, the blood analysis data are provided, including the SaO2, MetHb, COHb and Hgb concentration.  
16.2  The data analysis report will consist of the following:  
 A Table of the oximeter readings versus corresponding blood SaO2 values.  
 Graphic plots of the bias between the oximeter reading and the SaO2 measured by the hemoximeter (on the blood sample, i.e Modified Bland- Altman plots for each 
instrument or instrument probe combination) . 
 Regression equations for the bias of each instrument . 
 Tables of the mean error or bias, its standard deviation, standard error, 95% confidence interval, maximum and minimum and root mean square error, all computed both overall and by several sub- ranges of desaturation.  
 A table of the demographics of the subject population is provided.  
17.0 Subject Safety  
17.1 Pulse oximeter sensors are typically considered non -significant risk medical devices. The LED 
light energy utilized in typical test measurements is within the same range as other cleared 
marketed devices and intr oduces no further risks. An LED light emits light that passes through the 
tissue. A light detector then measures how much light was absorbed by the tissue. Based on the 
ratio of absorbance of different wavelengths of light, the device calculates the oxygen saturation.  
18.0 Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Device and Clinical Investigation  
18.1 Breathing a very low oxygen mixture may cause dizziness and might cause loss of consciousness for a few seconds. It may make one feel very short of breath during the t est and for a few seconds 
afterwards. There is a remote possibility that if the subject loses consciousness he/she might have muscular twitching or convulsions. This study will not seek to reach saturations below 70%.

Hypoxia may cause tachycardia and increased blood pressure during the test, and might cause 
headache. In all the years of the lab conducting the study no subject has mentioned headache. 
Much more severe and prolonged lack of oxygen could cause brain injury or death, but the 
duration and depth of hypoxia is limited by the test protocol to short intervals. The needle catheter 
used to take blood may hurt when it is inserted despite the use of local anesthesia, and there may 
be a black and blue spot afterward. It is remotely possible the artery might be damaged or clot, or 
a tendon sheath near it be injured by the needle, resulting in some soreness. These risks are unlikely because none of the enrolled 2000+ subjects has ever had a serious complication. 
Hyperventilating during the part of the study requiring reduced PCO2 may make subjects 
lightheaded or dizzy. Breathing air with added CO2 may make subjects feel short of breath and 
cause a headache. Some subjects feel faint when they arrive for the study, apparently related to 
the thought of having an arterial line. These subjects will likely be excluded from the study.  
18.2 Currently the FDA defines pulse oximeters as Class II devices which transmit radiation at a known 
wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of 
reflected or scattered radiation and may be used alone or in conjunction with a fiberoptic oximeter catheter. All oximeters being used in this study work by transmittance of radiation at known 
wavelength(s) through tissue to measure blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of 
reflected and scattered radiation. The devices under test and this study procedure are considered Non-Significant Risk (NSR).  
Non-significant risk letter and checklist were sent to test lab and accepted per UCSF IRB approval 
reference number  330726 . 
The device and use of the device under test does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:  
• Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for  serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject;  
• Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
19.0 Invasive Laboratory Testing on Healthy Volunteers  
19.1 The risk determination is based on the use of the device in an investigation in addition to the 
device itself. Generally, the FDA believes pulse oximeters as addressed in the FDA Guidance 
Document for Pulse Oximeters (March 4, 2013) are non- significant risk devices. Further, the 
recommendation is to conduct the study in accordance with Clause 201.12.1.101.2 and Annex EE.2 of ISO 80601 -2-61:2011, where Annex EE.2 describes the procedure for invasive laboratory 
testing on healthy volunteers.  
20.0 Risk Mitigations  
Subjects are all monitored with accurate reference oximeters and continuous end- tidal gas 
analysis to prevent the risk of more profound hypoxia than desired. Investigators are experienced 
anesthesiologists adept at assessing breathing and in maintaining appropriate airway conditions. The study room is set up like an OR with all resuscitation equipment immediately available.  
21.0 Informed Consent  
21.1 Written inform ed consent is obtained before any study interventions. In discussions with the study 
coordinator before the day of the study, potential subjects will be offered the consent form to

review. On the day of the study subjects are given the consent form which they read and sign if 
they wish to participate. A study doctor is present to answer questions.  
21.2 Only subjects clearly able to understand and read English will be enrolled. Subjects will be asked if they have any questions and are told they can withdraw at any time.  
22.0 Investigational Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
22.1 Prior to the start of subject enrollment, the investigator will be responsible for obtaining approval from the authorized IRB/IEC for the institution at which the proposed clinical investigation is to be conducted. Written approval from the IRB/IEC should specifically refer to the investigator, the protocol title and date, and subject informed consent date.  
22.2 Written IRB/IEC approval and any conditions of approval imposed by the IRB/IEC was obtained by the sponsor/investigator.  
22.3 Protocol amendments must also undergo IRB/IEC review and approval at each clinical site. The written approval from the IRB/IEC for the amendment should specifically refer to the investigator, the protocol version number and title, and any amendment numbers that are applicable.  
22.4 The IRB approval for this study was obtained November 16th 2021 and is valid through February 
15th 2022. Approval reference number 330726. 
23.0 Monitoring Arrangements  
23.1 A representative from the sponsor and study monitor  will provide all monitoring. The Monitor shall 
be responsible for maintaining a record of the findings, conclusions, and actions taken for the results of monitoring the study ensuring that:  
23.2 The monitoring requirements for an NSR device study is identified in 21 CFR 812.2(b) 
Abbreviated requirements. For monitoring an NSR device investigation, the requirement is to 
comply with 21 CFR 812.46 with respect to monitoring investigations: (a) Securing Compliance, 
(b) Unanticipated adverse device effects, (c) Resumption of terminated studies  
• Compliance to the signed agreement between the Investigator and sponsor  
• The study follows the protocol and any amendments that apply  
• Compliance to any conditions of the approval imposed by the IRB or FDA  
23.3 Sponsor will assess a ny new hazards/harms identified during a clinical investigation (i.e., pre - or 
post-market study) as part of the risk management process per DPCDS -013, Risk Management 
and the complaint handling process per DP -MCF -001, Division Complaint Handling Process, as  
applicable. 
24.0 Data Storage  
24.1 Identifiable subject information is always stored securely following all applicable rules and regulations.  Consent forms and other study related documents are retained following UCSF data retentions policy.  
25.0 Acceptance Criteria  
25.1 The statistical results of the data will be reviewed for the following pass/fail criteria:  
 At least 200 data points with SpO2 Accuracy for the range of 70- 100%, 3 (A RMS) is 
considered  a Pass  per FDA guidanc e.

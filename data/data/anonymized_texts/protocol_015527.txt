Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 6 of 44 1.0 Introduction and Background  
Breast reconstruction defines the final step for many women on a long road to recovery from breast cancer. 
Reconstruction of the breast mound following mastectomy has several benefits in psychosocial functioning, 
body image and satisfaction with breast appearance, and sexual well -being1-4. However, reconstruction at the 
same time as mastectomy has been linked t o higher post -operative pain5. As in any surgical procedure, post -
operative pain control has a major impact on patient satisfaction and important outcome measures such as 
length of stay, readmission rates, and overall hospital costs6-8. In particular, poor  post-operative pain control in 
the cancer population has a negative impact on physical functioning, with decreased ability to perform activities 
of daily living, social functioning, with decreased interest in hobbies and contact with friends, and can incr ease 
feelings of anxiety and depression9. In fact, fear of post -surgical pain has been shown to be a major reason that 
women refuse breast reconstruction surgery10. 
 
Implant based breast reconstruction is a widely used and well accepted technique with 86,013 procedures 
performed in the United States in 2015 vs 20,325 flap based breast reconstruction procedures11. However, this 
technique has disadvantages in relation to post -operative pain. Compared to autologous breast reconstruction, 
implant based tech niques have been linked to higher requirements of post -operative benzodiazepines, 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and narcotics as well as higher pain scores in the immediate post -
operative period and one year after surgery5,12. Tissue expander based  techniques in particular lead to even 
higher narcotic use and morphine equivalents than single staged implant reconstruction5.  
 
 In an effort to decrease pain control, it is common practice for local anesthetics to be infiltrated into the 
surgical wound.  Individual  studies have shown that infiltrations with bupivacaine specifically have  decreased 
intraoperative and postoperative narcotic use, decreased pain scores in the immediate postoperative period  24-26. 
However, upon meta -analysis of randomized clini cal trials studying the effect of wound infiltration with 
bupivacaine or ropivacaine it was found that postoperative pain severity was only decreased at 2 hours 
postoperatively and postoperative analgesic consumption did not change27. In light of this, the re continues to be 
a need for improvement  in postoperative pain management for mastectomy and subsequent breast 
reconstruction.  
 
One such medication which has been suggested for improvement in pain control after mastectomy and breast 
reconstruction is Exparel (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA) . It is a relatively recent bupivacaine 
multi -vesicular liposomal delivery system that allows slow release of bupivacaine, resulting in local anesthetic 
effects for up to 72 -96 hours after injection. It is a safe pain control modality with a similar side effects profile 
to bupivacaine HCL and does not compromise breast implant integrity13-14.  
 
Side effects of Exparel primarily includes GI upset (nausea and vomiting) which can occur in greater than 10% 
of pa tients. More rare side effects include hypotension (2 -10%), insomnia (2 -10%), pruritus  (3%), postoperative 
anemia (2 -10%), and muscle spasm (2 -10%).  Similar to other local anesthetics, dose related toxicity can occur 
and can lead to central nervous system excitation or depression.  Exparel has a half -life of 2 4-34 hours and is 
hepatically metabolized and renally excreted . It should be used in caution with patients with moderate -severe 
hepatic  or renal  impairment because of the increased risk of toxicity.  Exparel may increase the toxicity of 
lidocaine and bupivacaine. Bupivacaine can be administered with or immediately before Exparel as long as the 
milligram dose ratio of bupivacaine to Exparel is not greater than 1:2. Furthermore, Exparel may increase the 
effect of neuromuscular blocking agents. Exparel is not recommended in pregnant patients as there have been 
no studies conducted in this population and high doses used in animal models have been shown to decrease fetal

dosing for breast surgery of 266 mg (20 ml)28.  
 
Multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group clinical trials have been performed 
for Exparel use in postoperative pain control for bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy . In the bunionectomy 
trial, it was found that with injection of Exparel there was a statistically significant reduction of cumulative pain 
levels over the first 24 hours after surgery29. Similarly , in the hemorrhoidectomy trial, it was found that the 
Exparel group had a decreased cumulative pain score at 72 hours30.  
 
Furthermore, liposomal bupivacaine has been shown to improve outcome measures including mean hospital 
stay and post -operative pain scores in a wide range of procedures from abdominal wall reconstruction to 
thoracotomies and sternotomies15,16. In retrosp ective studies, the use of Exparel decreased immediate 
postoperative pain associated with breast reconstruction compared with IV and oral narcotics and bupivacaine 
pain pumps. It also showed a significant decrease in mean length of stay compared to IV and oral narcotic pain 
management18. Up to this point, there have been no prospective studies examining the effects of Exparel on 
outcome measures when used in tissue expander based breast reconstruction. We believe that its use will 
decrease post -operative pa in and will lead to improved performance in outcome measures.

5.0 Study Outcomes and Study Measures  
5.1 Primary Outcome  
 
5.1.1 The primary outcome of this study is the mean visual analog scores (scale of 0 -10) within 
the first 48 hours postoperatively. This will be measured every 12 hours for the first 48 
hours and will be assessed by the level of breast pain associated with arm m ovements 
while eating.  
5.1.1.1  Visual analog scores in mastectomy patients with oral and IV narcotics are 
approximately 5.0 at 24 hours and 4.8 at 48 hours17 
5.1.1.2  For patients with local infiltration of Liposomal bupivacaine after implant 
based reconstruction, visual analog scores at 24hrs were 3.8 on average18  
5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
 
5.2.1 Area under the curve visual analog scores (scale 0 -10) during the first 48 hours 
postoperatively.  
5.2.1.1  For patients undergoing submuscular augmentation mammoplasty, the area 
under the curve for pain scores at 72 hours for liposomal bupivacaine 
infiltration is 441 +/ - 182 and for bupivacaine infiltration is 461 +/ - 18120 
 
5.2.2 Morphine equivalent s used  within the first month postoperatively

CCCWFU # 99517  
 
Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 10 of 44 5.2.2.1  The number of doses of oral narcotics (hydrocodone -acetaminop hen 1 tablet) 
for patients with immediate tissue expander reconstruction without other 
measure of pain control has been 4.2 at 24 hours and 4.0 at 48 hours17. This is 
approximately 3.3 morphine equivalents  
5.2.2.2  We would expect the patients treated with liposom al bupivacaine to use an 
average of 2.5 intravenous morphine equivalents  at the 48 -hour point and 
decreased morphine equivalents in the liposomal bupivacaine over the first 
postoperative month.  
 
5.2.3 Length of stay for hospitalization after mastectomy and breast reconstruction  
5.2.3.1  Length of stay for patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate 
reconstruction has been shown to be 41 -47 hours on average21 
5.2.3.2  We believe liposomal bupivacaine will shorten this time to 36 hours±12 in the 
liposomal bupivacaine group, bu t not in the bupivacaine groups.  
 
5.2.4 Readmissio n rates to the hospital within 2  months after mastectomy and breast 
reconstruction  
5.2.4.1  Patients who underwent tissue expander breast reconstruction have a 
readmission rate of approximately 4.34%22. We anticipate a r eadmission rate 
of approximately 2%  Patients will be informed that if they are expected to undergo 
an axillary lymph node dissection at the time of surge ry then they will be excluded 
from  the study. Patients who are undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsies will be 
included in the study, but if their nodes are positive and there is an intraoperative 
decision to pursue axillary lymph node dissection they will subsequently be excluded 
from the study . 
 
5.2.5 Frequency of postoperative opioid related adverse effects wi thin the first week of 
surgery. This includes nausea, vomiting, pruritus, allergy, respiratory depression.   
5.2.5.1  After immediate breast reconstruction with implants, patients receiving 
bupivacaine had a 40% incidence of nausea and vomiting. Those not receiving 
a local anesthetic had a 75% incidence of nausea and vomiting17 
5.2.5.2  We predict a 30% incidence of opioid related adverse events in our liposomal 
bupivacaine group  
 
5.2.6 Trajectory of postoperative recov ery from pain within the first 2  months  
5.2.6.1  Growth curve analysis of pain intensity with movement scores over the first 
two months, using an initial log (time) model and a Bayesian change point 
analysis  
5.2.6.2  Groups will be compared for intercept and slope of the trajectory of pain 
intensity up to the first change point  
5.2.6.3  For t he entire population, the impact of the optimism -catastrophizing 
continuum and other predictive factors for intercept and slope will be explored

6.1 Study -Related Activities   
Patient involvement in the study will be initiated in the plastic surgery clinic.  Eligible subjects will  be identified 
prior to surgery.   Potential subjects will be contacted either by phone or during their clinic visit , informed 
consent will be obtained and a 30 -minute preoperative assessment will be performed.  Patients will be informed 
that if they are expected to undergo an axillary lym ph node dissection at the time of surgery then they will be 
excluded from the study. Patients who are undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsies will be included in the 
study, but if their nodes are positive and there is an intraoperative decision to pursue a xillary lymph node 
dissection they will subsequently be excluded from the study. Also , we will record demographic and history 
information, including existing pain elsewhere, and administer questionnaire -based measures of psychological 
state, physical funct ion, and baseline pain (Table 1, Appendix F ). Questionnaire  responses will be entered via 
the cancer center  REDCap data entry form . From these questionnaires, we will place each participant on a 
dimensional continuum that describes their general cognitive style. We will use multidimensional scaling 
(MDS) to force catastrophizing and optimism as 2 ends of this continuum.

These two constructs describe cognitive styles that are strongly inversely associated with each other; MDS will 
provide the optimal weights to best order individuals on this latent scale. Studies have examined the interplay of 
these constructs with other p sychological concepts such as acceptance, pain -related disability and psychosocial 
adjustment and have found that both are reliably associated with the positive and negative aspects of the 
adjustment to pain.                                             
 
The research coordinator will then assign the patients a study number. On the day of surgery, each patient will 
be randomized to be in one of the following two groups for perioperative local anesthetic infiltration:  
 
1. Local infiltration of bupivacaine  
2. Local i nfiltration of liposomal bupivacaine  
 
The study will be double blinded to both patients and providers including plastic and general surgeons involved 
in their operative care. We will enroll our patients in pharmacy randomization program, in which the pharm acy 
will deliver the appropriate medication per assigned group.  
 
To monitor our primary outcomes, patients will be asked to rate their pain level on a visual analog scale  (Table 
2, Appendix Z)  with activity every 12 -hours after surgery during their post -procedure stay . The activity for 
which they will rate their pain will be the arm movements associated with eating. In the hospital, their visual 
analog scores will be provided to each patient  in person by their nurse every 12 hours.  Subject’s pain scores wi ll 
continue to be recorded every 12 hours via a phone call  from a study team member  for the first 48 hours after 
discharge.  Additionally, while in the hospital, the amount of narcotics used will be recorded and converted into 
morphine equivalents.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 2: Visual Analog Scale  
 
 
Upon discharge, patients  will be given a sheet to record  their pain level  and the amount of narcotics  & 
benzodiazepines  used (Appendix K) . Both the amount of  narcotics & benzodiazepines and the pain level are to 
be reported at the time of taking any narcotics & benzodiazepines. Patients will follow up with our clinic at 1 
week , 3 weeks, and 5 weeks postoperatively. At  week 1  patients will  bring in their medicat ion and pain diary, 
and fill out a pain assessment  (Appendix G)  in addition to a questionnaire assessing breast cancer surgery

be assessed and recei ve the pain assessment and breast cancer surgery disability assessments as well. When 
tissue expansion is initiated will be determined by the primary surgeon, but we will track  the dates of the 
initiation of expansion as this will impact pain scores  within  the electronic medical record .  
 
Secondary outcomes including length of hospital stay, adverse opioid effects and re -admission rate will be 
tracked by t heir electronic medical record. Upon reviewing the questionnaires, if a subject is determined to have 
high levels of depression, our team will make them aware of the resources available in the psychiatry 
department and a contact number will be provided to them.  
 
6.2 Treatment  Administration  
Patients assigned to the local infiltration with b upivacaine group will receive a total 60 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine 
with 30 ml delivered to each breast . Patients assigned to the local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine will 
receive a total of 20 ml liposomal bupivacaine (266 mg) with 10 ml of 0.25%  bupivacaine and 30 ml  of 0.9% 
sodium chloride . These injections will occur at the end of the mastectomy and prior to the insertion of the tissue 
expander implant. The local anesthetic will be injected into the chest wall and skin flaps. Attending physicians 
and resident physic ians will receive prior instruction regarding correct placement of the local anesthetic so that 
it will be consistently placed in the same locations with similar volume distribution.  After this intraoperative 
injection, patients will not receive any more d oses of local anesthetics.  
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
This local anesthetic will get delivered at the time of surgery in an opaque syringe. Standardized anesthetic 
criteria will be applied to all patients enrolled in th e study. Pre -operatively, all patients will receive multi -modal 
therapy,  such as  acetaminophen , celecoxib , and gabapentin or pregabalin  unless  contraindicated. 
Intraoperatively, patients will only receive short acting fentanyl for analgesia. Intraoperative  ketamine and 
dexamethasone will be avoided.  A notification will populate in EPIC once the patient is linked to the study in 
WISER to notify the anesthesia provider.  Postoperative non -opioid medications will supplement as needed 
opioid mediations for anal gesic management.   
 
 
Patients will  receive full supportive care  as medically necessary , including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc . Medications considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be 
given as long as they are considered safe in the postoperative period and clinically indicated. The reason(s) for 
treatment, dosag e, and dates of treatment will  be recorded on the flow sheets . 
6.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be  seen at one week, three  weeks and five weeks postoperatively at which time they will receive 
pain and disability assessments.

Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 15 of 44 7.4 STRC  SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC  
Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. STRC  currently requires that all unexpected 4 and  all 
grade  5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for revi ew. All WFBCCC  Clinical Research 
Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a P rincipal Investigator  in investigating, documenting and 
reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC  reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the 
STRC as well as the e ntire committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE. 
All adverse events will be recorded and the data will be managed in WISER. As such, the STRC will 
have access to all adverse events in the course of the study.  
7.5 WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be promptly 
reported to the IRB , according to institutional policy . Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the 
funding source, study s ponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, 
biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, 
economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biol ogical agents, devices, 
procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other 
interactions with research subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other 
applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others. The Principal 
Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated 
problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator is also responsible 
for ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they receive are reviewed 
to determine whether the report represents a change in the risks and/or benefits to study particip ants, and 
whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a site where the study has 
been approved by the WFUHS IRB (interna l events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 
calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting th e 
same study that has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (external events) must be reported to the 
WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming 
aware of the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome  that alters the risk versus potential benefit of the research 
and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or informed consent 
process/document in order to insure the safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.

Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 18 of 44 10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
10.1 Analysis of Primary Objective  
10.1.1  The study will allow for an attrition rate of 10%.   Assuming a similar standard deviation 
in pain score at 48 hours for the local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine and 
bupivacaine arms, with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, the study would hav e 
the ability to detect an effect size (absolute value of difference in sample means divided 
by the standard deviation) of 0.6 between the 2 groups with 25  subje cts per arm.   We will 
recruit 25  subjects per arm; if there is no attrition, with the same alph a and power as 
above, the study would have the ability to  detect an effect size of 0.57. The primary 
outcome will be the pain score observed at 48 hours.   To test for differences in these 
scores between the 2 arms, an independent t -test will be used; if th e observed p -value is 
<0.05, statistical significance will be assumed.  Two-sided ANOVA will be performed for 
statistical analysis once data collection is complete.  
 
10.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
10.2.1  For the area under the curve of pain scores at 48 hours,  prior studies have found that the 
area under the curve for pain scores at 72 hours for liposomal bupivacaine infiltration is 
441 +/ - 182 and for bupivacaine infiltration is 461 +/ - 18120. A sample size of 40 in each 
group will have 80% power to detect a di fference in means of approximately 25% (115 
units) between a Bupivacaine mean,  m1, of 461 and a Liposomal Bupivacaine mean,  m2, 
of 346 assuming that the common standard deviation is 181 using a two group t -test with 
a 0.05 two -sided significance level. Our  study will be powered to detect this difference; 
we will use an independent t -test to assess statistical significance.  
10.2.2  For postoperative narcotic use,  prior studies have found the average use of morphine 
equivalents at 48 hours after mastectomy and tissue  expander placement is 3.317. This 
study will also have the ability to detect an effect size of 0.6 between groups, with 45 per 
group, a two -sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% power.   We would expect the patients treated 
with liposomal bupivacaine to be have a l ower average use.  We will use an independent 
t-test to test for differences between groups; if the data are not normally distributed, a log 
transformation will be used prior to using the t -test. 
10.2.3  For length of stay, the reported LOS has been shown to be 41 -47 hours on average  21. We 
believe Exparel will shorten this time; the study will have the ability to detect an effect 
size of 0.60 between the 2 groups.   We will use an independent t -test to test for 
differences between groups; if the data are not normall y distributed, a log transformation 
will be used prior to using the t -test. 
10.2.4  For readmission rates, patients who underwent tissue expander breast reconstruction have 
a readmission rate of approximately 4.34%22. We anticipate a readmission rate of 
approximat ely 2%.   Our study is not powered to detect differences in the 2 arms in this 
parameter.  
10.2.5  For opioid related adverse effects, we predict a 50% incidence of opioid related adverse 
events in our study.   With 45 per group, our study is not powered to detect di fferences 
between the 2 arms unless the difference is much larger than anticipated.   With a 60%

Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 19 of 44 rate, 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and 80% power, we could detect a difference of 31% between 
the 2 arms using a Fisher’s Exact Test  
10.2.6  For trajectory of postoperative re covery from pain, Growth curve analysis of pain 
intensity with movement scores over the first two months, using an initial log (time) 
model and a Bayesian change point analysis  
10.2.6.1  Groups will be compared for intercept and slope of the trajectory of pain 
intensity up to the first change point  
10.2.6.2  For the entire population, the impact of the optimism -catastrophizing 
continuum and other predictive factors for inter cept and slope will be explored  
10.3 Power and Sample Size  
We will have a power of 80% , as described in 10.1.1, with a sample size of 25  patient s in each arm for a total of 
50 patients  
 
10.4 Accrual Rate  
We plan on accruing 25  new patients per year until the goal of 50 total patients is reached.   
10.5 Estimated Study Length  
Estimated  study length wi ll be approximately 2  years. This will include patien t enrollment through the 5 week  
patient follow up period.   
10.6 Interim Analysis Plan  
We will plan on performing an interim analysis for the primary outcome and secondary outcomes after there are 
at least 10 patients in each treatment group in order to detect the evidence of severe side effects in either group. 
We will perform a secondary analysis after there are at l east 20  patients in each group to monitor for more rare 
side effects including but not limited  to bradycardia, tachycardia, respiratory distress, hypotension or 
neurological depression.

Safety and Toxicity Review Committee 
(STRC; previously known as CROC)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Notification 
SOP       Date: 8/17/2016  
 
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on WFBCCC  Institutional interventional trial patients . There are multiple en tities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by other entities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be used to evaluate whether an event s hould be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI Data Table 4 reporting guidelines, WFBCCC  Institutional 
Interventional studies covered by these reporting requirements are defin ed as: In-house, 
internally reviewed trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry 
sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, 
and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional 
investigator at another center.   Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher 
here at WFBCCC . Institutional protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the 
protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but 
Research Base trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for review ing SAEs for WFBCCC  Institutional Interventional studies, 
as defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on 
these trials be reported to the STRC for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management 
(CPDM) staff memb ers assisting a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualifies for 
STRC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone (or in -
person), followed by informing the entire committee via the required email notification.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the 
study team for a WFBCCC  Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it 
is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study

treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be the standard window to be used 
in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented to suggest th at a shorter window 
can be used to identify events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is unexpected it 
should be reported.

2  
and Phase 3 Interventional Trials  
STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. In 
those situations the adverse events t hat will not require STRC reporting must be specified in the 
text of the approved protocol.

STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as 
listed below (page if necessary) —see note 2 below  
2. Submit the STRC Notification Form WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. 
This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to 
http://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team 
membe rs and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your 
confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, consult the help 
page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate person(s) on t he STRC has been contacted.  
This documentation is placed on the STRC Notification form described above.  
4. Follow up with/update the clinical member(s) of STRC regarding any new developments or 
information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not respond to the phone call or 
page within a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact with their backup.  Give the back -
up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone ca ll or page before contacting another 
member. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical research 
professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is 
appropriate to contact backu p clinicians.  If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave 
messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification 
form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and document that  
you have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical members of STRC.  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as 
they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the 
members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there 
may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made and 
further commu nication directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the right

Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 31 of 44 to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator. STRC 
reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there  any immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the 
information provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment 
should take place.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply  all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email that 
was received by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list

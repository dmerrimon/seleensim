 All trial sites and subjects will be provided 
with FDA-approved handheld sUA devices to 
measure subject uric acid levels based on 
capillary samples. Results will be collected in 
the eCRF at non-infusion visits and pre- and 
post-infusion during pegloticase infusion visits. 
Subjects may also use the device to measure 
uric acid at home. Results will be collected for 
exploratory uses only. No in-trial treatment 
decisions will be made based upon the data 
generated with the handheld device. 
In addition, user experience by Investigators or 
patients will be assessed by a uric acid device

 2. During the MTX Run-in Period, subjects with 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 will inject SC MTX weekly at a starting dose of 15 mg at Weeks -6 and Week -5 increasing to 
25 mg at Week -4 and continuing 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 will inject SC MTX at a starting dose of 10 mg at Week -6 
and Week -5 increasing to 15 mg at Week -4 and continuing weekly throughout the trial; subjects unable to tolerate the 15 mg do se of MTX will be considered MTX Run-in 
Screen Failures. If a subject becomes unable to tolerate MTX at 25 mg doses, the folic acid dose may be increased from 1 to 2 m g/day and/or the MTX dosage may be 
decreased  to 20 or 15 mg, but to no less than 15 mg. Subjects who are unable to tolerate MTX at a minimum dose of 15 mg during the Run-in  Period regardless eGFR will be 
considered MTX Run-in Screen Failures. 
3. Subjects will be enrolled at the Day 1 Visit to receive pegloticase 8 mg IV every 2 weeks from Day 1 through Week 22, inclus ive. During this 24-week Pegloticase + MTX 
Treatment Period, subjects who meet the Individual Subject sUA Discontinuation Criteria or discontinue treatment for another re ason will remain in the trial for biweekly 
visits, including the Week 24/End of Trial/ET and 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-up Visits.  
4. Prior to Week 22, subjects who end treatment due to sUA level or other reasons should complete the End of Pegloticase Visit within 2 weeks of the last infusion and continue 
with trial procedures without infusion. Subjects will also complete all regularly scheduled Follow-up Visits, including the 30- Day Post-Treatment Follow-up email/phone call 
and Week 24/End of Trial/ET Visits. 
5. The Investigator or designee will collect a complete gout history, other relevant medical/surgical history. 
6. Medication history (i.e., prior medications) will include gout medications, starting at the time of diagnosis and up to scre ening visit, substance use history and all other 
medications up to the screening visit. Prior medications (not including gout medications and pegloticase) will be collected for  1 year prior to the screening visit. Detailed 
pegloticase use history, including reason for discontinuation and associated reactions, if any, will be collected.  
7. A complete physical examination, including assessment of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; ext remities; neurological status and musculoskeletal 
system, including an assessment for the presence of  as well as gout history and symptom severity, will be performed at the Scr eening Visit. A targeted physical 
examination per Investigator judgement will be conducted at all other indicated time points. On days when pegloticase is admini stered, the examination is conducted prior to 
pegloticase administration. At a minimum, the targeted physical ex amination should include assessment of heart, lungs and abdom en. Clinically significant findings from the 
targeted physical examinations will be recorded as AEs.  
8. Routine vital signs, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and heart rate, will be measured. Heart rate an d blood pressure measurements should be taken after 
the subject has been in a sitting position in a rested and calm state with proper positioning, including back support and feet flat on the floor, for at least 5 minutes. The 
subject s arm should be supported at heart level and the cuff placed on the bare arm. A large cuff should be used as needed to fit the upper arm and a consistent arm is to be 
used at each trial visit. The Korotkoff phase V will be used to determine diastolic blood pressure. During the Pegloticase + MT X Treatment Period visits, vital signs should be 
om the site. Height will be collected at the Screening 
Visit only. 
9. Weight should be measured in kilograms or pounds when the subject is not wearing shoes. On days when pegloticase is administ ered, weight should be recorded prior to 
pegloticase administration.  
10. Electrocardiogram should be completed during Screening and will be read at the site. When possible, a 12-lead electrocardio gram will also be performed at the time when a 
select AE of special interest (IR, anaphylaxis and major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as non-fatal stroke, non-fatal m yocardial infarction, cardiovascular death and 
congestive heart failure) is suspected. 
11. AEs/SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit. F or each AE, the Investigator will be asked to 
record if the event was possibly an IR or anaphylaxis and if so, will be prompted to complete additional electronic case report  forms. Females of childbearing potential will be 
asked to confirm if ovulation has occurred since the last dose of MTX. If the subject had not ovulated, a urine pregnancy test will be required.  
12. The initial DECT scan will be performed after the Screening Visit, during the MTX Run-in Period and prior to the Day 1 Visi t. Subsequent DECT scans may be performed 
±10 days from the scheduled visit date. Subjects who end pegloticase infusions prior to Week 24 should follow the scheduled tim e points and have a DECT scan at the End of 
Pegloticase (if applicable) and Week 24/End of Trial/ET Visits (detailed guidance is provided within the Imaging Manual). DECT will be carried out for all subjects where 
the site has the capability to conduct the test. 
13. MTX will be dispensed and brought back to check compliance at each infusion visit. MTX should be injected 1 to 3 days prior  to each pegloticase infusion; however, if a

 14. Subjects will take folic acid at a starting dose of 1 mg orally every day beginning Week -6 (preferably 2 days prior to the  first dose of MTX) continuing until prior to the End 
of Pegloticase (if applicable) or until 1 week after the last pegloticase infusion for subjects who have not stopped pegloticas e treatment. The folic acid dose can be increased 
or an alternative folate supplement can be used (see Section 9.4.6.3.2.2  for detailed instructions). 
15. Before a subject begins the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, he or she must have been taking at least 1 standard gout fl are prophylaxis regimen (i.e., colchicine and/or 
NSAIDs and/or low-dose prednisone 10 mg/day) per protocol for s per 
American College of Rheumatology guidelines ( FitzGerald  et al, 2020). Gout flare prophylaxis from Week 26 to the end of the trial will be administered, if needed, at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator.   
16. IR prophylaxis includes fexofenadine (180 mg orally) and prednisone (50 mg orally) administered the night before each infus ion; fexofenadine (180 mg orally), famotidine 
(20 mg orally), montelukast (10 mg orally) and acetaminophen (1000 mg orally) administered on the morning of each pegloticase i nfusion and methylprednisolone (125 mg 
IV) over an infusion duration between 10 and 30 minutes, prior to each pegloticase infusion.  
17.  
 
  
18. Serum samples for evaluation of  will be collected prior to the first dose of MTX at Week -6, prior to 
pegloticase infusion on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22 and 36; and at the non-infusion End of Pegloticase (if applicable) or t he Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/ET Visit. In the 
event of an AE suspected to be an IR, a serum sample will be collected at that time or at the subsequent visit for evaluation o f pegloticase antibodies. 
19.  Serum samples for measurement of sUA levels will be collected at the Screening, Week -6 (prior to the first dose of MTX) a nd Week -2 Visits. On Day 1, a pre- and 
post-infusion sUA will be collected to be shipped to the central laboratory. For the remainder of trial visits beginning at Wee k 2 during the Pegloticase +MTX Treatment 
Period, 2 sUA samples will be collected within 48 hou
sample will be sent to the central laboratory (the central laboratory sample may be drawn separately from the local collection) . Additional serum samples for sUA levels will 
be collected after the end of each pegloticase infusion prior to discharge at Weeks 10, 12, 14, 20, 22, 32, 34, 44 and 46. Sing le serum samples for measurement of sUA will 
also be collected at non-infusion visits at Weeks 21 and 23 and at the End of Pegloticase (if applicable) or the Week 24 or 48/ End of Trial/ET Visit. Serum for sUA analysis 
will also be collected following the first 7 pegloticase infusions (Infusion 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) at Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 , 10 and 12, respectively. The sUA will be collected 
at the following non-infusion days:  1st (~24 hours), 4th (~96 hours), 7th (~168 hours) and 10th (~240 hours) day after each of the first 4 infusions, and 1st (~24 hours), and 7th 
(~168 hours) day after each infusion number 5, 6, 7.  If infusion intervals of less than 2 weeks should occur due to scheduling  issues the 1st day (~24hours) samples must be 
obtained at a minimum and also the 7th day (~168 hours) if feasible. 
20.  
21. G6PD testing should be performed by the central laboratory; however, if performed by the local laboratory, normal ranges sh ould be provided.   
22. Optional serum and urine samples will be collected from each consenting subject prior to the first dose of MTX at Week -6, prior to pegloticase infusion on Day 1 and at 
Weeks 14, 24, 36 and the End of Pegloticase (if applicable) and Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/ET Visits. 
23. For women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit. A urine pregnancy tes t will be performed at the End of Pegloticase (if 
applicable), Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/ET and 30 days after the last MTX dose if it is determined that the subject has not ovu lated; a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
prior to MTX dosing during the MTX Run-in Period and prior to each pegloticase infusion at all other indicated visits. 
24.  
 
25. Thirty (30) days after the last MTX dose or pegloticase infusion (whichever is later), subjects will be contacted by teleph one or email to review AEs, SAEs and concomitant 
medications. Subjects who are females of childbearing potential will be asked to confirm that ovulation has occurred. If the su bject has not ovulated, the subject will be 
requested to return to the site for a urine pregnancy test. 
26. Male subjects who are non-vasectomized will be asked 3 mont hs after MTX discontinuation regarding partner pregnancy.

 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background 
7.1.1 Gout 
Gout affects approximately 4% of the United States population, is the most common form of 
inflammatory arthritis in men and is associated with decreased quality of life ( Saag  and Choi, 
2006; Singh and Strand, 2008; Zhu et al, 2011; Sattui  et al, 2014). The frequency of gout is 
increasing worldwide, with prevalence rates estimated to be as high as 7% in older men 
(Mikuls  et al, 2005; Saag and Choi, 2006; Roddy  and Doherty, 2010). While the exact 
prevalence is unknown, as many as 200,000 persons in the United States experience chronic 
symptoms of gout, despite trials of oral urate-lowering therapy. Uncontrolled gout, which is 
sometimes referred to as chronic refractory gout, is characterized by ongoing symptoms of active 
disease and a failure to control/maintain serum uric acid (sUA) <6 mg/dL with conventional 
xanthine oxidase inhibitors (i.e., allopurinol and febuxostat) and uricosuric agents 
(i.e., probenecid) ( Brook et al, 2010; Wertheimer  et al, 2013; Khanna  et al, 2016). These patients 
often have significant, disabling urate deposits in soft tissues and bone known as tophi. 
7.1.2 Pegloticase 
Pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA®, a recombinant modified mammalian urate oxidase [uricase]), is 
indicated for treatment-failure gout to control hyperuricemia and to manage the signs and 
symptoms of gout. Pegloticase was granted orphan designation by the FDA on 21 February 2001 
(Orphan Drug Act [ODA] #00-1356) and pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks was approved by the 
FDA on 14 September 2010 for the treatment of adult patients with chronic gout refractory to 
conventional therapy. 
Two replicate pivotal Phase 3 trials for pegloticase were undertaken to establish the efficacy and 
safety of the product. The primary endpoint was defined as plasma uric acid (highly correlated to 
sUA) reduction to <6 mg/dL for 80% of the time in Months 3 and 6 combined. The pooled 
response rate for pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks was 42%, versus a placebo response rate of 0% 
(Sundy  et al, 2011). There was also a greater reduction in us in the 
every 2 weeks treatment group, and favorable effect of pegloticase treatment in the reduction of 
the number of tender and swollen joints. In subsequent open-label extension trials, pegloticase 
led to continued control of plasma uric acid, reduction in gout flares and continued resolution of 
tophi, suggesting continuing benefit with extended pegloticase treatment beyond the initial 
6 months of therapy, particularly in subjects who met responder criteria in the placebo-controlled 
trials. 
In the Phase 3 pivotal trials, deaths, SAEs, other adverse events (AEs), as well as the laboratory 
abnormalities were generally equally distributed across placebo and pegloticase treatment 
groups, with the clear exception of gout flares and infusion reactions (IRs). Pegloticase-treated 
subjects exhibited a higher rate of gout flares during Months 1-3 as uric acid was being acutely 
lowered, then a decrease in gout flares compared with placebo during Months 4-6. Despite use of 
prophylactic medications against hypersensitivity, including administration of corticosteroids, 
antihistamine and acetaminophen, in advance of each pegloticase infusion, IRs were seen in

 22/85 (26%) of subjects receiving the 8 mg every 2 weeks regimen. There was no specified 
definition of anaphylaxis in the Phase 3 protocols and no investigator-reported events of 
anaphylaxis in the Phase 3 trials with pegloticase. However, in a post hoc review applying the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network criteria ( Sampson et al, 2006), it was determined that across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 
program, anaphylaxis occurred in 6.5% of subjects treated with pegloticase every 2 weeks. 
Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 2 hours after treatment. Manifestations included 
wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or 
urticaria. All of these events had relatively rapid resolution with cessation of infusion.  
In a post hoc analysis, the apparent role of immunogenicity in both loss of urate-lowering effect 
and incidence of IRs was appreciated. Only 2% of subjects with anti-pegloticase antibody titers 
exceeding 1:2430 maintained a urate-lowering response to pegloticase compared with 63% of 
subjects who were treated for at least 2 months without developing high-titer antibodies 
(p<0.001) ( Sundy  et al, 2011). The incidence of IRs was higher among subjects who developed 
high-titer antibodies compared with those who had titers that did not exceed 1:2430 
(60% vs 19%; p <0.001) ( Sundy  et al, 2011). In addition, most IRs occurred when sUA levels 
were >6 mg/dL. Retrospective analyses showed that the loss of urate-lowering efficacy, as 
reflected by sUA of >6 mg/dL, preceded a subject20 (91%) of 22 subjects treated with pegloticase every 2 weeks.  
Reducing anti-drug antibodies with concomitant administration of the immunomodulatory agent 
methotrexate (MTX) has been shown to be useful with other infused products that lead to 
immunogenicity, such as adalimumab, in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis treatment 
(Burmester  et al, 2015).  
Because of the limited treatment options for patients with uncontrolled gout, immunomodulators 
have been co-administered with pegloticase in an effort to prevent anti-drug antibody formation 
and increase the length of effective pegloticase therapy, similar to what is done in other 
rheumatic diseases treated with biologics (Krieckaert et al, 2012; Lie et al, 2015). The successful 
use of immunomodulators (MTX, azathioprine, leflunomide and cyclosporine) with pegloticase 
in patients who receive pegloticase treatment for the first time is supported by case reports that 
examined different immunomodulatory agents with varying doses, schedules and routes given 
prior to the start of pegloticase ( Hershfield et al, 2014; Berhanu et al, 2017; Freyne 2018; 
Albert et al, 2019; Botson and Peterson, 2019; Bessen et al, 2019a; Bessen et al, 2019b; 
Rainey et al, 2020; Masri  et al, 2020). In case reports of MTX with pegloticase, the proportion of 
responders (based on each case patients) ( Botson and Peterson, 
2019), 100% (7/7 patients) (Bessen et al, 2019a; Bessen et al, 2019b) and 80% (8/10 patients) 
(Albert et al, 2019); these responder rates are higher than the 42% rate observed in early Phase 3 
clinical trials of pegloticase alone ( Sundy  et al, 2011). Similar to results of case studies, a recent 
prospective open-label clinical trial reported that a high proportion of subjects treated 
concomitantly with MTX (oral 15 mg/week started 4 weeks prior to the first pegloticase dose 
and throughout the pegloticase treatment period) maintained therapeutic response to pegloticase 
at 6 months (79% [11/14]) ( Botson et al, 2020).

 7.1.2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Unlike most mammalian species, humans lack the urate oxidase enzymatic pathway for the 
oxidation and disposition of uric acid and are susceptible to the development of gout. To develop 
an animal model of hyperuricemia and gout for a therapeutic uricase proof-of-concept study, a 
mouse was genetically modified by knocking out its endogenous uricase gene ( Uox). This 
genetic lesion results in a marked elevation of plasma uric acid levels, leading to deposition of 
urate in kidney tissue and causing a profound defect in renal concentrating ability and 
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The studies in the mouse Uox-/- system demonstrate the 
therapeutic potential of pegloticase administration for the treatment of hyperuricemia and  
In addition, in nonclinical toxicity studies in which uric acid levels were measured, a decline in 
uric acid levels following administration of pegloticase (all pegloticase doses associated with 
these studies) was observed. 
7.1.2.3 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics 
A series of pharmacokinetic (PK) trials was conducted in rats, rabbits, dogs and pigs to 
determine the circulation half-life and bioavailability of pegloticase administration as a function 
of the route of administration. Plasma pegloticase levels were determined by assaying uricase 
bioactivity in plasma. As part of the PK trials, antibody levels in plasma were determined 
2 weeks after the last injection in the rabbit, dog and rat. Collectively, the results of the PK trials 
in these animals lend support to the expectation of high bioavailability and prolonged retention 
of pegloticase after administration in humans.  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of pegloticase were examined in rat studies. 
Approximately 70% of the dose was excreted in the urine during the course of 7 days after 
injection.  
7.1.2.4 Toxicology 
The results from acute and chronic toxicity studies did not indicate any toxic or adverse effect of 
pegloticase administered with a human exposure 645 times higher than that in the Phase 3 
clinical trials (8 mg every 2 weeks) based on the area under the curve values from the 39-week, 
repeat-dose, dog study (high-dose).  
An observation in the chronic toxicology studies is the finding of a dose-dependent increase in 
vacuolated cells. There were no associated clinical manifestations in any animals in which 
vacuolated cells were present. Evidence of vacuolated cells, especially in the spleen, has been 
observed with pegloticase administration in all the chronic toxicity studies as well as the 
embryo/fetal development and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies in the 
rat. It is thought that vacuolation of spleen macrophages is a result of lysosomal overloading

vacuoles were seen in the cytopl asm of endothelial cells in the in timal lining of the aorta. In the 
adrenal gland, vacuoles were loca ted within cortical cells in the zona reticularis and zona 
fasciculata. The clinical significance of these findings and functional c onsequences are unknown.

information. 
7.1.2.5  Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Pegloticase levels were determined in serum base d on measurements of uricase enzyme activity.  
Following single intravenous (IV) infusions of 0.5 mg to 12 mg pegloticase in 23 patients with 
symptomatic gout, maximum serum concentrations of pegloticase increased in proportion to the 
dose administered.  
The PK of pegloticase has not been studied in children and adolescents.  
In patients undergoing hemodialysis (Trial M0403 ), pegloticase serum concentrations were not 
affected in a clinically meaningfully manner by 2 hemodialysis sessions. Pre- and post-dialyzer 
samples, as well as samples taken during dialysis , demonstrated that tria l drug was not removed 
by the dialysis process. 
No formal trials have been  conducted to examine the eff ects of hepatic impairment on 
. 
7.1.2.6  Risks of Pegloticase 
The risks of pegloticase use are detailed in the full prescribing information and include: 
 IRs, including anaphylaxis 
 Hemolysis and methemoglobine mia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD) deficiency 
 Gout flares 
 Congestive heart failure exacerbation 
Subjects with diseases or conditions (e.g., non-com pensated congestive heart failure) that could 
potentially place them at increased risk for these events will be excluded from the trial. 
It is required that all subjects receive prophylac tic treatment to reduce the risk of acute gout 
flares, unless medically contraindi cated or not tolerated, as noted in the pegloticase prescribing 
information. Subjects will begin at  least 1 protocol-specified st andard gout flare prophylaxis 
regimen (i.e., colchicine and/or  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and/or low-dose 
prednisone 10 mg f pegloticase and should continue 
flare prophylaxis for at least 6 months per American College of Rheumatology guidelines 
(FitzGerald  et al, 2020). CCI

 Since IRs can occur, all subjects will receive pre-treatment prophylaxis consisting of 
antihistamine, acetaminophen, a leukotriene inhibitor and corticosteroids prior to each 
pegloticase infusion of pegloticase. To standardize this regimen, subjects will receive, at a 
minimum, fexofenadine (180 mg orally) and prednisone (50 mg orally) the night before each 
infusion, fexofenadine (180 mg orally), famotidine (20 mg orally), montelukast (10 mg orally) 
and acetaminophen (1000 mg orally) the morning of each pegloticase infusion and 
methylprednisolone (125 mg IV) given over an infusion duration between 10 and 30 minutes, 
prior to each pegloticase infusion. 
The risk of anaphylaxis and IRs is higher in patients whose sUA level increases to >6 mg/dL. 
Monitoring sUA and discontinuation of pegloticase therapy in patients who lose the ability to 
maintain uric acid <6 mg/dL can lead to the avoidance of the majority of IRs ( Keenan et al, 
2019).  
Refer to the current version of the FDA-approved KRYSTEXXA Full Prescribing Information 
and the KRYSTEXXA® ochure for detailed information.  
7.1.3 Methotrexate Overview and Risks 
MTX is a folic acid reductase inhibitor used as a disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug for the 
treatment of autoimmune diseases. MTX is a drug well-known to rheumatologists, has a 
well-established and understood safety profile and is known to prevent the formation of anti-drug 
antibodies ( Strand et al, 2017). 
 
AEs that may be experienced by subjects treated with MTX include: 
 Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis; 
 Hematologic and oncologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; 
 Hepatic: hepatotoxicity, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, increased serum bilirubin, 
increased serum transaminases; 
 Infection: increased susceptibility to infection; and 
 General: malaise, fatigue, dizziness, alopecia, photosensitivity.  
Additionally, MTX can cause fetal death or teratogenic effects. If either partner is receiving 
MTX, pregnancy should be avoided during therapy and for a minimum of 3 months after MTX 
therapy for the non-vasectomized male. For females of childbearing potential, pregnancy should 
be avoided for at least 1 ovulatory cycle after MTX therapy.  
Baseline assessment will include a complete blood count with differential, hepatic enzymes, 
renal function tests and a chest x-ray.  
MTX is available in both oral and injection formulations; however, subcutaneous (SC) 
administration may overcome some limitations of oral MTX therapy. In a trial of the PK profiles 
of MTX following oral and SC administration, the bioavailability of MTX was greater at all dose 
levels tested (10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 25 mg) for SC compared with oral administration, and a

Date: 02 May 2022 Protocol: HZNP-KRY-407
  Version 2.0, amendment 1, admin change1 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 47 of 168 
 dose-proportional increase in PK parameters was noted across all doses (Schiff and Sadowski 
2017).  
In addition, various clinical experiences suggest that SC MTX is more effective than oral MTX 
and may provide significant benefit even in patients in whom oral MTX proved to be inadequate. 
The increased efficacy of SC MTX resulting from higher drug exposure compared with oral 
MTX has been associated with a similar safety profile as oral MTX and in some reports even a 
lower frequency of gastrointestinal complaints (Vena et al, 2018). In a 6-month prospective, 
randomized, double-blind controlled trial of oral and SC MTX administration in 384 patients 
with active rheumatoid arthritis, SC administration was significantly more effective than oral 
administration at the same MTX dosage, with no difference in tolerability (Braun et al, 2008). 
This trial will use SC MTX to reduce and/or prevent the formation of anti-drug antibodies 
because subjects in this trial previously received pegloticase but did not maintain an sUA 
response, presumably due to anti-drug antibody formation.  
Refer to the current version of the FDA-approved RASUVO Full Prescribing Information for 
detailed information concerning the safety profile of MTX. 
7.2 Rationale for This Trial 
Although pegloticase is highly effective, when administered without an immunomodulator, the 
formation of anti-drug antibodies results in a high non-responder rate. In Phase 3 trials in which 
pegloticase was administered without concomitant immunomodulation, 52% of subjects were 
non-responders, leaving many subjects with no alternative therapy options, since pegloticase is 
the last line of defense. Among patients who have previously failed pegloticase, there is an 
unmet need for treatment.  
Retreatment with an immunomodulator following loss of efficacy of other biologics has been 
shown to regain efficacy. In inflammatory bowel disease patients with loss of response due to 
immunogenicity, the addition of immunomodulators to therapy resulted in undetectable anti-drug 
antibody levels and was an effective approach to recapture clinical response (Ben-Horin et al, 
2013; Strik et al, 2017; Ungar et al, 2017).  
Prophylactic use of immunosuppressive therapy, such as MTX with pegloticase may enable 
sustained treatment and improve outcomes. In case reports of 2 subjects, MTX was used as an 
adjunct to pegloticase treatment for refractory tophaceous gout. In 1 subject, high sUA levels 
developed prior to the third infusion. Adjunctive MTX treatment restored pegloticase response 
and the patients sUA levels decreased and remained low for the remainder of treatment. Oral 
MTX was initiated at the first infusion in a second subject. Following a lapse in MTX 
compliance, low sUA levels achieved initially were increased. Re-initiation of MTX restored 
pegloticase response and the patient tolerated subsequent infusions (Bessen et al, 2019a).  
Although there may be concerns for more severe IRs in this trial population upon retreatment 
with pegloticase due to relationship between anti-drug antibody development and IRs, analysis 
of IR severity among subjects treated with pegloticase every 2 weeks and who had more than 
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA® IND: 010122

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 48 of 168 
 1 IR in the Phase 3 program showed that the majority (approximately 66%) had a second IR of 
the same or lower severity than the first IR.  
MTX is the most commonly used non-biological disease-modifying agent worldwide and is 
frequently used in combination with other biological therapies ( Strand et al, 2017). An oral MTX 
dose of 15 mg is currently being studied in the randomized controlled trial to confirm if MTX 
can prevent anti-drug antibodies formation to increase responder rate and reduce risk of IR. In 
this trial, a higher SC dose of 25 mg (for subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [15 mg for subjects with eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) will 
be used to increase the likelihood of success in those who previously failed pegloticase.  
7.3 Rationale for Dose Selection 
7.3.1 Pegloticase Dose Selection 
The dose of pegloticase and instructions for use are consistent with the current pegloticase 
prescribing information. Refer to the current version of the FDA-approved KRYSTEXXA Full 
Prescribing Information. 
7.3.2 Methotrexate Dose Selection 
MTX is among the most well-studied agents shown to reduce anti-drug antibodies in numerous 
trials ( Strand et al, 2017). MTX as monotherapy for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis is 
generally administered at doses of 7.5 to 15 mg/week, with doses titrated up as necessary and 
tolerated to 25 to 30 mg/week ( Visser  and van der Heijde, 2009; Ceponis  and Kavanaugh, 2010; 
Mouterde  et al, 2011; Mease  2013). These dose levels have generally been both effective and 
safe. A similar dose range of MTX has been used in combination with biologic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs when the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have 
been used as therapy for both rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, as well as other conditions 
(REMICADE Product Labeling, 2020; HUMIRA Product Labeling, 2018; CIMZIA Product 
Labeling, 2019). As discussed in Section 7.1.3, in the current trial, MTX will be administered 
SC, given its potential superior efficacy compared with oral administration.  
A retrospective chart review of the effect of MTX and pegloticase in 10 uncontrolled gout 
patients provides support for the safety of the SC MTX with pegloticase regimen. Nine patients 
began SC MTX (25 mg weekly) prior to initiating pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks; the 
remaining patient began oral MTX (12.5 mg weekly) 14 days after the first pegloticase infusion. 
When MTX was administered with pegloticase, either as SC or oral formulation, the majority of 
patients (80%; 8/10) received at least 12 pegloticase infusions, were considered responders and 
no new safety concerns emerged ( Albert  et al, 2019).  
The MTX dose in the current trial will be based on eGFR because renal excretion is the primary 
route of MTX elimination.  
Bressolle  et al. (1998) have shown that in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the half-life of MTX is 
doubled when creatinine clearance decreases to <45 mL/min. The RASUVO Full Prescribing 
Information indicates that the dose of MTX should be reduced in patients who have renal

 impairment. The 2008 American College of Rheumatology recommendations for use of MTX 
(Saag  et al, 2008) indicate that MTX is contraindicated when the estimated creatinine clearance 
is <30 mL/min. Based on this literature, only subjects with an eGFR 0 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be 
eligible for enrollment. In this trial, a higher SC dose of 25 mg (for subjects with eGFR 
45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [15 mg for subjects with eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be used 
to increase the likelihood of success in those who previously failed pegloticase.

The overall objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegloticase and MTX 
co-administered in subjects with uncontrolled go ut who previously received pegloticase without 
a concomitant immunomodulator but did not maintain an sUA res ponse (i.e., unable to maintain 
sUA <6 mg/dL while being treated with peglotic ase alone and/or stopped pegloticase treatment 
due to an IR).  
Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to demonstrate that the response rate during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 
22, 23 and 24), as measured by the sustained normalization of sUA to <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6, is greater than 20% in subjects receiving pegloticase with MTX.  
Secondary Objectives 
To evaluate the effect of pegloticase with MTX on the following: 
 The response rate during Month 3 (Weeks 10, 12 and 14), as measured by the sustained 
normalization of sUA to <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 3.  
 The proportion of subjects who experienced any of the following events from Day 1 to 
Week 24: IR leading to discontinuation of treatment, anaphylaxis or meeting Individual 
Subject sUA Discontinuation Criteria.  
 The change from Baseline in urate depos ition volume, measured by dual-energy 
computed tomography (DECT) scan. 
 The change from Baseline in Health Assess ment Questionnaire (HAQ) - Disability Index 
(HAQ-DI) score.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label trial of pegloticase with MTX in adult subjects with 
uncontrolled gout who were previously treated with pegloticase without a concomitant 
immunomodulator and stopped pegloticase due to failure to maintain sUA response and/or a 
clinically mild IR. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. The treatment period with 
pegloticase + MTX will be approximately 24 weeks, with optional extension up to 48 weeks. 
The trial design will include 5 distinct components:  
1) a Screening Period, lasting up to 42 days;  
2) a 6-week MTX Tolerability Assessment Period (hereafter referred to as the MTX Run-in 
Period);  
3) a 24-week Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, which will include a Week 24/End of 
Trial/Early Termination Visit (subjects that end MTX and pegloticase treatment prior to 
the Week 24 will remain on trial for follow up until the Week 24 visit);  
4) an Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period from Week 24 to Week 48, if a subject 
may gain further benefit with additional pegloticase treatment per the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator, which will include a Week 48/Optional End of Trial/Optional Early 
Termination Visit and  
5) a 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-up (Phone/Email) 30 days after the last pegloticase 
infusion or last dose of MTX (for subjects who are unable to tolerate MTX during the 
MTX Run-in Period and do not dose pegloticase). Subjects that end MTX and pegloticase 
treatment prior to Week 24 and remain on trial for at least 30 days prior to Week 24 will 
complete the 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-Up as part of the visits following the End of 
Pegloticase visit. 
All subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will begin titrating up to a once weekly SC 
MTX at a target dose of 25 mg 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 15 mg 
<45 mL/min/1.73 m2) for 6 weeks prior to the first dose of pegloticase. Subjects will also take 
folic acid at a starting dose of 1 mg orally every day beginning at Week -6 (preferably 2 days 
prior to the first dose of MTX) continuing until prior to the End of Pegloticase Visit (if 
applicable) or until 1 week after the last pegloticase infusion for subjects who have not stopped 
pegloticase treatment. A higher folic acid dose or an alternative folate supplement will be 
allowed (see Section 9.4.1.3 for specific instructions). 
Subjects must be able to tolerate MTX at a minimum dose of 15 mg during the 6-week MTX 
Run-in Period to be eligible to participate in the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, regardless 
of Baseline eGFR. Subjects who are unable to tolerate MTX 15 mg during the MTX Run-in 
Period will be considered MTX Run-in Screen Failures.

 Female subjects of childbearing potential who inj ect at least 1 dose of MTX will receive a safety 
follow-up phone call/e-mail a pproximately 30 days after the last dose of MTX to verify that at 
least 1 ovulatory cycle has occurred since the last dose of MTX. If the subject has not ovulated, a 
urine pregnancy test will be performed. For thos e subjects who inject at least 1 dose of MTX and 
who are non-vasectomized males, an inquiry 
of MTX regarding partner pregnancy. 
All subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete the MTX Run-in Period will 
be considered enrolled subjects and will receive the first pegloticase infusion on Day 1. All subsequent doses and trial visits will be  scheduled based on the Day 1 Visit date. 
Prior to the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, subjects will begin taking at least 1 standard 
gout flare prophylaxis regimen (i.e., colchicine  and/or NSAIDs and/or low-dose prednisone 
 mg/day) per protocol 
at least 6 months per American College of Rheumatology guidelines ( FitzGerald  et al, 2020). For 
IR prophylaxis, fexofenadine (180 mg orally) and prednisone (50 mg orally) will be taken the night before each pegloticase infusion; fexofenadi ne (180 mg orally), famotidine (20 mg orally), 
montelukast (10 mg orally) and acetaminophen (1000 mg orally) will be taken the morning of 
each pegloticase infusion; methylprednisolone ( 125 mg IV), over an infusion duration between 
10 and 30 minutes, will be administered pr ior to each pegl oticase infusion.  
During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Peri od, pegloticase 8 mg will be administered IV 
every 2 weeks from Day 1 through the Week 22/W eek 46, after all predose trial visit assessments 
have been completed at each visit. The date, st art and stop time of infusion will be recorded.  
During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, subjects will be instructed to inject MTX 
weekly on the same day each week, within 1 to 3 days prior to each pegloticase infusion (on the 
weeks when pegloticase is administered); howev er, if a subject does not do so, MTX must be 
be injected after the last pegloticase infusion fo r subjects who have not stopped pegloticase due 
to individual subject sUA disconti nuation criteria. If the subject discontinues pegloticase due to 
the stopping rule or other reason, MTX and fo lic acid should also be discontinued.  
After Day 1, if a subject becomes unable to tolera te MTX, the folic acid dose can be increased, 
an alternative folate supplement may be us ed and/or the MTX dosage may be reduced or 
discontinued based on pre- defined criteria (see Section 9.4.6.3.2.2  for detailed instructions) and 
the subject may remain in the trial and continue  pegloticase infusions. Every attempt should be 
made to re-start the MTX in subjects once thei r MTX-associated symptoms have improved or 
their laboratory test s have normalized.  
The Investigator will review th e subject clinical status and  
(Appendix 17.8 ) at Week -6; prior to pegloticase infu sion at the Week 24 and Week 36 Visits 
(subjects who may gain further benefit beyond 12 infusions and elect to receive pegloticase + 
MTX during the Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extens ion Period); and at the End of Pegloticase 
(if applicable) and Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visits.  CCI

 After the Week 24 or 48 Visit (or End of Pegloticase Visit [if applicable]) or upon pegloticase 
discontinuation, subjects should resume regular care for gout per the judgment of the treating 
physician, including resumption of urate-lowering therapy, if appropriate.  
Two sequential cohorts of subjects will be enrolled in this trial. Cohort 1 is targeted to enroll 
10 subjects who previously failed to maintain sUA response with pegloticase monotherapy and 
stopped pegloticase treatment without a history of pegloticase-related IR. After 7 and 10 subjects 
in Cohort 1 complete at least 6 infusion visits, safety assessments of IR and anaphylaxis from 
 will be performed by the Safety Review Team (comprising members of 
the Horizon Clinical Development and Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance Teams) based on 
pre-determined tolerability criteria. If a subject discontinues treatment or discontinues the trial 
prior to the 6th infusion, their available data will be included in the safety assessment. If the 
safety assessment during Cohort 1 indicates that the pegloticase infusions are well tolerated 
based on the pre-determined criteria (see tolerability criteria), then the trial can begin enrolling 
Cohort 2. If the safety assessment indicates that the pegloticase infusions are not well tolerated 
based on the pre-determined tolerability criteria, then the trial will cease to screen and enroll new 
subjects. Subjects who are ongoing and benefitting from continued treatment, as determined by 
the Principal Investigator at the time of the termination of new subject screenings, will be 
permitted to continue treatment and trial visits.  
The aim is to enroll up to 20 subjects in Cohort 2; subjects who failed to maintain sUA response 
with pegloticase monotherapy and or experienced a pegloticase related clinically mild IR . After 
3, 6, 10, 15 and 20 subjects in Cohort 2 complete 6 infusion visits, safety assessments of IR and Team. If the 
safety assessment indicates that the pegloticase infusions are not well tolerated based on the pre-
determined tolerability criteria (see tolerability criteria) or in the absence of subjects with a 
history of pegloticase-related clinically mild IR, the trial will continue enrolling subjects without 
a history of pegloticase-related clinically mild IR to reach a total of 30 subjects enrolled for the 
trial.  
Depending on any potential safety signals reported (e.g., serious IR or any SAE related to 
pegloticase infusion), regular quarterly and/or ad hoc safety assessments will be conducted 
during the trial as specified in the Safety Management Plan and the Safety Review Team Charter. 
The regular quarterly reviews will include review of the database by the Safety Review Team 
and will be conducted as set out in the Safety Management Plan. The first safety review meeting 
will occur approximately after the first 3 subjects in Cohort 1 complete at least 12 weeks of the 
Pegloticase + MTX Treatment period (6 infusion visits). The Safety Review Team could stop the 
trial for other significant safety reasons.  
If 3 events of anaphylaxis (as assessed by PI)  occur, an Adjudication Committee (composed of 
independent experts external to Horizon) ( Section 9.5.6 ) will be established for this trial to 
adjudicate the AESIs of Anaphylaxis at a frequency defined in the Adjudication Committee 
Charter. The AESI of IR, MACE and gout flare will not be adjudicated.

 9.2 Discussion of Trial Design 
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label, efficacy and safety trial of pegloticase in combination 
with SC MTX in adult subjects with uncontrolled gout, who previously received pegloticase 
without a concomitant immunomodulator and stopped pegloticase due to a clinically mild 
pegloticase-related IR and/or failure to maintain sUA response.  
Immunogenicity (anti-pegloticase antibodies) in response to pegloticase therapy can lead to loss 
of therapeutic response and/or AEs, including IRs. For patients who previously lost therapeutic 
response to pegloticase treatment without a co-concomitant immunomodulator due to 
immunogenicity, a potential strategy to regain therapeutic efficacy with pegloticase is 
pretreatment followed by co-administration of immune-modulating therapy. MTX is the most 
commonly used non-biological disease-modifying agent worldwide and is frequently used in 
combination with other biological therapies ( Strand et al, 2017), and has been shown to recapture 
clinical response of other biologic treatment after initial therapeutic efficacy is lost due to 
immunogenicity (Ben-Horin et al, 2013; Strik et al, 2017; Ungar et al, 2017). In the current trial, 
MTX given SC will be used as an immunomodulator co-administered with pegloticase to 
subjects who previously failed pegloticase alone.  
This trial will include up to a 6-week Screening Period, a 6-week MTX Run-in Period, a 
24-week Pegloticase + MTX Period, an Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period from 
Week 24 to Week 48, if a subject may gain further benefit with additional pegloticase treatment 
per the discretion of the Principal Investigator and a Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  
The Safety Review Team ( Section 9.5.5) will assess the tolerability of pegloticase using the 
tolerability criteria (see Section 9.5.4.1.1.5).

9.3.3.1.1  Trial Considerations for Subjects Ending Pegloticase Infusions Prior to Week 24 
or Week 48 
 MTX, along with folic acid, will be discontinued at the time of cessation of pegloticase 
infusions prior to Week 24 or 48.  
 All subjects will complete the End of Peglo ticase Visit and will remain in the trial 
through Week 24 (if End of Pegloticase Visit occurred before Week 24) regardless of 
whether they stop infusions due to sUA stopping  rules or other reason (e.g., withdrawal 
of consent for pegloticase infusions). 
 Subjects are encouraged to continue to par ticipate in all visits, including the 30-Day 
Post-Treatment Follow-up and Week 24/End of  Trial/Early Termination Visits, but are 
especially encouraged to complete trial visits at the trial site for key efficacy and safety 
assessments at Weeks 10, 12, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24, so that sUA laboratory and other 
key assessments can be completed. During visits between these key efficacy and safety 
collection visits, in subjects who have st opped infusions, subjects may complete trial 
visits in person or via telephone to collect  AE, concomitant medication and gout flare 
information.  
 Activities related to pre-/post-infusion monitoring or medication dispensation will not be 
completed once a subject has stopped peglo ticase infusions. These activities include:  
o MTX compliance/reconciliation; 
o IR prophylaxis; 
o IR prophylaxis compliance; 
o Folic acid compliance; 
o Pegloticase infusion; 
o ; 
o Pre-infusion  sampling; and  
o MTX drug/dispensation related items. 
 Re-introduction of oral urate-lowering ther apies should not start until after the Week 24 
or 48/End of Trial/Early Ter mination Visit (or End of Pegloticase Visit [if applicable] 
laboratory tests are collected.  
If a subject discontinues treatment or discontinues the trial prior to the 6th infusion, their 
available data will be in cluded in the safety assessment conduc ted by the Safety Review Team.  
Subjects who elect to receive pegloticase + MTX during the Optional Pegloticase + MTX 
Extension Period will complete the 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-up after the final pegloticase infusion but are not required to return for biweekly visits.  
9.3.3.2  Removal of Subjects From Trial 
For subjects who discontinue from the trial prior to Week 24 or 48, the reason for 
discontinuation from the trial should be record ed on the eCRF using 1 of the following 
categories: CCI

 Death. 
9.3.4 Replacement Policy 
9.3.4.1 Subjects 
In general, subjects who prematurely discontinue from the trial for any reason will not be 
replaced. An exception may be made for subjects who are unevaluable due to the impact of the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated restrictions on movement and 
work. Subjects unable to receive treatment or be evaluated due to restrictions during the 
COVID-19 pandemic may be replaced, at the discretion of the Sponsor. This may result in more 
subjects than originally planned being enrolled into the trial to allow for the originally planned 
number to be evaluable for the primary efficacy analysis. 
9.3.4.2 Centers 
A center may be closed and/or replaced for the following administrative reasons:   Excessively slow recruitment. 
 Poor protocol adherence. 
9.3.4.3 Screen Failures 
Subjects who do not meet all of the inclusion criteria or meet any of the exclusion criteria will be 
considered screen failures.  
In addition, subjects who are unable to tolerate MTX at a SC dose of at least 15 mg weekly 
during the MTX Run-in Period will be considered MTX Run-in Screen Failures.  
Subjects who fail screening or are an MTX Run-in Screen Failure may be allowed to rescreen, or 
retest laboratories for the trial if both the Investigator and Sponsor are in agreement regarding 
rescreening/retesting and if the Investigator determines that the subject can satisfy all of the 
eligibility criteria. 
9.4 Treatments 
9.4.1 Treatments Administered 
9.4.1.1 Methotrexate 
During the MTX Run-in Period, which begins 6 weeks prior to the first dose of pegloticase, 
subjects with 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 will inject SC MTX weekly at a starting dose of 15 mg 
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA® IND: 010122 
Date: 02 May 2022 Protocol: HZNP-KRY-407
  Version 2.0, amendment 1, admin change1

 at Weeks -6 and Week -5 increasing to 25 mg at Week -4 and continuing weekly throughout the 
45 mL/min/1.73 m2 will inject SC MTX weekly at a starting 
dose of 10 mg at Week -6 and Week -5 increasing to 15 mg at Week -4 and continuing weekly 
throughout the trial. If a subject becomes unable to tolerate MTX at 25 mg doses, the folic acid 
dose may be increased from 1 to 2 mg/day and/or the MTX dosage may be decreased to 20 or 
15 mg, but to no less than 15 mg. Subjects who cannot tolerate MTX at a minimum dose of 
15 mg during the MTX Run-in Period will be considered MTX Run-in Screen Failures, 
regardless of their Baseline eGFR.  
During the MTX Run-in Period, if a dose is missed, it should be injected as soon as it is 
remembered. If it is within 48 hours of the next scheduled dose, the subject will be instructed to 
skip the missed dose and resume at the next regularly scheduled time. If a subject misses more 
than 2 doses of MTX during the 6-week Run-in Period, the Principal Investigator should contact 
the Sponsor to discuss eligibility of the subject for enrollment in the Pegloticase + MTX 
Treatment Period. 
During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, subjects will be instructed to inject MTX 
weekly on the same day each week, within 1 to 3 days prior to each pegloticase infusion (on the 
weeks when pegloticase is administered); however, if a subject does not do so, MTX must be be injected after the last pegloticase infusion for subjects who have not stopped pegloticase due 
to individual subject sUA discontinuation criteria. If the subject discontinues pegloticase due to 
the stopping rule or other reason, MTX should also be discontinued. 
After Day 1, if a subject becomes unable to tolerate MTX, the folic acid dose can be increased, 
an alternative folate supplement may be used and/or the MTX dosage may be reduced or 
discontinued based on pre-defined criteria and the subject may remain in the trial and continue 
pegloticase infusions (see Section 9.4.6.3.2.2 for detailed instructions). Every attempt should be 
made to re-start the MTX in subjects once their MTX-associated symptoms have improved or 
their laboratory tests have normalized.  
MTX for SC injection in auto-injectors (7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mg) will be provided to all subjects 
(RASUVO Full Prescribing Information ). For each subject, the MTX dose will be based on their 
Baseline eGFR value. 
Refer to Section 9.4.12 for contraception requirements.  
9.4.1.2 Pegloticase 
All subjects who meet the entry criteria and tolerate SC MTX at a minimum dose of 15 mg 
weekly during the MTX Run-in Period will receive pegloticase at a dose of 8 mg administered 
IV every 2 weeks for a total of 12 infusions from Day 1 through Week 22, inclusive (Pegloticase 
+ MTX Treatment Period) or a total of 24 infusions from Day 1 through Week 46, inclusive 
(Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period and Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period), for 
subjects who may gain further benefit with additional pegloticase treatment beyond 12 infusions 
based on the . Subjects will not be fasting on the day of

 infusion and will be encouraged to have a snack or normal meal before or after the infusion. On 
Day 1, pre- and post-infusion sUA results must be reported by the central laboratory. For the 
remainder of the trial beginning at Week 2, 2 sUA samples will be collected within 48 hours 
PRIOR to pegloticase infusion and results reported by the local laboratory and central laboratory 
(see Section 9.5.1.1). 
After the Week 24 or 48 Visit (or End of Pegloticase Visit [if applicable]) or upon pegloticase 
discontinuation, subjects should resume regular care for gout per the judgment of the treating 
physician, including resumption of urate-lowering therapy, if appropriate.  
Pegloticase will be administered as an admixture of 8 mg in 250 mL of 0.45% or 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) for IV infusion by gravity feed or infusion 
pump, generally over 120 minutes. Pegloticase will not be administered as an IV push or bolus. 
If using tubing with no in-line filter, the pegloticase preparation will be infused over 
approximately 120 ±15 minutes while the subject is under close observation for any signs of 
distress. If an in-line filter is used, it should be 0.2 µm or larger. At the end of the infusion, the 
IV line will be flushed with 10 mL of normal saline to ensure the full dose is administered. The 
date and time of infusion start and stop and time of the start and stop time of the flush will be 
recorded.  
9.4.1.3 Folic Acid 
Subjects will also take folic acid at a starting dose of 1 mg orally every day beginning at Week -6 
(preferably 2 days prior to the first dose of MTX) until prior to the End of Pegloticase Visit (if 
applicable) or until 1 week after the last pegloticase infusion for subjects who have not stopped 
pegloticase treatment.  
During the MTX Run-in Period, if minor clinical symptoms emerge, such as mild stomatitis, 
mild gastrointestinal discomfort or fatigue, the Investigator may increase the folic acid dose from 
1 mg/day to 2 mg/day.  
During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period after Day 1, if MTX toxicity-related laboratory 
findings or symptoms (such as nausea, fatigue) occur, the Investigator may increase the folic acid 
dose from 1 mg/day to 2 mg/day. If after more than 1 week of taking 2 mg/day folic acid, the 
sign/symptom or laboratory abnormalities do not resolve or improve, the subject is allowed to 
switch to oral leucovorin at 10 mg/week, given 10 to 24 hours POST each MTX injection, at the discretion of the Investigator. In this case, the Investigator should discuss the timing of oral 
leucovorin administration relative to the MTX injection with the Medical Monitor to ensure 
subject compliance. Leucovorin taken before, at the time of or too soon (<8 hours) after MTX 
injection will likely reduce the efficacy of MTX. 
If the subject discontinues pegloticase due to the stopping rule or other reason, folic acid should 
also be discontinued.

 Prescriptions are to be filled at a local pharmacy, as needed. At trial visits, the subject will be 
asked whether folic acid was taken per protocol. 
9.4.1.4 Gout Flare Prophylaxis 
All subjects will receive standardized prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of acute gout 
flares, beginning , continuing for at least 6 months 
per American College of Rheumatology guidelines ( FitzGerald  et al, 2020). Before a subject 
begins the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, he or she must have been taking at least 
1 standard gout flare prophylaxis regimen (i.e., colchicine and/or NSAIDs and/or low-dose 
prednisone 10 mg/day) per protocol. Gout flare prophylaxis is optional from Week 26 to the 
end of the trial if needed at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  
Prescriptions are to be filled at a local pharmacy, as needed. At trial visits, the subject will be 
asked whether gout flare prophylaxis was taken per protocol. 
9.4.1.5 Infusion Reaction Prophylaxis 
Since IRs can occur with pegloticase, all subjects will receive IR prophylaxis prior to each 
pegloticase infusion, consisting of antihistamines, acetaminophen, a leukotriene inhibitor and 
corticosteroids. To standardize this regimen, fexofenadine (180 mg orally) and prednisone 
(50 mg orally) will be taken the night before each pegloticase infusion. Fexofenadine (180 mg 
orally), famotidine (20 mg orally), montelukast (10 mg orally) and acetaminophen (1000 mg 
orally) will be taken the morning of each pegloticase infusion. Methylprednisolone (125 mg IV), 
given over an infusion duration between 10 and 30 minutes prior to each pegloticase infusion 
will be administered. 
Substitution of the corticosteroid is generally not allowed. The name, dose, route, date and time 
of administration of each prophylactic medication will be recorded in the medical record and in 
the eCRF. IR medications administered prior to each pegloticase infusion will be supplied by the 
site.  
Prescriptions are to be filled at a local pharmacy, as needed. At trial visits, the subject will be 
asked whether IR prophylaxis was taken per protocol.  
As a precaution, emergency equipment will be readily available to treat a possible 
hypersensitivity reaction and will include drugs used to treat an anaphylactic reaction. Personnel 
trained in managing IRs and in the use of the emergency equipment will be readily available 
during and for 1 hour after the infusion. As IRs can occur after the completion of the infusion, 
subjects will be observed for 1-hour post infusion. 
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 
9.4.2.1 Pegloticase 
Pegloticase is a clear, colorless, sterile solution in phosphate-buffered saline intended for IV

 Investigational clinical supplies will be received by a designated person at the trial site, handled 
and stored safely and properly and kept in a secured location to which only the Investigator and 
designated assistants have access.  
The Trial Pharmacy Manual contains more detailed information on MTX and pegloticase 
packaging, labeling, storage and destruction. 
9.4.6 Trial Drug Administration and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
9.4.6.1 Description of Clinical Supplies 
PCI Pharma Services will supply trial drugs (pegloticase and MTX) to clinical sites. Ancillary 
supplies for dosing will be provided by the trial site (i.e., infusion bags containing saline, 
syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, gauze pads, bandages and biohazard containers for safe storage 
of used needles and syringes).  
9.4.6.2 Determination of Dose Volume 
Pegloticase will be administered as an admixture of 8 mg in 250 mL of 0.45% or 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP for IV infusion.  
In the event of any potential safety signals reported (e.g., serious IR or any SAE related to 
pegloticase infusion), additional IR mitigation approaches, such as a slower pegloticase infusion 
rate, can be implemented. Infusions subsequent to an IR in an individual subject may be given in 
a larger volume of diluent, not to exceed 500 mL. In this case, the infusion duration will also be 
extended to a minimum of 3 hours. 
9.4.6.3 Details Concerning Timing and Dose Administration 
9.4.6.3.1 Preparation 
Vials of pegloticase will be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration before 
administration, whenever solution and container permit. Vials will not be used if either 
particulate matter or discoloration is present. Using appropriate aseptic technique, 1 mL of 
pegloticase will be withdrawn from the vial into a sterile syringe. Any unused portion of product 
remaining in the vial will be discarded. Syringe contents will be injected into a single 250 mL 
bag of 0.45% or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for IV infusion and will not be mixed or 
diluted with other drugs. The infusion bag containing the dilute pegloticase solution will be 
inverted a number of times to ensure thorough mixing but will not be shaken. In accordance with 
good pharmacy practice, gloves will be worn during preparation of the dose. 
Pegloticase infusion must be started within 4 hours of dilution. Before administration, the diluted 
solution of pegloticase should be allowed to reach room temperature. Pegloticase must never be 
subjected to artificial heating.

 9.4.6.3.2 Dose Modifications, Interruptions and Delays 
9.4.6.3.2.1 Pegloticase Modifications 
In the event of potential IR safety signals identified during the pegloticase infusion, or when the 
pre-infusion sUA level is >6mg/dL, additional IR mitigation approaches, such as a slower 
pegloticase infusion rate, can be implemented.  
Infusion of pegloticase will be immediately held if the subject experiences any significant IR 
such as respiratory distress, agitation, chest or back pain, urticaria or another clinically 
significant event occurring during infusion. If the AE meets the definition of an SAE for IR, the 
infusion should not be restarted unless the site Investigator determines it is safe to do so. If the 
AE does not meet the definition of an SAE for IR, the site Investigator may make the decision to 
re-start the infusion depending upon the nature and severity of the AE.  
Infusions subsequent to an IR in an individual subject may be at a slower infusion rate. An 
example of an ~150-minute infusion procedure in 250 mL volume (relative to the standard 
steady rate over 120 minutes) that can be implemented at the discretion of the Investigator is 
presented in Table 9.1.  
Table 9.1 Sample Pegloticase Infusion Rate Modification Following an Infusion 
Reaction Time Interval Staggered Rate (Over ~150 Minutes) Standard Steady Rate (Over 120 Minutes) 
First 30 minutes 1.0 mL/min (30 mLs) 2.08 mL/min 
Second 30 minutes 1.5 mL/min (45 mLs) 2.08 mL/min 
Third 30 minutes 2.0 mL/ min (60 mLs) 2.08 mL/min 
Fourth 30 minutes 2.0 mL/min (60 mLs) 2.08 mL/min 
Last 27.5 minutes 2.0 mL/min (55 mLs) Done 
 
Alternatively, a larger volume of diluent, not to exceed 500 mL can be used. In this case, the 
infusion duration will be extended to a minimum of 3 hours. The total volume and duration of 
infusion will be captured in the medical record and eCRF. 
Infusion of pegloticase may be held or delayed if the subject has an ongoing SAE or AE/SAE 
that occurs prior to the infusion. The status of subjects with skipped infusions will be discussed -by-case basis to determine 
whether the subject should continue to the next scheduled infusion or proceed to the End of 
Pegloticase Visit.  
If a confirmed anaphylaxis event occurs in any subject, further dosing with pegloticase for that 
subject will be discontinued.

 9.4.6.3.2.2 MTX Dose Titration Algorithm and Intolerance Criteria 
During the MTX Run-in Period, a subject will be considered an MTX Run-in Screen Failure if 
any of the following new laboratory findings (repeat laboratory tests may be needed to confirm 
the findings) or symptoms reflecting MTX intolerance occur:  
1. Abnormal hematology findings: 
a. White blood cell count <3.5 × 109/L; 
b. Platelet count <75 × 109/L; and 
c. Hematocrit <32%. 
2. Abnormal hepatic function findings: 
a. AST/ALT >1.5 × upper limit of reference range and  
b. Albumin <lower limit of reference range. 
3. Abnormal renal function: eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as estimated with the MDRD 
equation). 
4. New clinically important signs and symptoms, such as the following: 
a. Rash or oral ulceration; 
b. Persistent nausea, vomiting and diarrhea;  
c. New or increasing dyspnea or dry cough or unexplained cough with fever;  
d. Severe sore throat, abnormal bruising; and 
e. Severe headaches, fatigue and problems concentrating.  
In addition, during the MTX Run-in Period, if minor clinical symptoms emerge, such as mild 
stomatitis or mild gastrointestinal discomfort, the Investigator may increase the folic acid dose 
from 1 mg/day to 2 mg/day and/or reduce the MTX dose (but to no less than 15 mg/week). If 
symptoms improve, the subject will not be considered a screen failure on the basis of that 
symptom. 
During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Periods, MTX dose guidance based on new laboratory 
findings or new symptoms will be as follows:

Date: 02 May 2022 Protocol: HZNP-KRY-407
  Version 2.0, amendment 1, admin change1 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 70 of 168 
 3. Any laboratory or clinical symptoms leading to temporary stop on 3 consecutive 
measures, in which case the Medical Monitor will review to consider re-initiation, a 
continued temporary stop, or a permanent stop in discussion with the Principal 
Investigator. 
Guidance for increasing MTX back towards 15 or 25 mg/week after dose reduction, based on 
improvement or resolution of abnormal liver enzymes (>2 × ULN): 
1. 
higher dose provided (i.e., 7.5 to 10 mg, 10 to 15 mg, 15 to 20 mg or 20 to 25 mg) and 
reassess in 2 weeks. 
2. If liver 
dose provided (i.e., 10 to 15 mg, 15 to 20 mg or 20 to 25 mg) and reassess in 2 weeks. 
Improvement of other laboratory abnormalities potentially attributed to MTX may also warrant 
titration back up to 15 or 25 mg weekly, based on Principal Investigator judgement and in 
discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 
9.4.7 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
All subjects will receive the same trial drugs (i.e., SC MTX and pegloticase).  
Two sequential cohorts of subjects will be enrolled in this trial. Subjects who previously failed to 
maintain sUA response with pegloticase monotherapy and stopped pegloticase treatment without 
a history of pegloticase-related IR will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  
The Safety Review Team will use the tolerability criteria to determine if Cohort 1 enrollment can 
continue, Cohort 2 enrollment can begin and whether subjects without a history of pegloticase-
related clinically mild IR can enroll in Cohort 2.  
Based on the safety assessment during Cohort 1, the trial can begin enrolling Cohort 2 if the 
pegloticase infusions are well tolerated or the trial will cease to screen and enroll new subjects if 
the pegloticase infusions are not well tolerated.  
Subjects with a history of pegloticase-related clinically mild IR will be enrolled in Cohort 2. If 
the safety assessment during Cohort 2 indicates that the pegloticase infusions are not well 
tolerated based on pre-determined tolerability criteria or in the absence of subjects with a history 
of pegloticase-related clinically mild IR, the trial will continue with enrolling subjects without a 
history of pegloticase-related clinically mild IR.  
9.4.8 Blinding 
All trial drugs will be administered in an open-label fashion.  
9.4.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Medication history (i.e., prior medications) will include all prior gout medications, starting at the 
time of diagnosis and up to the Screening Visit and all other medications taken from 1 year prior 
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA® IND: 010122 
Date: 02 May 2022 Protocol: HZNP-KRY-407

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 71 of 168 
 to the Screening Visit. Detailed pegloticase use history, including reason for discontinuation and 
associated reactions, if any, will be collected.  
Concomitant medications are defined as drug or biological products other than the trial drugs (or 
prior gout medications) taken by a subject from Screening through the Post-Treatment Follow-up 
Visits. This includes other prescription medications (including preventive vaccines), 
over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, vitamins and food supplements. If a subject is 
treated with antibiotics, refer to Section 9.4.6.3.2.2 for monitoring guidelines. 
Information about prior and concomitant medications, including those used for any duration to 
treat an AE, will be collected on source documents and the appropriate eCRFs at each visit. The 
generic name of the medication, indication, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration and 
start and stop dates will be recorded.  
Other than restricted medications ( Section 9.4.10), other medications used at the time of trial 
initiation may be continued at the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.4.9.1 Gout Flare Treatment 
An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, 
including pegloticase. Subjects will be instructed to contact the site within 12 hours of the onset 
of symptoms. Gout flares will be confirmed through questioning or direct observation, as 
detailed in Section 9.5.4.8. All subjects who experience a gout flare during the trial will be 
prescribed anti-inflammatory treatment (e.g., NSAID, colchicine, corticosteroids and 
intra-articular steroid injections), as clinically indicated or deemed necessary on an individual 
basis at the discretion of the Investigator. Pain medications for gout flare should be administered 
according to standard of care, as clinically indicated or deemed necessary on an individual basis 
at the discretion of the Investigator. All medications should be documented on the concomitant 
medication eCRF. 
Colchicine will be prescribed in a medically appropriate dose range of 0.6 to 1.8 mg/day, usually 
dosed as 0.6 mg orally twice per day unless reduced dosing is necessitated by renal insufficiency 
or gastrointestinal intolerance. The precise dose and regimen of colchicine will be individualized 
for each subject by the Investigators and documented on the concomitant medication eCRF.  
9.4.9.2 Infusion Reaction Treatment 
Subjects must be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of IRs. In the event of an IR, the 
infusion should be slowed or stopped, and restarted at a slower rate at the discretion of the 
Investigator. If a serious IR occurs, the infusion should be discontinued and treatment should be 
provided, as needed.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 72 of 168 
 If a subject experiences an AE suspected to be an IR:  
 A physical examination will be performed to capture medically relevant details, 
including, but not limited to, a thorough dermatologic examination for detection of 
erythema, urticaria (hives) or peri-oral or lingual edema; a chest examination for breath 
sounds, stridor or wheezing; and a cardiac examination with attention to irregular 
heartbeat.  Vital signs (sitting or supine blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body 
temperature) will be captured at least every 30 minutes until the resolution or 
stabilization of the AE.  A serum sample will be collected in a serum-separator tube at that time or at the 
subsequent visit. The sample will be centrifuged, frozen at -20°C or colder and stored for 
the batch shipment to a Horizon designated laboratory for evaluation of pegloticase 
antibodies at a future date.   When possible, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will also be performed at the time of 
IR.  
Section 9.5.4.1.1.5), pegloticase should be immediately discontinued. Any incidence of 
anaphylaxis should be reported as an SAE. 
The Investigator may administer any medically indicated pharmacologic agent or procedure 
intended to relieve symptoms (CAUTION: no other drugs can be mixed in the pegloticase 
infusion bag). Signs and symptoms of the AE and drugs given for treatment are to be recorded in 
the medical record and in the eCRF. 
After the first incidence of an IR that does not meet the anaphylaxis criteria (see 
Section 9.5.4.1.1.5) or does not meet serious criteria, the Investigator may elect to initiate the 
next infusion at a slower rate. All changes to infusion rate or dilution are to be recorded in the 
medical record and in the eCRF. 
9.4.10 Restricted Medications 
Subjects will be directed to discontinue current urate-lowering therapy at least 7 days prior to 
Day 1.  
Subjects should not receive the following medications from Screening through the end of 
pegloticase and MTX during the trial:   Concomitant therapy with allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid or other urate-lowering 
medications or a PEG-conjugated drug (see Appendix 17.10); 
 Other investigational agents;

  Any MTX other than the trial approved investigational product, azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofetil or other systemic immunosuppressants aside from glucocorticoids 
for gout flare or IR prophylaxis or intermittent gout flare treatment; 
 Systemic or radiologic treatment for ongoing cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin 
cancer; and 
 Current or chronic treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents. 
9.4.11 Treatment Compliance 
A dosing calendar will be provided to subjects at the Week -6 Visit for recording the MTX dose 
and the date, time and mg dose of each dose. The dosing calendar and MTX auto-injector should 
be brought to each trial visit for assessment of compliance. At the end of the trial or if the subject 
prematurely discontinues the trial, the subjects will return any unused or partially used trial drugs 
to the site. Adherence to the MTX regimen will also be recorded by the trial coordinator at trial 
visits in the eCRF by recording the date of each MTX dose (mg), frequency and time of each 
dose per calendar day. Subjects who have injected at least 80% of the protocol-specified amount 
of MTX will be considered compliant. Noncompliant subjects will be re-educated on 
compliance.  
At trial visits, the subject will be asked whether folic acid, gout flare and IR prophylaxis were 
administered. 
Pegloticase will be administered at the trial site by trained personnel. The date and time of 
infusion start and stop and the stop and start time of the flush will be recorded. 
9.4.12 Contraception Requirements 
Women of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause <2 years prior to 
Screening, non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to Screening or not surgically 
sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]) must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception 
during the trial, 1 of which is recommended to be hormonal, such as an oral contraceptive.  cle prior to Week -6 (start of MTX) and 
continue for 30 days after the last dose of pegloticase, or at least 1 ovulatory cycle after the last 
dose of MTX (whichever is the longer duration after the last dose of pegloticase). Highly 
effective contraceptive methods (with a failure rate <1% per year), when used consistently and 
correctly, include implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, 
sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner.  
Men who are not vasectomized must agree to use appropriate contraception so as to not 
impregnate a female partner of reproductive potential during the trial, beginning with the 
initiation of MTX at Week -6 and continuing for at least 3 months after the last dose of MTX. 
Appropriate contraception methods include condom use and abstinence.

 9.5 Efficacy, Quality-of-Life, Pharmacokinetic and Safety Variables 
The Schedule of Assess ments is provided in Section 2.1 . 
9.5.1 Efficacy Variables 
Efficacy will be assessed based on measurement of sUA levels, urate deposition and  
 
and the HAQ-DI, HAQ pain scale and HAQ health scale.  
9.5.1.1  Serum Uric Acid 
Serum samples for measurement of sUA levels will be collected at the Screening Visit, the 
Week -6 Visit (prior to the first dose of MTX)  and the Week -2 Visit. On Day 1, a pre- and 
post-infusion sUA will be collected to be shipped to the central laboratory. For the remainder of trial visits beginning at Week 2 during the Pe gloticase + MTX Treatment Period; 2 sUA samples 
will be collected within 48 hours PRIOR to each  pegloticase infusion. One sample will be for 
testing at the 
 local laboratory and the second sample will be sent to the central laboratory 
(the central laboratory sample may be drawn separately from the local collection). The local laboratory or central laboratory pre-infusion sUA results should be reported prior to pegloticase 
infusion. Note:  It is allowable for the local a nd central laboratory sUA samples to be drawn on 
different days or times so long as both samples are drawn within 48 hours PRIOR to the infusion 
and the results of at least 1 sample are available prior to the infusion. Additional serum samples 
for sUA levels will be collected after the end of each pegloticase infusion prior to discharge at Weeks 10, 12, 14, 20, 22, 32, 34, 44 and 46; at Weeks 21 and 23; and at the End of Pegloticase (if applicable) or the Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visit.  
Serum for sUA analysis will also be collected following the first 7 pegloticase infusions at 
Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12, respectively. The sUA will be 
collected at the following non-infusion days: 1
st (~24 hours), 4th (~96 hours), 7th (~168 hours) 
and 10th (~240 hours) day after each of the first 4 infusions, Day 1 to Week 6.  Following Week 
8, Week 10, Week 12, sUA will be  collected at the followi ng non-infusion days:  1st (~24 hours) 
and 7th (~168 hours). If infusion intervals of less th an 2 weeks should occur due to scheduling 
issues, less than 4 sUA measurements between infusions are acceptable. The 1st day (~24hours) 
samples must be obtained at a minimum. If there are restrictions in relation to obtaining the 
interim samples also obtain 7th day (~168 hours) if feasible. 
To ease the on-site visit burden for subjects , for non infusion visit sUA collection, a Home 
Health Care nurse may collect sUA samples, AE data and concomitant medication information if the subject consents 
Prior to Week 22, subjects whose lowest ava ilable interim sUA value (typically the 1
st day 
[~24 hours] after infusion) after the pegloticase in fusion at Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 is less than a 
50% reduction from the highest sUA value meas ured between Screening and pre-infusion on 
Day 1 will discontinue treatment and complete the End of Pegloticase Visit within 2 weeks of the last infusion, but remain in the trial for biweekly  visits, including the Week 24/End of Trial/Early 
Termination and 30-Day Post-Tr eatment Follow-up Visits.  CCI

gout (e.g., inflammatory markers), gout co-morbidities in response to pegloticase or other 
potential treatments for gout.  
The samples will be retained no longer than 15 years after trial completion or as required by 
applicable law. The samples will be stored in a secured storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality. 
Detailed instructions regarding blood sample timing and handling are provided in the Laboratory

9.5.4 Safety Variables 
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of all AEs, whether or not drug 
related, measurement of vital signs, physical examinations and monitoring of hematology and 
blood chemistry and urine test. 
9.5.4.1 Adverse Events 
9.5.4.1.1 Definitions 
9.5.4.1.1.1 Adverse Event Definition 
As defined by the ICH, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not the 
event is considered related to the trial drug. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, except for an abnormal sUA result), symptom, or 
disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the trial drug. This includes 
any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the Baseline 
condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
Examples of an AE include:   Conditions newly detected or diagnosed after the signing of the ICF, including conditions 
that may have been present but undetected prior to the start of the trial;  
 Conditions known to have been present prior to the start of the trial that worsen after the 
signing of the ICF; 
 Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction; and  
Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC  KRYSTEXXA® IND: 010122

  Version 2.0, amendment 1, admin change1 
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 80 of 168 
  Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational 
product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE). 
Issues that will not be considered an AE include: 
 Conditions present at the start of the trial should be recorded as medical history; 
  Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy; however, a condition 
that leads to a procedure is an AE if it qualifies according to the definitions above); 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social, diagnostic, 
elective or convenience admission to a hospital); 
 Fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of 
the trial that do not represent a clinically significant change from Baseline; and 
 Abnormal laboratory or test findings that are not assessed by the Investigator as a 
clinically significant change from Baseline. 
-
that must be used to report/document the AE. 
9.5.4.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
Based on ICH guidelines, an SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
a. Results in death. 
b. Is life threatening.  
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event 
that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe, prolonged, or 
untreated. 
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
NOTE: Hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted to the hospital as an 
inpatient for any length of time. Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event 
not fulfilling any of the definitions of SAEs and not resulting in hospital admission does 
not qualify for this category but may be appropriately included in category g (see below). 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are usually AEs. If a complication 
prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criterion, the event will be 
 
Hospitalization will not be considered an AE in and of itself. It will be considered an 
outcome of an AE. Therefore, if there is no associated AE, there is no SAE. For example, 
hospitalization for elective or pre-planned treatment of a pre-existing condition that did 
not worsen from Baseline will not be considered an AE.

normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may temporarily interfere with 
or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting as serious is appropriate in other situations; specifically, important 
medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition should 
usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive cancers, intensive

or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. If in doubt as to whether or not an event qualifies as an 
 
9.5.4.1.1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Event Definition 
AEs that do not result in any of the outcomes listed in Section 9.5.4.1.1.2 are considered 
non-serious. 
9.5.4.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event Definition 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Reference 
Safety Information section of the  (for pegloticase) or United States 
Prescribing Information (for MTX) or is not listed with the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Reference Safety Information as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
9.5.4.1.1.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs include IRs, anaphylaxis, gout flares and MACE. If 3 events of Anaphylaxis (as assessed 
by PI) occur an Adjudication Committee (composed of independent experts external to Horizon) 
Anaphylaxis. The AESI of IR, MACE 
and gout flare will not be adjudicated.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 82 of 168 
 Tolerability Criteria 
Safety assessments of IR and anaphylaxis will be conducted after 7and 10 subjects in Cohort 1 
complete 6 infusions and after 3, 6, 10,15 and 20 subjects in Cohort 2 complete 6 infusions. If 
more than one-third of subjects experience a severe IR and/or anaphylaxis related to pegloticase 
infusion, the pegloticase infusions will be considered not tolerated. 
The signs and symptoms of severe IRs are usually prolonged (e.g., not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion) or recurrent following initial 
improvement. Possible associated signs and symptoms of IRs may include, but not be limited to:   Respiratory: difficulty breathing with wheezing or stridor; respiratory distress 
manifested as at least 2 or more of the following: tachypnoea, increased use of 
accessory respiratory muscles, cyanosis, recession or grunting; 
 Upper airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula or larynx); 
 Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, measured hypotension, a decreased level 
of consciousness or loss of consciousness; 
 Dermatological or mucosal: generalized urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, 
angioedema or generalized pruritus with skin rash 
The Safety Review Team must confirm that the tolerability criteria are not met in Cohort 1, prior 
to Screening subjects with history of pegloticase-related mild IR for Cohort 2. The Safety 
Review Team could stop the trial for other significant safety concerns.  
If an anaphylaxis event occurs in any subject, further dosing with pegloticase for that subject will 
be discontinued. Anaphylaxis events will be adjudicated using the Sampson criteria (see 
Appendix Error! Reference source not found.  for guidance on anaphylaxis and IR symptoms 
and assessment). 
Infusion Reaction An IR will be defined as any infusion-related AE or cluster of temporally-related AEs, not 
attributable to another cause, which occur during the pegloticase infusion and for up to 2 hours 
post infusion. Other AEs that occur outside of the 2-hour window following the infusion may 
also be categorized as an IR at the Principal IR and treatments administered will be documented in the medical record and in the eCRF and 
will be adjudicated.  
Examples of AEs not considered possible IRs include, but are not limited to: laboratory 
abnormalities that are unlikely to have occurred during or within 1 hour following the infusion 
(e.g., anemia), gout flares, most infectious diseases or the recurrence or worsening of a known 
ry.  
In the event of any potential or suspected IR, the procedures in Section 9.4.9.2 will be 
performed.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 83 of 168 
 Anaphylaxis 
Any incidence of anaphylaxis should be reported as an SAE. Anaphylaxis will be defined using 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network 
criteria ( Sampson et al, 2006), and will be adjudicated:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives; pruritus or flushing; urticaria, and llowing: 
a.  Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia) or 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that subject (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, 
swollen lips-tongue or uvula); 
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia); 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence); or 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy, abdominal pain, 
vomiting).  
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to 
Baseline. 
Gout Flares 
It is common for potent urate-lowering therapies to lead to acute attacks of gout. Gout flares will 
be confirmed through questioning or direct observation detailed in Section 9.5.4.8. 
Cardiovascular Events 
Cardiovascular AEs will be collected as part of the AE collection. External adjudication will be 
conducted for MACE (defined as non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, 
cardiovascular death and congestive heart failure). Refer to the Adjudication Committee Charter 
for the detailed definition.

 9.5.4.1.2 Documentation of Adverse Events 
AE and SAE monitoring will begin from the signing of the ICF until the 30-Day Post-Treatment 
Follow-up Visit. 
Subjects will be questioned about AEs at each trial visit, using nonspecific questions, such as 
trial visit
and documented in the source record after the signing of the ICF.  
9.5.4.1.3 Intensity of Adverse Events 
All AEs, both serious and non-serious, will be assessed for severity using the Rheumatology 
Common Toxicity Criteria v2.0 ( Woodworth et al, 2007). The scale displays Grades 1 through 4 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE (including abnormal laboratory values) 
based on this general guideline.  
 Grade 1 (mild)  asymptomatic or transient, short duration (<1 week), no change in 
lifestyle, no medication or over-the-counter. 
 Grade 2 (moderate)  symptomatic, duration 1 to 2 weeks, alter lifestyle occasionally, 
medications give relief (may be prescription), trial drug continued. 
 Grade 3 (severe)  prolonged symptoms, reversible, major functional impairment, 
prescription medications/partial relief, hospitalized <24 hours, temporary trial drug 
discontinuation or/and dose reduced. 
 Grade 4 (includes life-threatening)  at risk of death, substantial disability, especially if 
permanent, hospitalized >24 hours, permanent trial drug discontinuation. 
9.5.4.1.4 Relationship to Trial Drug 
The relationship of each AE to MTX and/or pegloticase will be determined by the Investigator 
and the Sponsor based on the following definitions: 
 Not related: There is no plausible temporal relationship or there is another explanation 
that unequivocally provides a more plausible explanation for the event. 
 Related: There is evidence in favor of a causal relationship (i.e., there is a plausible time 
cour  
o There is a reasonable pharmacological relationship (or known class effect). 
o There is no other more plausible explanation. 
o There is a positive de-challenge (without active treatment of the event). 
o There is a positive re-challenge. 
o There is a distinguishable dose effect.

 The assessment of causality will be based on the information available and may change based 
upon receipt of additional information. 
9.5.4.1.5  Reporting and Documenting SAEs and Product Complaints 
9.5.4.1.5.1  Serious Adverse Events 
Any death, life-threatening event, or other SAE ex perienced by a subject during the course of the 
trial, whether or not judged drug-related, must  be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event by entering the information into the eCRF. If unable to access the eCRF, the event must be 
reported by submitting the completed SAE form via email or fax to the contacts provided below.  
Fax  
E-mail  clinicalsafety@horizontherapeutics.com  
The event must be documented in source documentation and the eCRF. The following steps will 
be taken to report promptly and document accurately any SAE, whether or not it appears to be related to MTX and/or pegloticase: 
1. Report the SAE to the Sponsor as outlined above. 
2. Perform appropriate diagnostic tests and th erapeutic measures, and submit all follow-up 
substantiating data, such as diagnostic test  reports, hospital discharge summaries, and 
autopsy report, to the Spon
 
3. Respond in a timely manner to any queries from Sponsor regarding the SAE. 
4. Conduct appropriate consulta tion and follow-up evaluation until the SAE is resolved, 
stabilized, or otherwise explained by the Investigator. 
5. Review each SAE report and evaluate th e relationship of the SAE to MTX and/or 
pegloticase. 
6. The Investigator must report all AEs or SAEs that meet the criteria for Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Human Subjects or Others to the IRB. 
After receipt of the initial report, the informati on will be reviewed and the Investigator may be 
contacted with requests for additional information or for data clarification. 
Follow-up will be obtained via the eCRF, fax, or e-mail, as necessary, until the event resolves or 
attains a stable outcome. Horizon or design ee is responsible for the preparation of 
MedWatch 3500 A/Council for International Organi zations of Medical Sciences I forms and 
analysis of similar events for individual occurrences (to be submitted as Investigational New 
Drug safety letters to the FDA and Investig ators according to 21 CFR 312.32 by Horizon). 
9.5.4.1.5.2  Product Complaints 
A product complaint process will be described in the Trial Reference Manual. Any product 
complaint must be reported to th e Sponsor using this process. CCI

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON THERAPEUTICS IRELAND DAC  Page 86 of 168 
 9.5.4.1.6 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
After the initial recording of an AE, the Investigator should proactively follow the subject. Any 
non-serious AEs that are still ongoing at the 30-Day Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit should be 
reviewed to determine if further follow up is required. The Investigator will document on the AE 
eCRF all ongoing non-serious AEs that will not be followed further after the 30-Day 
Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit. If in doubt, the Investigator shMedical Monitor. 
All SAEs should be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the subject is 
lost to follow-up. Once the SAE is resolved, the corresponding AE eCRF page should be 
updated. 
9.5.4.1.7 Medication Error and Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational drug 
to or by a trial subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual subject according 
to the trial protocol. 
All cases of medication errors and overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be 
documented on the eCRF in order to capture this important safety information consistently in the 
database. AEs associated with an overdose and SAEs of overdose are to be reported according to 
the procedures outlined in Section 9.5.4.1.2 and Section 9.5.4.1.5, respectively. 
In the event of drug overdose, the subject is to be treated as appropriate. 
9.5.4.1.8 Review of Adverse Events and Emerging New Safety Information 
The Sponsor will notify all Investigators involved in the clinical investigation of important safety 
information regarding the trial drug, as required by the applicable regulations. Investigators will 
notify their IRB of all such notifications, as required. 
9.5.4.1.9 Reporting of Investigational New Drug Safety Reports 
The Sponsor will notify the United States FDA and all Investigators on any new serious risks 
associated with the drug. 
9.5.4.1.10 Development Safety Update Reports 
The Sponsor will prepare and submit annual safety reports to competent authorities. 
9.5.4.2 Pregnancy Reporting 
Women of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause <2 years prior to 
the Screening, non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to the Screening, or not 
surgically sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]) will have a serum pregnancy test at the 
Screening Visit. Urine pregnancy tests will also be performed at all other time points, as

 indicated in Section 2.1. Pregnancy will not be considered an AE in this trial; however, any 
pregnancy complications, including an elective termination for medical reasons, should be 
reported as an AE.  
Information must be obtained and reported if a female subject suspects that she has become 
pregnant during the trial (including the MTX Run-in Period) up to 30 days after the last dose of 
trial treatment (either pegloticase or MTX), or if a female partner of male subject suspects that 
she has become pregnant during the trial (including the MTX Run-in Period) up to 3 months 
(approximately 90 days) after their male subject partner discontinues MTX. The Investigator will 
instruct the female subject to stop taking all trial drugs. A serum pregnancy test should be 
performed if any female subject or female partner of a male subject suspects that she has become 
pregnant during the time frame as defined above. If pregnancy is confirmed, the female subject 
will be removed from pegloticase therapy and should remain in the trial unless she withdraws 
consent for trial participation. Pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of pregnancy is 
available. 
Complete pregnancy information, including the outcome of the pregnancy, should be collected in 
the source documents on the female subject or partner of a male subject. In the absence of 
complications, follow-up after delivery will be no longer than 8 weeks. Any stillbirths or 
premature terminations of pregnancies, whether elective, therapeutic or spontaneous, should be 
reported on the pregnancy outcome form. Any pregnancy complications, including an elective 
termination for medical reasons, should be reported as an AE. 
A spontaneous abortion should always be considered an SAE, as should any congenital defects 
in the newborn. Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-trial pregnancy and considered 
reasonably related to the trial drug by the Investigator should be reported to the Sponsor. 
Women who are breastfeeding are not eligible to participate in the trial. 
9.5.4.3 Medical History 
Medical history, including gout history (e.g., time of first diagnosis and history of tophi, 
collected on a gout-specific eCRF) and symptom severity, will be recorded at the Screening 
Visit.  
9.5.4.4 Vital Signs, Height and Weight 
Routine vital signs, including blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and heart rate will be 
measured at Screening, Weeks -6, -4 and -2 (MTX Run-in Period), Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 (Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period), Weeks 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 
36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46 (for subjects who participate in the Optional Pegloticase + MTX 
Extension Period) and the End of Pegloticase (if applicable), Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early 
Termination Visits. Heart rate and blood pressure measurements should be taken after the subject 
has been in a sitting position in a rested and calm state with proper positioning, including back heart level and the cuff placed on the bare arm. A large cuff should be used as needed to fit the 
upper arm and a consistent arm is to be used at each trial visit. The Korotkoff phase V will be

 used to determine diastolic blood pressure. During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period 
visits, vital signs should be taken before the pegloticase infusion and any time after the end of the 
 
When possible, the same staff member should take all blood pressure measurements for a given 
subject. 
Weight should be measured in kilograms or pounds when the subject is not wearing shoes and 
recorded at the Screening Visit, prior to pegloticase infusion on Day 1, prior to pegloticase 
infusion at the Week 24 (subjects who may gain further benefit beyond 12 infusions and elect to 
receive pegloticase + MTX during the Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period) and at the 
End of Pegloticase (if applicable) or Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visits.  
Height will be collected at the Screening Visit only. 
Vital sign monitoring during IR is described in Section 9.4.9.2.  
9.5.4.5 Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit, including head, eyes, 
ears, nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; extremities; neurological status and 
musculoskeletal system. The examination will include assessment for presence of tophi, as well 
as gout history and symptom severity.  
A targeted physical examination per Investigator judgement will be conducted at the Week -2 
Visit and prior to administration of pegloticase on Day 1 and at the Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 
Visits (Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period); prior to pegloticase infusion at the Weeks 24 and 
36 Visits (subjects who may gain further benefit beyond 12 infusions and elect to receive 
pegloticase + MTX during the Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period); and at the End of 
Pegloticase (if applicable) or Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visits; at a 
minimum the targeted physical examination should include heart, lungs and abdominal 
examination ( Section 2.1).  
Physical examination findings at Screening will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Clinically significant findings from the targeted physical examinations will be recorded as AEs.  
9.5.4.6 Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening and will be read at the site. 
When possible, a 12-lead ECG will also be performed at the time when a select AESI (see

at the Week -2 Visit; prior to the pegloticase infusion on Day 1 and at the Weeks 2, 6 and 14 
Visits (Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period); prior to pegloticase infusion at the Week 24 and 
36 Visits (subjects who may gain further benefit beyond 12 infusions and elect to receive 
pegloticase + MTX during the Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period); and at the End of 
Pegloticase (if applicable) or Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visits. 
Urine samples (for albumin:creatinine ratio) will be collected at the Screening Visit; prior to the 
pegloticase infusion on Day 1 and at the Weeks 2, 6 and 14 Visits (Pegloticase + MTX 
Treatment Period); prior to pegloticase infusion at the Week 24 and 36 Visits (subjects who may 
gain further benefit beyond 12 infusions and elect to receive pegloticase + MTX during the 
Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period); and at the End of Pegloticase (if applicable) and 
Week 24 or 48/End of Trial/Early Termination Visits.  
Women of childbearing potential (as defined in Section 9.5.4.2) will have a serum pregnancy test 
at the Screening Visit; urine samples (for human chorionic gonadotropin) will be collected at all 
other visits.  
Safety laboratory assessments will include:   Hematology: complete blood count (hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, erythrocyte 
count, platelet count, leukocyte count, and differential leukocyte count) with differential;  
 Chemistry: albumin, transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
creatinine (including calculation for eGFR calculated by the MDRD equation: 175 × 
(standardized serum creatinine [mg/dL] )-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if 
African American) or 175 × (standardized serum creatinine [µmol/L]/ 88.4)-1 154 × (age)-0.203 
× (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American), glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, 
chloride, total protein and blood urea nitrogen; and  
 Urine: albumin:creatinine ratio and human chorionic gonadotropin for all female subjects 
of childbearing potential.

Trial/Early Termination Visits.  
9.5.4.8 Assessment of Gout Flare 
There is no validated instrument to assess gout flares. Gout flares will be assessed at the time 
points specified in Section 2.1. Investigators will assess gout flares based on subject 
self-reporting, with Investigator confirmation of flare based on subject questioning and/or direct 
observation. All gout flares will be recorded as AEs with the required AE reporting information. 
Investigators will also ask the subject a series of questions related to each gout flare, to document 
subject report of swollen joints, joints that are warm to touch, and level of joint pain ( Gaffo et 
al, 2012).  
9.5.5 Safety Review Team 
SSafety Review Team (comprising members of the Horizon Clinical Development and Patient 
Safety and Pharmacovigilance Teams) based on pre-determined tolerability criteria.  
Depending on any potential safety signals reported (e.g., serious IR or any SAE related to 
pegloticase infusion), regular quarterly and/or ad hoc safety assessments will be conducted 
during the trial as specified in the Safety Management Plan and the Safety Review Team Charter.  
9.5.6 Adjudication Committee 
An Adjudication Committee (composed of independent experts external to Horizon) will be 
established for this trial to adjudicate the AESIs of anaphylaxis, if 3 events of Anaphylaxis (as 
assessed by PI) occur (see Section 9.5.4.1.1.5).  The AESI of IR, MACE and gout flare will not 
be adjudicated. The AESIs of anaphylaxis will be adjudicated at a frequency defined in the 
Adjudication Committee Charter. The committee will be comprised of physicians with 
experience in immunology, allergic reactions, rheumatology and cardiovascular diseases. Details 
outlining the responsibilities of the Adjudication Committee will be included in the Adjudication 
Committee Charter.  
9.5.7 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The trial assessments are appropriate for a trial in subjects with gout and consistent with those 
used in registrational trials.  
9.5.8 Trial Procedures 
Subjects who provide informed consent and who meet all the entry criteria for participation in 
this trial will be enrolled.

intercurrent events; selected intercurrent events leading to data that are missing completely at random may be addressed with a While-on-Treatment  Strategy (e.g., if site closures due to 
COVID-19).  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders during Month 6. The proportion of 
21, 22, 
23 and 24. The amount of time that sUA is <6 mg /dL (using linear interpolation, if necessary) 
will be calculated and divided by the total amount of time from the first to the last observed sUA 
value in this time range (missed values in this time range will be ignored for purposes of this 
calculation). Subjects who have no available sUA value in this time range will be imputed as non-responders unless the data are missing comple tely at random, in which case they will be 
omitted from the analysis. Two-sided exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated. CCI

Prior to initiation of the trial trial center 
personnel information regarding the investigational drug, protocol requirements, monitoring 
requirements and reporting of SAEs. 
At intervals during the trial, as well as after the completion of subject enrollment, the trial center 
will be monitored by the Sponsor or designee for compliance. During these visits, the monitor 
will discuss trial progress, verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency 
and accuracy of the data being entered on the eCRF (source data verification); oversee the 
resolution of outstanding data discrepancies and check on various aspects of trial conduct 
(e.g., drug accountability, sample storage). The Investigator agrees to allow monitors access to 
the clinical supplies, dispensing and storage areas and clinical records of the trial subjects, and, if 
requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator must cooperate with the monitors to 
ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
A secondary audit may be conducted by Quality Assurance designated by the Sponsor. The 
Investigator will be informed if this is to take place and advised as to the nature of the audit. 
Representatives of the United States FDA and/or representatives of other regulatory authorities 
may also conduct an inspection of the trial at the investigative site. If informed of such an 
inspection, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately. 
Every effort will be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of subjects participating 
in this clinical trial. However, because of the investigational nature of this treatment, the 
Investigator agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor, its designated agents and authorized 
employees of the appropriate regulatory agencies to inspect the facilities used in this trial and to

 17.9 Infusion Reaction and Anaphylaxis Assessment Guidance 
1.  Infusion Reaction Criteria and Severity Assessment Guidance  
An infusion reaction (IR) will be defined as any infusion-related adverse event or cluster of 
temporally related adverse events, not attributable to another cause, which occur during the 
pegloticase infusion and for up to 2 hours post infusion. Other adverse events that occur outside 
of the 2-hour window and up to 24 hours following the infusion may also be categorized as an IR 
 
In general, the severity assessment should follow the following Infusion Reaction Severity 
definition in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 5.0 (Nov. 2017). CTCAE 
term Grade 1  
(Mild) Grade 2 
(Moderate) Grade 3 
(Severe) Grade 4 
(Life-threatening) Grade 5 Infusion 
related 
reaction Mild transient 
reaction; infusion 
interruption not 
indicated; 
intervention not 
indicated Therapy or infusion 
interruption indicated 
but responds promptly 
to symptomatic 
treatment 
(e.g., antihistamines, 
nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, 
intravenous fluids)  Prolonged (e.g., not 
rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic 
medication and/or 
brief interruption of 
infusion); recurrence 
of symptoms 
following initial 
improvement; 
hospitalization 
indicated for clinical 
sequelae Life-threatening 
consequences; u rgent 
intervention 
indicated Death 
A Sponsor Adjudication Committee will review the signs, symptoms and treatment administered 
for the prior IR associated with pegloticase infusion before subjects with history of mild IR are 
enrolled in Cohort 2. 
2.  Anaphylaxis Criteria  
Based on NIAID/FAAN (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food 
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network) criteria by Sampson et al, 2006, anaphylaxis is likely 
when any 1 of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 
 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen  
lips tongue uvula) with at least 1of the following 
o Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia)

 o Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
 Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that subject (minutes to several hours) 
o Involvement of the skin mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, 
swollen lips-tongue-uvula)  
o Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia)  
o Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)  
o Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy, abdominal pain, 
vomiting).   The subject experiences a reduced blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen 
for that subject (minutes to several hours) 
o Systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease 
from that  Baseline.

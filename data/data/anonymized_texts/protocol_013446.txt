 1. OBJECTIVES  
• Primary objective  
o To determine the pathologic response rate ( ≥95% necrosis) after preoperative 
treatment with sorafenib, epirubicin, ifosfamide, and hypofractionated radiation 
for high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body wall.  
• Secondary objectives  
O To further characterize the safety of sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy, including wound complication rate  
o To estimate time -to-event rates, including overall survival, overall disease- free 
survival, distant dis ease-free survival, and local disease-free survival in patients 
with high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body wall treated with preoperative sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy and postoperative sorafenib plus chemotherapy.  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Soft-Tissue Sarcomas  
Soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of heterogeneous, rare tumors that are diagnosed in 
approximately 8,000 patients per year in the United States.  While limb- salvage 
procedures combining wide excision with radiation therapy achieve local control in up to 90% of patients with extremity soft- tissue sarcomas, approximately half of 
patients with high -grade, >5 cm, deep tumors will die from metastatic disease.
1-4  The 
outcome of these patients is unacceptable.  Improving the survival of patients diagnosed with such high- risk tumors is a priority.  
2.2 Adjuvant Radiotherapy 
The ability to perform limb -salvage surgery was facilitated by the introduction of 
adjunctive radiotherapy.  Adjuvant radiotherapy for soft- tissue sarcoma was initially 
described by Suit and Lindberg, who demonstrated improved local control rates of extremity sarcomas in over 80% of patients.
1,2,5  Preservation of function of the limb 
was achieved in greater than 90% of cases.  Randomized trials have validated the efficacy of the limb -sparing approach in achieving excellent local control rates that 
have eliminated the need for amputation for the majority of patients. A prospective, randomized clinical trial of limb -sparing surgery plus radiation versus amputation 
found equivalent recurrence- free survival rates.
6   A randomized study of limb-
sparing surgery plus or minus adjuvant radiation showed a significant decrease in local recurrence in those patients receiving radiation.
3 Radiotherapy has clearly 
demonstrated its utility in improving local control rates and reducing the amputation rate. 
Administration of radiation can be performed either pre- or postoperatively.  A 
randomized study showed an increased acute wound complication rate with 
preoperative radiation compared to postoperative radiation.
7 However, longer follow-
up has suggested that postoperative radiation is associated with a greater incidence of 
long-term complications, such as subcutaneous fibrosis, that tend to be permanent problems and are probably due to the larger field size and higher radiation dose that 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 6 of 47 
 are used with postoperative treatment.8  In terms of efficacy, loc al control rates are 
the same whether the radiation is administered pre - or postoperatively.7 The use of 
pre- vs. postoperative radiation varies between institutions and is a matter of 
preference of the surgeon and radiation oncologist.  Preoperative administration has 
been the preference at our institution.  Theoretical advantages of preoperative 
radiation include delivery to undisturbed, well-oxygenated tissue.  The field size does 
not need to be increased as it does in post-operative radiotherapy, a llowing for lower 
radiation doses.9 Importantly, pathologic examination of the tumor specimen after 
surgery for necrosis allows assessment of the efficacy of the pre -operative treatment 
that may correlate with overall survival.10 
2.3 Adjuvant Chemotherapy  
The utility of chemotherapy in treatment of localized sarcomas remains controversial.  Theoretically, treatment with drugs active against advanced sarcoma, such as anthracyclines or ifosfamide, may eradicate micro -metastases and thus increase the 
cure rate over surgery plus radiation alone.  The first generation of adjuvant studies included doxorubicin as the key active agent.  These small studies reported conflicting results. A meta-analysis using updated data on 1568 patients treated on trials using doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy was published in 1997,
11 and was 
subsequently updated with data from additional studies for a total population of 1953 patients.
12  A statistically significant benefit favoring chemoth erapy was 
demonstrated for local, distant, and overall recurrence.  The absolute risk reduction for overall recurrence was 10%.
12 A trend towards absolute overall survival benefit of 
4% at 10 years was not statistically significant, but did reach statistical significance upon subgroup analysis of extremity sarcomas (P=.029).
11  The studies on which 
these meta-analyses were based had a number of faults, including heterogeneity of stage and grade, incorporation of non- active chemotherapy drugs into the treatment 
regimens, and possible under-dosing of doxorubicin. 
Randomized, controlled, adjuvant studies containing ifosfamide and using intensified 
chemotherapy doses with hematopoietic growth factor support were begun in the 1990's.  The first to be published was an Italian stud y that randomized patients with 
high-risk sarcomas to observation or to post- operative chemotherapy with ifosfamide 
and epirubicin.
13  This study included only high- risk patients with high -grade, large 
(≥5 cm) or recurrent sarcomas of the extremities or girdle.  One-hundred-four patients 
were randomized to chemotherapy or to observation, and accrual was halted in 1996 after an interim analysis suggested significant benefit from chemotherapy. Subjects in 
the treatment group received 5 cycles of epirubicin 60 mg/m
2 days 1 and 2 and 
ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5, with hydration, mesna, and granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor support.  The median disease- free survival was 48 months in the 
treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P =.04) and the median overall survival was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P =.03).    The study has been criticized for its small size and early s topping based on 
recurrence-free survival; indeed, with longer follow-up the overall survival advantage lost statistical significance.

 2.4 Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy 
There are advantages, both pra ctical and theoretical, to treating high -risk extremity 
soft tissue sarcomas with pre -operative chemotherapy and radiation.  Chemotherapy 
may act both in the early systemic treatment of micrometastatic disease and as a 
radiosensitizer for improved local control.  In combination with pre-operative radiotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve tumor downsizing and potential resectability.  Preoperative radiation has the advantage of delivery to undisturbed, well-oxygenated tissue.  The field size does not need to be increased as it does in post-operative radiotherapy, allowing for lower radiation doses.
9  
Additionally, preoperative therapy allows evaluation of treatment effect from the surgical specimen: the degree of pathologic necrosis in the surg ical specimen after 
chemoradiation has been associated with improved local control and overall survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. In a study published by Eilber,
10 treatment -
induced pathologic necrosis after neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiation was found to be an independent predictor of both local recurrence and overall survival for patients with high -grade sarcomas. The 10 -year overall s urvival 
rate for patients who had achieved ≥ 95% necrosis was 71%, compared with 55% in 
patients with < 95% necrosis. While combined chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery has been reported by a number of different groups, there exists no standard regimen. 
15-20 
We previously published a 25 patient, phase II study investigating a dose-intense, pre-operative chemoradiotherapy regimen for patients with large, intermediate - and high-
grade sarcomas of the extremity or body wall.
20 Intense doses of epirubicin and 
ifosfamide were given pre- and post-surgery, and 28 Gy of radiation in 8 fractions was given preoperatively, partly in conjunction with ifosfamide.  This “hypofractionated” or “rapid fractionation” scheme was based on that previously reported by the UCLA group, a short-course treatment plan that provides for convenient and effective administration of radiation.
15 The rate of ≥95% pathologic 
necrosis in the resected tumors was 40% (95% C.I. 21%, 59%) and estimates of 2-year overall and disease-free survival were 84% (95% CI, 66% to 100%) and 62% (95% CI, 37% to 86%), respectively.  Postoperative wound complications requiring an operative procedure occurred in 20%, within the expected and acceptable range for pre-operative radiotherapy.
7  Due to expected chemotherapy side effects and related 
patient drop-out, only 64% of patients completed all chemotherapy cycles and the average delivered dose intensity relative to intended therapy was 69%.  Notable toxicities included neutropenic fever (40%), ifosfamide encephalopathy (24%), and grade 3-4 anemia (64%).  While the toxicity was manageable and expected from the 
agents utilized, it did impact our ability to deliver the intended dose intensity. The 
rate of ≥95% pathologic necrosis found in a subsequent analysis of 37 patients treated both on- and off- study was 32%.
21 The high rate of pathologic necrosis with this 
regimen has been encouraging, and has prompted us to consider alternate methods of augmenting neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma. 
2.5 Antiangiogenic Therapies for Sarcoma  
Development of new blood vessel formation is critical in the progression of tumors.  Folkman’s hypothesis
22 of targeting this process as an antineoplastic strategy has 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 8 of 47 
 become practical reality three decades later with the advent of antiangiogenic agents 
now in widespread use based on clinical trials that have shown benefit in combination with chemotherapy
23,24 or as monotherapy in select diseases.25-27 Common among 
these treatments is inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity, a key pathway in tumor angiogenesis.  
Soft tissue sarcomas frequently overexpress VEGF
28,29 and elevated circulating levels 
of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are found in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
30-33 Tumor VEGF concentration has been 
found to correlate with grade, stage, and prognosis of soft- tissue sarcomas.29,34  
VEGF-directed therapies have now demonstrated to have activity in a variety of 
advanced soft tissue sarcomas. Pazopanib, an inhibitor of VEGF- R and multikinase 
inhibitor was approved by the FDA in 2012 for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma after previous chemotherapy.  This approval was based on the results of a phase III study that showed improvement in progression-free survival over placebo control.
35 Several studies have looked at sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGF 
receptors, PDGF receptor, Raf/MEK/ERK, and others, as a single- agent in patients 
with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.  The first of these studies to be reported observed 
a small number of radiographic responses in subjects with angiosarcoma and 
leiomyosarcoma, as well as stable disease in these and other sarcoma subtypes.36 At 
least 2 other studies of sorafenib in advanced sarcoma have been conducted, including a phase II study by the Southwest Oncology Group in which OHSU led accrual and developed a sizeable pilot experience using the agent for this disease (19 subjects).
37  While no objective radiographic responses were observed in this study, 
patients with vascular -type sarcomas were noted to have prolonged stable disease.  
 
While the activity of these antiangiogenic agents against soft- tissue sarcomas may 
appear low when evaluated with the traditional metric of radiographic response rates, 
this measure is far from optimal in assessing the activity of antiang iogenic agents 
which typically may not cause rapid involution of tumors.  Radiographic disease stabilization as a clinically meaningful effect has been demonstrated in studies with sorafenib in renal carcinoma, in which traditional response rates are low b ut 
progression-free survival is improved.
25 Additionally, the use of these agents as 
monotherapy in the high- disease burden setting of metastatic disease may not r eveal 
their full activity, and studying their use in combination with chemotherapy in the locally advanced, micrometastatic setting may yield greater impact.  In a VEGF -
overexpressing preclinical sarcoma model, VEGF receptor blockade enhanced chemotherapy responsiveness and decreased development of pulmonary metastases, 
suggesting that combining
 anti-VEGF therapy with chemotherapy might be most 
useful in high VEGF- secreting sarcoma patients at high risk of eventual metastatic 
spread.38

 2.6 Sorafenib  
Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor 
proliferation and tumor angiogenesis.39  It was initially selected based on inhibitory 
activity against the serine/threonine kinases Raf-1 and wild- type B-Raf, which are 
pivotal components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.  Inhibitory activity was subsequently demonstrated against the tyrosine kinases for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor as 
well as Flt-3 and c- Kit.
39  
The Raf/ME K/ERK pathway is an important mediator of responses to growth factors, 
and a strong inducer of genes involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis.
40  In preclinical studies, sorafenib demonstrated broad-spe ctrum anti -
tumor activity by inducing complete tumor stasis and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types.
39   
The safety and clinical activity of sorafenib, alone 41-44 or in combination45,46 with 
chemotherapy, has been examined in a series of phase I studies conducted in patients with solid tumors. Results of a  multi-center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double-
blind phase III trial of sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were first reported in 2005.
47,48 The co-primary endpoints of the trial were overall survival (OS) 
and progression-free survival (PFS).  Patients with advanced cl ear cell renal 
carcinoma with good performance status following one prior systemic therapy were randomized to either sorafenib or blinded placebo with best supportive care.  At the time of a per -protocol interim analysis of PFS, 769 of 884 planned patients had been 
randomized, and 342 PFS events had been reported. Median PFS was 24 weeks for sorafenib versus 12 weeks for placebo (hazard ratio 0.44; p<0.00001) and the 12 week progression-free rate was 79% for sorafenib versus 50% for placebo.  Based on these results, the study in May 2005 was unblinded and patients in the placebo group were allowed to cross over and receive sorafenib.  At the time of cross over, an interim analysis of overall survival was conducted based on 220 events. Median overall survival in the placebo group was 14.7 months and had not been reached in the sorafenib group.  The Hazard Ratio (sorafenib over placebo) was 0.72 with a p-value of p = 0.018. The threshold for statistical significance for this interim analysis was not reached (p < 0.0005).  Final analysis of OS was reported at ASCO 2007.
49  
Overall survival in the sorafenib group was 17.8 months and 15.2 months in the placebo group (HR 0.88, p=0.146).  For this study, however, OS was likely confounded by the fact that approximately half of the placebo patients crossed over at the time of unblinding to receive sorafenib.  To illustrate that point, overall survival analysis with placebo patients censored  at the time of cross over indicated that 
sorafenib treated patients had a statistically significant 22% reduction in mortality risk compared to placebo patients (OS 17.8 mo vs. 14.3 mo, HR 0.78, p=0.0287).   
A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III trial of 
sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also reported at ASCO in 2007.
26  In this study 602 patients with advanced HCC, Child Pugh class A, having 
received no prior systemic therapy were randomized to receive either sorafenib (n=299) at 400 mg bid or placebo (n=303).  In February 2007, based on a planned interim analysis of overall survival, the DMSB recommended unblinding and closure 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 10 of 47 
 of the study.  OS in the sorafenib group was 46.3 wks versus 34.4 wks in the placebo-
treated group. This represented a 44% increase in relative OS (HR 0.69, p=0.00058).  PFS was also significantly increased in the sorafenib group (24 wks) vs. the placebo group (12.3 wks); HR 0.58, p=0.000007.     
As mentioned previously, several studies with sorafenib monotherapy have been 
conducted in soft tissue sarcoma, and activity has been seen in several histologic subtypes including angiosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.
36 
2.7 Antiangiogenics plus Chemoradiotherapy  
Antiangiogenics have been shown to increase the effects of chemotherapy and radiation in  pre-clinical and clinical studies. Bevacizumab has been demonstrated to 
increase overall survival when added to chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
23,24   This may seem counterintuitive, as anti- vascular 
therapies would be expected to reduce blood flow, thus potentially decreasing delivery of drug and oxygen to the tumor needed for the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and radiation, respectively.  However, tumor vasculature is thought to be abnormal due to an imbalance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors leading to a 
number of effects that can be a barrier to drug and oxygen delivery including 
impedance of blood flow and interstitial hypertension.
50 The concept of 
“normalizing” tumor vasculature with antiang iogenic therapy has been proposed as a 
method whereby drug delivery and oxygenation are improved and thus can amplify 
the effect of chemotherapy and radiation.50  Blockade of VEGF signaling can “prune” 
immature vessels, helping to normalize the vasculature and tumor microenvironment, thus improving tumor oxygenation and delivery of drugs.
51,52 Early evidence suggests 
that combined VEGF-blockade and chemoradiotherapy is safe and promising in locally advanced rectal cancer.
52,53  Many phase I -II studies investigating combined 
antiangiogenic and chemoradiotherapy are ongoing, but to our knowledge none are currently investigating this approach in soft tissue sarcomas.
54 
2.8 Sorafenib with Chemoradiotherapy  
Given the early clinical activity observed with antiangiogenic agents in advanced soft tissue sarcomas and given that the greatest effect of antiangiogenics may not be as monotherapy but in their ability to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, we have found it compelling to study the effect of combined 
antiangiogenic therapy with chemoradiotherapy in patients with localized, high-risk, 
extremity soft tissue sarcomas.   We thus conducted a 16 subject phase I study with 
escalating doses of sorafenib to determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib in combination with a dose-modified version of our previously published regimen of preoperative chemoradiation and postoperative chemotherapy with epirubicin and ifosfamide.
55  At a sorafenib dose of 400 mg twice daily, dose- limiting toxicities 
included grade 4 neutropenic sepsis in 1 patient and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in all 3 patients treated. We determined a maximu m-tolerated-dose for sorafenib to be 
400 mg daily when combined with a regimen of 28 Gy of preoperative hypofractionated radiation and pre- and post-operative chemotherapy (epirubicin 30 mg/m
2/day days 1 -3 and ifosfamide 2.5 g/m2/day days 1 -3). At this dose level, 
toxicity was similar to that seen with chemoradiotherapy alone. Grade 3 -4 
hematologic toxicity was common including a 50% rate of neutropenic fever and 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 11 of 47 
 neutropenic infections. The most common grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity was 
hypophosphatemia, a known side effect of both sorafenib and ifosfamide, which was easily managed with phosphorus replacement and did not lead to any significant sequelae.  The rate of wound complications was 38%, which is similar to the 35% that has been reported with preoperative radiation alone.   We observed a promising rate of pathologic response (≥95% necrosi s) across all dose 
levels of 44%.  Eleven of the subjects were enrolled in a companion study evaluating 
DCE-MRI to assess preoperative therapy effect, and results indicate that treatment 
effect of sorafenib could be detected in some patients after only 2 weeks of sorafenib, 
and that the change in a novel DCE -MRI biomarker, ∆K
trans, at this time point 
correlated with pathologic necrosis  found at the time of eventual surgery (Figure 1).

biomarkers (SM Ktrans, SSM Ktrans, and ΔKtrans) from baseline (TP 0) to 2 weeks after sorafenib treatment

2.9 Study Rationale 
The optimal chemoradiotherapy regimen for soft- tissue sarcomas remains undefined.  
We have extended our neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy experience by confirming the safety and feasibility of combined treatment with sorafenib in a dose-finding phase I study.
55  We now propose to further study the efficacy and safety of sorafenib 400 
mg/daily when combined with chemoradiotherapy (epirubicin, ifosfamide, and hypofractionated radiation) as an adjunct to surgery for extremity soft tissue sarcomas in the setting of a phase II trial.

 We hypothesize that this regimen will improve clinical outcome in patients with high -
risk disease by potentiating the effects of chemoradiotherapy on the local tumor and 
enhancing the effects of chemotherapy on micrometastatic disease.  Treatment effect 
will be assessed by the pathologic response rate (≥95% necrosis), and subjects will be 
followed for local recurrence, distant relapse, and overall survival.

3.3 Removal of Subjects from Study  
3.3.1 Criteria for stopping therapy:  
• Substantial non-compliance with the requirements of the study.  
• Any adverse event which, in the Investigator’s opinion, requires termination of 
the study medication . 
• Disease progression, unless at the discretion of the investigator (in collaboration with Bayer/Onyx) continued treatment with study drug is appropriate. 
• The patient would benefit from additional radiation therapy beyond that 
specified in the protocol. 
• Request by the patient or a legal representative/relative to stop the treatment.  
• The patient presents with a beta-HCG test consistent with pregnancy.  
Pregnancy will be reported along the same timelines as a serious adverse event  
• The patient uses illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise interfering with results.  
• The development of a second malignancy that requires treatment, which would interfere with this study . 
• The patient is lost to follow -up. 
• Interruption in study drug’ s administration for greater than 3-week delay.  
Following surgery, interruption in study drug’s administration is allowed for up to 10-weeks from initial surgery.  
• Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the investigator, affect assessments of clinical status and study endpoints to a significant degree.  
3.3.2 Criteria for study withdrawal:  
• Disease progression, unless at the discretion of the investigator (in 
collaboration with Bayer/Onyx) continued treatment with study drug is 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 15 of 47 
 appropriate. 
• Study closure,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient decision to withdraw from the study, or 
• In the judgment of the investigator, further treatment would not be in the best 
interest of the patient.  
 
The Investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep each patient in the study unless it is  in the patient’s best in terest to discontinue participation.  If a patient is 
removed from the study or declines further participation, all End of Treatment evaluations should be performed if the patient is willing and able to be assessed.  A description of the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  The Investigator should also ensure that all patients are followed up for survival and recurrence after the Final Visit.  
Relevant visit data should be entered on the CRF and any unused study medication will be accounted for and returned for all patients participating in the study, even for a brief period of time.  Patients who discontinue following entry will have relevant information completed and recorded on the CRF.  All patients who discontinue because of adverse events or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed up until they recover or stabilize, and the subsequent outcome will be recorded.  If any patient should die during the trial or within 30 days of st opping study treatment, the Investigator will inform the OHSU 
IRB and the Bayer representative.  The cause of death should be recorded in detail, within 24 hours, on a serious adverse event (SAE) form and reported to the sponsor Drug Safety Unit (refer to Section  10)).

 1 cycle = 21 days in length 
♦ PEG-Filgrastim should be administered 24 -48 hours after completing chemotherapy.  10 
days of filgrastim may be substituted.  
* Radiation administration will consist of 8 fractions over 10 days, as it is common practice 
in many centers not to administer rad iation therapy on weekends. Whenever possible, both 
radiation and chemotherapy should be administered together on days 36- 38. Initiating 
chemoradiation on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday for cycle 2 will help ensure 
concomitant administration during these 3 days prior to the weekend break. 
** Sorafenib should be discontinued 1 week before surgery and resumed 1 week after 
surgery.  Note that the timing of surgery and resumption of post- operative chemotherapy 
presented here are estimations.  While adherence to this schedule is a goal, treatment -
related complications and other logistical factors may alter scheduled events.  In general, surgery should be planned for 2-4 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy for cycle 3.  Deviation from this schedule will be  reported in the final analysis.  In case of delays, the 
dates specified above should be appropriately recalculated.  If a major wound complication requires additional surgery, reinstitution of chemotherapy (cycle 4) should be initiated only after adequate wound healing has been achieved (a minimum of 2 weeks following the second surgery).   Patients who require a delay of greater than 10 weeks since initial surgery due to inadequate wound healing will be removed from further protocol therapy. 
*** For patients with positive surgical margins, 12 Gy (200 cGy x 6 fractions) will be given 
by external beam prior to restarting chemotherapy.  Begin radiation 2 weeks after surgery (approximately day 91) assuming wound is healing well. 
4.1 Study Drug  
Sorafenib will be administered orally 400 mg once daily. Sorafenib will begin 2 weeks before first chemotherapy cycle with epirubicin and ifosfamide.  Sorafenib will be held 1 week before and after surgery  
4.2 Chemotherapy Dose and Suggested Administration Guidelines (may be modified per institutional standards)  
Chemotherapy can be administered on either an inpatient or outpatient basis.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described in the protocol may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Patients will receive 3 cycles of pre -operative chemotherapy and 3 cycles of post-
operative chemotherapy.  
Recommended hydration is 0.45 NS + 50 mEq NaHCO3 1L over 2 hours prior to ifosfamide daily.  
 
• Epirubicin: 30 mg/m
2/day I.V., days 1 -3 of each cycle.  Epirubicin is to be 
omitted during cycle 2 (concomitant chemoradiation) 
• Ifosfamide: 2.5 g/m2 over 90 minutes I.V., days 1- 3 of each cycle.  Begin 
after  1 L hydration  
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 17 of 47 
 • Mesna:  Suggested dosing: 850 mg/m2 mixed in same bag as ifosfami de, 
then 850 mg/m2 I.V. over 15 minutes given 4 hours and 8 hours after start of 
ifosfamide, days 1- 3 of each cycle  
• PEG-filgrastim 6 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection starting 24 -
48 hours after completion of chemotherapy (may substitute filgrastim  5 
mcg/kg/day (rounded to nearest vial size) administered as a subcutaneous injection starting 24 -48 hours after completion of chemotherapy for 10 days, 
or until white blood count has recovered after nadir (ANC > 10,000) 
4.3 Radiation 
Treatment is to consist of one course of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 
coinciding with the start of cycle 2 of chemotherapy.  Treatment will consist of a total dose of 28 Gy (350cGy x 8 fractions in 10 days).  If treatment falls on a weekend or holiday, treatment can resume the next business day. 
The target volume of radiation therapy will include the site of the primary lesion 
and those tissues suspected of involvement by microscopic disease to a clinically important probability.  Physical exam in conjunction with MRI or CT scans obtained during evaluation will be used in defining the target volume.  The margins beyond clinically or radiologically- evident sarcoma will be 7 cm.  Optimal field 
arrangement, beam parameters, and shaped blocks will be used to achieve the closest approximation of treatment volume to target volume to minimize irradiation 
of uninvolved normal tissue.  Immobilization devices should be used daily to ensure reproducibility of treatment.  
Post-operative EBRT boost will be given for patients with posit ive margins.  The 
radiation treatment is to be completed by administering 12 Gy in 6 fractions (once a day) to the bed of the residual tumor (including a margin of 1 cm).  Boost will not be given for patients with 100% necrosis.  EBRT will begin approximat ely 2 weeks 
following resection, assuming there is satisfactory healing of the surgical wound.   The target volume for the post-operative radiation therapy will be the tumor bed as defined by the operative and pathological findings.  Chemotherapy can resum e 
thereafter.  
4.4 Surgery 
Surgical treatment necessary to resect the tumor with negative margins should be used.  All lesions of the trunk and extremities will be treated with conservative resection (minimal wide excision) after pre -operative therapy.  Surgical resection 
should remove as wide a margin of tissue around the tumor as possible without compromising function.  Dissection should always be done through grossly normal tissue planes and should be done beyond fascial plane adjacent to the tumor.  If the tumor is close to or displaces major vessels or nerves, these need not be removed if the adventitia or perineurium is removed and the margin is not involved pathologically.  Frozen section at the time of surgery should be done from the closest margin and should be confirmed as being free of tumor.  If postoperative pathology evaluation reveals positive soft-tissue margins other than bone, nerve, or large blood vessels, this margin should be resected if possible.  If bone, major blood vessel or nerve is microscopically positive ad ditional radiation should be given as 
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 18 of 47 
 noted in the protocol.  In general, lymph node dissection is not recommended, but a 
sampling can be performed if the primary tumor is over a major node station.  Primary tumors overlying major lymph node stations may b est be treated with 
surgical resection including node dissection.   Marker clips (titanium) may be placed to help guide the radiation oncologist.  Closed wound suction drainage should be used in all anatomic regions (Davol, Hemavac, etc.)  The drains should exit the skin close to the edge of the surgical incision.  External compression for extremity resections with ace wraps or compression dressings is advised.  
State clearly in the operative note what type of surgical procedure was performed, and from where the frozen section of the margins was taken. 
Because all patients will have had radiation, special care must be given to skin 
flaps.  Use of muscle flaps, pedicled myocutaneous flaps, and even free flaps is encouraged to fill dead space and used if there is any concern about the viability of the wound flaps. 
In general, the following principles should be followed in post- operative 
management of these patients:  
• Maintain staples or skin sutures per surgeon preference but because of potential 
delay in wound healing, 3 -4 weeks is recommended  
• Leave drains until the drainage meets the criteria for surgeon preference for discontinuation 
• Begin rehabilitation slowly  
Resectability will depend upon the judgment of the operating surgeon.  For the extremities, resection  must be limb salvage procedure.  For other anatomic areas, it 
must be the judgment of the operating surgeon that he/she may reasonably expect to obtain negative margins. Extremity patients who are not resectable without amputation may be amputated, and should complete chemotherapy per protocol.  Unresectable tumors elsewhere may be palliated with additional chemotherapy, per protocol.  Patients who would benefit from additional radiation therapy will be withdrawn from protocol therapy. 
Note that documentation of wound complications is an integral part of this 
clinical trial.  Wound complications are defined in section 8.5 and must be accurately recorded and reported to the coordinating center.  
4.5 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Appropriate anti -emetics per institutional standard and at the investigator’s 
discretion should be used with this highly- emetogenic regimen.  
Use of erythroid growth factors to support hemoglobin levels are permitted, at the discretion of the investigator. 
Prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of neutropenic fever may be used at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Use of prophylactic antibiotics must be recorded in the case report forms.  
4.6 Other Concomitant Medications  
Sorafenib  is metabolized primarily by liver enzymes, in particular CYP3A4. Caution 
is recommended when administering sorafenib with inducers of the CYP3A4 family.  
Version 1: 04 March 2013  Page 19 of 47 
 Concurrent administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as, phenyoin, rifabutin, 
and rifampin) is not permited.  In a clinical interaction study, concurrent 
administration of sorafenib with rifampin resulted in a 37% decrease in mean 
sorafenib AUC. Other agents known to moderately induce CYP3A4 should be 
avoided if possible.  
4.7 Duration of Therapy 
Treatmen t should continue until the end of protocol therapy or until one of the 
following criteria applies: 
Disease progression,  
The patient would benefit from additional radiation therapy beyond that specified in the protocol, 
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
Unacceptable adverse events(s),  
Greater than 3 -week delay in therapy due to adverse event  
The patient presents with a beta-HCG test consistent with pregnancy.  
Patient or legal representative/relative requests to withdra w from the study, or 
General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
5. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
5.1 Sorafenib Dose Modifications 
General Considerations.  Sorafenib dosing will be modified for adverse events that 
are at least in -part attributable  to sorafenib according to the following dose levels:   
 
 
     All patients will start treatment at dose level 0.  
 
Patients will be removed from protocol treatment if dose reduction below - 2 is 
indicated.   Dose Level  Sorafenib

21 5.1.2 Dose Modifications for Sorafenib- Associated Hypertension  
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with sorafenib 
treatment. Patients will have their blood pressure monitored and recorded weekly during the first 6 weeks of therapy, either at the doctor’s office or by using any calibrated 
electronic device (such as those found at a local drug store or pharmacy). Patients will record their weekly blood pressure during the first 6 weeks on their drug diary, a copy o f 
which will remain in the research chart. If the patient’s blood pressure is elevated at any time (>150/100), even outside clinic visits, they should contact their treating physician.

then reduce one dose level and resume 
treatment.  Withhold dose until 
toxicity is grade <1, 
then reduce one dose level and resume treatment, or discontinue at the discretion of the principal investigator.  
Hematologic  Continue at the  
same dose level.  Continue at the  
same dose level.  Withhold dose until 
toxicity is grade <2, 
then resume treatment at the same dose level.  If patient experiences a second grade 3 toxicity, withhold dose until toxicity is grade <2, 
then reduce one dose level and resume 
treatment.  Withhold dose until 
toxicity is grade <2, 
then reduce one dose level and resume treatment, or discontinue at the discretion of  the principal investigator after discussion with study supporter. 
*Patients who develop grade 3 fever/chills, grade 3 hyperlipasemia or hyperamylasemia without clinical or other 
evidence of pancreatitis, grade 3 leukopenia, or grade 3/grade 4 lymphopenia may continue study treatment without 
interruption at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Because certain grade 3 -4 adverse events are common with epirubicin, ifosfamide 
and radiotherapy, the above table should be modified for these adverse events as 
defined below (unless the adverse events are definitely attributable only to 
sorafenib, in which case refer to above table).  Attribution to sorafenib at least in-
part should be present in order to justify sorafenib dose-reduction: 
• Neutropenia – Grade 3 or Grade 4 lasting ≤7 days: no action.  Grade 4 lasting 
>7 days: refer to table above 
• Neutropenic Fever – Grade 3 lasting ≤5 days: no action.  Grade 3 lasting >5 
days or Grade 4: refer to table above 
• Leukopenia –  No dose reduction 
• Thrombocytopenia --  Grade 3: no action.  Grade 4 lasting ≤ 5 days: no action, 
Grade 4 lasting > 5 days : refer to table above.  Grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia 
with clinically significant bleeding: refer to table above.  
• Anemia – Grade 3: no action. Grade 4: refer to table above 
 
23 • Nausea/Vomiting – Per above table, only if persistent Grade 3-4 despite 
maximal anti- emetic adjustment 
• Fatigue – Grade 3: no action.  Grade 4: refer to table above. 
• Diarrhea – Diarrhea should be initially managed with anti- diarrhea agents 
including loperamide or Lomotil.  If persistent Grade 3- 4 toxicity, refer to 
table above.  
• Hypophosphatemia /Hypokalemia  – Grade 3: replacement therapy.  Grade 4: 
refer to above table only if refractory to replacement therapy  
• Transaminitis – Grade 3 with ALT and AST:  Monitor liver function tests 
until resolution. Consider dose reduction at investigator’s discretion. 
5.2 Chemotherapy Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications for epirubicin and ifosfamide- related toxicity will be based on the 
following dose level schema.  All patients will start treatment at dose level 0.  Patients who require a reduction of dose below Dose Level –3 will be  removed from the study.

5.2.1 Hematologic Toxicity 
5.2.1.1 A treatment cycle may not begin unless the patient's absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥ 1500/µL and platelet count is ≥ 75,000/µL 
(without transfusion). 
5.2.1.2 Grade 4 neutropenic fever,  grade 3 neutropenic fever lasting >5 
days, or grade 4 neutropenia for >7days:   reduce by one dose level 
for next and all subsequent cycles  
5.2.1.3 Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding or 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting >5 days:  reduce by one dose level 
for next and all subsequent cycles  
5.2.1.4 Anemia: Institution of erythropoietin or darbopoietin at physician's 
discretion  
5.2.2 Non-hematologic Toxicity 
Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is attributable to 
chemotherapy and not to the underlying disease should have chemotherapy held until the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1.  Treatment should then be resumed at a 
 
24 reduction of one dose level for the next and all subsequent cycles (see 
exceptions below).  Patients who are delayed greater than 3 weeks due to non-resolution of such toxicity will be taken off stud y.  
5.2.2.1 Nausea and Vomiting:  Grade 3 or 4 nausea or vomiting should be 
managed with anti- emetic adjustments (at treating physicians 
discretion) before a dose-reduction is performed 
5.2.2.2 Cardiac Toxicity:   Patients who experience a Grade 3 or greater 
impairment in left ventricular function (decline of ≥ 20% of baseline 
LVEF or symptomatic congestive heart failure) or Grade 3 or greater 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction should immediately be removed 
from protocol therapy. 
5.2.2.3 Renal Toxicity:   Patients who experience grade 2 or greater Acute 
Kidney Injury or Hematuria should have therapy held until the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1.  Treatment should then be resumed at the next lower dose level that includes a lower dose of ifosfamide (i.e. reduce 
from dose level 0 or -1 to dose level -2, reduce from dose level -2 to dose level -3) for the next and all subsequent cycles, at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
5.2.2.4 Electrolyte Wasting:   Electrolyte wasting, especially potassium and 
phosphorous, is a common effect of ifosfamide therapy due to renal tubular effects.  Grade 3 or greater hypokalemia and/or hypophosphatemia should be managed with appropriate electrolyte replacement.  If electrolyte wasting is refractory to replacement therapy, a dose reduction should be undertaken to the next lower dose level that includes a lower dose of ifosfamide 
5.2.2.5 CNS Toxicity:   Patients who experience grade 3 or greater 
Encephalopathy should have therapy held until the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1.  Treatment should then be resumed at the next lower dose level that includes a lower dose of ifosfamide (i.e. reduce from dose 
level 0 or -1 to dose level -2, reduce from dose level -2 to dose level -3) for the next and all subsequent cycles.  If a patient is to be removed 
from study due to reaching the maximum allowable number of dose 
level reductions, and if these reductions were due to ifosfamide- related 
CNS toxicity, then the patient will be allowed to continue on treatment 
with omission of ifosfamide and continuation of epirubicin and 
sorafenib. 
6. AGENT FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT  
6.1 Sorafenib (Nexavar) 
Availability:    Sorafenib will be supplied for this study 
Product description:  Sorafenib 200 mg is supplied as round, biconvex, red- film-
coated tablets, debossed with the 'Bayer cross' on one side and '200' on the other side.  The tablets contain sorafenib tosylate equivalent to 200 mg of the free base sorafenib, and the excipients croscarmellose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, hypromellose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and magnesium stearate. The fi lm-coat consists of 
 
25 hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and red iron oxide. The film 
coating has no effect on the rate of release of the active sorafenib tosylate. Study Drug can be supplied as sorafenib 200 mg  commercial tablets in bottles  of 140 tablets with a 
product identification label affixed or as commercial Nexavar in bottles of 120 tablets.  
Storage requirements:   Do not store above 25°C (77°F). Store in the original package. 
Stability:  The current shelf life is 36 months
. 
Route of administration:  Orally. Sorafenib should be given on an empty stomach 1 hour 
before 2 hours after a meal.  
Pregnancy:  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy.  Women of 
childbearing potential must be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, which includes sever malformation (teratogenicity), failure to thrive and fetal death (embryotoxicity).  Sorafenib should not be used during pregnancy.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during sorafenib therapy. 
Expected adverse events:   The following additional drug- related adverse events and 
laboratory abnormalities were reported from clinical trials of sorafenib in 1286 cancer 
patients who received sorafenib as monotherapy ( very common  10% or greater, 
common 1 to less than10%, uncommon 0.1% to less than 1%): 
Cardiovascular : Uncommon:  hypertensive crisis, myocardial ischemia and/or 
infarction  
Dermatologic: Very common: erythema Common:  exfoliative dermatitis, acne, 
flushing Uncommon:  folliculitis, eczema, erythema multiforme  
Digestive: Ve ry common:  increased lipase, increased amylase Common:  mucositis, 
stomatitis (including dry mouth and glossodynia), dyspepsia, dysphagia Uncommon:  
pancreatitis, gastrointestinal reflux, gastritis. Note that elevations in lipase are very common; a diagnosis of pancreatitis should not be made solely on the basis of abnormal laboratory values 
General Disorders:  Very common:  asthenia, pain (including mouth pain, bone pain, 
and muscle pain) Common:  decreased appetite, influenza- like illness, pyrexia 
Uncommon:  infection 
Hematologic:  Very common:  leukopenia, lymphopenia Common:  anemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia Uncommon:  INR abnormal  
Hypersensitivity: Uncommon:  hypersensitivity reactions (including skin reactions 
and urticaria)  
Metabolic and Nutritional : Very common:  hypophosphatemia Common:  transient 
increases in transaminases Uncommon:  dehydration, hyponatremia, transient 
increases in alkaline phosphatase, increased bilirubin (including jaundice), hypothyroidism 
Musculoskeletal:  Common:  arthralgia, myalgia  
Nervous System and Psychiatric: Common:  depression Uncommon:  tinnitus 
Reproductive : Common:  erectile dysfunction Uncommon:  gynecomastia  
Respiratory: Common:  hoarseness Uncommon:  rhinorrhea  
In addition, the following medically significant adverse events were reported 
 
26 infrequently during clinical trials of sorafenib: cerebral hemorrhage, transient 
ischemic attack, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolism, acute renal failure. For these events, the causal relationship to sorafenib has not been established. 
Effects on fertility: Results from animal studies indicate that sorafenib can impair 
male and female fertility.  
6.2 Epirubicin (Ellence)  
Availability:   Epirubicin is commercially available.  
Product description :  Epirubicin is available in polypropylene single- use vials 
containing 2 mg epirubicin hydrochloride per mL as a sterile, preservative- free ready -
to-use solution in 50 mg and 200 mg vials.  
Solution preparation:  Epirubicin is available a s a preservative- free, ready -to-use 
solution. 
Storage requirements:   Store refrigerated between 2ºC and 8ºC (36ºF and 46ºF).  Do 
not freeze.  Protect from light.  
Stability: Epirubicin should be used within 24 hours of first penetration of the rubber 
stopper. 
Route of administration:   Intravenous administration of epirubicin should be 
performed with caution.  It is recommended that epirubicin be administered into the tubing of a freely flowing intravenous infusion (0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose solution) over a period of 3 to 5 minutes.  This technique is intended to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation, which could lead to severe cellulites, vesication, or tissue necrosis.  A direct push injection is not recommended due to the risk of extravasation, which may occur even in the presence of adequate blood return 
upon needle aspiration.  Venous sclerosis may result from injection into small vessels or repeated injections into the same vein. 
Pregnancy:  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy.  Breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during therapy. 
Expected adverse events:   
Hematologic : A dose-dependent, reversible leukopenia and/or neutropenia is the 
predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity.  Severe thrombocytopenia and 
anemia may also occur.  
Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis  
Dermatologic : Alopecia, flushes, skin and nail hyperpigmentation, photosensitivity, 
hypersensitivity to irradiated skin. 
Extravasation: Infiltration can cause severe in flammation, tissue necrosis, and 
ulceration.   If the drug is infiltrated, consult institutional policy, apply ice to area, and elevate the limb.  May require debridement.  
Cardiac: Anthracycline -induced cardiac toxicity may be manifested by early or late 
events.  Early cardiac toxicity consists mainly of sinus tachycardia and/or ECG abnormalities such as non- specific ST -T wave changes, but tachyarrhythmias , 
bradycardia, as well as atrioventricular and bundle-branch block have also been reported.  Delayed c ardiotoxicity results from a characteristic cardiomyopathy that is 
manifested by reduced LVEF and/or signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  
 
27 The probability of developing CHF increases with increasing cumulative doses of 
epirubicin.  The risk of d eveloping CHF in the absence of other cardiac risk factors 
increases steeply after an epirubicin cumulative dose of 900 mg/m2. 
Secondary Leukemia :  The occurrence of secondary acute myelogenous leukemia 
has been reported in patients treated with anthracyclines.  
Miscellaneous: Allergic reaction, anaphylaxis.

Pregnancy:  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy.  Breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during therapy. 
Expected adverse events:   
Central nervous system: Somnolence, confusion, hallucinations in 12% and coma 
(rare) have occurred and are usually reversible; usually occur with higher doses or in 
patients with reduced renal function; depressive psychoses, polyneuropathy. Note:  
CNS depression can be reversed with methylene blue (50 mg intravenously) and methylene blue is recommended for prophylaxis for subsequent doses if the patient has CNS manifestations with the first dose.  
Dermatologic : Alopecia occurs in 50% to 83% of patients 2- 4 weeks after initiation 
of therapy; may be as high as 100% in com bination therapy. Phlebitis, dermatitis, 
nail ridging, skin hyperpigmentation, impaired wound healing. 
Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting in 58% of patients is dose and schedule 
related (more common with higher doses and after bolus regimens); nausea and vomiting can persist up to 3 days after therapy; also anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, transient increase in LFTs and stomatitis noted.  
Genitourinary : Hemorrhagic cystitis has been frequently associated with the use of 
ifosfamide; a urinalysis prior to  each dose should be obtained; ifosfamide should 
never be administered without a uroprotective agent (MESNA) ; hematuria has 
been reported in 6% to 92% of patients; renal toxicity occurs in 6% of patients and is 
 
28 manifested as an increase in BUN or serum creatinine and is most likely related to 
tubular damage; renal toxicity, including ARF, may occur more frequently with high-dose ifosfamide; metabolic acidosis may occur in up to 31% of patients. 
Endocrine & metabolic : SIADH  
Hematologic : Myelosuppression: Leukopenia is mild to moderate, thrombocytopenia 
and anemia are rare. However, myelosuppression can be severe when used with other chemotherapeutic agents or with high-dose therapy; be cautious with patients with compromised bone marrow reserve  
Respiratory : Nasal stuffiness, pulmonary fibrosis 
Cardiovascular : Cardiotoxicity  
Miscellaneous : Immunosuppression, sterility, possible secondary malignancy, 
allergic reactions  
6.4 Mesna (Mesnex)  
Availability:  Mesna is commercially available.  
Product description:  Mesna is available as a sterile, preservative-free aqueous 100 
mg/mL solution in 200 mg ampules or 1 g multidose vials.  Mesna tablets are available as a white, oblong, scored, film coated 400 mg tablet. 
Mechanism of action:   Mesna is a uroprotecant whose oxidized form dimesna binds to 
and inactivates acrolein, a urotoxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.  
Solution preparation:  Mesna can be diluted in D5W or NS to a final concentration of 
1-20 mg/mL. 
Storage and Stability:  Diluted solutions are chemically and physically stable for 24 
hours at room temperature; polypropylene syringes are stable for 9 days at refrigeration 
or room temperature; injection diluted for oral administration is stable 24 hours at refrigeration

administered separately IVPB over 15 minutes. 
Mesna injection may also be administered orally.  For oral administration, injection 
may be diluted in 1:1, 1:2, 1:10, 1:100 concentrations in carbonated beverages (cola, ginger ale, Pepsi®, Sprite®, Dr Pepper®, etc), juices (apple or orange), or whole milk (chocolate or white), and is stable 24 hours at refrigeration.  Mesna tablets should be given orally and absorption is not affected by food.  Mesna tablets are approxi mately 
50% bioavailable and are generally dosed at 2 & 6 hours after the first mesna dose, which is usually given intravenously, to account for the delayed absorption with an oral vs. the intravenous product 
Pregnancy:  Women should avoid becoming pregnant while on therapy.  Breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during therapy. 
Expected adverse events:  
Cardiovascular : Hypotension  
Central nervous system : Malaise, headache

6.5 Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)  
Availability:  Pegfilgrastim is commercially available.  
Product Description: Neulasta™ is supplied as a preservative-free solution containing 
6 mg (0.6 mL) of peg filgrastim (10 mg/mL) in a single -dose syringe with a 27 gauge, 
1/2 inch needle with an UltraSafe® Needle Guard.  Neulasta™ is provided in a 
dispensing pack containing one syringe (NDC 55513-190-01).  
Storage and Stability: Neulasta™ should be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 
46°F); syringes should be kept in their carton to protect from light until time of use. Shaking should be avoided. Before injection, Neulasta™ may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 48 hours but should be prot ected from light. Neulasta™ 
left at room temperature for more than 48 hours should be discarded. Freezing should be avoided; however, if accidentally frozen, Neulasta™ should be allowed to thaw in the refrigerator before administration. If frozen a second time, Neulasta™ should be discarded.
 
Route of Administration:  The recommended dosage of Neulasta™ is a single 
subcutaneous (SC) injection of 6 mg administered once per chemotherapy cycle. Neulasta™ should not be administered in the period between 14 days before and 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The 6 mg fixed-dose formulation should not be used in infants, children, and smaller adolescents weighing less than 45 kg.  Neulasta™ should be visually inspected for discoloration and par ticulate matter 
before administration. Neulasta™ should not be administered if discoloration or particulates are observed.
 
Neulasta™ is supplied in prefilled syringes with UltraSafe® Needle Guards. Following administration of Neulasta™ from the prefilled s yringe, the UltraSafe® Needle Guard 
should be activated to prevent accidental needle sticks. To activate the UltraSafe® Needle Guard, place your hands behind the needle, grasp the guard with one hand, and slide the guard forward until the needle is completely covered and the guard clicks into place. NOTE: If an audible click is not heard, the needle guard may not be completely activated. The prefilled syringe should be disposed of by placing the entire prefilled syringe with guard activated into an approved puncture-proof container.

7. CORRELATIVE / SPECIAL STUDIES  
7.1 Angiogenic Biomarkers  
Plasma will be collected for  measurement of  tumorigenic and angiogenic markers 
including p- ERK, VEGF, sVEGFR2, and bFGF at baseline, week 2 (after sorafenib 
run-in), and then every 3 weeks through completion of treatment.  Blood samples (10 
mL) will be drawn using venipuncture into a Vacutainer containing potassium EDTA 
and inverted gently several times to mix with anticoagulant. Within 10 -15 minutes after 
collecting, blood samples will be centrifuged in a refrigerated (4 °C) centrifuge for 10 
minutes to separate the plasma. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not availa ble, the tubes 
should be chilled in an ice bath for 5-15 minutes and then placed in a standard centrifuge for 10 minutes to separate the plasma. The plasma will be transferred to 
polypropylene tubes and frozen at -70°C or lower. The tubes will be labeled w ith the 
investigator’s name, study number, and subject’s study number, and time and date of 
the sample acquisition.  
Fresh tumor tissue will be collected when possible at baseline and at time of resection.  
Tissue will be immediately frozen with liquid nitr ogen and stored at –70°C or lower. 
Tumor tissue will be mechanically homogenated for 5 minutes on ice in 1 ml of 
extraction buffer per 100 mg tissue wet weight, and extract obtained after centrifugation 
for 20 minutes at 4°C will be transferred to polyprop ylene tubes and frozen at -70°C or 
lower. The tubes will be labeled with the investigator’s name, study number, and 
subject’s study number, and time and date of the sample acquisition. 
Quantitative enzyme -linked immunosorbent
 assays (ELISA) for p -ERK, VEGF , 
sVEGFR2, and bFGF will be performed  on plasma and tumor extracts using 
commercial kits.  Manufacturers' protocols will be followed and samples are to be 
measured in duplicate.  
Paraffin block of the primary tumor biopsy and resected tumor will be obtained. 
Representative areas from each whole -mount paraffin block chosen as the best 
composite representation of tumor based on H&E morphology will be placed in 
 
31 standard-sized tissue cassettes. These will be re -embedded, sectioned at 4 µm, and 
mounted on poly- L-lysine–coated slides for immunohistochemistry.  Sections of 
paraffin embedded tissue will be deparaffinized and rehydrated.  After appropriate 
antigen retrieval methods, staining with commercial antibodies for p-ERK, VEGF -R2, 
phospho-VEGF-R2, PDGFR, and phospho-PDGFR will be performed using an 
automated Dako immunostainer.  Staining will be visualized by incubating the slides 
with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine solution, after which they will be rinsed, counterstained 
with hematoxylin, dehydrated in a Leica Autost ainer XL, coverslipped, and reviewed 
by a single experienced pathologist who will score the percentage of positively staining 
cells  
8. STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS  
8.1 Subject Registration  
Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific medical 
procedures are performed . 
All patients must be registered with the Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Center. 
8.2 Baseline Screening  
To be completed within 6 weeks of registration: 
  CT of Chest   CT or MRI of primary disease site  
To be completed within 4 week of registration:   History & Physical, including vitals, PS  
  EKG 
  MUGA or ECHO  
To be completed within 1 week of registration:   Labs, pregnancy test, urinalysis 
(Pregnancy test must be repeated prior to dispensing Sorafenib to the patient if 
completed >7 days before treatment start)  
8.3 Study Visits  
See table 8.7  
Toxicities and adverse experiences will be assessed at each visit using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
Assessment of study drug attribution will be made by an Investigator. Acute and long -
term radiation toxicity will be assessed for the following CTCAE categories: 1)  
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: Dermatitis radiation  2) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Fibrosis (superficial and/or deep) 3) other appropriate Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders AEs appropriate to limb function.  
8.4 Pathology Sample Submission 
All pathology slides from the initial diagnostic biopsy an d the post- chemoradiation 
 
32 excision must be submitted for central review at OHSU by a pathologist experienced in 
sarcoma.  For the post therapy excision, the specimen should be sectioned parallel to the long axis of the tumor; a full face of the plane of gr eatest cross sectional area should 
be fixed and blocked in, up to 20 sections. If there are central cystic necrotic areas, they can be noted in a specimen diagram and not sampled.  
8.5 Assessment of Wound Complications  
An accurate assessment of post -operative wound complications is vital for the accurate 
reporting of toxicity associated with this regimen.  Major wound complications will be defined as described by O’Sullivan et. al. in the prospective, randomized study of preoperative vs. postoperative radiation.
7 
A major wound complication is defined as a secondary operation under general or regional anesthesia for wound repair (debridement, operative drainage, and secondary wound closure including rotationplasty, free flaps, or skin grafts), or wound management without secondary operation.  Wound management includes 
an invasive procedure without general or regional anesthesia (such as aspiration of seroma), readmission for wound care such as intravenous antibiotics, or persistent 
deep packing for 120 days or longer . 
8.6 Follow-up 
Follow-up for all patients registered on this study, including those who do not receive 
any protocol therapy, will be required until the patient’s death.  Follow- up after 
completion of protocol therapy will be limited to monitoring  for 1) development of 
local tumor recurrence, 2) development of distant metastatic disease, 3) survival, and 4) late toxicity, including limb function impairment and secondary malignancy.  Follow -
up reports are due every 4 months.

or chest X-ray be performed every 4 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the 3rd year, and yearly for the 
4th and 5th year.  It is suggested that MRI or CT of the primary site be obtained yearly for the first 3 years.  
F Toxicity assessments per CTCAE v 4.0 (See section 8.3).  Long term follow -up for radiation toxicity and limb 
function required per section 8.3  
G An MRI or CT of the primary tumor should be performed within 6 weeks prior to registration and again prior to surgery per standard care decision  of the subject’s surgeon  
 
34 H INR should be closely monitored for patients receiving warfarin.  INR does not need to be monitored during study 
for patients not receiving warfarin.  
 
9. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
9.1 Pathologic Response 
All specimens of primary tumor will be examined for pathologic response at the time of 
surgery.  The study pathologist will estimate the amount of viable tumor, and report the percentage of necrosis.  For purpose of analysis, tumors will be classified as either 
≥95% necrosis or <95% necrosi s. 
9.2 Radiographic and Clinical Response  
The radiographic and/or clinical response of the primary tumor to preoperative therapy 
will be evaluated.  For subjects with stage IIb or III disease, the primary lesion will serve as the sole target lesion and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  For patients with stage IV disease, target lesions will be chosen according to RECIST procedure. The longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions will be measured and reported as the baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee.
56  Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. 
9.3 Response Criteria  
9.3.1 Evaluation of target lesion s 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions 
Stable Disease (SD):    Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
  
 
35  
9.3.2 Evaluation of best overall response 
The best overall response is the best response achieved prior to surgical 
resection of the target lesion.

Note: 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, this will be determined at the time of surgical resection.  
 
9.4 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response 
9.4.1 Confirmation  
Given that the target lesion will be surgically removed after the first evaluation for response, no confirmatory scans will be able to be performed. 
9.4.2 Duration of overall response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurren t or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented. 
9.4.3 Duration of Stable Disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
9.5 Time-to-Event Measures  
9.5.1 Time to Local Recurrence 
Defined as the durat ion of time from surgical resection  of the primary tumor 
until local recurrence (amputated patients excluded).  
 
36 9.5.2 Local Disease-Free Survival 
Defined as the duration of time from surgical resection  of the primary tumor 
until local recurrence or death, whichev er occurs first.  
9.5.3 Distant Disease -Free Survival  
   Defined as the duration of time from registration  until development of distant 
metastatic disease or death, whichever occurs first.  Subjects with stage IV 
disease will be censored from this analysis.  
9.5.4 Disease-Free Survival  
Defined as the duration of time from surgical resection to local recurrence, 
distant metastatic disease, or death, whichever occurs first.  Subjects with stage IV disease will be censored from this analysis.  
9.5.5 Progression-Free Survival 
Defined as the duration of time from registration to progressive disease (per 
RECIST), local recurrence, distant metastatic disease (exclusive of stage IV subjects), or death, whichever occurs first. 
9.5.6 Overall Survival 
   Defined as the interval of time from registration until death from any cause.

Any modification of this protocol must be documented in the form of a protocol revision or amendment signed by the principal investigator and approved by the CRRC and IRB, before the revision or amendment may be implemented.  The only circumstance in which the amendment may be initiated witho ut regulatory approval is 
for a change necessary to eliminate an apparent and immediate hazard to the patient.  In that event, the investigator must notify the CRRC and IRB in writing within 10 working days after the implementation. Investigators holding the IND must notify FDA of 
substantive changes to the protocol. 
 
37 10.4 Maintenance of Records  
If the investigator relocates or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study 
records must be transferred to an agreed upon designee, such as another institution, another investigator, or to OHSU Knight Cancer Institute Clinical Research Management.  Records must be maintained according to sponsor or FDA requirements.  
10.5 OHSU IRB Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Problems (UP) and Adverse Events (AE) will be reported to IRB according to the policies, procedures and guidelines posted on the OHSU IRB web site http://www.ohsu.edu/research/rda/irb/policies.shtml
. 
Fatal and life-threatening UP will be reported to OHSU IRB within 7 days of 
notification of the event.  All other UP reports will be submitted to OHSU IRB no later than 15 days of occurrence or notification of the event. Copies of the report documents will be kept in the study regulatory binder.  If any of these require a change (as determined by the PI or the IRB) to the protocol or consent form, the PI will make those changes promptly and  submit the revised documents to the OHSU IRB. 
UP and AE reports are submitte d through OHSU e-IRB and will be reviewed by OHSU 
Knight Cancer Institute and IRB.  Monthly accumulative reports will be reviewed by a 
DSMC Oncologist and forwarded to the CRRC.   
10.6 Adverse Event Definitions  
10.6.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered with a pharmaceutical product. The adverse event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, include the following:  
• An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in 
professional practice.  
• An adverse event occurring from an overdose whether accidental or 
intentional.  
• An adverse event occurring from drug abuse. 
• An adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal.  
• An adverse event where there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
occurred purely as a result of the subject’s participation in the study (e.g. 
adverse event o r serious adverse event due to discontinuation of anti-
hypertensive drugs during wash-out phase) must also be reported as an adverse event even if it is not related to the investigational product. 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharm acological action is 
not recorded as an adverse event as it is already reflected as a data point 
 
38 captured in the CRF.  If, however, the event fulfills any of the criteria for a 
“serious” adverse event, it must be recorded and reported as such. 
10.6.2 Serious Adve rse Event  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  
Life-threatening: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an adverse event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an adverse event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalization: Any adverse event leading to hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization will be considered as Serious, UNLESS at least one of the following exceptions is met:   
• The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours. 
OR 
• The admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study).  
OR 
• The admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care). 
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may fulfil the criteria of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as a serious adverse event dependant on clinical judgement.  In addition where 
local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedent.  
   Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct nor mal            
   life’s functions. 
Important medical event: Any adverse event may be considered serious because it may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance for determination of important medical events refer to the “WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology – Critical Terms List. These 
terms either refer to or might be indicative of a serious disease state.  Such 
reported events warrant special attention because of their possible association with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on 
other terms.  
10.6.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
39 An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug event, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the current Package Inserts f or Nexavar 
(sorafenib ).  Also, reports which add significant information on specificity or 
severity of a known, already documented adverse event constitute unexpected adverse events.  An event more specific or more severe than described in the 
package insert would be considered “unexpected”.  
10.6.4 Relationship of Adverse Event to Investigational Product 
The assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of 
study drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of 
the completion of the case report form. 
An assessment of ‘No’ would include: 
• The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.  
OR 
• Non-Plausibility, e.g. the subject is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer developing a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable suspicion that the adverse event is associated with  the use of the investigational drug. 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the adverse event to study drug include: 
• The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur 
after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event 
should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
• Recovery on discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on reintroduction 
(re-challenge): Subject’s response after drug discontinuation (de- challenge) 
or subjects response after drug re -introduction (re- challenge) should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them may be suspect ed to cause the event in question. 
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test drug(s), coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
10.6.5 Intensity (Severity) of the Adverse Event  
The intensity or severity of adverse events should be graded according to NCI-CTC version 4.0 criteria.   
10.6.6 Adverse Event Documentation  
 
40 All adverse events occurring after the subject has signed the informed consent 
must be fully recorded in the subject’s case record form.  
Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject’s file.  A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator, should be reported as an adverse event.  Each event should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken and outcome. 
10.7 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by 
submission of updated reports to the designated person. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assigned grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE, unless the investigator assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the dis ease 
profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must 
be reported to the Ethi cs Committee and Regulatory Authorities.   
All serious adverse events should be reported to Bayer/Onyx within 24 hours.  In the event of such an event, the investigator should refer to the Pharmacovigilance section of the contract for reporting procedures.  In brief: 
The Investigator/Sponsor may report serious adverse drug reactions ( SADRs) 
using either:

10.8 OHSU Knight Cancer Institute Data and Safet y Monitoring Plan 
In addition to complete study and pharmacy files, complete records must be maintained 
on each patient treated on this protocol.  OHSU Knight Cancer Institute (CI), through 
the auditing function of the Knight Clinical Trials Office , is responsible for ensuring that all 
member investigators and affiliate investigators conduct clinical research studies in compliance with local IRB standards, FDA regulations and NIH policies.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for conducting Quality 
Assurance audits on CI approved protocols according to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan policies and procedures 
http://ozone.ohsu.edu/cancer/sharedres/kctoresdocs.cfm   
 
Locally initiated studies will be audited by an OHSU Knight CI Auditor. Newly approved studies may be audited any time after enrollment has been initiated.  Each OHSU Knight approved treatment protocol will be audited on an annual basis 
in 
accordance with the Knight Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  .   
10.9   Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Children 
10.9.1    Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
No OHSU Knight Cancer Institute study will focus on any particular gender, 
racial or ethnic subset. No subject will be excluded from the study on the basis of gender, racial or ethnic origin. Male, female and minority volunteers will be recruited for this study from the general population and approximately 50% men and 50% women will be studied.

10.9.2    Inclusion of  Children 
In accordance with NIH guidelines on the inclusion of children as participants 
in research involving human subjects, children under the age of 18 years must be included in all human subjects’ research, conducted or supported by the 
NIH, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. Therefore, proposals for research involving human subjects must include a description of plans for the inclusion of children. 
 
This protocol does not include children <18 years of age for the following 
reason:  no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of 
sorafenib in combination with ifosfamide and epirubicin in children, therefore, 
 
43 children <18 years of age a re excluded from this study but will be eligible for 
future pediatric phase 2 combination trials.  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a single -stage, single- arm phase II clinical trial to determine the pathologic response 
rate (≥ 95% necrosis) in the operat ive specimen.  
11.1 Study endpoints  
11.1.1 Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the pathologic response rate.  
11.1.2 Secondary endpoint  
Secondary endpoints include level of toxicity, would complication rate, overall 
survival, overall disease- free survival, distant diseas e-free survival and local 
disease-free survival.  
11.2 Statistical analysis plan  
Descriptive statistical analysis will be conducted for the primary and secondary endpoints. The proportion with 95% confidence interval will be summarized for the categorical variables. Method of Kaplan- Meier will be used to estimate the 
survival functions.  We will also conduct exploratory analysis to i nvestigate  levels of tumor 
proliferation and angiogenic markers including p- ERK, VEGF, sVEGFR -2, bFGF 
in the plasma and tumor tissue at baseline, during, and after treatment with sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy and to evaluate expression of tumorigenic and angiogenic factors including p- ERK, VEGF -R2 and PDGFR in tumor tissue by 
immunohistochemical staining. These analyses will be conducted in an 
exploratory manner with the aim of generating clinically and biologically interesting hypotheses.   
11.3    Sample size consideration    
This is a single-stage single-arm phase II clinical study. We expect to enroll a total 
of 20 patient for achieving 80% power at a significance level of 5% using one -
sided binomial test. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the pathologic response rate is 25%, and we assume the pathologic response rate after preoperative treatment with sorafenib, epirubic in, ifosfamide and hypofractionated radiation for 
high risk soft tissue sarcomas is at least 52%.  
11.4 Duration of Accrual  
This study will be conducted in a single stage.  Based on an estimated accrual rate of 1 patient per month, we expect to c omplete the enrollment within 20  months.

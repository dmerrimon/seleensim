Official Title: Preliminary Studies to Test the Effects of Ambulatory Voice Biofeedback: Study 2  
NCT Number:  03416868 
Date: August 14th, 2024 
Study Protocol:  
Study Two will involve 48 total patients (20 with phonotraumatic VH and 20 with non-phonotraumatic VH + 
potential 20% drop out rate), each handled as a single subject desig n to test if large changes in voicing occur 
during AVB (acquisition) and the days post -AVB (retention).  This experimental design is best suited for the 
study since (1) AVB can only be effective via an individualized approach to therapy and (2) we aim to 
demonstrate improvement with AVB across subjects who will have different measures as biofeedback targets. 
To be offered participation, each patient must success fully complete approximately one week of pre -therapy 
ambulatory data (acquired from protocol 2011P002376) and will need to demonstrate that the average 
behavior of a particular vocal function measure deviates by at least 1  standard deviation from normative  
values.  
Throughout the first voice therapy session, the VHM will be worn with the goal of establishing a significant change in a voiced feature associated with perceptually improved voicing per the SLP. The SLP will use the 
VHM’s real -time summary feedback to asse ss if improved voicing is significantly different than baseline. First, 
the baseline threshold will be based on 85th and/or 15th percentiles of measures from baseline that were >1 standard deviation away from out normative database. Second, the improved vo icing must be over 90% 
compliant for at least 1 feature.  
During the first therapy session, once the clinician has established that the patient can modify their voicing the 
patient will qualify for ambulatory monitoring without AVB the following week. Of note, patients will have already been trained on VHM use without AVB in the 2011P002376 protocol and completed a week of 
monitoring. After the first voice therapy session , each patient will begin monitoring without AVB in daily life. 
There will be no feedback in the patient’s daily life so that we can evaluate if the patient can improve their 
voicing outside the therapy session without feedback.  
The patient will receive monitoring with AVB during their second voice therapy session and subsequent 
monitoring in daily life. Starting in the second therapy session, the SLP will review the patient’s performance 
over the previous week. The patient will be trained on using, and begin receiving, feedback for the last half of 
their therapy session. The training will include presenting how the biofeedback parameter is affected by their success. The patient will be asked to produce the targeted vocal behavior using negative practice in which s/he 
will be asked to purposefully perform a voicing task correctly and incorrectly to experience biofeedback cueing. 
The AVB will be provided throughout the second half of the first therapy session so that the patient can have 
practical training on its use and the clinician can ensure the AVB is tracking with improved voicing 
appropriately. During the ambulatory voice recordings, the patient will receive feedback on all 4 days of 
monitoring. During the week that the patient  receives feedback, starting after this second therapy session, Dr. 
Van Stan will set up the VHM to provide feedback.  
Starting in the third therapy session, the SLP will review the patient’s performance over the previous week. If the patient did not respond to the feedback during week 2 monitoring, the study will stop for the patient and 
they will be paid for two voice th erapy sessions and 8 days of monitoring (4 days per week). If the patient did 
responded to the feedback, they will qualify to continue the study during their third therapy session and in daily life the following week. The patient will be monitored during the third therapy session and for 4 days the 
subsequent week without the feedback. The purpose of the third week of monitoring is to see if the patient can 
retain their vocal improvements without the feedback.  
The schedule of ambulatory monitoring time within each therapy week will be: 20 minutes of accumulated 
phonation time after the therapy session (Day 1), 40 minutes of phonation time for each of the next 
consecutive two days (Days 2 and 3), and 40 minutes o f phonation time for the day before the patient’s 
subsequent voice therapy session (Day 4). AVB will be provided during all days only during week 2. The 
specific AVB used will depend upon patient preference (e.g., some patients may find the frequent vibrot actile 
cueing of immediate feedback to be too distracting at their job). Throughout the study, subjects may be 
prompted to take a picture of their neck with the smartphone to document correct placement of the 
accelerometer.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Study Two will use one repeated measure ANOVA with 3 levels (pre-therapy days, AVB days pooled together (therapy week 2), retention days pooled together (after stopping AVB, therapy week 3) for the outcome variable of overall percentage compliance. The finding of interest is the main effect of “Level.” Appropriate post hoc tests will be conducted on the main effects (if significance is achieved). It is hypothesized that the ANOVA will show, compared to pre-therapy, a significantly increased percentage compliance for all other levels. This result will demonstrate the expected large AVB effect that fades after AVB removal (smaller improvements during retention days than AVB days).

About this consent form
Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A 
member of our research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  
People who agree to take part in research studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used 
throughout this consent form.
If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign this form to show that you want to 
take part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to keep.
Key Information
We are asking you to be in a research study. This form will tell you what you should expect if 
you agree to be in the study. You will find more information about each of the following points 
later in this form.
It is your decision whether or not to join the study. We are asking you to be in this study because 
you were diagnosed with vocal fold nodules, polyps, or muscle tension dysphonia, are between 
18-65 years old, and have successfully completed 1 week of voice monitoring in a previous 
research protocol (2011P002376). We are doing the research to determine how voice-related 
biofeedback provided in daily life—feedback based on your vocal behavior and delivered by 
vibration of or visual presentation on a smartwatch, smartphone—affects your ability to learn 
new therapeutic vocal behaviors and use them throughout the day. If you agree, you will receive 
standard voice therapy where the first week will include ambulatory monitoring without 
biofeedback, the second week will include ambulatory monitoring with biofeedback, and the

third week will include ambulatory monitoring without biofeedback. You will be in the study for 
3 weeks if you decide to stay for the whole study. 
The main risks of being in the study are skin irritation from the double sided stick tape used to 
adhere the sensor onto your neck, annoyance due to the biofeedback. 
You might benefit from being in the study because traditional voice therapy and ambulatory 
voice biofeedback have been shown in previous work to improve vocal function. 
If you decide not to be in the study, another thing that might help your condition is traditional 
voice therapy without biofeedback. 
You will be paid up to $660 for taking part in this research study. You will find more 
information about the payment amount for each visit and a plan if you do not complete all study 
visits later in this form.

Detailed Information
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required 
by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the

Why is this research study being done?
We are doing this study to determine how voice-related biofeedback provided in daily life – 
feedback received by vibration of a smartwatch based on your vocal behavior - affects your 
ability to learn new therapeutic vocal behaviors and use them throughout the day. 
The study will use a device called the Voice Health Monitor (VHM). The VHM is a research 
device that records your voice through your neck skin vibrations. The sensor is an accelerometer 
which analyzes the vibration of your neck skin so that speech is not intelligible. This device is 
not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA). This means that the VHM can 
only be used in research studies.
This study is being done to see if the VHM is capable of helping subjects with vocal fold 
nodules, polyps, or muscle tension dysphonia learn how to carry over newly learned vocal 
behaviors from the voice therapy session into daily life.
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have been diagnosed with 
vocal fold nodules, polyps, or muscle tension dysphonia and successfully completed a week of 
voice monitoring before starting voice therapy. About 48 subjects will take part in this study. 
The National Institute of Health (NIH) is paying for this research to be done. 
Dr. Robert Hillman, the Co-Investigator on this study, has a financial interest in InnoVoyce LLC, 
a company focused on developing and commercializing technologies for the prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment of voice-related disorders. In accordance with Partners HealthCare's 
conflict of interest policies, the Partners Office for Interactions with Industry has reviewed Dr. 
Hillman’s financial interest in the company and has determined that the interest creates no 
significant risk to the welfare of participants in this study or to the integrity of the research. If 
you would like more information about this, please contact the Partners Office for Interactions 
with Industry at 857-282-2024.

What will happen in this research study?
If you choose to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign this consent form before we do 
any study procedures. 
All visits will include an in-person visit to the MGH Voice Center coordinated with your voice 
therapy session and week of ambulatory voice monitoring (4 days of recording your voice during 
daily life). Throughout the study, subjects may be prompted to take a picture of their neck with 
the smartphone to document correct placement of the accelerometer.
The weekly visits to the MGH Voice Center will be combined with your therapy sessions:
- Each visit should last approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes and will begin 15 minutes 
before your therapy begins.
- The VHM app on the smartphone uses a small sensor attached to the front of your neck 
with medical grade double-sided tape. You can see a picture of the VHM below.
- Dr. Van Stan will place the sensor on your neck and mark its location (top and bottom) 
with a semi permanent marker so you have a reference of where to put it during the rest 
of the week (or should the sensor fall off and need replacement). The marks on the skin 
will fade away after approximately one week. He will also set up the VHM to record.
- We will teach you how to use the app to Start, Pause, and Stop the recording as well as 
reporting your level of vocal fatigue.
- You will wear the VHM throughout your voice therapy session.
- After your voice therapy session, Dr. Van Stan will upload your voice therapy data 
(which will take approximately 2-5 minutes) and give you the VHM back to wear in your 
daily life.

For the ambulatory voice monitoring, the recording should take no more than 10 hours to 
complete per day.
- Day 1 will start after your voice therapy session. You will wear the device for 20 minutes 
of talking time.
- Days 2 and 3 will start in the morning and are the two days after your voice therapy 
session. You will wear the device for 40 minutes of talking time.
- Day 4 will start in the morning the day before your next therapy session. You will wear 
the device for 40 minutes of talking time.
- When you reach the talking time limit each day, the device will vibrate, then show you a 
message stating that the recording has stopped and that you can remove the device.
- Dr. Van Stan will upload the 4 days of ambulatory recordings the day of your next voice 
therapy session (the day after Day 4).
Visit 1
This visit will be used to see if you qualify for ambulatory monitoring throughout voice therapy. 
To qualify for monitoring, the investigators will be trying to identify any measures that change in 
agreement with your voice therapist’s judgement (i.e., a measure that changes when your 
therapist reports improve voicing). If we cannot find any measures that agree with your 
therapist’s perception, the study will stop for you after this therapy session. You will be paid for 
the one voice therapy session. If we do find measures that agree with your therapist’s perception, 
you will qualify for 4 days of monitoring the week after your first voice therapy session. There 
will be no feedback in your daily life so that we can evaluate if you can improve your voicing 
outside the therapy session without the feedback.
Visit 2
You will be receiving feedback during your second voice therapy session and subsequent 
monitoring in daily life. Starting in the second therapy session, your therapist will review your 
performance over the previous week with you. You will be trained on using, and begin receiving, 
feedback for the last half of your therapy session. Also, you will begin receiving biofeedback in 
your daily life after the therapy session. During the ambulatory voice recordings, you will 
receive feedback on all 4 days of monitoring. During the weeks you receive feedback, starting 
after your second therapy session, Dr. Van Stan will set up the VHM to provide feedback.
Visit 3
Starting in the third therapy session, your therapist will review your performance over the 
previous week. If the data do not show that you have responded to the feedback, the study will 
stop for you before this therapy session. You will be paid for two voice therapy sessions and 8 
days of monitoring (4 days per week). If the data show that you have responded to the feedback, 
you will qualify to continue the study during your third therapy session and in daily life the

following week. You will be monitored during the third therapy session and for 4 days the 
subsequent week without the feedback. The purpose of the third week of monitoring is to see if 
you can retain your vocal improvements without the feedback. 
Stopping the study early
Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study even 
after signing this consent. The study doctor may have to take you out of the study. This may 
happen because: 
1. We were unable to obtain usable information using the recording equipment during the 
therapy recording or ambulatory monitoring.
2. You were unable to wear the system for all of the days required.
3. There were difficulties scheduling study sessions.
Study information included in your medical record
A notation that you are taking part in this research study may be made in your electronic medical 
record.  Information from the research that relates to your general medical care may be included 
in the record (for example: list of allergies, results of standard blood tests done at the hospital 
labs).  
Please ask your study doctor if you have any questions about what information will be included 
in your electronic medical record.
How may we use and share your samples and health information for other 
research?
The information we collect in this study may help advance other research.  If you join this study, 
we may remove all information that identifies you (for example, your name, medical record 
number, and date of birth) and use these de-identified samples and data in other research.  It 
won’t be possible to link the information or samples back to you.  Information and/or samples 
may be shared with investigators at our hospitals, at other academic institutions or at for-profit, 
commercial entities.  You will not be asked to provide additional informed consent for these 
uses.
Will you get the results of this research study?
No.  The research study we are doing is only a stepping stone in understanding [condition].  
Therefore, no information about the results of this research study or the results of your individual 
participation in the research study will be given to you or your doctor.  Tests done for the 
research using your samples will not be useful in directing your medical treatment.  The results 
of the tests will not be placed in your medical record.

What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research 
study?
Wearing the neck accelerometer may draw attention to you. You may cover it up with clothing 
(like a buttoned shirt, turtleneck, or a scarf) or jewelry. You may need to be careful when going 
to the restroom due to the wire attachment between the neck disk and the Samsung smartphone. 
Removing the tape that holds the accelerometer on the neck may cause you brief discomfort 
similar to removing a Band-Aid. You may have a tiny bit of skin irritation where the sticky tape 
came off. 
Being prompted about your vocal behavior throughout an entire day could be annoying 
depending upon your response to cueing and how often you are cued. This potential annoyance 
will be minimized since the biofeedback will be individualized according to your specific vocal 
difficulties.
If you were prompted to take pictures of your neck with the smartphone, it is possible that 
identifying features of the subject’s face or photos of others may be inadvertently present in the 
picture. These pictures will only be used by MGH Voice Center study staff to confirm accurate 
placement of the accelerometer and will not be shared externally.
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?
You may not benefit from taking part in this study. It is possible that your voice disorder will 
improve temporarily during the study. Others with vocal fold nodules, muscle tension dysphonia, 
or vocal fold polyp(s) may benefit in the future from what we learn in this study.
What other treatments or procedures are available for your condition?
You do not have to take part in this study to be treated for vocal fold nodules, polyps, or muscle 
tension dysphonia.  Other treatments or procedures that are available to treat vocal fold nodules, 
polyps, or muscle tension dysphonia include:
Weekly voice therapy sessions without any feedback provided in your daily life.
Can you still get medical care within Mass General Brigham if you don’t 
take part in this research study, or if you stop taking part? 
Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Mass General Brigham now 
or in the future.  There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or 
have a right to receive.

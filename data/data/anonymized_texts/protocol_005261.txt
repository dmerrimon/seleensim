prior to enrollment. 
 
Screening Angiogram and/or 
CTA 
In addition to review of medical 
history, patients will be 
screened by the Screening 
Committee based on the 
results of an angiogram or 
CTA. These images must 
include at a minimum the aortic 
arch, ipsilateral carotid artery, 
target lesion, and intracranial 
and extracranial views. A 
complete diagnostic study will 
be needed in order to evaluate 
fully the patient against entry

Doc Type: GC  Section 10.4.3 Analysis Sets Current Version: The primary 
analysis set for testing of the 
primary endpoint is the per-
protocol analysis set. 
 
Previous Version: The primary 
analysis set for testing of the 
primary endpoint is the intent-
to-treat, or full, analysis set. Because subjects with 
technical failure are followed 
only to 30 days, they will not 
be evaluable for the primary 
endpoint. The ITT set 
includes technical failures; 
the per-protocol set does not.  
Section 10.4.3 Intent-To-
Treat Analysis Set Current Version: The ITT 
analysis set is defined as all 
enrolled subjects with adequate 
informed consent, regardless of 
whether the study stent was 
implanted. Because technical 
failures (test device attempted 
but not implanted) are followed 
only to 30 days, this set will be 
used in the analysis of safety 
endpoints (major, serious, and 
nonserious adverse events) to 
30 days and secondary 
endpoints evaluated at 
procedure, discharge, and 30 
days. 
Previous Version: The ITT 
analysis set is defined as all 
enrolled subjects with adequate 
informed consent, regardless of 
whether or not the study stent 
was implanted. This set will be 
used in the analysis of the 
primary and all secondary 
endpoints evaluated at 
procedure, 30 days and one 
year, as well as supplemental 
analyses of the primary 
endpoint (for example, Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis). Same as above. 
Section 10.4.3 Per-Protocol 
Analysis Set (Primary 
Analysis Set) Current Version: For per-
protocol analysis, only subjects 
who had the study stent 
implanted in the target vessel 
and had no major protocol 
deviations will be included in 
the analysis. Major protocol 
deviations are defined as 
protocol deviations with a level Same as above, plus 
clarification to definition of 
major protocol deviation.

inclusion of the subject(s) 
would unacceptably bias the 
primary endpoint analysis. An 
example of a major protocol 
deviation might be failure to 
satisfy eligibility criteria to a 
degree where the subject does 
not fit the underlying scientific 
model for the treatment. 
The per-protocol set will be 
used for the primary analyses 
of the primary endpoint. Ideally, 
this analysis set will consist of 
all subjects from the ITT set 
with technical success (test 
device implanted).

Doc Type: GC  1. Introduction  
1.1. Disease 
It has been estimated that carotid artery disease accounts for 20-30% of the greater than 
500,000 new strokes that occur annually in the United States1. As stroke is the leading cause 
of serious, long-term disability in the United States, treatment of carotid artery disease may 
diminish part of the $53.6 billion yearly health care costs associated with the treatment of 
stroke2.   
1.2. Historical Treatments  
Treatment options for carotid artery disease include the current standard of care, carotid 
endarterectomy (CEA), medical therapy, and the continuously evolving procedure of carotid 
artery stenting (CAS). 
 
CEA remains the gold standard as an effective technique for the treatment of chronic carotid 
artery stenosis associated with stroke.  The technique is endorsed by the American Heart 
Association (AHA) as a first-line therapy for symptomatic subjects with recent cerebral 
ischemia and carotid artery diameter stenosis exceeding 70% and for carotid stenosis 
exceeding 60% in asymptomatic subjects with surgical risk less than 3% and a life expectancy 
of at least 5 years1,3. However, for CEA to provide a greater benefit than medical therapy, the 
combined morbidity and mortality rate should be under 3% for asymptomatic subjects and less 
than 6% for symptomatic subjects4. 
 
In patients at high risk for complications during CEA, such as those with anatomic or 
physiologic co-morbidities, outcomes with surgery are less well defined and in some cases 
documented to be worse than the standard surgical risk patient5.  In these cases CAS has 
been shown to be a potentially safer and equally effective stroke reduction therapy6.   
Furthermore, high surgical risk registry data have demonstrated a continued reduction in 
stroke/MI/death rates over the last several years suggesting that as technique, patient 
selection, and technology improves, so do outcomes7,8. In the standard risk patient, the 
recently released results of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs. Stent Trial 
(CREST) study found equivalence between the two strategies in terms of the primary endpoint 
of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction to 30 days plus ipsilateral stroke to 4 years9. 
 
Advantages and Disadvantages with Current Carotid Stents 
 
Closed Cell vs Open Cell 
Currently, the stents available for CAS are divided into two types; Closed-Cell and Open-Cell.  
Locally approved Closed-Cell stents, such as the Xact® Carotid Stent System (Abbott 
Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) or the Wallstent® Monorail® System (Boston Scientific 
Corporation Natick, MA) are characterized by individual apices of the stent frame being 
connected by a strut to the apices in the adjacent row and is further characterized by each of 
the individual apices having a smaller cell size.  The obvious benefit from such a design is that 
the stent provides a higher degree of plaque stabilization, thus minimizing plaque protrusion 
through the stent struts and maintaining greater contact with the vessel wall.  However, such a 
design is typically considered to be more rigid and not able to conform to the native anatomy 
with clinical reports of kinks forming in the vasculature at the distal end of the device10.  
GORE ® Carotid Stent

Revision#: 1   Page 21  
Doc Type: GC   
In contrast, Open Cell stents, such as the PRECISE® Carotid Stent System (Cordis, Miami, 
FL), are characterized as having fewer connections between adjacent apices and thus having 
larger cell sizes. The benefit of such a design allows for a higher degree of flexibility, which 
conforms to the native anatomy, however the design has less of a scaffolding effect and does 
not cover the plaque as efficiently as do Closed Cell stents.  An additional issue reported is the 
so called “fish-scaling” of the stent struts where when deployed in tortuous anatomy, the stent 
struts come out of alignment and appear as individual scales protruding from the stent11. 
 
As carotid artery stenting devices and techniques continue to evolve, many clinicians have 
described the optimal design.  Consistent with these statements from the podium at scientific 
presentations, Stefan Müller-Hülsbeck describes the ideal carotid stent as having features 
which include “scaffolding that is adequate enough to control plaque prolapse but has 
acceptable levels of flexibility, conformability, and radial strength to track to the lesion, appose 
the vessel wall, and control recoil” .12 
1.3. Study Device Description  
GORE® Carotid Stent System 
The GORE® Carotid Stent is designed as a true “hybrid” stent in that it incorporates the 
flexibility and conformability of an Open Cell stent as well as the plaque stabilization of the 
Closed Cell Stent.  Additionally, the device is coated with a covalently bonded Carmeda® 
Bioactive surface heparin to create an anti-thrombogenic surface.  Ease of use of the system 
is designed into the delivery system which not only offers a single-handed deployment handle, 
but allows complete closure of the hemostatic valve to aid in stabilization of the delivery 
system and minimized blood loss. 
 
The GORE® Carotid Stent System consists of a self expanding nitinol stent frame with a 500µ 
pore size lattice on the exterior of the stent frame.  Additionally the stent frame and lattice are 
coated with a permanently bound anti-thrombogenic surface in the form of CBAS® Heparin.  
The stent is mounted on a 5Fr or 6Fr introducer sheath compatible delivery system with a 
working length of 135 cm and a single-handed delivery handle. 
   
The GORE® Carotid Stent, used with the GORE® Embolic Filter, is indicated for the treatment 
of carotid artery stenosis in patients deemed at high surgical risk for CEA.  
x Patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, t50%, as confirmed by ultrasound or 
angiography. 
x Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, t80%, as confirmed by ultrasound or 
angiography. 
x Patients must have a Reference Vessel Diameter of 3.7 mm – 9.0 mm.

7 Vital Signs include: Blood Pressure, Pulse, and respirations. Collection of height and weight will be done at screening.  Temperature 
should be collected pre- and post- procedure at a minimum  
 
5.3. Informed Consent Process 
All patients must provide written informed consent prior to submission of pre-procedure 
imaging and medical history to the Screening Committee for review (refer to Section 5.5 for 
details) and prior to any study related procedures being performed.  The case history (i.e. 
source documents/subject chart) for each subject shall document that such informed consent 
was obtained.  The IRB approved consent form will be signed and personally dated by the 
subject, and the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  The original signed 
informed consent form will be retained in the subject records.  A copy of the informed consent 
document will be given to the subject for their records.    
 
5.4. General Study Evaluation Guidelines  
For the purposes of the study the following are required: 
 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) may only be performed by an individual 
certified to perform the NIHSS even if others may be qualified per state or local regulation.  
Any potential endpoint neurological symptoms will be assessed by the NIHSS.  All NIHSS 
certifications must be kept up to date. 
 
Electrocardiograms (ECG) will not be sent to a core lab and should be reviewed per site’s 
standard processes. 
 
Screening and follow-up carotid duplex ultrasounds will be sent to the ultrasound core lab.  
Any unscheduled ultrasounds performed due to an Adverse Event will also be sent to the core 
lab. Please refer to section 6.4 for details.   
 
All applicable angiograms as well as any re-intervention angiograms will be sent to the 
Angiographic core lab.  Please refer to sections 5.7 and 6.4 for details.   
 
Other tasks may be performed by those individuals who are qualified by training and who have 
been designated by the site’s Principle Investigator to perform those tasks 
5.5. Pre-Screening/Screening 
All patients who sign an ICF will be considered entered into the screening phase of the study. 
A subject screening log will be maintained at each site to document select information about 
the patients who sign informed consent.  For patients who did not meet eligibility criteria after  
signing informed consent, the reasons for exclusion will be documented on the subject 
screening log.  
The following evaluations will be conducted at the screening visit  or must have been 
completed no more than 30 days prior to enrollment (except as noted):

x Angiography (within 30 days) and/or CTA (within 60 days) 
x CT or MRI Brain Imaging for symptomatic patients only (Within 180 days of the index 
procedure)I 
 
Pre-screening Assessment 
A Screening Committee will review pre-operative angiography and/or CTA, along with patient 
medical history, for assessment of entry criteria, and approval prior to the study procedure.    
The Screening Committee will be comprised of an interdisciplinary team of study investigators 
with pertinent knowledge in carotid stenting. The members will not review potential cases from 
their own sites. The members will be compensated for their involvement in the Screening 
Committee, including reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to attend meetings.   
 
This committee will operate under pre-specified procedures as outlined in the Screening 
Committee Charter.    
 
Prior to a patient being enrolled in the study, the investigational site must receive confirmation 
from the Screening Committee that the subject is eligible to be enrolled.  Although patient may 
be deemed eligible to be enrolled, it is still the responsibility of the investigator to assess all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to enrollment. 
 
Screening Angiogram and/or CTA 
In addition to review of medical history, patients will be screened by the Screening Committee 
based on the results of an angiogram or CTA.  These images must include at a minimum the 
aortic arch, ipsilateral carotid artery (origin and bifurcation), target lesion and intracranial and 
extracranial views.  A complete diagnostic study will be needed in order to evaluate fully the 
patient against entry criteria.  Submission of complete case images is strongly encouraged.  
 
Carotid Duplex Ultrasound 
Patients will be screened using a bilateral carotid duplex ultrasound within 60 days of 
enrollment to verify that baseline percent stenosis values are consistent with entry criteria and 
justify proceeding with angiography and stent placement.   
 
The diagnostic angiography results prior to the stenting procedure will be the definitive 
measure of compliance with vessel stenosis criteria.

Doc Type: GC   
If a bilateral carotid duplex ultrasound was completed prior to the patient’s consent to 
participate in the clinical trial but is within 60 days preceding the study procedure, the results 
may be used in lieu of repeating the ultrasound for the clinical trial.   
 
MRI / CT for Symptomatic Patients 
CT or MRI brain imaging is required for symptomatic patients in order to rule out non-carotid 
pathology.  Additional assessment of the carotid arteries and the morphology of the aortic arch 
may be achieved through CTA or MRA but the results of these studies may not be used as a 
substitute for a carotid ultrasound or carotid angiography.  If CT or MRI brain imaging was 
completed at the time of the “symptomatic” event (within 180 days) and is prior to the patient’s 
informed consent to participate in the clinical trial, the CT or MRI results obtained following that 
event may be used in lieu of repeating the imaging for the clinical trial.   
 
5.6. Pre-Procedure Assessments 
The following must be completed within 24 hours preceding the index procedure: 
x Exam and vital signs (if not done at screening) 
x NIHSS 
x Modified Rankin Scale (if not done at screening) 
x 12-lead ECG (if not done at screening) 
x Baseline Cardiac Enzyme -Troponin  (may be obtained once arterial access is gained but 
not after any interventional wires enter the subject’s vasculature) 
x Pregnancy test if applicable (within the 10 days preceding the index procedure) 
x Blood work not completed at screening visit  
Concomitant medications (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) 
Pre Procedure Antiplatelet Therapy 
Preparation of patients receiving the GORE® Carotid Stent should include initiation of an 
appropriate dosage of oral antiplatelet medication prior to and following the procedure. 
Effective anticoagulation therapy should be maintained throughout the procedure and 
continued into the postoperative period as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.  
 
Prior to the index procedure, patients must be on a form of antiplatelet therapy. Patients who 
are on antiplatelet therapy prior to consenting for the trial may continue their current regimen.  
However, if a patient is not on any antiplatelet regimen, the following dosages are 
recommended: 
 
x Aspirin 75-325 mg by mouth beginning 3 days prior to procedure  
x Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth beginning 3 days prior to procedure  
 
If the above is not possible the following may be administered 4-6 hours prior to procedure: 
 
x Aspirin 325 mg by mouth

Revision#: 1   Page 34  
Doc Type: GC  x Clopidogrel 75-600 mg by mouth (in accordance with local standard of practice) 
 
5.7. Procedure 
The following will be collected during the procedure and enrollment time points: 
x Cerebral angiography to confirm Angiographic entry criteria 
x Concomitant medications (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) 
x Adverse events assessment 
 
Only physicians who have received appropriate training and are familiar with the principles, 
clinical applications, complications, side effects and hazards commonly associated with carotid 
interventional procedures should use this device. 
 
The index procedure begins at time of vascular access and is considered completed at the 
time of vascular closure, sheath removal, or when all wires, catheters and devices are 
removed and the sheath is secured for removal outside the cath lab; whichever comes first.  
This information will be collected on the procedure case report form.   
 
The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with minimal sedation to facilitate 
continuous neurological evaluation.  The need for continuous monitoring of the subject’s 
baseline level of awareness during the procedure, with techniques that can consist of a rubber 
squeeze toy or verbal verification, should be utilized and explained to the subject.  If it is 
believed that a neurological status change has occurred, the NIHSS will be repeated. 
 
An initial arch and carotid angiogram must be performed prior to cannulation of the arch 
vessels or the carotid artery.  Cerebral angiograms (extracranial and intracranial images) must 
also be completed showing the tip of the catheter, or other form of calibration, and the carotid 
bifurcation.  This complete diagnostic study is required to fully evaluate the subject against 
angiographic exclusion criteria.  If subjects have undergone the above diagnostic imaging 
within 30 days preceding the index procedure, these films may be substituted for performance 
of repeat diagnostic angiography.  These films must be made available to the investigator prior 
to the procedure and be submitted to the angiographic core lab per their specifications 
following the index procedure. 
 
Once it is determined that the subject meets all entry requirements for the study, systemic 
anticoagulation should be given.  Administer heparin (bivalirudin may be substituted in local 
regions where approved) to achieve and maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) of t 250 
seconds prior to deployment of the embolic protection device.  Periodic testing of the ACT 
level should be done to ensure that the ACT level is maintained during the intervention. The 
use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors is prohibited during the procedure.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION                          
MD133246 Protocol Template 
Revision#: 1   Page 35  
Doc Type: GC  The patient will be considered enrolled in the study when the investigational device enters the 
patient’s vasculature.  All patients enrolled in the study should be followed until completion of 
the study, or withdrawal from study follow-up. 
 
If the decision is made not to attempt the GORE® Carotid Stent and therefore not enroll the 
patient, the patient will be considered a screen failure and the status and reason for not 
enrolling noted on the subject screening log. 
 
A patient may only be enrolled into the study once.  A patient with carotid artery disease 
contralateral to the target lesion in which both sides require treatment may be enrolled into the 
study; however, only one side may be treated at the index procedure.   
 
Embolic Protection System 
The investigator must select the GORE® Embolic Filter for embolic protection during the 
procedure and should pay specific attention to the device IFU for specific patient selection 
criteria.       
  
After an unsuccessful documented attempt with the GORE® Embolic Filter, an alternative 
locally approved embolic protection device may be used to complete the procedure.  
 
Unprotected pre-dilation is strongly discouraged.  Embolic protection with the GORE® Embolic 
Filter should be in place prior to stenting.  
 
GORE® Carotid Stent 
Selection of the correct size GORE® Carotid Stent should be done using the sizing 
instructions in the table below and/or the IFU for the device.  Oversizing of the stent to the 
vessel diameter is not recommended.

GORE ® Carotid Stent Technical Failure 
If a GORE® Carotid Stent is not implanted due to technical reasons, another locally approved 
carotid stent may be used to complete the procedure.  Subjects who do not have a successful 
GORE® Carotid Stent implant during the index procedure will be considered technical failures.  
Technical failure subjects only require follow-up through 30 days post-procedure and will then 
have completed the study. 
 
Device failures and malfunctions will be documented on the Stent Assessment case report 
form and the study device will be returned to W. L. Gore and Associates, Inc. for analysis.  
Instructions for returning the study device will be provided in the study binder supplied by W. L. 
Gore and Associates, Inc.

Any clinically driven revascularization procedure of the original treatment site, including 
angioplasty, stenting, endarterectomy, or thrombolysis performed to open or increase the 
luminal diameter inside, or within 5 mm, of the previously treated lesion may be performed.   
 
Only devices or therapies that are commercially available at the time of the revascularization 
may be used.  All angiograms in relation to the re-intervention must be sent to the 
Angiographic core lab.  Please refer to section 6.4. 
5.10. Post-Procedure 
The following will be completed between 4-48 hours post procedure or prior to discharge, 
whichever comes first (unless otherwise indicated): 
x Exam and vital signs 
x NIHSS 
x 12-lead ECG 
x Hematology blood work (CBC including platelets) 
x Cardiac Enzymes (Troponin) – to be completed within 8-16 hours post-procedure.  If the 
subject experiences cardiac related chest pain lasting longer than 15 minutes, a change in 
baseline ECG, or the value has increased to 2 (two) times the upper limit of normal, serial 
cardiac enzymes will also be completed at 18-24 hours post procedure.   
x Adverse events assessment  
x Concomitant medications (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) assessment  
 
Post Procedure Antiplatelet Therapy 
Subjects will receive post-procedure antiplatelet medication per the institution’s standard of 
care, or using the following recommended regimen: 
x Aspirin 75-325 mg by mouth once a day for the duration of the study 
x Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth once a day for 30 days; then per physician discretion 
 
5.11. Follow-Up 
Subjects with successful GORE® Carotid Stent implant will return for follow-up at 30 days, 6 
months, 1, 2 and 3 years.  Subjects considered Technical Failures (no GORE® Carotid Stent 
implant) are only required to complete a 30 day follow-up and will have then completed the 
study. 
 
The following assessments are required for each follow-up visit (unless indicated otherwise): 
x Exam and vital signs 
x NIHSS 
x Modified Rankin Scale 
x Carotid Duplex Ultrasound of target vessel  
x Concomitant medications (antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) assessment

Follow-up Visit Windows 
The follow-up visits should be completed within an acceptable time frame and in accordance 
with the protocol defined visit windows.  All intervals are to be calculated from the index 
procedure.  The 6-Month visit target is 180 days.  The yearly visits are calculated on a 
calendar year from index procedure. 
 
30 Days 6 Months 
(180 Days) 1 Year 2 & 3 Years 
r 7 days r 14 days r 30 days r 45 days 
 
If the visit is not able to be completed during these windows the visit should be completed as 
soon as possible; however, it will be considered a protocol deviation and should be reported 
per local IRB policy. 
 
5.12. Subject Withdrawal from the Clinical Study 
A subject may withdraw from the clinical study at any time and should notify the Investigator in 
this event.  The Investigator may also withdraw the subject from the clinical study at any time 
based on his/her medical judgment.  The Investigator will encourage subjects to return for all 
required follow-up visits.   
 
All subjects who withdraw from the study should complete an end of study visit.  No further 
visits are required by the subject once the end of study visit is complete. 
 
5.13. Subject Lost to Follow-Up 
The Investigator should encourage subjects to return for the required follow-up visits.  These 
measures are important as the clinical study objectives may not be realized if a large number 
of subjects are lost to follow-up (LTF).   
 
A subject may withdraw from the clinical study at any time and should notify the Investigator in 
this event.  If a subject refuses to return for the follow-up visits, the Investigator will attempt to 
obtain at least vital status and whether or not the subject has experienced a stroke or TIA.  In 
the event of subject death, a death certificate or autopsy report should be obtained to confirm 
cause of death and reported on the Subject Completion / Discontinuation Form. 
 
A subject will be considered LTF and discontinued from the study once they have missed two 
required follow-up visits and three documented attempts for each pending study related visit 
have been made by the Investigator to contact the subject.   
 
One of the three documented attempts must include a certified (traceable) letter.  The 
Investigator must complete the appropriate CRF (CRF Study Completion / Discontinuation 
Form) documenting the subject’s withdrawal or discontinuation from the clinical study.  The 
subject will be considered withdrawn once the Sponsor receives the respective CRFs.

The Investigator may also withdraw the subject from the clinical study at any time based on 
the Investigator’s medical judgment.   
 
The study Monitor will ensure that subject withdrawals are documented properly, discussed 
with the Investigator, and reported to the Sponsor  
 
5.14. Subject Study Completion 
A subject has completed the study when he/she has completed the 3-year follow-up 
evaluations.   Any subject that does not complete these requirements due to voluntary 
withdrawal, physician withdrawal, death, or any other reason will be considered as an early 
withdrawal. In the event of a Technical Failure (no GORE® Carotid Stent implanted), the 
subject will be followed through the 30-day visit and will be considered to have completed the 
study.  
5.15. Explant Procedures 
The GORE® Carotid Stent may be explanted during a surgical procedure or as part of an 
autopsy. Sites are requested to return explanted device to the Sponsor for gross and 
histological evaluation. Prior to planned or potential device retrieval, contact the Gore 
associate managing the study to communicate that a specimen is being retrieved from a study 
subject. A specimen shipping kit will be immediately sent to the Site. The specimen kit 
provides specific packaging and handling instructions for the specimen and contains a 
shipping container. 
 
6. Clinical Study Administration  
6.1. Device Training 
Physician device training will be provided by a qualified Gore Associate.  The minimum 
requirements for physician device training include:   
1. Didactic training for each investigator at site 
2. First case for each investigator is supported by a qualified Gore Associate. 
6.2. Monitoring

6.5. Protocol Deviations 
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the study design 
or procedures of a research protocol.t The Investigator is responsible for promptly reporting 
Protocol Deviations to their reviewing IRB per IRB policy and the Sponsor. The Sponsor will 
determine the effect of the protocol deviation on the scientific soundness of the clinical study 
and subject safety and determine if additional reports or actions are required. Additional action 
may include Site retraining, removal of devices from the Site, and/or Site termination.    
 
The Investigator will not implement any changes to the protocol without first obtaining written 
agreement from the Sponsor and documented approval from the IRB, except in the event of 
an immediate hazard(s) to a subject.  The Investigator will report the deviation in accordance 
with the applicable regulations.         
6.6. Protocol Amendments 
The Investigator will obtain IRB approval on all amendments in a timely manner. The Sponsor 
will ensure proper training of Investigator and Site staff on all protocol amendments.

Doc Type: GC  9. Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring  
Adverse Events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrences in a subject whether 
device-related or not.   
9.1. Anticipated Adverse Events  
Anticipated Adverse Events are complications that are known to be associated with carotid 
artery stenting.  Potential complications of carotid artery stenting are listed in Section 8 above.  
If a complication occurs that is not on the list of known, potential complications and the 
investigator believes that the complication is a potential UADE (Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effects, see section below), the site should immediately contact the Sponsor to determine 
reporting requirements . 
 
Anticipated Adverse Events are complications that are known to be associated with carotid 
artery stenosis patients undergoing an angioplasty and stenting procedure.  See Section 8, 
Risk Assessment.  
9.1.1. Adverse Event Relationship 
Each reported AE will be assessed by the Investigator for its primary suspected 
relationship to the carotid stent, embolic protection device, procedure, medication, or 
disease.  Only one primary relationship will be assigned to each reported AE. 
 
Study Device-related   
The functioning or characteristics of the device caused or contributed to the Adverse 
Event. 
 
Embolic Protection System (EPD)-related   
The functioning or characteristics of the EPD caused or contributed  to the Adverse 
Event.   
 
Study Procedure-related   
The study index procedure (and not the device or EPD) caused or significantly 
contributed to the Adverse Event. 
 
Medication-related    
The Adverse Event was a result of medical therapy prescribed by the study protocol 
and not the device, EPD, or procedure.   
 
Disease-related    
The Adverse Event was a result of the underlying disease progression for which the 
study procedure is being performed, and not the device, EPD or procedure.

Revision#: 1   Page 48  
Doc Type: GC  Not related   
An Adverse Event which cannot be attributed to the device, EPD, procedure, 
medication or disease.   
 
Unknown relationship   
The relationship of the Adverse Event to the device, EPD, procedure, medication or 
disease cannot be determined. 
 
9.1.2. Adverse Event Classification 
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator to determine if it is a Serious Adverse 
Event as defined below:  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is an adverse event that 
x led to death 
x led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in 
o a life threatening illness or injury, or 
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or  
o inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
x led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
9.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting and Coding 
AEs will be reported on the appropriate case report form (CRF) for that visit and 
documented in the subject’s permanent medical record.  The Investigator at each Site 
is ultimately responsible for reporting AEs to the Sponsor .  
 
The following information on each reported Adverse Event will be collected:  
x Adverse Event Name 
x Adverse Event Onset Date 
x Relationship 
x Classification Serious 
x Treatment 
x Outcome 
x Resolution Date 
 
Adverse Events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).

Revision#: 1   Page 49  
Doc Type: GC  x Adverse event reporting begins once the patient is enrolled in the study.  All 
adverse events should be reported from enrollment through study 
completion/discontinuation. 
x Provide a diagnosis if possible. If unable to provide diagnosis, report the 
symptoms as separate events. Adverse Events should be reported using the full 
name without abbreviations or narratives. 
x Adverse events with an outcome status of “Ongoing” should be assessed at each 
follow-up evaluation to determine if the event has resolved.  Adverse events 
ongoing at study completion/discontinuation should be left as “Ongoing” on the 
AE case report form.   
9.1.4. Subject Death 
If a subject dies while participating in the study, the cause of death will be reported as 
the adverse event and “death” reported as the event outcome on the AE case report 
form. If the subject has other ongoing adverse events at the time of death, the 
outcome status of those events should be reported as “resolved” on the AE case 
report form. 
 
The Investigator should obtain all medical records including death certificate and 
autopsy report for inclusion in reporting to the Clinical Events Committee.   
  
9.2. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s) as any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or protocol.  
 
The Sponsor is required to notify FDA within (10) days of any unanticipated adverse device 
effect.  The Sponsor is required to notify PMDA within (15) days of any unanticipated adverse 
device effect not resulting in death; the Sponsor is required to notify PMDA within (7) days of 
any unanticipated adverse device effect resulting in death or which may result in death. If a 
complication occurs that the Investigator believes may be a potential UADE, the Site should 
immediately contact the Sponsor to determine reporting requirements.  In addition, when there 
is a reason to believe a device may have malfunctioned, causing potential harm to a patient, 
the Site should immediately notify the Sponsor. 
 
The Investigator will submit to the reviewing IRB a report of any UADE occurring during an 
investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) days after the Investigator 
learns of the effect.  All UADEs must be documented by the Investigator including the date of 
onset, a complete description of the event, possible reason(s) for the event, severity, duration, 
actions taken and outcome.  Copies of all supporting documents should be submitted 
concurrently with the appropriate CRF. 
 
 A report from the Sponsor will be submitted to the FDA and to all reviewing IRBs and 
participating Investigators within 10 working days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the 
effect.

Doc Type: GC  9.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board   
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee conduct of the study.  
The DSMB will review accumulating study safety data on a regular basis and will advise the 
Sponsor regarding the continuing safety of study subjects as well as the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the study.  The DSMB will be comprised of an interdisciplinary team of at 
least 3 members (2 voting physicians, and one voting statistician) with pertinent expertise in 
carotid stenting who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study.  The members will be 
compensated for their involvement in the DSMB, including reimbursement for reasonable 
travel expenses to attend meetings.   
 
This committee will operate under pre-specified procedures as outlined in the DSMB Charter 
in accordance with the FDA’s Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors on the Establishment and 
Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.  The DSMB will be responsible for 
conducting periodic reviews of aggregate data on a prescribed basis.  The frequency of data 
review and other roles and responsibilities of the DSMB will be specified in the DSMB Charter.    
 
Based on the safety data review, the DSMB will make recommendations to the Sponsor.  
Recommendations may include study continuation with or without major or minor 
modifications, temporary suspension of enrollment and / or study intervention until some 
uncertainty is resolved.  All final decisions regarding study modifications rest with the Sponsor. 
 
9.4. Clinical Events Committee  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will review potential primary endpoint events 
and adjudicate events based on endpoint definitions in the study protocol.  The CEC will be 
comprised of an interdisciplinary team with pertinent knowledge in carotid stenting or the 
cardiovascular and/or nervous system who are not directly involved in the conduct of the 
study.  The members will be compensated for their involvement in the CEC, including 
reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to attend meetings.   
 
This committee will operate under pre-specified procedures as outlined in the CEC Charter.   
The adjudication process will be initiated after a potential primary endpoint event is reported by 
the site.

Doc Type: GC  10.4. Data Analysis 
10.4.1. Timing of Analyses 
The primary endpoint analysis will occur when enrollment and one year follow-up are 
complete. No interim analyses of the study hypotheses are planned.  
10.4.2. Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographics, clinical history, risk factors, and preprocedure lesion 
characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables 
(mean, standard deviation, number of observations, minimum and maximum) and 
discrete variables (percentage and count/sample). 
10.4.3. Analysis Sets 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed both on an intent-to-treat basis and on a per-
protocol basis. The primary analysis set for testing of the primary endpoint is the per-
protocol analysis set. 
 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set  
The ITT analysis set is defined as all enrolled subjects with adequate informed 
consent, regardless of whether the study stent was implanted. Because technical 
failures (test device attempted but not implanted) are followed only to 30 days, this 
set will be used in the analysis of safety endpoints (major, serious, and nonserious 
adverse events) to 30 days and secondary endpoints evaluated at procedure, 
discharge, and 30 days. 
 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set (Primary Analysis Set) 
For per-protocol analysis, only subjects who had the study stent implanted in the 
target vessel and had no major protocol deviations will be included in the analysis. 
Major protocol deviations are defined as protocol deviations with a level of 
seriousness such that inclusion of the subject(s) would unacceptably bias the primary 
endpoint analysis. An example of a major protocol deviation might be failure to satisfy 
eligibility criteria to a degree where the subject does not fit the underlying scientific 
model for the treatment. 
The per-protocol set will be used for the primary analyses of the primary endpoint. 
Ideally, this analysis set will consist of all subjects from the ITT set with technical 
success (test device implanted). 
The Per-Protocol set will be used in additional analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints. 
The primary safety and efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed controlling for the 
following baseline covariates: age, sex, and race/ethnicity. 
Additional subgroup analyses may be performed based on variables identified to be 
significant predictors (p-value<0.05) in multivariate analyses.

Doc Type: GC  10.4.4. Pooling of Data 
Site data will be pooled based on clinical comparability, i.e., the sites used a common 
protocol, the sponsor adequately monitored the study to assure protocol compliance, 
and the data gathering and validation mechanisms were the same across all study 
sites. 
Analyses to justify pooling will include the following: 
x The primary endpoint will be presented by institution.  
x An assessment of the poolability of the sites using a 2-by-(number of sites) 
contingency table of MAE outcome versus site. Fisher’s Exact Test will be used to 
assess homogeneity. Sites with fewer than five subjects will be combined based 
on geographic region. 
x If the sites are found to be significantly heterogeneous with respect to the primary 
endpoint, additional analyses will be conducted to assess differences between 
sites in baseline and procedural variables that might explain differences in primary 
outcome. 
10.4.5. Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of 1-year MAE is subject-based. A one-sided 95.1% upper 
confidence bound will be calculated (using the standard error based on H 0) and 
compared to the prespecified performance goal. If this bound is less than the 
performance goal, then the primary endpoint is met and the GORE® Carotid Stent 
will have demonstrated acceptable performance. The P value for the corresponding 
one-sided normal approximation to the binomial test will be reported. The primary 
hypothesis test will use D=0.049 to ensure an overall Type-1 error rate d0.05. 
10.4.6. Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be conducted and will include, at a 
minimum, a worst-case analysis and tipping point analysis.  
10.4.7. Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoint(s) 
Secondary endpoints (subject-based unless otherwise specified) will be descriptive 
only; no formal statistical hypotheses will be tested. Secondary endpoints will be 
summarized at the specified time points using the descriptive statistics described 
above. No claims of statistical significance will be made based on secondary endpoint 
results. P values from these tests will not be reported in labeling, but may be used for 
scientific presentations and/or manuscripts.  
10.5. Publication Plan  
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have 
adopted a trials-registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all 
clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry.  The Sponsor will register the study and 
post results as required by this policy and applicable U.S. laws and regulations.

Person Administering Scale _____________________________________  
 
Administer stroke scale items in the order listed.  Record per formance in each category after each subscale exam.  Do not go 
back and change scores.  Follow directions pr ovided for each exam technique.  Scores should reflect what the patient does, not 
what the clinician thinks the patient can do.  The clinician should record answers while administering the exam and work quickl y. 
Except where indicated, the patient s hould not be coached (i.e., repeated requests to patient to make a special effort). 
 
Instructions   Scale Definition Score 
1a.  Level of Consciousness: The investigator must choose a 
response if a full evaluation is pr evented by such obstacles as an 
endotracheal tube, language barrier, orotracheal trauma/bandages.  A 
3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than reflexive posturing) in response to  noxious stimulation. 
  0 =    Alert;  keenly responsive. 
 1 = Not alert; but arousable by minor stimulation to obey, 
answer, or respond. 
 2 = Not alert; requires repeated stimulation to attend, or is 
obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to 
make movements (not stereotyped). 
 3 = Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or 
totally  unresponsive, flaccid, and areflexic.  
 
  
______ 
1b.  LOC Questions:   The patient is asked the month and his/her age. 
The answer must be correct - there is  no partial credit for being close.  
Aphasic and stuporous patients w ho do not comprehend the questions 
will score 2.  Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal 
intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, 
language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are 
given a 1.  It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not "help" the patient  with verbal or non-verbal cues.  0 = Answers both questions correctly. 
 
 1 = Answers one question correctly. 
 
 2 = Answers neither question correctly.  
   
  
 
______ 
1c.  LOC Commands:   The patient is asked to open and close the 
eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand.  Substitute 
another one step command if the hands cannot be used.  Credit is 
given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to 
weakness.  If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result 
scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands).  Patients with 
trauma, amputation, or other phy sical impediments should be given 
suitable one-step commands.  Only the first attempt is scored.  0 = Performs  both tasks correctly. 
  1 = Performs  one task correctly. 
  2 = Performs  neither task correctly. 
     
 
______ 
2.  Best Gaze:   Only horizontal eye movements will be tested.  
Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored, but caloric testing is not done.  If the patient has a conjugate 
deviation of the eyes that can be ov ercome by voluntary or reflexive 
activity, the score will be 1.  If a patient has an isolated peripheral 
nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1.  Gaze is testable in all 
aphasic patients.  Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing 
blindness, or other disorder of vis ual acuity or fields should be tested 
with reflexive movements, and a choice made by the investigator.  Establishing eye contact and then mo ving about the patient from side 
to side will occasionally clarify t he presence of a partial gaze palsy.    0 = Normal.  
 
 1 = Partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, 
but forced deviation or total gaze paresis is not present. 
  2 = Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by the 
oculocephalic maneuver.

3.  Visual:   Visual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by 
confrontation, using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate.  
Patients may be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the 
moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal.  If there is 
unilateral blindness or enucleation, vi sual fields in the remaining eye 
are scored.  Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including quadrantanopia, is found.  If patient is blind from any cause, score 3.  Double simultaneous stimulation is perfo rmed at this point.  If there is 
extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to respond to 
item 11.  0 = No visual loss.  
 
 1 = Partial hemianopia. 
 
 2 = Complete hemianopia.  
  3 = Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness). 
    
 
______ 
4.  Facial Palsy:   Ask – or use pantomime to encourage – the patient 
to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes.  Score symmetry of grimace in response to noxious st imuli in the poorly responsive or 
non-comprehending patient.  If faci al trauma/bandages, orotracheal 
tube, tape or other physical barriers obscure the face, these should be removed to the extent possible.  0 = Normal symmetrical movements. 
 1 = Minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on 
smiling). 
 2 = Partial paralysis (total or near-total paralysis of lower 
face). 
 3 = Complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of 
facial movement in the upper and lower face).    
______ 
5.  Motor Arm:  The limb is placed in the appropriate position: extend 
the arms (palms down) 90 degrees  (if sitting) or 45 degrees (if 
supine).  Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 seconds.  The 
aphasic patient is encouraged us ing urgency in the voice and 
pantomime, but not noxious stimulation.  Each limb is tested in turn, 
beginning with the non-paretic arm.  Only in the case of amputation or 
joint fusion at the shoulder, the exam iner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.   0 =  No drift;  limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds. 
  1 =  Drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before 
full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support. 
  2 =  Some effort against gravity;  limb cannot get to or 
maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, 
but has some effort against gravity. 
  3 =  No effort against gravity;  limb falls. 
  4 =  No movement.   UN = Amputation or joint fusion, explain:  _____________________

6.  Motor Leg:   The limb is placed in the appropriate position:  hold 
the leg at 30 degrees (always tested supine).  Drift is scored if the leg falls before 5 seconds.  The aphas ic patient is encouraged using 
urgency in the voice and pantomime, but not noxious stimulation.  Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic leg.  Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion at the hip, the examiner 
should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the 
explanation for this choice.   0 =  No drift;  leg holds 30-degree position for full 5 seconds. 
  1 =  Drift; leg falls by the end of the 5-second period but does 
not hit bed.    
  2 =  Some effort against gravity;  leg falls to bed by 5 
seconds, but has some effort against gravity. 
  3 =  No effort against gravity; leg falls to bed immediately.

7.  Limb Ataxia:   This item is aimed at finding evidence of a unilateral 
cerebellar lesion.  Test with eyes open.  In case of visual defect, 
ensure testing is done in intact vis ual field.  The finger-nose-finger 
and heel-shin tests are performed on both sides, and ataxia is scored only if present out of proportion to weakness.  Ataxia is absent in the patient who cannot understand or is paralyzed.  Only in the case of 
amputation or joint fusion, the examiner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.  In 
case of blindness, test by having the patient touch nose from 
extended arm position.  0 = Absent. 
 
 1 = Present in one limb.  
  2 = Present in two limbs.  
 
 UN = Amputation or joint fusion, explain:  ________________ 
     ______ 
 
  
 
8.  Sensory:   Sensation or grimace to pinprick when tested, or 
withdrawal from noxious stimulus  in the obtunded or aphasic patient.  
Only sensory loss attributed to st roke is scored as abnormal and the 
examiner should test as many body areas (arms [not hands], legs, 
trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss.  A 
score of 2, “severe or total s ensory loss,” should only be given when 
a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated.  
Stuporous and aphasic patients will, therefore, probably score 1 or 0. 
The patient with brainstem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2.  If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic, score 
2.  Patients in a coma (item 1a=3) are automatically given a 2 on this 
item.  0 = Normal;  no sensory loss. 
  1 = Mild-to-moderate sensory loss;  patient feels pinprick is 
less sharp or is dull on the affected side; or there is a 
loss of superficial pain with pi nprick, but patient is aware 
of being touched. 
  2 = Severe to total sensory loss;  patient is not aware of 
being touched in the face, arm, and leg.   
  
 
______ 
9.  Best Language:   A great deal of information about comprehension 
will be obtained during the preceding se ctions of the examination.  
For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached picture, to name the items on the attached naming 
sheet and to read from the attached list of sentences.  
Comprehension is judged from responses  here, as well as to all of 
the commands in the preceding general  neurological exam.  If visual 
loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech.  The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a coma (item 1a=3) will 
automatically score 3 on this item.  The examiner must choose a 
score for the patient with stupor or limited cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one-step 
commands.  0 = No aphasia;  normal. 
 
 1 =  Mild-to-moderate aphasia;  some obvious loss of fluency 
or facility of comprehension, without significant 
limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression.  
Reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, 
makes conversation about prov ided materials difficult 
or impossible.  For example, in conversation about 
provided materials, examiner  can identify picture or 
naming card content from patient’s response. 
  2 = Severe aphasia;  all communication is through fragmentary 
expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing 
by the listener.  Range of information that can be exchanged is 
limited; listener carries burden of communication.  Examiner cannot identify materials prov ided from patient response. 
  3 = Mute, global aphasia;  no usable speech or auditory 
comprehension.  
 
  
 
  
 
 ______ 
10.  Dysarthria:  If patient is thought to be normal, an adequate 
sample of speech must be obtained by asking patient to read or repeat words from the attached list.  If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be 
rated.  Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barriers to 
producing speech, the examiner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice.  Do 
not tell the patient why he or she is being tested.  0 = Normal. 
 1 = Mild-to-moderate dysarthria;  patient slurs at least some 
words and, at worst, can be understood with some 
difficulty. 
 2 = Severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so slurred as to be 
unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric.

11.  Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect):   Sufficient 
information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior 
testing.  If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual 
double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are normal, the score is normal.  If the patient has aphasia but does 
appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal.  The presence of 
visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality.  Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the 
item is never untestable.    0 = No abnormality. 
  1 = Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention  
or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one 
of the sensory modalities. 
  2 = Profound hemi-inattention or extinction to more than 
one modality; does not recognize own hand or orients 
to only one side of space.

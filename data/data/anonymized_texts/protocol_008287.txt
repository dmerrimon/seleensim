CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 38  1 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background 
 
With more than 2 million abdominal operations occurring annually in the United States (US) 
and up to 20% of
 those patients developing ventral incisional hernias, abdominal wall defects 
and incisi
onal hernias represent a challenging surgical condition. 1, 2 Approximately 250,000 
ventral hernia repairs are performed on a yearly basis. 3 There are several options for repair, 
including primary repair, mesh reinforcements, repair with relaxing incisions, and use of 
musculofascial flaps, utilizing both open and laparoscopic approaches. 2 However, there is no 
clear-cut consensus regarding the optimal hernia repair technique, particularly in complex 
hernia repair cases where patient co-morbidities exist and a high risk of infection is present.    
 
Simple suture repair has been associated with a high risk of hernia recurrence, with reports 
ranging from 10% to 55%, and has been nearly abandoned for the repair of hernias which are 
greater than five centimeters (cm) in size. 4, 5, 6, 7 As a result, many ventral hernia repair 
procedures involve the use of a mesh material as a soft tissue reinforcement.    
 
Synthetic mesh repair procedures, either open or laparoscopic, have been reported to lead to 
fewer recurrences compared to primary repairs.8, 9, 10  Improved outcomes are believed to be 
related to reduced tension on the fascial edges and sutures when mesh is used in hernia repair 
procedures.  However, complex cases and large abdominal wall defects continue to pose a 
challenge to surgeons.  Factors such as patient co-morbidities, defect size, location, tissue 
viability and degree of contamination are included in a surgeon’s assessment and decision-
making process.11 These large abdominal wall defects have been associated with recurrence 
rates of up to 46%.12 
 
Despite the positive clinical impact of reducing hernia recurrence rates, the use of synthetic 
mesh has been associated with complications such as infection, adhesions, fistulae, and 
foreign body reactions including increased inflammation.13 
 
Non-absorbable meshes can lead to complications related to the body’s reaction to the 
persistent foreign mesh material resulting in foreign body sensations including discomfort 
and chronic pain, which is described by the International Association for the Study of Pain as 
pain lasting for 3 months or greater following hernia repair.14, 15 
 
Id
eally, an absorbable mesh would provide adequate structural support throughout the 
healing process and would be fully absorbed when the wound has completely healed, thereby 
potentially reducing the chances for complications associated with the persistence of non-
absorbable mesh material.16,17,18  The development of absorbable mesh products has faced 
challenges related to the rate of absorption with complications arising when the mesh product 
is absorbed too quickly.  An absorbable mesh should retain its functional strength for a 
sufficient period of time to allow native cellular ingrowth tissue remodeling, maturation of 
collagen, and gradual shift of mechanical load.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 38  Phasix™ Mesh is a commercially available medical device in the United States. It is a 
resorbable mesh prepared from poly-4-hydroxybutrate (P4HB) which has been studied for 
use as a biomaterial for a number of applications in medical devices and tissue engineering 
due to favorable mechanical properties, biocompatibility and desirable degradation times.19, 
20, 21 Using standard measures of mechanical strength (suture pull-out, tear and ball burst 
strength) Phasix™ Mesh is comparable in performance to traditional polypropylene mesh. 
Pre-clinical implantation studies indicate that the resorption of the Phasix™ Mesh fibers is 
minimal throughout the 12 week expected period of healing and up to ~26 weeks post-
implantation.  Resorption of the fibers is essentially complete in 12-18 months.24   
 
A bridging hernia repair study in a porcine model demonstrated that Phasix™ Mesh could 
pe
rform as a durable scaffold for soft tissue repair when spanning a surgical defect.24  The 
results of the 52 -week study showed that the repair site had three times greater mechanical 
repair strength, as compared to native abdominal wall.  This persisted even after significant 
Phasix™ Mesh resorption (as measured by molecular weight).  Only 10% of the strength of 
the repair site came from the Phasix™ Mesh at the 52 week timepoint.  Phasix™ Mesh 
showed an initial mi ld-moderate host inflammatory response, that declined to mild over 52 
weeks. Neovascularization (angiogenesis) and new collagen deposition were evident at 6, 12, 
26 and 52 weeks, as histologically evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.  In a 
24-week rat study, histological analyses of the repair site demonstrated that some competitive 
meshes had
 a greater overall host inflammatory response, some had less of a response and 
one had a very similar response, to Phasix™ Mesh.24 In the same study, histological analyses 
demonstrated similar variability on measures of host fibrotic response. 
 
This post-approval clinical study is being conducted to evaluate the use of Phasix™ Mesh in  
primary ventral or  incisional hernia repair . Patients who receive a Phasix™ Mesh implant 
will be followed for 24 months.

1.2 Rationale 
 
This study is intended to evaluate the use of Phasix™ Mesh for primary ventral, incisional 
and first-recurrent incisional hernia repair. 
 
1.3 Device Descriptions 
 
1.3.1 Phasix™ Mesh  
 
The Phasix™ Mesh (Davol, Inc.) is a resorbable mesh prepared from P4HB.  P4HB is 
produced from a naturally occurring monomer and is processed into monofilament fibers and 
knitted into a surgical mesh.  Phasix™ Mesh degrades through a process of hydrolysis and a 
hydrolytic enzymatic digestive process.  It was developed to minimize the variability of 
resorption rate (loss of mass) and strength and provide support throughout the expected 
period of healing. 
 
Pre-clinical implantation studies indicate that the resorption of the Phasix™ fibers is minimal 
throughout the 12-week expected period of healing and up to about 26 weeks post 
implantation.  Resorption of the fibers is essentially complete in 12 to 18 months.24  
 
Phasix™ Mesh has been commercially available in the United States since 2012 and is 
indic
ated to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists, such as the repair of hernia or other 
fascial defects that require reinforcement or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical 
result.  Because Phasix™  Mesh is fully resorbable, it should not be used in repairs where 
permanent wound or organ support from the mesh is required.  A full description of Phasix™ 
Mesh is included in the product’s Instructions for Use (IFU) ( Appendix 2). 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES

6 STUDY PROCEDURES 
 
6.1 Subject Screening a nd Baseline Evaluation 
 
Subjects with a diagnosis of a primary ventral or incisional hernia or up to 3 recurrent hernias 
requiring surgical repair to close the defect will be screened for potential eligibility against 
the study protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria, utilizing ordinary standard of care 
procedures (e.g. physical examination, blood work, medical evaluation) within 60 days of the 
date of consent.  This may include a full anesthetic work-up customary for hernia repair 
procedures.  Any other standard of care examination or evaluation within 60 days of the date 
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 38  of consent may be considered baseline for study purposes.  Prior medical records 
documenting these tests, examinations and evaluations may be used as the source documents 
for the baseline visit. 
 
During the screening and recruitment process, the Investigator will be responsible for 
describing the nature of the clinical study, verifying that the eligibility criteria have been met, 
and obtaining informed consent.  Written informed consent and a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver must be obtained prior to performance of 
any protocol specific procedures. 
 
The following screening/baseline procedures will be conducted and documented. 
 
6.1.1 Informed Consent  
 
The investigator will explain the study to the subject, answer all of the subject’s questions, 
and obtain written informed consent in a language in which the subject is fluent before the 
collection of any study data or performance of any study procedures.  
 
The subject (or subject’s legally authorized representative) must be willing and able to sign 
and date the informed consent form (ICF) prior to the collection of study data or performance 
of any study procedures. The original, signed informed consent will be retained with the 
subjects’ records and a copy provided to the subject. 
 
6.1.2 Enrollment 
 
Subjects who sign the informed consent and receive Phasix™  Mesh as a part of this study 
will be considered enrolled in the study.   
 
6.1.3 Eligibility 
 
The subject’s eligibility for study enrollment will be reviewed and documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  At the time of screening, a related progress note must be entered in the 
source document ation to indicate that all eligibility criteria were reviewed and screening 
results noted. Final eligibility will be determined intraoperatively. 
 
Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria should be considered screen failures and treated 
according to the Investigator’s standard of care. Data are to be collected for screen failure 
subjects from the time the ICF is signed until the subject is deemed a failure. At a minimum, 
subject demographics and the reason for failure must be collected; adverse events (AEs) will 
also be collected and followed through satisfactory resolution or stabilization.

criteria should be verified. Defect closure, defined as both fascial and skin closure, must be 
confirmed.  
 
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0  
Phasix™ Mesh  August 21, 2014 
Protocol DVL- HE-015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 38  The surgical technique will require retro-rectus or onlay placement (using absorbable suture) 
with or without Component Separation Technique (CST).  Subjects will be administered 
antibiotics according to hospital protocol.  
 
Subjects are prepared to undergo hernia repair following the instructions supplied by the 
Sponsor. The IFU for Phasix™ Mesh device is presented in Appendix 2.  
 
Phasix™ Mesh will be placed in the retro-rectus or onlay space with absorbable mesh 
fixation. The peritoneum should remain posterior to the mesh upon completion of mesh 
placement. Phasix™  Mesh may be cut to shape or size desired for each specific application. 
To prevent recurrence when repairing hernias, a mesh larger than the defect is required to 
ensure adequate coverage. The mesh is to be positioned so its edges extend beyond the 
margins of the defect by at least 5 cm.  It is recommended that fixation be placed at 
approximately 5 to 6 c m intervals (6 to 12 resorbable sutures) around the periphery of the 
mesh. The edges are then fixated to assure proper closure under correct tension.  
 
The procedure may include CST to obtain site closure. All incisions will be closed with 
staples and/or sutures and wounds will be dressed with sterile occlusive dressings. 
  
6.2.2 Component Separation Technique Surgery 
 
Prophylactic antibiotics will be administered according to hospital protocol. If a prior hernia 
repair utilizing mesh is in the affected area, complete removal of any mesh remaining is 
required. Once all of the dissection is performed and all of the hernia has been exposed, the 
largest vertical and transverse dimensions should be recorded. 
 
If the CST is utilized, the surgical technique will be a modification of the “component 
separation technique” by Ramirez et al. with the graft being implanted into the tissue plane of 
the surgeon’s preference, according to the following: Separation of components may be done 
via open, posterior or endoscopic/minimally invasive technique as described below.8, 26  
 
6.2.2.1 Open Technique 
  
After entering the abdominal cavity, adhesiolysis is performed to dissect free any intra-
abdominal contents from the abdominal wall.  The skin and subcutaneous fat are dissected 
free from the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominal muscle and the external oblique 
muscle.  The external oblique is separated through the aponeurosis approximately 1-3 cm 
from the edge of the rectus, or through the muscle.  If the hernia is subxiphoid in position, 
release must be done above the rib cage and come across the rectus sheath and muscle at the 
level of where the pectoralis meets the rectus.  The external oblique muscle is separated from 
the internal oblique muscle, as far laterally as possible (aiming to the anterior axillary line), 
above and below the hernia by approximately 5 cm.

upper third of the abdomen, about 0.5 cm medial to the anterior/posterior rectus sheath 
junction (linea semilunaris), the posterior rectus sheath is incised to expose the underlying 
transversus abdominis muscl e. The muscle is then divided along its entire medial edge using 
electrocautery. The use of a right-angled dissector significantly facilitates this release and 
minimizes injury to the underlying transversalis fascia and peritoneum. Transection of the 
medial edge of the transversus abdominis muscle allows for entrance to the space between 
the transversalis fascia and the lateral edge of the divided transversus abdominis muscle. The 
retromuscular space is bluntly developed further laterally to as far as the lateral border of the 
psoas muscle to allow for a reinforcement of a visceral sac with a large mesh. Also, if 
needed, this dissection may be extended superiorly above the costal margin and inferiorly to 
expose both myopectineal orifices. 
 
6.2.2.3 Endoscopic/Minimally Invasive Technique 
  
Make a 2 cm incision in the upper abdomen in a location that is convenient for release (such 
as directly over the costal margin at the level of the mid clavicular line, or at the tip of the 
11th rib). Please note: this incision may occasionally need to be placed further lateral to 
ensure the incision is lateral to the linea semilunaris.  Dissect down to the level of the 
external oblique muscle.  Separate the external oblique muscular fibers (this allows for 
visualization of the underlying internal oblique aponeurosis below).  Advance a balloon 
dissector between the internal and external oblique muscle down to the level of the inguinal 
ligament.  Insufflate the balloon under endoscopic visualization.  Remove the dissecting 
balloon and replace with a trocar (first port).  Infuse the lateral abdominal cavity with gas, 
such as carbon dioxide. Place a second port into the lateral abdominal cavity to allow for 
dissection.  A third port may be used to facilitate easier access to parts of the anatomy.  If 
performing a minimally invasive technique multiple incisions may be used to visualize and 
release the external oblique under direct visualization.  Use cautery or alternatively ultrasonic 
dissection to divide the external oblique muscle from the costal margin down to the inguinal 
ligament.  Please note: extending the dissection to the level of Scarpa’s fascia results in even 
greater abdominal wall advancement.  This technique is generally performed bilaterally. 
  
6.2.2.4 Open or Endoscopic Technique 
  
If necessary, resect/debride the edges of the rectus fascia to ensure apposition of healthy 
well-vascularized tissue as the midline is closed.  Care must be taken not to damage the 
blood supply and the nerves that run between the internal oblique and transverse muscle and 
enter the rectus abdominal muscle at the posterior side. 
  
Closure should be performed with permanent or long lasting sutures every 1-2 cm between 
sutures, for example with an interrupted Figure-8 closure or running stitch.  The surgeon 
should make every effort to close the fascial edges including the use of the component 
separation technique.  If the fascia cannot be closed, the peritoneum of the hernia sac should

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 38  have been preserved so that this can be closed over the Phasix™ to provide vascularized 
tissue.   
  
If a previous scar of skin is present, the scar should be excised.  The fascial and subcutaneous 
layer should be closed with sutures.  The skin should be closed with staples and/or 
sutures.  When skin closure can’t be achieved, a wound vac can be used.   
 
6.2.3 Postoperative Care  
 
Subjects will be discharged and postoperatively managed according to standard of care 
practices, determined by their physician/Investigator.   
 
If for any reason the mesh is removed and a mesh infection is suspected, routine culture, at 
the site of the wound, area of contamination, or potential contamination, obtained via each 
site’s normal protocol, should be obtained to determine cell count and type (i.e., yeast, gram 
positive or gram negative bacteria, or other).  If genus and species of the culture are 
identified as part of the routine practice at the site, that information should be recorded.   
 
6.2.4 Surgical Details 
 
Surgical details will be recorded and entered in the appropriate source documentation and 
eCRF(s).  Details will include but may not be limited to procedure date, start/stop times, 
procedure related complications, and AEs.   
 
6.3 Subject Follow- up 
 
6.3.1 S
ubjects Not Implanted and Surgical Repair Failures 
 
Subjects who are enrolled but do not have the test device placed or meet intraoperative 
eligibility criteria should be considered a screen failure and treated per hospital standard of 
care. Screen failure subjects who experience a protocol defined AE  will be followed through 
satisfactory resolution or stabilization of the event.  
 
Reason for failure of the surgical repair procedure, as well as all information outlined in 
Section 6.2.3 must be recorded in the source documentation.    Reasons for failure include, 
but are not limited to, inability to re-approximate the fascia, excessive tension on the midline 
incision, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal pressure too high, or staged procedure to 
eliminate active contamination. 
 
6.3.2 Subjects Successfully Implanted 
 
Subjects successfully implanted with Phasix™ Mesh will be followed as per the protocol 
defined follow-up procedures (see Table of Study Events).

6.5 Withdrawal and/or Early Termination 
 
Subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, 
without affecting their future care.  Subjects may also be discontinued from the study, if the 
Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the subject.   
 
Additionally, subjects may be discontinued for reasons including, but not limited to the 
following: 
 Consent is withdrawn 
 Lost to follow -up (LTF) 
 Death 
 Investigator withdrawal of subject 
 Sponsor’s decision 
 Other  
 
A subject is considered LTF if the investigational site personnel are unable to locate the 
subject despite two documented attempts to notify the subject via telephone and a third 
attempt by certified mail. 
 
A subject is considered an Early Termination (ET), if discontinuation occurs after successful 
implant of the test device.  The site should attempt to bring the subject bac k to complete all 
ET visit study procedures (see Table of Study Events).   
 
Once a subject discontinues from the study, the Investigator must complete a Study 
Completion eCRF and the reason for subject discontinuation must be fully documented. 
 
7 STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
This section describes the planned statistical analyses for this study. A detailed Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be completed and placed on file prior to database lock. The SAP 
will contain a comprehensive explanation of the methodology used in the statistical analyses 
described below.  
 
7.1 Study Hypothesis 
 
There is no formal statistical hypothesi s for this observational post-market study.  The study 
will follow eligible patients implanted with the Phasix™ Mesh for hernia repair in order to 
assess long-term recurrence rates. 
 
  
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0  
Phasix™ Mesh  August 21, 2014 
Protocol DVL- HE-015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 38   
7.2 Sample Size Considerations 
 
This study is projected to enroll up to 30 subjects at approximately 4 sites.  The sample size 
of 30 subjects is based on potential adequacy of data to meet the study objectives. It is not 
ba
sed on any statistical consideration. 
   
7.3 Data Analysis 
 
The Intent- to-treat (ITT) population consists of all enrolled subjects who have signed the 
Informed Consent Form. The modified ITT (mITT) population is defined as those subjects in 
the ITT population in whom Phasix™ Mesh has been implanted.  All analyses will be 
primarily based on the mITT population. 
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the ITT population. 
Summary statistics for categorical variables will include frequency counts and percentages 
and for continuous variables mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum. 
 
The primary endpoints of hernia recurrence rate and surgical site infection rate will be 
reported by visit along with their 95% confidence intervals based on the mITT population. 
The calculation of rates at each time point will be based on available data at the time point. 
Missing data will not be imputed. Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be 
performed.  
 
The secondary endpoints of Carolinas Comfort Scale and SF-12® will be summarized based 
on the mITT population with mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum 
presented by visit. Other secondary endpoints will be summarized as appropriate. 
 
A Per-Protocol (PP) population may be created if there are subjects who have any major 
protocol violations. The PP population will consist of any subjects in the MITT population 
who do not have any major protocol violations. The protocol violations that are considered to 
have a “major” grade will be defined a priori in the analysis plan. 
 
Subjects who do not have Phasix™ Mesh implanted will have their AEs summarized 
separately and their outcome data will not be collected or analyzed.  
 
Exploratory analyses on subpopulations may be performed. 
 
8 ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. All AEs that occur 
during the study should be treated with established standards of care that will protect the life 
and health of the study subjects.   
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0  
Phasix™ Mesh  August 21, 2014 
Protocol DVL- HE-015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 38   
Adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment through the end of study 
participation (either study completion or early discontinuation) and will be documented on 
the medical record or source document and on study eCRFs.  Events with an onset prior to 
enrollment should be reported in the subject’s medical history.   
 
8.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
 
In this study, an AE is defined as any undesirable clinical event occurring in the abdominal 
space including the lower abdominal, inguinal and pubic regions (including the skin), as well 
as any other undesirable clinical events judged to be related to the study device or surgical 
procedure regardless of anatomical region.  
 
Abnormal laboratory results are not to be considered AEs unless the results are accompanied 
by clinical signs or symptoms.  A pre-existing condition should not be reported as an AE 
unless there has been a substantial increase in severity or frequency of the condition 
(worsening of the underlying disease), which has not been attributed to natural history.  Pre-
existing conditions should be considered as part of the subject’s medical history.  
Exacerbation of an existing condition should be reported as an AE, if the event meets the 
protocol definition of an AE. 
 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of an AE to the study device or procedure as 
described in Section 8.5.  
 
8.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
 
An event will be classified as a serious adverse event (SAE) if it meets the definition of 
serious injury in the Medical Device Reporting Regulation [21 CFR 803.3] as listed below: 
 
 results in, or contributes to, a death or serious injury; 
 is life-threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); 
 requires in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization; 
 results in persistent disability or incapacity (i.e., permanent impairment of 
a body function or permanent damage to a body structure);  
 necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above in this definition (i.e., to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure) 
 
NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to describe 
the intensity of an event experienced by the subject. 
 
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Event to Device/Procedure 
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0  
Phasix™ Mesh  August 21, 2014 
Protocol DVL- HE-015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 38   
Assess each AE for its relationship to the device (Phasix™  Mesh) or surgical procedures as 
follows: 
 
 Device: This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to 
devices used as part of the study procedure. 
 
 Procedure:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable 
to the study device surgical procedure.  
 
Use the following categories for assigning the certainty of the relatedness: 
 
 Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or 
there is little doubt regarding the relationship. 
 
 Possibly Related:  An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being 
related but relatively unlikely. 
 
 Not Related:  An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no 
plausible association. 
 
 
8.4 Severity of Adverse Events 
 
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by the 
subject. 
 
 Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s 
activity or is transient and is resolved without treatment or sequelae. 
 
 Moderate:  May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional 
intervention and/or treatment, and may have additional sequelae. 
 
 Severe:  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s 
activity.  Additional intervention and/or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae 
occur.  Severe is used to describe the intensity of an event experienced by the subject. 
 
8.5 Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
If an AE occurs, all sections of the appropriate eCRF must be completed. 
 
All Investigator-judged device- or procedure-related AEs that occur (whether serious or not) 
must be reported to Davol Inc. Field Assurance using the contact information provided in 
Section 9, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
Davol, Inc.  Version 3.0  
Phasix™ Mesh  August 21, 2014 
Protocol DVL- HE-015 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 38   
Additionally, all SAEs (whether device- or procedure-related or not) must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of 
AEs according to IRB requirements. The Sponsor will report to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as appropriate after becoming aware of a reportable event. 
 
 
9 MECHANICAL FAILURES, MALFUNCTIONS AND DEFECTS  
 
The Investigator will record if the surgical mesh device used in the study procedure failed to 
meet its performance specifications whether due to mechanical failure, malfunction or 
defects.  This applies to: devices used in the subject, devices in which the package was 
opened but the device was not used for implantation in the subject, or devices with which 
implantation was attempted, but the device did not remain (was not used) in the subject. 
 
A recurrence (unless it is in a different location than the study hernia) is considered a device 
failure if the recurrence is clearly device related, and not procedure related or an issue of 
patient mismanagement (e.g., use of a Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) system for too long; 
mesh used was too small to adequately cover the defect), as determined by the Investigator. 
 
All mechanical failures, malfunctions, missing components, foreign matter inclusion or any 
other defects of the study device or any components of the device kit that do not perform to 
specifications must be promptly reported to the Davol Field Assurance Department :  
 
Telephone: 800-556 -6756 
Email: davol.fieldassurance@crbard.com   
 
The event must also be documented on the Device Failure eCRF and the malfunctioning 
device promptly returned to the manufacturer.   
 
10 CASE REPORT FORMS  
 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all study 
documentation.  All clinical study data will be recorded in the eCRFs provided to the 
investigational site.  
 
11 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
 
Subjects participating in this study will require hernia repair surgery as part of their standard 
of care.  The device utilized in this study is commercially available, has 510(k) clearance 
from the US FDA and will be used in accordance with the indications in labeling which are 
in effect during the study period.  This study will not pose any additional potential risk to the

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 38  health, safety, or welfare of the subject.  The risks associated with hernia repair and Phasix™ 
Mesh are described in full in the IFUs ( Appendix 2).  
 
There is no immediate benefit to the subject for participation in this study.  Collection and 
analysis of the data generated in this study may be of benefit to future subjects who require 
hernia repair. 
 
12 ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS 
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, HIPAA 
requirements, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and applicable FDA regulations (21 CFR parts 
50, 54, 56 and will be exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, as per 21 CFR part 
812.2(
c)(2), as the device has been cleared by the FDA for commerce and will be used as per 
the IFU).   
 
12.1 Publication Policy  
 
At the conclusion of the study, a multi-center article may be prepared for publication in a 
scientific journal. The publication of the principal results from any single-center experience 
within the study is not allowed until the preparation and publication of the multi-center 
results. Exceptions to this rule require the prior approval of Davol.  The analysis of other pre-
specified and non-pre-specified endpoints will be performed by Davol or its designee.  Such 
ana
lyses, as well as other proposed investigations will require the approval of Davol.  Davol 
anticipates the possibility of secondary manuscripts with principal authorship. For purposes 
of timely abstract presentation and publication, such secondary publications will be delegated 
to the appropriate principal authors, and final analyses and manuscript review for all multi-
center data will require the approval of Davol. 
 
12.2 Investigator Selection 
 
The Investigator must be of good standing as an Investigator and knowledgeable in relevant 
areas of clinical research to ensure adherence to the requirements of the protocol, including 
the protection of human subjects.  Other site personnel must have appropriate research 
experience and infrastructure to ensure adherence to the protocol and enrollment of sufficient 
numbers of evaluable subjects.  The curriculum vitae (CV) of the Investigator will be 
maintained in the Sponsor files as documentation of previous medical training, and federal 
databases will be searched to ensure that the Investigator and/or the site are not prohibited 
from engaging in federally Sponsored clinical research.  The Principal Investigator will sign 
the signature page of this protocol, agreeing to comply with all applicable government

It is important that the Investigator(s) and the relevant site personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits, and possible audit, and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
 
13.1 Study Initiation Visit 
 
Before the study begins, the study monitor will visit the site. The purpose of this visit is to 
review with the Investigator and staff the provisions and proper conduct of the clinical 
evaluation. This includes a detailed review of the protocol and eCRFs with instructions as to 
their completion, as well as reviewing regulations pertaining to the conduct of the clinical 
study. Arrangement for timely and accurate reporting of clinical data and relevant medical 
events will be established as well as ensuring safe and secure storage for the study devices. 
 
The study monitor will: 
 
 Confirm that the ICF to be used is the one approved by the IRB; 
 Verify that all necessary documents are on file at the site; and 
 Confirm that there are provisions to continue and maintain all documents and records 
throughout the study as required by GCP regulations. 
 
13.2 Ongoing Monitoring Visits 
 
The study monitor will maintain personal contact with the Investigator and staff throughout 
the study by telephone, e-mail, fax, mail, and on-site visits. On-site monitoring will begin 
after the first subjects are enrolled and continue until the study is completed. The monitoring 
will assure continued protocol compliance, adequate subject enrollment, accurate data 
reporting (including the comparison of eCRFs with subject records), device accountability (if 
required), and continued IRB acceptance of the study. The study monitor will evaluate and 
summarize the results of each visit in written reports, identifying any ongoing data problems 
with any study site and specifying recommendations for resolution of noted deficiencies. A 
formal monitoring plan will describe the planned extent of source data verification. 
 
13.3 Final Monitoring Visit  
 
At the completion of the study, the study monitor will conduct a final on-site visit. The 
purpose of this visit is to collect all outstanding study data documents, confirm that the 
Investigator’s files are accurate and complete, review the record retention requirements with 
the Investigator, provide the return of unused devices (if required) to the sponsor, review 
records which account for device shipment (if required), and assure that all applicable 
requirements for closure of the study are met. The actions and observations made at this visit 
will be recorded and filed.

14 TERMINATION OF STUDY  
 
Sponsor reserves the right to suspend enrollment or terminate the study at any time as set 
forth in the Clinical Study Agreement.  Written notice will be submitted to the Investigator in 
advance of such termination.  
 
Sponsor may suspend enrollment or terminate the study at a specific site for reasons 
including, but not limited to, inadequate data collection, low subject enrollment rate, 
achievement of the total enrollment, or non-compliance with the protocol or other clinical 
research requirements. 
 
15 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
The Investigator must promptly report to Sponsor any withdrawal of IRB approval at the site.  
Additional reporting requirements of the Investigator include: 
 
 Reporting all ICF violations to the IRB 
 Reporting all unanticipated problems, whether AEs or not  
 Reporting all device-related AEs to Davol Field Assurance Department 
 
As well as any additional requirements per the local IRB. 
 
16 RECORD RETENTION  
 
The investigator shall retain all study records for a period of 2 years after the investigation is 
terminated or completed, or until the records are no longer required as determined by the 
Sponsor.  The investigator may withdraw from the responsibility to maintain records for the 
period required and transfer custody of the records to any other person who will accept 
responsibility for retaining them with pre-approval.  Notice of a transfer shall be given to the 
Sponsor not later than 10 working days after transfer occurs.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 38  Appendix 3: Surgical Site Infection Classification27  
Superficial Incisional Surgical Site Infections (SSI) 
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation 
and 
Infection involves only the skin or subcutaneous tissue around the incision and at least one of 
the following: 
1. Purulent drainage with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial 
incision. 
2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the 
superficial incision. 
3. At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness, 
localized swelling, redness or heat and superficial incision is deliberately opened 
by a surgeon, unless the culture is negative. 
4. Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician. 
 
NOTE: Do not report the following as SSI: 
1. Stitch abscesses (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of 
suture penetration) 
2. Infection of the epis iotomy or neonatal circumcision sites 
3. Infected burn wound. 
4. Incisional SSI that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see definition for 
Deep Incisional Surgical Site Infections below).  
 
Note: Specific criteria are used for identifying infected epis iotomy and circumcision sites and 
burn wounds. 
 
Deep Incisional SSI 
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one 
year if implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation; 
and 
Infection involves deep soft tissues (e.g., fascia and muscle layers) of the incision and at least 
one of the following: 
1. Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space of the 
surgical site. 
2. A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon 
when the patient has at least one of the following signs: fever (>38° C), localized 
pain or tenderness unless the culture is negative. 
3. An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on 
direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic 
examination. 
4. Diagnosis of a deep SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.    
 
Notes: 
1. Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incision as deep incisional 
SSI. 
2. Report an organ / space SSI that drains through the incision  as deep incisional SSI.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 38  Appendix 4: Surgical Wound Classification27 
 Class I/Clean: An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is 
encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tract is not 
entered. In addition, clean wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary, drained with 
closed drainage. Operative incisional wounds that follow non-penetrating (blunt) 
trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria. 
 
 Class II/Clean-Contaminated: An operative wound in which the respiratory, 
alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are entered under controlled conditions and 
without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, 
appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence 
of infection or major break in technique is encountered. 
 
 Class III/Contaminated: Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations with 
major breaks in sterile technique (e.g., open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from 
the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, non-purulent inflammation is 
encountered including necrotic tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (e.g., dry 
gangrene) are included in this category. 
 
 Class IV/Dirty-Infected: Old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and 
those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. This definition 
suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the 
operative field before the operation.

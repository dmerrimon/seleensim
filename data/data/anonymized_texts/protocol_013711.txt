Study title:  Arimoclomol prospective double blind, randomised, placebo- controlled 
study in patients diagnosed with Niemann -Pick disease type C.  
Protocol number:  CT-ORZY -NPC -002 
Type of study:  Phase II/III  
Sponsor:  KemPharm Denmark  A/S 
Principal Investigator: Prof. Dr. med.  
Study centres:  15-20 sites in 6-9 countries
Laboratories Central laboratories used for all samples:  
Clinical chemistry and haematology : Covance Indianapolis  (United States 
sites); Covance Geneva (European sites).  
Biomarker analysis : Covance Harrogate,  United Kingdom (c holesteryl 
esterification , oxysterol , unesterified cholesterol , heat shock pro tein 
70 [HSP70 ]); KemPharm Denmark , Denmark (g lycosphingolipid s [GSLs] , 
sphingoid bases ); Centogene, Germany (LysoSM509). 
Study design:  MAIN STUDY: 
A prospective, randomised, double -blind, placebo- controlled therapeutic 
study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of Niemann- Pick disease 
type C (NPC) on or not on miglustat therapy that either 1) have 
completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CT -ORZY- NPC -001 study 
or 2) meet the eligibility criteria of this study (CT -ORZY -NPC -001) 
including a requirement of stable treatment with miglustat for 6  months (if 
on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment into CT -ORZY- NPC -002 study. 
It is anticipated that the majority of p atients for inclusion in the 
CT-ORZY -NPC -002 study would have comp leted the 
CT-ORZY -NPC -001 study. 
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol 
(compared to placebo) when it is administered as an add- on therapy to the 
patient’s current prescribed best standard of care; each patient’s stan dard 
of care may, or may not, include miglustat. 
Patients will be stratified into strata A (on miglustat therapy) and B (not on 
miglustat therapy). Hereafter , the patients will be randomised to receive 
placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio  of 1:2). 
To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will 
undergo an arimoclomol single -dose pharmacokinetic ( PK) evaluation 
before randomisation and the start of continuous (multiple dosing) 
treatment.  
The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12 months.  
Following this , all patients will be offered to continue into the extension 
phase of the study where  every patient will receive arimoclomol and attend 
site visits at 18 months, and every 6 months thereafter until End of 
Extension Phase at 60 months ( after patient  randomisation) . The extension 
phase runs for 48 months or until arimoclomol has received European 
Union ( EU)/United States  (US)  marketing authori sation  (MA)  or until the 
analysis of data from the controlled , blinded phase  12-month study period 
does not support the efficacy and/or safety of arimoclomol.  If the EU /US 

Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 5 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  MA is not obtained within this period, the duration of the study will be 
extended accordingly (amendment to protocol).  
Patients will be enrolled in the extension phase only if the investigator 
deem s that the patient is deriving clinical benefits from th e trial 
participation. 
The Investigator will contact the patient (or the patient's parent[s]/legal 
guardian[s]) by telephone (monthly calls during the first 6  months of the 
blinded phase and every 3 -4 months following the start of the extension 
phase) to follow up on the status of the patient, whether the patient has 
experienced any new AEs or the worsening of any existing AEs, whether 
the patient has had a change in any prescribed medication, whether the 
patient has experienced any difficulties in taking the investigational 
medicinal product  (IMP)  and to confirm the weight of the patient . Should 
the patient experience disease progression that is too severe and/or too fast 
or should there be any safety concerns , the patient may also attend the site 
for unscheduled visits. 
In order to perform an exploratory exposure -response analysis, sampling 
for Population Pharmacokinetics (POP PK) of arimoclomol and 
metabolites (if relevant) will be performed in all patients at Visits  3, 4, 5, 
and 6 (3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively). 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety data  
during the blinded phase of the study. 
Should a patient discontinue prematurely and choose to withdraw from the 
study, all effort should be made to have the patient attend the  site for a 
withdrawal visit during the blinded or the extension phase of the study 
(depending on the time point of withdrawal). 
In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the 
“early escape clause” will allow the Investigator to a pply the escape route 
which implies that the patient can be treated with  arimoclomol during the 
blinded phase of the study. 
Early Escape Clause and Criteria:  
The “early escape clause” can be invoked when a set of criteria are met in 
the event that  a participating patient experiences  disease p rogression that is 
too severe and/or too fast . In such cases, the patient will:  
1)Stop receiving the IMP;
2)Be offered treatment with arimoclomol ;
3) Continue with their current protocol schedule.
For evaluation of a  potential early escape, the three relevant domains of the 
NPC  Clinical Severity Scale  (NPCCSS) to be assessed are: Ambulation, 
Swallowing and Fine Motor Skills. 
The investigator will assess the following criteria to determine if the “early -
escape clause” is to be invoked for the particular patient: 
EITHER  
•Criterion  1: An increase of at least 2  points simultaneously in two
out of the three relevant domains of the NPCCSS (for at least
4 points in total) within a period of 3 months;
OR 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 6 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  •Criterion  2: An increase of 6  points simultaneously in two out of
the three relevant domains of the NPCCSS (for at least 6  points in
total) within a period of 6 months;
OR 
•Criterion  3: An increase of at least 2  points simultaneously in the
all of the three relevant domains of the NPCCSS (for at least
6 points in total) within a period of 6 months.
The Investigator will submit all requests for early escape to Worldwide 
Clinical Trials  for review and approval. 
Following the review of relevant juvenile toxicology data and 
PK information from 100% of the patients aged 2 to <12 years, t he 
CT-ORZY -NPC -002 study has now been expanded to include a paediatric 
substudy in patients aged 6 to < 24 months at study enrolment which will 
assess the safety and tolerability of 36 months of open -label arimoclomol 
when it is administered as an add -on therapy to the patient’s current 
prescribed best standard of care; each patient’s standard of care may, or 
may not, include miglustat. Data from the paediatric substudy will be 
analysed and reported separately from the data in the main study.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Study objectives:  MAIN STUDY: 
Primary:  
•To evaluate therapeutic response to arimoclomol versus placebo,
both in addition to best available standard of care, at 12 months.
Secondary:  
•To evaluate the therapeutic response to arimoclomol through
clinical, biological and imaging assessments at 6 and 12  months;
•To evaluate the long- term therapeutic response (clinical and
biological assessments) at 18 months and every 6 months
thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 60  months;
•To evaluate the safety of arimoclomol.
PAEDIATRIC SUBSTUDY: 
 
 
 
Study drug  and dosage 
form : MAIN STUDY:  
Blinded Phase Study Period 
Arimoclomol citrate or placebo in hard capsules  of 25  mg, 50 mg, and 
100 mg , which are supplied either in single -dose high density 
polyethylene ( HDPE ) bottles for the  initial single dose  PK evaluation  
(patients less than 12  years of age only) , or supplied in blister package s 
mounted within wallets which are packaged  within a box for the  placebo -
controlled part. 
Extension Phase  
Arimoclomol  citrate  in hard capsules of 25 mg and/or 50 mg and/or 100 mg 
are supplied in HDPE bottles. 
PAEDIATRIC SUBSTUDY:  
   
 
 
Dose s to be studied:  MAIN STUDY:  
Dosing is based on the patient’s body weight (BW): 
Patient Body Weight Arimoclomol C itrate Dose  
8-15 kg BW 50 mg t.i.d. (150 mg/day) 
>15-22 kg BW 75 mg t.i.d. (225 mg/day) 
>22-38 kg BW 100 mg t.i.d. (300 mg/day) 
>38-55 kg BW 150 mg t.i.d. (450 mg/day) 

Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 8 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  >55 kg BW 200 mg t.i.d. (600 mg/day) 
The patient’s weight will be measured at each visit and the IMP dose is to 
be adjusted as required.  
In the event that a patient who is receiving 150 mg IMP per day requires a 
dose reduction, then a dose of 75 mg per day (25 mg t.i.d) should be 
administered.  
For individual patients less than 12  years of age, to confirm the 
corresponding dose, a single dose PK evaluation will be performed by an 
independent assessor following a single dose of arimoclomol to verify the 
area under the cur ve in 0-8 hours  (AUC 0-8). In the event that patient s require 
a dose reduction, the se patient s will be dispensed a further s ingle dose of 
arimoclomol, and a new single dose PK  evaluation will be performed to 
confirm the corresponding dose. Should further dose adjustments be 
required , based on the second single dose PK evaluation, the above 
procedure will be repeated until the c orrect dose level is found.  
Also, in the event that unexpected PK -profiles are obtained (from patients 
less than 12  years of age) which are clinical significant and could 
potentially impact the safety of the patient, the independent assessor can 
recommend additional PK sampling to be performed (in agreement with 
the Sponsor’s medical responsible person and the Principal Investigator). 
The results of this analysis might lead to dose adjustments as recommended 
by the independent assessor. 
This/these  dose reduction(s) will take place prior to randomisation and to 
commencing continuous dosing of IMP (arimoclomol or placebo, as per the 
study randomisation).  
PAEDIATRIC SUBSTUDY:  
 
 
 
Dosing route and 
regimen  MAIN STUDY:  
IMP (arimoclomol or placebo) will be administered orally t .i.d. 
If required, the IMP can be dispersed in 10-20 mL (i.e. 1-2 tablespoons) of 
liquid (water, apple juice) or soft foodstuff (yoghurt or apple sauce).  
In the dispersed state, the IMP capsules can also be administered via a 
gastric tube (as applicable). For full administration of the dose, flush the 
tube with 5 mL of water.

Dose adjustment:  MAIN STUDY:  
Patients less than 12 years of age may have their dose adjusted (decrease) 
following a single oral dose of arimoclomol based on review of the 
following criteria by an independent assessor:  
•AUC 0-8
Also, in the event that unexpected PK -profiles are obtained (from patients 
less than 12 years of age) which are clinical significant and could 
potentially impact the safety of the patient, the independent assessor can 
recommend additional PK sampling to be performed (in agreement with 
the Sponsor’s medical responsible person and the Princi pal Investigator). 
The results of this analysis might lead to dose adjustments as recommended 
by the independent assessor.  
In addition to this, a patient who has commenced continuous dosing with 
the IMP is to be considered for dose reduction should the fol lowing criteria 
be met: 
•Serum creatinine above 1.5 x the patient’s baseline creatinine
value . Dose adjustment may be temporary  however, subsequent
dose increase  must be discussed with the KemPharm Denmark ’s
medical monitor (or delegate) ;
Note : Serum creatinine calculation  = Serum creatinine value /baseline
serum creatinine value. Result rounded to 1 decimal  point as per normal
rounding principles .
•Decrease in the patient’s weight  (as confirmed during a site visit)
meeting the lower weight range i n the  actual dose group .
Administration of IMP  will be stopped and the patient withdrawn from the 
study should the following criteria be met:  
•CTCAE* Grade  2 acute kidney injury considered related to the
IMP (which corresponds to the serum creatinine increase of above
2-3 x the patient’s baseline creatinine value);

summary statistics . If a baseline value is missi ng, no change from baseline 
will be calculated . 
MAIN STUDY:  
Evaluation of Primary Endpoint: 
The primary analysis is by a general linear mixed model for repeated 
measurements. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 
12 months in the 5  domain NPCCSS. The 5  domain NPCCSS  score is 
derived as the sum of scores from the ambulation, speech, swallow, fine 
motor skills and cognition domains.  
The model will be f itted with treatment, miglustat level and visit as fixed 
effects along with a treatment -by-visit interaction term. The estimated 
treatment effect will be taken from the treatment -by-visit interaction term 
at 12 months. 
The analysis model is:  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛽𝛽0∙𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0+𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖+𝑀𝑀𝑙𝑙+𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+𝑇𝑇𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
where  
Yijk is the  5 domain  NPCCSS endpoint for the jth patient of treatment 
group i at visit k  
yij0 is the baseline value for the jth patient of treatment group i 

Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 17 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  𝛽𝛽0 is the unknown fixed slope for the baseline covariate  
Ti is the unknown fixed effect of treatment i 
Ml is the unknown fixed effect of miglustat level l  
Vk is the unknown fixed effect of visit k  
TVik is the unknown fixed interaction effect of treatment i  and visit k  
sij is the effect associated with the jth patient of treatment i  
eijk is the error (residual) associated with the jth patient of treatment i 
at visit k  
sij and eijk are assumed to be independent from each other and follow a 
multivariate normal distribution. Th e covariance matrix for e is chosen to 
be the unstructured variance -covariance matrix, it assumes pair -wise 
correlations are not constrained by the data.  
The estimated treatment effect is taken from the TVik interaction term at 
Visit  6 (i.e. 12 months). 
Missing data will not be imputed for the primary endpoint analysis. If a 
baseline value is missing, no change from baseline will be calculated.  
The model allows for the calculation of the 95% confidence interv al (CI) 
for the treatment effect, and a P -value to test the null hypothesis that the 
effect of arimoclomol  and placebo is the same.  
Evaluation of Secondary Endpoints:  
Key Secondary Endpoints: 
•Responder analysis of patient’s CGI -I score remains stable or shows
improvement at 12 months and descriptive summary of responder rate
at 12 months  (for the FDA submission, this endpoint is considered a
co-primary endpoint)
•Responder analysis of patient’s  5 domain NPCCSS  score remains
stable or improves at 12 months and descriptive summary of responder
rate at 12 months .
These will be analysed at 12  months using two- tailed chi -squared tests. If 
chi-squared conditions are not met, then a Fisher’s exact test will be used. 
A patient who disc ontinues before 12 months will be considered a non-
responder. 
•Time to worsening (as defined by reaching the  MCID in patient’s 5
domain NPCCSS)
Kaplan -Meier plots for time to worsening will be produced for each 
treatment group and compared via a log -rank te st, stratified for use of 
miglustat.   
•Proportion of patients worsening (as defined by reaching the MCID on
patient’s 5 domain NPCCSS) at 6 and 12 months
This will be analysed using two -tailed chi -squared tests . If chi -squared 
conditions are not met, then a Fisher’s exact test will be used. A patient 
who discontinues before 6 months (or 12 months, as appropriate) will be 
considered a patient who has worsened.  
•Change in full scale NPCCSS score apart from hearing domains (i.e.
Hearing and Auditory Brainstem Response) from baseline to 12
months : This will be analysed using an analysis of covariance model
including baseline full scale NPCCSS score (apart from heari ng
domains) , miglustat and randomised treatment as the only covariates.

including each domain score and its change from baseline.
•Change in the NPC -cdb score (modified "Stampfer Score") at 6, 12 and
18 months and e v ery 6 months thereafter until End of Extension Phase
at 60 months : This will be analysed using the same model as for the
change in the full N PCCSS ( apart from hearing domains ) at 6  months.
•Change in Quality of Life (EQ 5D Y) at 6, 12 and 18 months and every
6 months thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 60 months : The
changes from baseline will be simply compared by a Mann Whitney
(independent samples) test and 95% CI at each of 6 and 12 months).
Data from 18 months and e very 6  months thereafter until End of
Extension Phase at 60 months will be summarised descriptively.
•Change in the SARA score at 6, 12  and 18 months and every 6  months
thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 60 months : This will be

Evaluation of Exploratory Endpoints: 
•NPC disease progression rate based on the NPCCSS (apart from
hearing domains) from baseline in the CT -ORZY- NPC -002 study to 6
and 12 months. This will be analysed using a similar model as for the
change in the N PCCSS score  at 6 months. Specifically, the analysis of
covariance models (2  models) will have as response variables: rate of
disease progression between Baseline and (1) 6  months in the
CT-ORZY- NP C-002  study and (2) 12 months in the
CT-ORZY- NPC-002  study. The covariates in each model (the same in
both analyses) will be rate of disease progression in study
CT-ORZY -NPC -001, miglustat use, and randomised treatment.
•The number of patients le aving the blinded phase of the study before
12 months as a result of early escape will be presented .
•The number of patients who either withdraw from the study before
12 months, or who need to jump to escape therapy  will be presented .
•Change in use of NPC m edication/standard of care (including
miglustat therapy) at 12 and 18 months and every 6  months thereafter
until End of Extension Phase at 60 months will be listed .
Subgroup Analyses:  
Exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed on the primary and three 
key secondary endpoints. Point estimates of treatment differences with 
95% CIs and proportions of treatment difference with 95% CIs will be 
presented for each subgroup where applicable. Exploratory subgroup 
analyses will be performed based upon: 
•Use (or not) of miglustat at randomis ation;
•Genotype;
•Age at diagnosis of first neurological symptom. Categories are:
oPre/peri -natal (onset at age <3  months);
oEarly -infantile (at age 3  months to <2  years);
oLate-infantile (at age 2 to <6  years);
oJuvenile (at age 6 -15 years);
oAdolescent/adult (at age >15  years).
•Age at entry to the study either <12 years or ≥12 years;
•Age at entry to the study either <4 years or ≥4  years);
•Disease severity defined as the 5 domain NPCCSS score at baseline
divided into 3 severity groups <4, 4- 22 and >22;
•Disease severity defined as the full scale NPCCSS ( apart from hearing
domains) at baseline divided into tertiles; 0 - ≤18, 19 - ≤36, 37 - ≤54);
•Change in full scale NPCCSS score (apart from hearing domains ) from
baseline to 3  months for patients with late infantile phenotype (age at

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  7. INTRODUCTION
7.1. NIEMANN- PICK DISEASE TYPE  C 
Niemann -Pick disease type C  (NPC ) is a very rare , fatal, neurovisceral, atypical lysosomal 
storage disorder  (LSD) presenting  impaired cellular functions in processing and transporting 
low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol ( Huang et al., 2011). The disease affects all organs and it 
is charact erised by a significant variety of progressive and disabling neurological symptoms 
(Vanier , 2010). NPC  presents an extremely heterogeneous clinical manifestation which 
progresses over varied periods of time ( Imrie  et al ., 2007; Patterson  et al. , 2012). 
The estimated incidence is 1:150,000 live births ( Wraith  et al. , 2009) or 0.1 in 10,000 people 
in the European Union (EU).  
NPC  is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations of either the 
NPC1 (95% of families) or the NPC2  genes (in approximately 5% of cases) . Patients with 
NPC1 or NPC2 mutations are not clinica lly distinguishable. Undetected causal gene mutations 
may also exist.  
The broad clinical spectrum ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult onset 
chronic neurodegenerative disease. The neurological involvement defines the disease severity in most patients but is typically preceded by systemic signs (cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal 
period or isolated spleno- or hepatosplenomegaly in infancy or childhood).  
The disease progression largely correlates with the age at onset of the neurologic symptoms. Progressive neurological disease is the hallmark of NPC , and is responsible for disability and 
premature death in all cases. Classically, children with NPC  may initially present with delays 
in reaching normal developmental milestones before mani festing cognitive decline and 
dementia.  
Neurological signs and symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, tremor, 
epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (up gaze palsy, down gaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paraly sis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy, dystonia, spasticity, 
hypotonia, ptosis, microcephaly, psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor. 
In the terminal stages of NPC , the patient is bedridden, with complete ophtalmoplegia, loss of 
volitional movement and severe dementia. 
7.2. ARIMOCLOMOL  
Arimoclomol acts as a c o-inducer of heat shock protein 70 ( HSP 70, a major component of the 
so-called  heat shock response  [HSR]) under conditions of cellular stress. The HSR has been 
established as therapeutic target in LSDs in several studies.   
Several previous studies have established the HSR as therapeutic target in NPC . In a recent 
study, HSP70 was shown to be critical for the proper folding and activity of the NPC1 protein, 
which is mutated in the majority of patients with NPC . Importantly, this study furthermore 
demonstrated that induction of HSP 70 can rescue the most common genetic defect i n the NPC1 
protein and the resulting cellular pathology. 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 33 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Proof-of- concept for the use of arimoclomol has been established in vitro  and in vivo , in a 
mouse model of disease. In the NPC1-/- mouse model, arimoclomol was effective in improving 
neurological symptoms and reducing the accumulation of glycosphingolipids  (GSLs) which is 
a pathobiochemical hallmark of NPC . These results strongly suggest that arimoclomol may 
confer similar benefits to patients with NPC . Refer to the Investigator Brochure  (IB) for furt her 
information. 
7.2.1. Clinical Data  
Clinical experience on arimoclomol originates from 7  Phase I studies and 2 Phase II stud ies in 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  (ALS) patients. Phase I studies with arimoclomol include a 
single- dose study, a multiple -dose study, an ascending multiple -dose study, two food effect 
studies, a mass balance study to determine absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
elimination  (ADME ), and a renal safety study. In addition, pharmacokinetic ( PK) parameters 
were assessed in one of the Phase II stud ies in ALS patients.  
Overall, arimoclomol was absorbed rapidly and arimoclomol exposure (based  on peak serum 
concentration  [C max] and are under the curv e [AUC ]) has been shown to increase in a nearly 
dose proportional manner. 
Steady  state appeared to  have been reached by  24 hours after the start  of three times a day  (t.i.d.) 
dosing for all dose levels.  
Across all clinical studies performed ( including the Phase  II stud ies in ALS patients) an 
average t 1/2 of 3.5 hours and a time to peak serum concentration  (Tmax) of 1-2 hours has been 
found.  Furthermore, the food effect was evaluated in 2  studies (single dose administration of 100 mg 
and 400 mg arimoclomol 
citrate ). No food effect (based upon AUC and C max) was observed 
following the administration of arimoclomol in the fed compared to the fasted state.  To date, a total of 106 healthy subjects received arim oclomol 
citrate  at doses ranging from 
50 mg  (single dose) to 1800 mg  (600 mg dosed t.i.d.). 
In the Phase  II study (Study AALS -001), 62 patients with ALS were administered 25 -100 mg 
arimoclomol citrate  t.i.d. for 3 months. A total of 69  patients from this study (previously treated 
with arimoclomol or placebo) continued in the open- label extension study (Study AALS -001-
OL), receiving 100 mg arimoclomol citrate  t.i.d. for an additional 6 months.  
In summary, safety data from the Phase  I studies and the Phase  II stud ies in ALS patients 
suggest that arimoclomol may lead  to a drug- related increase in serum creatinine, and a 
decrease in mean creatinine clearance. All observed changes in creatinine were reversible. 
Since there was no change in glomerular filtration rate and serum cystatin  C, this suggests an 
inhibitory effect of arimoclomol on tubular secretion of creatinine.  
In an in vitro  transporter study, arimoclomol was shown to be an inhibitor of OCT2 transporter 
(with initial inhibitory activity of this transporter at C max of individual human doses higher than 
400 mg ). OTC2 transports creatinine; thus, inhibition of this transporter could provide an 
explanation for the modest increases in serum creatinine found in clinical studies.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Other adverse events  (AEs) related to arimoclomol were gastrointestinal disorders ( diarrhoea  
being most frequently reported) as well as dry mouth (this was the most frequently treatment 
related AE reported in the ALS studies). 
Refer to the IB for more information.  
7.3. RATIONALE FOR T HE STUDY AND RISK -BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
NPC  is an extremely rare , progressive and life -threatening  disease. The clinical manifestation 
regarding symptoms, severity and progression is very heterogeneous amongst patients. There 
is no approved cure for NPC . In the absence of any curative treatment for  NPC , quality of life 
represents  the treatment goal in the management of the patients, and can be addressed by 
(Patterson  et al., 2012): 
•Rigorous sympt omatic treatment
•Miglustat therapy for existing neurological manifestations
Symptomatic treatments are targeting: 
•Neurological manifestations: such as seizures, cataplexy, dystonia and tremor,
dysphagia, drooling and sleep disturbances
•Cognitive impairment
•Psychiatric illness
•Systemic manifestations
In Europe, miglustat was approved in 2010  as disease modifying therapy for the treatment of 
progressive neurological symptoms in NPC  patients.  Miglustat reduces substrate load, intended 
to slow down the progressive neurological manifestations in adult and paediatric NPC  patients. 
The available data on miglustat support that at least some patients might benefit from treatment in that  the progression of disease is slowed down. The benefit of the treatment  should be 
evaluated on regular basis, e.g. every 6 months to monitor potential or expected AEs and the 
continuation of the therapy should be re -appraised after at least 1  year of treatment with 
miglustat.  
Several previous studies have established the HSR as therapeutic target in LSDs ( Ingemann  
and Kirkegaard, 2014). The HSR is a key homeostatic system, which is induced under conditions of metabolic stress (e.g. protein misfolding and aggregation, nutrient deprivation, oxidative or thermal stress). Its main components are the heat shock proteins  (HSPs), in 
particular HSP70, which have significant cytoprotective properties. HSP70 act as molecular chaperone,  assisting in the folding of newly synthesized or damaged proteins, preventing 
protein aggregation, and targeting severely damaged proteins for degradation. Notably, the cytoprotective actions of HSP70 also include protection against lysosomal dysfunction and cell death ( Ingemann  and Kirkegaard, 2014).  
Since most LSDs  are characterized by lysosomal dysfunction, cell death and significantly 
reduced enzyme activity due to missense mutations rather than complete loss of function, the LSDs are amenable to therapeutic approaches involving HSP70 ( Kirkegaard , 2013; Ingemann  
and Kirkegaard, 2014).  
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 35 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Arimoclomol is a co -inducer of HSP70 expression which acts through the activation of heat 
shock factor- 1 (HSF -1), the major regulator of HSP gene transcription ( Neef  et al ., 2011).  
Through the induction of HSP70- proteins, arimoclomol aids the proper folding of otherwise 
misfolded NPC1 protein, hereby correcting the root cause of NPC  disease ( Figure 7-1). 
Additionally, HSP70 proteins improve lysosomal function, a key target in NPC  disease. The 
molecular actions of arimoclomol th us correct several aspects of the molecular pathology of 
NPC  disease in a concerted action, providing the mechanistic rationale for the hypothesized 
therapeut ic benefit of arimoclomol in NPC  patients.  
Another aspect related to the therapeutic potential of arimoclomol is its ability to cross the 
blood brain barrier  (BBB ). By penetration into the central nervous system  (CNS) arimoclomol 
is suggested to bring direct neurologic benefit also to the NPC  phenotype.

Disease Type C Disease  
Th
e observational (non- therapeutic, interventional)  study, CT -ORZY- NPC -001 was designed 
to better characterise the individual patient disease profile (disease burden) through the clinical, imaging, biological status, and Q uality of L ife prospectively recorded, together with the 
historic disease information collected from pati ent medical records. It also allowed the 
evaluation of the safety data of the disease- related therapy and to record every AE linked to the 
disease.  The study was categorized as interventional due to the nature and frequency of the 
study procedures, which are not necessarily performed as a standard of care. 

Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 36 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  During the study CT -ORZY -NPC -001, the patients remained  on their prescribed disease 
related therapy (based on the choice of their treating physician) and did  not receive any 
investigational medicinal prod uct (IMP). All patient- care decisions, including diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions, were made by and conducted at the discretion of the Investigators 
according to their clinical judgement and the local standard of medical care. 
The only standard of care limitation wa s that miglustat therapy was to  be stable for at least 
6 months before study participation (for those patients in treatment with miglustat), and that 
patients with three or more anticonvulsants were excluded from participation. For those 
patients who had  been discontinued from prescribed treatment with miglustat, they must have 
been discontinued for at least 3 continuous months prior to inclusion in the study. 
The procedures performed in the study CT -ORZY -NPC -001 are the same that the ones  which 
will be carried out in study CT -ORZY- NPC -002, apart from the Scale for Assessment and 
Rating of Ataxia  (SARA), Nine -hole Peg Test  (9HPT), Clinical Global Impression Scale – 
Severity  (CGI -S), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI- I), PK, Population 
Pharmacokinetics (POP  PK) and IMP related procedures which are exclusively performed in 
study CT -ORZY- NPC -002. The addition of the SARA , 9HPT , CGI -S and CGI -I will not add 
any burden to the study patients. Following on from the CT -ORZY- NPC -001 observational study, t his Phase  II/III  
interventional therapeutic study (CT -ORZY -NPC -002) will assess the efficacy and safety of 
arimoclomol (compared to placebo). This s tudy will allow for a thorough evaluation of the 
clinical (NPC Clinical Severity Scale  [NPCCSS], NPC Clinical Database [NPC -cdb], SARA, 
9HPT, Quality of Life , CGI -S and CGI -I), biological/biochemi cal (unesterified cholesterol, 
oxysterol, HSP70, NPC1 protei n, GSL s and sphingoid bases ), POP  PK and imaging 
(ultrasound of liver and spleen) markers in a randomised controlled setting ensuring the 
generation of reliable data for the assessment of therapeutic response of arimoclomol.  
In the CT -ORZY -NPC -002 study, t he IMP (arimoclomol or placebo) will be administered 
orally  t.i.d. as an add -on therapy to the patient’s current prescribed best standard of care. The 
duration of the controlled blinded phase study period will be 12 months; following this  period, 
every patient will continue into the extension stage of the study where they will receive 
arimoclomol in addition to the best standard of care  and be followed up at 18 months and every 
6 months thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 60 months (after patient randomisation) . 
The extension phase  runs for 48 months or until arimoclomol has received EU /United 
States  (US) marketing authorisation  (MA) or until the analysis of data from the controlled, 
12-month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of
arimoclomol.  If the EU /US MA is not obtained within this period, the duration of the study
will be extended accordingly (amendment to protocol).
Following the review of relevant juvenile toxicology data  and PK  information f rom 100% of 
the patients aged 2 to <12 years, the CT -ORZY- NPC -002 study has now been expanded to 
include a paediatric substudy in patients aged 6 to <24 months at study enrolment which will 
assess the safety and tolerability of 36 months of open- label arimoclomol when it is 
administered as an add -on therapy to the patient’s current prescribed best standard of care; each 
patient’s  standard of care  may, or may not, include miglustat  (refer to APPENDIX V: 
Paediatric Substudy for description of the substudy). 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 37 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Arimoclomol has been shown to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and ALS  patients . To 
date, a total of 106 healthy subjects have received arimoclomol  citrate  at doses ranging from 
50 mg (single dose) to 1800 mg (600 mg dosed t.i.d.) and a total of 69 ALS patients have 
received 100  mg arimoclomol citrate t.i.d. for at least 6 months with no safety concerns.  
Refer to Section  11.2.1  for the rationale behind the dose recommendations for the 
CT-ORZY- NPC -002 study. 
The potential risks involved in this study concern those routinely linked to the interventional 
study procedures of skin punch biopsy procedure and blood draws for clinical haematology, 
biochemistry and biomarkers , and venous blood samples for the PK analysis (in patients less 
than 12 years of age ) and POP  PK analysis in all patients .  
One of the key requirements of a clinical trial is to assess as early and as reliable as possible 
any consistent pharmacodynamics effect of the drug being tested. KemPharm Denmark  A/S 
decided to perform in the participating NPC  patients in this study , the least invasive and best 
researched tissue (skin biopsy and blood sampling) instead of more invasive sampling 
assessment of cerebrospinal fluid  (CFS)  or the biopsy of other organs for this study. Skin 
biopsies are therefore required in this study to assess the effect of arimoclomol on lysosomal 
lipid sequestration as well as NPC1 protein expression.  
The key component of NPC  disease is the sequestration  of cholesterol and GSLs in the 
lysosomes. For this reason, Filipin staining of cultured fibroblast from skin biopsies is used as 
a diagnostic tool to confirm the accumulation of un- esterified cholesterol prior to sequencing 
of the NPC gene ( Vanier , 2010) . Likewise, the characterization of the NPC1 protein function 
and post translational glycosylation have been addressed in primary fibroblast cell cultures, which also show increased GSL accumulation  (Gelsthorpe  et al. , 2008) ( Sun et al. , 2001; 
Watanabe et al. , 1998; Yu  et al.,  2012; Zampieri  et al. , 2012). Therefore, the purpose of the 
skin punch biopsies is not to generate fibroblast cultures, but to directly measure the biomarkers in the fibroblasts from the skin homogenates. 
Lipid accumulation is pronounced in the brain, liver and spleen, organs that are severely 
affected in this neurovisceral , progressively debilitating and life -threatening disease. However, 
these tissues are not easily sampled in a clinical trial, even less justified in the paediatric population. Recently, GSL accumulation was also found to be elevated in purified CD19+ B 
cells ( Te Vruchte e
t al., 2014); but whether these cells are suitable for the diagnostic 
determination of cholesterol accumulation, remains to be investigated and confirmed. Whether 
the same observation can be shown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs ) remains 
also to be investigated. For the ganglioside analysis, most publications rely on fibroblast or animal tissue but there are also a couple of publications on CD19+ cells. Upon these reasons it 
was decided not to rely solely on the PBMC results. 
Oxidation products of cholesterol, called Oxysterols, have been shown to be elevated in 
mu
ltiple tissue from NPC mutant mice and in -patient  blood samples ( Porter  et al. , 2010). 
Recently, a large clinical study demonstrated that the oxysterol cholestane -3β,5α,6β -triol can 
be used as a diagnostic marker for Niemann Pick type C disease ( McKay  Bounford et al ., 2014, 
Reunert  et al. , 2016). 
Accumulation of sphingoid bases  has been seen  in NPC patients as well as in mouse models of 
the disease ( Lloyd-Evans  and Platt, 2010; Vanier  et al. , 2015; Lloyd-Evans  et al., 2008). 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 38 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  The skin biopsies procedure is minimally invasive and represents a low risk in comparison to 
other diagnostic procedures that may imply a much higher risk of complication s. Other relevant 
target tissues such as brain, liver and spleen are not easily sample d in a clinical trial, and 
arguably are not ethically justifiable to sample if punch skin biopsies can be used instead. 
In order to perform an exploratory exposure -response analysis, sampling for POP PK will be 
performed in all patients at Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 (3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively). The 
maximum volume of blood collected for POP PK sampling will be 8 mL in total.  
Extensive assay development has  been performed  to confirm and validate the appropriate 
procedure/s and to  minimise the sampling vol umes . 
Upon regulations and guidelines, a  limited volume of blood will be drawn from each patient 
during this study (at baseline, 7 -14 days post the commencement of multiple dosing, and at the 
3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60- month visit s) that will not exceed the recommended 
maximum blood sampling volume for children in clinical trials which should not exceed 3 % of 
total blood volume in one draw ( Howie , 2011 ). 
7.4. BIOBANK  
If the patient or the patient's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) provide consent, the Sponsor will store 
the excess blood/plasma/serum collected during the study for future research use. The research 
may include analysis of biomarkers for NPC . This is optional for all patients entering the study 
and will involve a separate patient consent procedure. Consenting for the storage of excess blood/plasma/serum for future research use by the Sponsor is not a pre -requisite to participating 
in the study. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15  years after the last patient has 
completed the study.

9.1. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
A prospective, randomised, double -blind, placebo- controlled therapeutic study in patients with 
confirmed diagnosis of NPC  1 or NPC  2 on or not on miglustat therapy that either 1) have 
completed Visit 2 (end of study [EOS]) of the CT -ORZY- NPC -001 study or 2) meet the 
eligibility criteria of this study (CT -ORZY- NPC -001) including a requirement of stable 
treatment with miglustat for 6  months (if on miglustat therapy) prior to enrolment int o 
CT-ORZY- NPC -002 study. It is anticipated that the majority of patients for inclusion in the 
CT-ORZY- NPC -002 study would have completed the CT- ORZY- NPC -001 study.  
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of arimoclomol (compared to 
placebo) when it is administered as an add -on therapy to the patient’s current prescribed best 
standard of care; each patient’s standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat . The study 
endpoints are documented in Section  9.3. 
Patients will be stratified into strata  A (on miglustat therapy) and B (not on miglustat therapy). 
Hereafter, the patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an allocation ratio of 1:2). 
To confirm the selected dose, patients less than 12 years of age will undergo an arimoclomol 
single- dose PK evaluation before randomisation and the start of continuous (multiple dosing) 
treatment.  
In order to perform an exploratory exposure -response analysis, sampling for POP PK will be 
performed in all patients at Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 (3, 6, 9 and 12 months re spectively).  
The duration of the blinded phase study period will be 12  months. 
Following this, all patients will be offered to continue into the extension phase  of the study 
where every patient will receive arimoclomol and will attend site visits at 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 
48, 54 and 60 months ( after patient randomisation ). The extension phase  runs for 48 months or 
until arimoclomol has received  EU/US MA or until the analysis of data from the controlled, 
12-month blinded phase study period does not support the efficacy and/or safety of
arimoclomol.  If the EU/US MA is not obtained within this period or if the study is stopped
prematurely (see S ection  22.5), the duration of the study will either be extended accordingly
(amendment to protocol) or patient s may be offered continued treatment with arimoclomol via
an early access program me as permitted by local regulation. Early access program mes may
vary depending on location and include: compassionate use, named patient, expanded accessand managed access program mes.
Continued access to treatment will be contingent on the continued favorable benefit/risk profile of arimoclomol in NPC as assessed by KemPharm  Denmark .  
Patients will be enrolled in the extension phase only if the investigator deem that the patient is deriving clinical benefits from the trial participation.  
Following the review of relevant juvenile toxicology data  and PK  information from 100% of  
the patients aged 2 to <12 years, the CT -ORZY- NPC -002 study has now been expanded to 
include a paediatric substudy in patients aged 6 to <24 months at study enrolment which will assess the safety and tolerability of 36 months of open- label arimoclomol whe n it is

patient’s standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat (refer to APPENDIX V: 
Paediatric Substudy for description of the substudy).  Data from the paediatric substudy will be 
analysed and reported separatel y from the data in the main study. 
Before undergoing any screening procedures or data collection, patients (and the patients' parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) will be required to sign the Patient Information and Informed Consent Document (PICD) for this study. 
Refer to Section  9.4 for the trial timetable/study visits. A schedule for the tests and evaluations 
to be conducted in this study is found in the flow chart s in APPENDIX II: Stu dy Flow Chart:

The Investigator will contact the patient (or the patient's parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) by 
telephone (monthly calls during the first 6 months of the blinded phase and every 3-4 months 
following the start of the extension phase) to follow up on the status of the patient, whether the patient has experienced any new AEs or the worsening of any existing AEs, whether the patient has had a change in any prescribed medication, whether the patient has experienced any difficulties in taking the  IMP and to confirm the weight of the patient. Should the patient 
experience disease progression that is too severe and/or too fast or should there be any safety concerns  or should the patient’s weight require reassessment in the clinic (in order to confirm 
if a dose reduction is required), the patient may also attend the site for unscheduled visits. 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety data (includ ing renal and 
hepatic data)  during the blinded phase of the study. 
In patients whose disease progression is too severe and/or too fast, the “early escape clause” 
(refer  also to Section  10.5.2) will allow the Investigator to apply the escape route which implies
 
that the patient can be treated with arimoclomol during the blinded phase of the study.  
Should a patient discontinue prematurely and choose to withdraw from the study, all effort 
should be made to have the patient attend the site for a withdrawal visit during the blinded or the extension phase of the study (depending on the time point of withdrawal). Should the patient 
(or the patient's parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) refuse to attend the withdrawal  visit, the date and 
reason for study discontinuation will be recorded in the electronic case report form  (eCRF) as 
minimum.  Refer to Section  10.5.1 for the discontinuation criteria. 
Approximately 15-20 sites in 6 -9 countries in Europe and US will participate in this study . Up 
to 52 NPC  patients  will be randomised , to have at least 40 evaluable patients  (at least 30 of 
these should be paediatric patients less than 1 8 years of age).  
The over all stu dy design is summarised in Figure 9-1.

9.2. DIS
CUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN  
NPC  is a very rare disease in which patients  show progressive and significant neurological 
deterioration. There is no universally accepted marker of the disease. Inter- patient individual 
disease progression is heterogeneous.  
In this Phase  II/III study (CT -ORZY- NPC -002), a ll markers investigated dur ing the initial 
12-month placebo- controlled phase of the study will support the therapeutic response
evaluation of arimoclomol vs. placebo.Arimoclomol (or placebo) is given as an add- on therapy to the current best standard of care. 
Since none of the patie nts are deprived from their current available therapy it is considered 
ethically justified to use placebo in this study. In addition to this, the exposure to placebo has 
been minimised as much as statistically justifiable ( i.e. a randomisation scheme of 1:2 
[placebo:arimoclomol]) is applied. 
The 12-month duration of the blinded study phase is considered to be the minimal duration 
required in order to be able to identify changes in the disease severity (as assessed by the 
NPC CSS). In order to monitor the patient ’s disease progression and the safety of the IMP , as 
well as to maintain patient  motivation, improve patient compliance and minimise patient drop 
outs, the patient will visit  the site every 3  months.  
Although the potential  benefits of arimoclomol in this patient population still remains to be 
evaluated , an early escape clause has been implemented  in order to ensure that patients 
experiencing an unacceptable rate of  progression, than expected, can receive arimoclomol 

Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 43 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  (active  treatment ) during the blinded phase of the study (as per the patient’s current protocol 
sche
dule) . To minimise bias introduced by the families (eager to get active drug), the decision 
of whether the early escape clause and criteria have  been met or not , is to be taken by the 
i
nvestigators and is based upon the NPCCSS score. Also, the frequent visits (every 3 months) 
are considered to minimise the risk of families requesting unscheduled visits to have the disease 
severity evaluated, since this could lead to  a bias in the estimate of time to “treatment failure”. 
In general, with regard to the PK c haracteristics, the age group of 12-18 ye ars ( adolescent) i s 
considered t o hav e similar P K as adul ts, w hile the  lower age  g roups  are less pr edictable. 
Therefore the P K profile of  ar imoclomol is re quired t o be confirmed in patients below the age 
of 12 before multiple dosing can commence 
(ref:http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/
WC500003066.pdf
). 
In or der to perform an exploratory exposure -r esponse analysis, POP  PK will be performed in 
all patients at Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 (3, 6, 9 and 12 months respectively). The maximum volume 
of blood collected for POP PK sampling will be 8 m L in total. Sampling times for POP  PK 
were selected based on the anticipated PK pr ofiles in children, robustness to uncertainty in PK 
and patient convenience. 
After the 12- month  blinded phase  of  the study, all patients will receive arimoclomol  (active 
drug) . Since the safety prof ile of arimoclomol in paediatric patients  will be well established at 
this time point , duri ng the extension phase of the study the patients will attend the site for  a 
visit at 18, 24, 30, 36, 4 2, 48, 54 and 60 m onths  (a fter patient randomisation) . In addition  to 
this, 
following the start of the extension phase of the study, the site will call the patient every 
3-
4 months to follow up on the status of the patient, whether the patient has experienced any
ne
w AEs or the worsening of any existing AEs, whet her  the patient has had a change in any
pre
scribed medication, whether the patient has experienced any difficulties in taking the IMP
a
nd to confirm the weight of the patient.
Patients will be enrolled in the extension phase only if the investigator deem that the  patient is 
de
riving  clini cal benefits f rom the  trial participation.  
F
ollowing the review of relevant juvenile toxicology data  and PK  information from 100%  of 
the patients aged 2 to <12 ye ar s, the CT -ORZY- NPC -002 study has now been expanded to 
include  a paediatric substudy in patients aged 6 to <24 m ont hs at study enrolment which will 
assess the safety and tolerability of 36 m onths of open- label arimoclomol when it is 
administered as an add-on therapy to the patient’s current prescribed best standard of care; each 
patient’s standard of care may, or may not, include miglustat (refer to APPENDIX V: 
P
aediatric Substudy for  a description of the substudy) . Patients below 2 ye ars of age will be 
tr
eated with open label arimoclomol and will be analysed and reported separately as compared 
to the main analysis of the 12 months placebo-controlled study.

•Have their data entered on the eCRF.
10.1. INFORMED C ONSENT  
Each potentially eligible patient (and /or their parent[s]/legal guardian[s] /legally authorised 
representative [ LAR ]) will be informed of the study’ s objectives and overall requirements. 
Prior to conducting any tests not performed routinely in the treatment of the patient, the 
Investigator will exp lain the study fully to the patient and/or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
using the PICD. If the parent/legal guardian is willing for the patient to participate in the study, (s)he will be requested to give written informed consent. The Informed Conse nt will be signed
and personally dated by the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) (according to local laws andregulations) and the Investigator. If capable, the patient should provide assent /consent to
participate in the study and also sign and personally date the Informed Consent if possible(according to local laws and regulations). A copy of the signed form (s) will be provided to the
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and the original retained with the source documents. Although
nursing staff may be involved in describing the trial to a patient and his/her parent(s)/legal
guardian(s), the Investigator must participate  in discussions with the patient  and/or his/her
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and sign and personally date the Informed Consent.
10.2. INCLUSION CRITERIA

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Sexual absti nence is considered a highly effective birth control method only if it is 
defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the study and for 3 week s 
after the last dose of IMP (for female patients of child -bearing potential) and for 
3 months afte r the last dose of IMP (for male patients with female partners of child -
bearing potential). The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated by the 
Investigator in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Based on recommendations from the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group  (CTFG , 2014). 
•Ability to comply with the protocol -specified procedures/evaluations and scheduled
visits.
10.3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Each of the following criteria will be taken as reason for exclusion from participation in the trial: 
•Recipient of a liver transplant or planned liver transplantation;
•Severe liver insufficiency (defined as hepatic laboratory parameters, AST and /or ALT
greater than three- times the ULN for age and gender  (central laboratory assessment) ;
•Renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 times the ULN (central
laboratory assessment) ;
•Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to the IMP (arimoclomol or constituents);
•In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient's clinical condition does not allow for therequired blood collection and/or skin biopsies as per the protocol -specified procedures;
•Treatment with any investigational drug during the study or in the 4 weeks  prior to
entering the study.
This includes treatment with  any investigational drug during the study in an attempt to
treat NPC ;
•Pregnancy or breastfeeding;
•Current participation in another trial is not permitted unless it is a non -interventional
study and the sole purpose of the trial is for long- term follow up/survival data (registry);
•For patients who have not completed the CT -ORZY -NPC -001 study, fulfilling any of
the criteria listed below:
oPatients with uncontrolled severe epileptic seizures period
a (at least
3 consecutive severe epileptic seizures that required medication) within
2 months prior to the written consent. This includes patients with ongoingseizures that are not stable in frequency or type or duration over a 2 -month
period prior to enrolment, requiring change in dose of antiepileptic medication(other than adjustment for weight) over a 2- month period prior to enrolment, or
requiring 3 or more antiepileptic medications to control seizures;
a An epileptic seizure is a transient symptom of  abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in 
the brain. The outward effect can be as dramatic as a thrashing movement (tonic -clonic seizure) or as 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 52 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  mild as a brief loss of awareness (absence seizure). It can manifest as an alteration in mental st ate, tonic 
or clonic movements, convulsions, and various other psychic symptoms. Sometimes it is not 
accompanied by convulsions but a full body slump, where the person simply will lose body control and 
slump to the ground. Seizures can occur in patients who do not have epilepsy. On the other hand, non-epileptic seizures are paroxysmal events that mimic an epileptic seizure but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons. These non -epileptic seizures are caused by either physiological 
or psychological conditions.  
oNeurologically asymptomatic patients;
oSevere manifestations of NPC  disease that would interfere with the patient’s
ability to comply with the requirements of this protocol;
oTreatment with any IMP within 4  weeks prior to the study enrolment.
10.4. ASSIGNMENT OF P ATIENT NUMBER /ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO 
TREATMENT GROUPS  
At screening, the Investigator will assign a patient number to the patient. 
Once the subject is considered by the Investigator to be eligible for the study, the Investigator 
will create a new patient in the eCRF. Patients will be stratified into strata A (on miglustat 
therapy) and B (not on miglustat therapy). Upon randomisation, the eCRF will assign a randomisation  number to the patient. The 
treatment assigned to each patient will be determined according to a computer -generated 
randomisation list.  Patients will be randomised to receive placebo or arimoclomol (with an 
allocation ratio of 1:2). 
10.5. PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS FROM STUDY AND 
REPLACEMENT POLICY 
10.5.1. Discontinuation C riteria  
Patients  (and their parent [s]/legal guardian[s]) will be informed that they have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice to their medical care, and are not 
oblige d to state their reasons. Any withdrawals must be fully documented in the eCRF and 
should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Additionally, the Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if he/she considers this to be 
in the patient’s best interest.  
Patients will be discontinued from the study if at least one of the following criteria has been 
met:  
•Patient ’s parents/legal guardian have withdrawn informed consent;
•Patient has withdrawn informed assent;
•Safety reasons (decision of the Investigators and/or Sponsor’s medical responsible
person and/or DSMB);
•Investigator’s decision;
•Patient has participated in another interventional clinical trial;
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 53 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  •Patient ha s received a liver transplantation;
•Patient has died;
•Patient has become pregnant;
•Patient is lost to follow -up. This is defined as when the site is unable to contact the
patient (the patient ’s parents[s]/legal guardians[s]) and it is impossible to obtain any
further data ;
•Patient meets criteria for IMP administration to be stopped and subsequent withdrawal
(refer to Section  11.2.4);
•Patient is un -blinded during the blinded phase of the study due to an emergency (refer
to Section  11.4).
If a patient  fails to return for a scheduled visit, attempts should be made to contact the patient 
(or the patient ’s parent[s]/legal g uardian[s]) to ensure that the reason for not returning is not an 
AE. Likewise,  if a patient (and/or the patient ’s parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) declares his/her 
wish to discontinue prematurely and withdraw from the study e.g. for personal reasons, an attem pt should be made to establish that the true reason is not an AE (bearing in mind the 
patient is not obliged to state his/her reasons). 
Should the patient discontinue prematurely and choose to withdraw from the study, the patient 
will be asked to attend th e site for a withdrawal visit during the blinded or the extension phase 
of the study ( depending on the time point of withdrawal).  The visit should take place within 
4 weeks of patient withdrawal. The reason for study discontinuation (if known) should be 
documented in the eCRF, and any A Es followed up until resolution, until the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise expla ined or until the patient is lost to follow up. If the 
patient is lost to follow up, then this should be noted in the eCRF. 
10.5.2. Early Escape Clause and Criteria  
The “early escape clause” can be invoked when a set of criteria are met in the event that a partici pating patient experiences disease progression that is too severe and/or too fast. In such 
cases, the patient will: 
1) Stop receiving the IMP;
2)Be offered treatment with arimoclomol;
3)Continue with their current protocol schedule (see APPENDIX II: Study Flow Chart:Blinded Phase Study Period: Patients less than 12 years of age and APPENDIX III: Study
Flow Chart: Blinded Phase Study Period: Patients 12  Years of Age and Older ).
For evaluation of a potential early escape, the three relevant domains of the NPCCSS to be assessed are: Ambulation, Swallowing and Fine Motor Skills. 
The investigator will assess the following criteria to determine if the “early -escape clause” is 
to be invoked for the particular patient:

10.5.3. Replacement P olicy  
At least f orty (40) patients planned to be evaluable in this study; at least  30 of these  should be  
paediatric patients less than 1 8 years of age. U p to fifty -two (52) NPC patients  will be 
randomised. No patient drop-outs will be replaced.  
An evaluable patient is defined as a patient who:  
•Met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion cri teria specified in Sections 10.2 and
10.3 within the specified time -frame ,
•Completed Visit 1 and Visit 4 at 6  months, and
•Had his/her eCRF  completed.
Should a patient drop out or be withdrawn from the study, their patient study numbe r will not 
be reallocated.  A dropout rate of approximately 23% is estimated to ensure 40  evaluable 
patients to complete the study. During the study, recruitment may be increased based on an 
assessment on the number of evaluable patients in the study to dat e.

Arimoclomol (N-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-3- (1-piperidyl)propoxy]pyridine-3-carboximidoyl 
chl
oride, 1-oxide , citrate) is a hydroxim ic acid derivative.  
Arimoclomol is a small molecule that up-regul ates the HSPs in cells under stress and is a 
co-induc
er of the HSP70 expression. It has been demonstrated in experimental models for NPC  
tha
t arimoclomol offers the potential to ameliorate signs and symptoms of this severe 
neurological condition.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  11.2. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  DOSING SCHEDULE 
AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION 
11.2.1. Dose Rationale 
A simple allometric scaling method using PK data from Phase  I studies to relate size to 
predicted clearance (CL) (and total exposure), based on total body weight  (BW) has been 
selected as the most appropriate method to adjust dosage in paediatric patients with NPC  
because:  
1.Pharmacokinetics of arimoclomol are linear (proportional) and well characterised in
human adults;
2.Bioavailability of arimoclomol in human adults is high;
3.Renal clearance is expected to be a major contributor to overall elimination ofarimoclomol and metabolites;
4. Maturation of renal function is considered complete at 2 years of age.
The following equation was applied to predict CL ( Mahmood, 2006): 
CL in the child = adult CL×(weight of the child/70)
0.75 
Estimated CL values were used to predict exposure (AUC) over a dosing interval at steady state and an appropriate decrease in dose for children based on their total BW. Dose was adjusted based on a target daily exposure limit (AUC
0-24) of 12.9 µg.h/mL ensuring a safety 
factor of 2 compared to daily exposure following repeated dosing at the No Observed Effect Level  (NOEL) (400  mg/kg/day) in juvenile rats. 
Predicted AUC
0-24 values at steady state in the patient population were also compared to 
observed AUC 0-24 at the NOEL in the most sensitive adult toxicological species to ensure a 
relevant safety margin was maintained.  
The final reco mmendation for dose stratification using a pragmatic choice of weight ranges to 
ensure a safety ratio of approximately 2 versus NOEL in juvenile rat are presented in Table 11-2. These recommendations are based on a t.i.d dose regime consistent with the dose regime used in adults. 
The following numerical assumptions were made for the completion of these predictions: 
1. Change in C
max and AUC with dose are proportional;
2. Bioavailability of arimoclomol is 100% in children and adults;3.CL in a healthy 70 kg human adult is 55 L/h - value pooled from available exposure
and demographic data in Phase I studies.
4. Protein binding is low (10%) and constant between adults and children.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  11.2.2.  Do se 
IMP (arimoclomol and placebo) dosing is based on the patient’s BW (refer to Table 11-3 ): 
T
able 11- 3:  Investigational Medicinal Dosing : Based on the Patient Body Weight 
Patient Body Weight  (BW)  Investigational Medicinal Dosing  (IMP)  Dose

>22-38 kg BW 100 mg t.i.d.  (300 mg/day)  
>38-55 kg BW 150 mg t.i.d.  (450 mg/day)  
>55 kg BW 200 mg t.i.d.  (600 mg/day)  
The pa
tient’s weight will be measured at each visit and the IMP dose is to be adjusted as 
required.  
In the event that a patient who is receiving 150 mg IMP per day requires a dose reduction, then 
a dose of 75 mg per day (25 mg t.i.d) should be administere d (refer also to Section  11.2.4).  
For individual patients less than 12 years of age, to confirm the corresponding dose, a single dose PK evaluation will be performed by an independent assessor following a single dose of 
arimoclomol to verify the area under the curve in 0- 8 hours  (AUC
0-8). In the  event that patients 
require a dose reduction (refer also to Section  11.2.4), these patients will be dispensed a further 
single dose of arimoclomol, and a new single dose PK  evaluation will be performed to confirm 
the corresponding dose. Should further dose adjustments be required, based on the second single dose PK evaluation, the above procedure will be repeated until the correct dose level is found.  
Also, i n the event that unexpected PK -profiles are obtained (from patients less than 12 years of 
age) which are clin ical significant and could potentially impact the safety of the patient (e.g. 
risk of accumulation), the independent assessor can recommend additional PK sampling to be 
performed. If agreed by the Sponsor’s medical responsible person and the Principal Investigator , up to a maximum of 6 additional samples (corresponding to the full PK analysis 
set) can be taken at a subsequent visit prior to randomisation. The results of this analysis might 
lead to dose adjustments as recommended by the independent assessor. 
This/these dose reduction(s) will take place prior to randomisation and to commencing 
continuous dosing of IMP (arimoclomol or placebo, as per the study randomisation). 
11.2.3. Dosing Route and Regimen 
The IMP (arimoclomol and placebo) may be dispensed only by the Investigator or by a member 
of staff specifically authorized by the Investigator, as appropriate. The IMP will be dispensed 
to the patient during site visits or shipped to the patient’s house ( as appropriate) (refer to 
Section  13). 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 60 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Arimoclomol or placebo will be administered orally t.i.d. In the event that IMP administration 
during the blinded phase study period coincides with the administration of other concomitant medication, the IMP should be administered first. 
If required, the IMP can be dispersed in 10-20 mL (i.e. 1-2 tablespoons ) of liquid (water, apple 
juice) or soft foodstuff (yoghurt or apple sauce). In the dispersed state, the IMP  capsules can also be administered via a gastric tube (as 
applicable).  For full administration of the dose, flush the tube with 5 mL of water.  
The dispersed product is stable for 8 hours. 
11.2.4. Dose Adjustment  
Patients less than 12 years of age  may have their dose adjusted (decrease)  following a single 
oral dose of arimoclomol based on review of  the following criteria  by an independent assessor  
(see also Table 11 -4 and Section  11.2.1): 
•AUC
0-8
In 
addition, the dose can be adjusted (and subsequent repeated PK assessments performed)  
(refer to Section  11.2.2), if justified by the independent assessor (e.g. if an unexpected 
PK-profile is obtained and this could potentially impact the safety of the subject). 
In the event that a patient who is receiving 150 mg IMP per day requires a dose reduction, then 
a dose of 75 mg per day (25 mg t.i.d) should be administered. For this dose group (75 mg per day), the same AUC acceptance limit of 4.6 has to be adhered to ( Table 11 -4).

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  In addition to this, a patient  who has commenced continuous dosing with the IMP  is to be 
considered for dose reduction should the following criteria be met: 
•Serum creatinine above 1.5 x the patient’s baseline creatinine value . Dose adjustment
may be temporary however, subsequent dose increase must be discussed with the KemPharm
Denmark ’s medical monitor (or delegate) ;
Note : Serum creatinine calculation  = Serum creatinine value/baseline serum creatinine value. Result
rounded to 1 decimal  point as per normal rounding principles .
•Decrease in the patient’s weight (as confirmed during a site visit) meeting the lower
weight range in the actual dose group (refer to Section  11.2.2 for dosing based on the
patients BW) .
Upon confirmation of a dose reduction, new IMP kits will be dispensed to the patient  at the 
confirmed lower dose . In the event that this does not coincide with a site visit, the IMP will be 
shipped to the patient’s home.  
In order to maintain blinding (refer to Section 11.3) in the event that a dose reduction is due to 
a patient’s elevated serum creatinine values  at Visit 2, 2 additio nal patients (selected at random 
from across all sites) will also be dispensed new IMP kits but their IMP dose will remain unchanged. 
Following confirmation of a dose reduction, the patient should continue their daily dosing at 
their current IMP dose, until they are in receipt of the new IMP kits, as per Investigator discretion and patient safety. 
Administration of IMP  will be stopped and the patient withdrawn from the study should the 
following criteria be met: 
•Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE
) Grade 2  acute kidney
injury considered related to the IMP (which corresponds to the serum creatinine
increase of above 2-3 x the patient’s basel ine creatinine value) ;
Note : Serum creatinine calculation  = Serum creatinine value/baseline serum creatinine value. Result
rounded to 1 decimal  point as per normal rounding principles .
•CTCAE  Grade 3 hepatic related parameters (AST and/or ALT) considered related to
the IMP;
•Other CTCAE  Grade 3 AEs considered related to the IMP.
The individual patient dose will be adapted if required upon patient’s weight changes at every visit (refer to Section  11.2.1 for dosing based on the patients BW).  
Refer also to Section  11.3 for the review of the Visit 2 creatinine test results (central lab 
analysis).  
11.2.5. Dose Interruption  
If a patient experiences a clinically significant and/or unacceptable toxicity  (which is not a 
discontinuation criterion  as listed in Section  10.5.1 ), dosing may  be interrupted and supportive 
therapy administered as required. All dos ing interru ptions must be discussed with the 
KemPharm Denmark ’s medical monitor (or delegate).  
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 62 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  An interruption of up to 4 weeks (calculated from AE start date) is permitted following 
discussion with the KemPharm Denmark ’s medical monitor (or delegate) prior to resuming 
IMP administration  at the same dose prior to interruption (unless the criteria are met for dose 
adjustment as specified in Section  11.2.4).  
11.3. BLINDING  
To maintain the integrity of the study, access to unblinded information will be restricted 
t
hroughout until final database lock. The treatment allocation for each patient will be managed  
vi
a Interactive Response Technology ( IRT). T reatment codes will not be  made available to 
anyone who could influence the ongoing treatment and evaluation of patients. 
Visit 2 creatinine test results (central lab analysis) will not be sent to the site; instead these 
r
esults will be reviewed by an independent expert in order to avoid the possible unblinding of 
the patient. Based upon the available data, any possible effects on the kidneys/creatinine levels 
will be detectable with 7 -14 da ys (at Visit 2) . Any possible changes are expected to be 
nor
malized within a period of 3-4 months. Visit  2 c reatinine test results will be transferred to 
Worldwide Clinical Trials  Data Management for inclusion in the study database following 
unbli
nding of the study data  after study completion. The independent expert will contact the 
investigator in the event that further safety follow up is required.  
In the event that a patient requires a dose reduction (refer to Section 11.2.4) at Visit 2, 
2 addi
tional patients (selected at random from across all sites) will also be dispensed new IMP 
ki
ts. Only the patient requiring a dose reduction will  r eceive a lower dose; the IMP dose for the 
a
dditional 2 patients will remain unchanged. 
The DSMB will be provided with unblinded data where appropriate , the DSMB will also have 
a
 specified unblinded statistician. Pharmacovigilance department can also requ e st unblinded 
data as per the requirements for safety reporting.  
To ensure blinding, all IMP (placebo, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 m g capsules) are identical in size 
and appearance. In the event the capsules are opened in order to mix or dissolve the contents 
i
nto liquid or foodstuff, the excipient composition, texture, appearance, solubility, smell  and 
flavour are carefully matched to mask the identity of the capsule fill.  
The IMP will be blinded by means of treatment c ode lists. The IMP packages will also be 
blinded: The number of capsules per container, and all container parts will be identical and 
f
rom the same parts batches, the label batches will be the same and the label print will be 
completed on the same print station, and the position of the label will be applied consistently 
be
tween treatment groups as well.  
11.4. E
MERGENCY UNBLINDING  
As a double -blind, placebo- controlled study, both the patients and the Investigators are blinded 
to the IMP assignment.  
In addition, all personnel from the CRO  and KemPharm Denmark  A/S (except for personnel 
in Product Supply depar tment) , laboratory personnel , and others are blinded to the IMP 
assignment and will remain blinded until the data for the 12-month blinded phase of the study 
has been validated and  locked . 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 63 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  In case of emergency, where knowledge of the blind treatment may influence further care of 
the patient , the investigator may determine the patient’s treatment using IRT . It is strongly 
encouraged that un- blinding should only take place after consultation with the study Medical 
Monitor, CRO  or KemPharm Denmark  A/S, provided that this does not compromise patient 
safety. If a treatment code is revealed for any reason, the Investigator must notify the CRO  
immediately and a record will be kept of when it was revealed , by whom and why. If a blind is 
broken due to an AE  or serious adverse event  (SAE ), a corresponding AE entry must be 
completed in the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported as documented in Section 15.3.3.7. 
In the event of an emergency unblinding, the patient will be withdrawn (refer to Section  10.5). 
11.5. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  STABILITY DURING 
SHIPMENT  
The IMP (arimoclomol and placebo) will be shipped to the centers  and to patients’  homes at 
room temperature.  
11.6. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  ACCOUNTABILITY 
The Investigator (or pharmacist) is responsible for verifying accurate delivery of the IMP and 
acknowledging receipt of the IMP by signing (or initialling) and dating the document ation 
provided by or on behalf of Worldwide Clinical Trials  and returning it to Worldwide Clinical 
Trials . A copy will be retained for the Investigator Site File.  
The Investigator (or pharmacist) will maintain accountability records that must document all  
IMP received from the Sponsor, dispensed (as per the doses specified by the protocol/amendment[s]) to the patient, returned by the patient, and returned to the Sponsor (or alternative disposition of unused IMP) . In addition to this, the accountability records will 
document relevant information received by the Investigator (pharmacist) on the IMP shipped directly to the patients’ homes. Records should include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiration dates, and any unique code numbers assigned to the IMP  and/or patients. 
When IMP is shipped directly to the patient’s home, the confirmation of receipt will be documented via the tracking/documentation system of the courier supplying the IMP. 
Patients will be require d to return all unused IMP (and relevant packaging [used/empty blister 
packs  and used/empty bottles ]) to the site staff. The site staff should aim to follow up on the 
reasons for any missing IMP or other discrepancies noted after performing the relevant IM P 
accountability . 
IMP that has been dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re -dispensed for a 
different patient. Unused IMP must not be used for any purpose other than the present study. 
Patients should be instructed to return unused IMPs, preferably in their original packaging. 
The Worldwide Clinical Trials  Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will review the drug 
accountability forms and check all IMP returns  prior to making arrangements for their return 
to the Sponsor or authorising their destruction by the study site.

ADVERSE EVENTS
Any medication, w hich is considered necessary for the patient welfare, may be given at the 
discretion 
of the Investigator. Medications/therapies which should be administer ed as part of 
the study requirements are listed in Section 12.2. 
D
uring the study, patients will remain on their standard prescribed therapy (based on the choice 
of their treating physician), symptomatic medication (e.g.: corticosteroids, non- s teroidal anti-
inflammatories, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, etc .) , vitamins, minerals and food 
s
upplements.  
There is the potential that arimoclomol could inhibit the elimination of cationic drugs (e.g. 
c
imetidine, ranitidine and trimethoprim) that are significantly eliminated by renal tubular 
s
ecretion, so concomitant administration of such drugs with the IMP should be done under 
careful observation. 
Medications 
that are prohibited during the course of this study are listed in Section 12.3. 
If a pa t ie nt experience s a c linica l significa nt and/or una cceptabl e toxicity, an interruption in

12.1. RE
CORDING OF CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
All medications  administered during the study and medical procedures (including any 
unplanned diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures) ongoing at or starting after the time 
of written consent until the end of the extension phase of the study or patient withdrawal , must 
be reported in the appropriate section of the  case report form  (CRF)/ eCRF along with dosage 
information, dates of administration , frequency, route and reasons for use.  
12.2. MEDI CATIONS THAT MUST BE ADMINISTERED 
There is no mandatory therapy in this study. The patients should continue their standard therapy, which should remain unchanged as judged by the treating physician. Any changes to the patient ’s standard therapy should be recorded in the CRF/eCRF.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  15.2.4. Physi cal Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations during the study will include  the assessment of skin, head, neck, 
lymphatic, abdomen, respiratory, cardiovascular/peripheral vascular, central nervous and 
musculoskeletal systems as appropriate to determine general condition.  
Vital signs will include supine blood pressure, pulse rate, res piratory rate and temperature (ear). 
New or worsening clinically significant abnormalities will be reported as an AE.  
15.2.5. Electrocardiogram  
A twelve -lead ECG will be recorded over at least 10  seconds after the patient has rested supine 
on a bed for at least 5  minutes. The ECG report must be reviewed by the Investigator and any 
clinical ly relevant findings should be reported in the eCRF. Any new or worsening clinically 
significant abnormalities will be followed up with the patient and reported as an AE. 
15.3. ADVERSE E VENT REPORTING  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure compliance with reporting of AE s from his/her 
site. 
Safety data will b e collected from the time of  written informed consent and ends at the end of 
the extension phase of the study (main study), end of the study (paediatric substudy)  or patient 
withdrawal . All ongoing AEs and SAEs will be followed up until resolution, until the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained or until the patient is lost to follow up.  
Any AE (including an AE that leads to death) that occurs after the end of the extension phase 
of the study (main study) or end of the study (paediatric substudy), which the Investigator 
assesses as related to a study procedure and/or medicinal product, should also be reported as an AE or SAE.  
All A Es should be followed until they are resolved or a clinically- stable endpoint is reached if 
they are consi dered chronic.  
15.3.1. Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An AE can also refer to an untoward response to the administration of the IMP, but can also 
occur as a result of the protocol -required procedures or be unrelated to both and include 
worsening of pre-existing conditions, for example. 
AEs include the following: 
•Suspected adverse medication reactions;
•Reactions from medication overdose, abuse, sensitivity, or toxicity;
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 87 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  •Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre- existing illness;
•Injury or accidents;
Note: If a documented medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, only the accident 
should be reported as an AE;
•New or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical
examination as compared with previous assessments;
•Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal assessments (e.g. physical examination,vital signs, ECG) that require clinical inte rvention or further investigation (beyond
ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an alreadyreported clinical event.
15.3.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: 
•Results in death;
Note : Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. Event which led to death should be recorded 
with fatal outcome. In reports of death due to “Disease Progression”, where no other information is
provided, the death will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease under investigation.
All deaths occurring on the study or up to an including the end of the extension phase  of the study or
patient withdrawal must be reported.
•Is life -threatening;
A life -threatening event places  the patient at risk of death at the time of the even t. It does not refer to an
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).
•Requires inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization ;
Note : In general, h ospitalization  signifies that the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an
overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur duringhospitalization  are A Es. If a complication prolongs h ospitalization  or fulfils any other serious criteria,
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether other events meet the serious criteria, the event is to be
considered serious. When in doubt as to whether “ hospitalization ” occurred or was necessary, the AE
should be considered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not
considered an AE.
•Results in persist ent or significant disability/incapacity;
Note : The term “significant disability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, hospital, influenza, and accidental
trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
•Is a congenital anomaly/bir th defect;
•Is an important medical event(s) that may not be immediately life threatening or result
in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to
prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events are int ensive treatment in
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 88 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization ; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such instances. 
15.3.3. Recording and R eporting  of Adverse Events  
All A Es and SAEs, as defined above, encountered during the clinical study will be reported in 
the appropriate section of the CRF/ eCRF. Information will include the following: 
•Duration of the AE (onset/resolution dates);
•Relationship to the IMP (refer to Section  15.3.3.6);
•Severity (refer to Section  15.3.3.5);
•Concomitant therapy given (or other action taken);
•Action taken with respect to the IMP.
If an AE increases in severity it will be recorded as a new record with the same AE identifier.  
AE data should be obtained through observation of the patient, from any information 
volunteered by the patient (and the patient ’s parent[s]/legal guardian[s])  and through patient 
(and the patient ’s parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) questioning. The patien t may be asked “Do you 
have any health problems?” or “Have you had any health problems since your last site  visit?”  
15.3.3.1. Reporting of Signs and Symptoms versus a Diagnosis 
Recording a diagnosis (when possible) is preferred to record  a list of associated signs an d 
symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known but there are associated signs or symptoms not 
generally attributed to the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom must be recorded separately.  
15.3.3.2. Disease Progression  
Disease progression can be considered  as a worsening of a patient’s condition that is being 
studied. It may be reflected by an increase in the severity of the condition or an increase in the symptoms. Disease progression during the blinded phase of the study may result in the patient meeting the early escape clause and criteria (refer to Section  10.5.2). Disease progression and 
any events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should be recorded only in the CRF/ eCRF and should not be reported as an AE. 
15.3.3.3. Death  
All deaths that occur during the AE Reporting period (refer to Section 15.3.4) must be reported as follows: 
•Death due (or clearly due to) to disease progression should be documented in theCRF/eCRF  but should not be reported as an SAE;
•Death that is not due (or not clearly due) to disease progression should be documentedin the CRF/ eCRF and as a SAE within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the
event (refer to Section  15.3.3.7).
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 89 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  15.3.3.4.  Pregnancy 
Should a pregnancy occur in a female patient  or the partner of a male patient, it must be reported 
i
n accordance with the procedures described in Section  15.3.3.7 . Pregnancy in itself is not 
regarded as an AE.  
Female patients who become pre gnant during the study should be withdrawn (refer to 
Section  10.5.1). 
15.3.3.5. Definition of Se verity of Adverse Events 
Severity of any AE will be graded according to National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE 
V
ersion 4.03 (14 June 2010), where applicable. 
If an AE occurs that is not listed in the CTCAE, the Investigator will evaluate its severity 
using the definitions in Table 15-1. 
Ta
ble 15-1: Definition of Severity of Adverse Events  
Mild  Grade 1  – Does not interfere with patient’s usual function 
(awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated [acceptable]).  
Moderate  Grade 2  – Interferes to some extent with patient ’s usual function 
(enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity [disturbing]).  
Severe  Grade 3  – Interferes significantly with patient ’s usual function 
(incapacity to work or to do usual activities [unacceptable ]) 
Life Threatening  Grade 4  – Results in risk of death, organ damage, or permanent 
disability (unacceptable) 
Death  Grade 5  – Event has a fatal outcome 
Note:  Severe  is a measure of intensity whereas an event must meet one of the criteria for serious even ts listed in 
Section  15.3.2  to be considered serious ;  thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious  reaction. For example, 
a headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it m et one of the criteria for 
serious events listed in Section  15.3.2. An AE that is assessed as Grade  3 (severe) or Grade 4 (potentially life -
threaten ing) should not be confused with a SAE.  
15.3.3.6. Definition of Relationship of AEs to a Medicinal Product and/or Study Procedure 
The Investigator must assess the possible relationship between the AE and the IMP  and/or 
study procedure  and/or the patient’s underlying condition and record that assessment in the 
CRF/ eCRF. The Investigators is to make his/her own assessment of each SAE to be recorded 
on the CRF/ eCRF and on the SAE form. 
The Investigator should provide a Yes or No assessment as to whether there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the IMP  and/or study procedure. 
KemPharm Denmark  A/S will evaluate all SAE s with respect to seriousness, causality and 
expectedness. The expectedness of an S AE considered to be related to the IMP will be 
determined according to the IB . 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 90 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  The relationship should be assessed according to the criteria below: 
Definitely 
Related  AEs that are temporally linked and for which the study product is the 
most likely explanation, which disappear or decrease when not using study product and reappear when using study product 
Probably Related  AEs that are temporally linked and for which the study product is more 
likely to be the explanation than other causes, which may improve when not using study product 
Possibly Related  AEs that could equally well be explained by study product or other 
causes, which are usually temporally linked and may improve when not using study product but do not reappear when using study product 
Unlikely Related  AEs that may be temporally linked, but which are much more likely to 
be due to other causes than study product and which do not get worse with continuing use of product 
Not Related AEs that can be clearly explained by extraneous causes and for which 
there is no plausible association with study product, or AE s for which 
there is no temporal relationship 
15.3.3.7. S
AE Reporting Procedure for Investigators 
The Investigator must report (by fax, telephone or email) all initial and follow -up SAE reports 
to the safety vendor within 24 hours of awareness of an SAE. Please refer to the SAE Reporting 
Contact Details document.  
If
, for any reason, it is not possible  to complete all sections of the SAE form within 24  hours, 
transmission of the form must not be delayed,  and the outstanding information should be sent 
on a follow-up SAE form. In addition, the event must be documented in the CRF/eCRF.  
Information on SAEs will be recorded on a SAE form. Blank copies are included in the study Investigator’s File.  
This report should contain as much information as possible and must include an assessment of  
available information on seriousness, severity, cau sal relationship to the IMP or trial procedure, 
the action taken, the outcome to date, and a narrative description of the course of the event.  
Photocopies of the subject’s medical records should not be sent in lieu of completion of the  
SAE Form. Medical records, laboratory reports etc. should only be sent to the Safety vendor  
upon request. Importantly, when subject records are shared outside the site, all subject  
identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, shall be redacted on the copies of the  
medical records before submission.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  15.3.3.8. Follow-up SAE Reports 
For all SAEs where important or relevant information is missing, active follow -up should be 
undertaken. Investigators or other site personnel should inform  the safety vendor  of any follow -
up information on a previously reported SAE immediately but no later than 24 hours after they 
become aware of the SAE.  The follow -up information must be presented on an SAE form 
marked as follow -up. It is necessary only to provide the new information, with the SAE for m 
signed by an Investigator. 
The Investigator will ensure that all the necessary information is provided within the timelines 
stipulated by safety vendor when the request for information is made. 
Follow- up reports (as many as required) should be completed and faxed following the same 
procedure above. 
15.3.3.9. Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Independent Ethics Committee/ 
Institutional Review Board  
The Investigator is responsible for informing local Independent Ethics Committees  (IEC s)/ 
Institutional Review Board  (IRBs)  of the applicable safety reports in compliance with local 
regulations. Copies of all correspondence relating to reporting of any safety reports to the 
IEC/IRB  should be maintained in the Investigator’s Files and provided t o Worldwide Clinical 
Trials . 
The Sponsor, or its designee s, Worldwide Clinical Trials  or safety vendor , will inform 
Investigators, central IECs /IRBs  and regulatory authorities of applicable safety reports, as 
required . 
15.3.3.10. Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (SUSAR) is an SAE, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the reference safety information  (RSI) of the study drug in the IB 
and for which there is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with the study 
drug. 
The Sponsor shall ensure that all relevant information about SUSARs that are fatal or 
life-threatening is recorded and reported as soon as possible to the concerned authorities, 
central IECs/IRBs and Investigators, and in any case no later than seven days after knowledge by the Sponsor of such a case, and that relevant follow -up information is subsequently 
communicated within an additional eight days. 
All other SUSARs shall be reported to the concerned authorities, central IES/IRBs  and 
Investigators as soon as possible but within a maximum of fifteen days of first knowledge by 
the Sponsor. The Sponsor will report all SUSARs via the EudraVigilance Clinical Trials  (CT) Module or Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences  (CIOMS ) 
forms.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing local IECs/IRBs of the applicable safety reports in compliance with local regulations. Copies of all correspondence relating to reporting of any safety report s to the IEC/IRB should be maintained in the Investigator’s Files and provided to 
Worldwide Clinical Trials  for filing .

ALL A Es that occur  from the time  of written informed consent to the end of the extension 
phase of the study (main study), end of the study (paediatric substudy)  or patient withdrawal,  
will be recorded in the CRF/eCRF. All ongoing AEs and SAEs will be followed up until 
resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained or unt il the 
patient is lost to follow up.  
All new AE s or the worsening of any ongoing events from the time of informed consent will 
be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF/eCRF.  
All A Es experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be m onitored 
until the event has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or 
stabilised at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until the pa tient is lost to follow -up.  
Any untoward event that occurs after the AE reporting period but which the Investigator assesses as possibly related to  the IMP or  a study procedure should also be reported as an AE  
or SAE .

A punch skin biopsy is a short procedure ( 1-2 minutes)  to remove a small piece of skin tissue. 
Skin punch biopsies are usually done while the child is fully awake, although the area of skin 
where 
the biopsy is taken will be numbed. The punch skin biopsy instrument is gently 
inserted into your child’s skin, rotated and a small circle of skin is carefully removed (refer 
to Figure 18-2).

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  19. ASSESSMENTS OF OTHER ENDPOINTS
19.1. SPECIFICATION OF OTHER PARAM ETERS  
•Treatment failures;
•Change in use of NPC  medication ;
•Patient acceptability/palatability of the IMP .
19.2. METHODS AND TIMING  
The difference in number of treatment failures (defined as patients meeting early escape clause 
and criteria) at 12  months will be assessed.  
The change in use of NPC  medication (including miglustat therapy) will be assessed at 
12 months and at 18 months and at every 6  months thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 
60 months. 
The patient’s acceptability/palatability of the IMP will be assessed during the blinded phase 
study period using the hedonic scale at 7-14 days after the commencement of continuous 
dosing, 3, 6 and 12 months. The hedonic scale is a validated scale developed to test palatability 
of food ( Chen  et al. , 1996) and has been extensively used to assess palatability of flavoured 
medications ( Matsui , 2007). The patient (the patient’s parents[s]/legal guardians[s]) will be 
asked to use the hedonic scale to rate the palatability of the IMP based on the patient’s reaction 
to the IMP. 
Telephone follow up (monthly calls during the first 6  months of the blinded phase and every 
3-4 months following the start of the extension phase)  will include assessment of whether the
patient has experienced any difficulties in taking the IMP.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  20. EV ALUATION OF RESULTS
20.1. SAMPLE SIZE AND STU DY POWER 
No formal statistical calculation of sample size has been used.  
However, the following has been considered to try to ensure that a suitable number of patients 
will be recruited. I n the ASIS study (Protocol Number ASIS -001: A retrospective, non-
interventional study of the data of patients diagnosed with NPC  in order to confirm ASIS as a 
disease progression predictive model/tool) (15 patients) the mean rate of progression was 3.6 points per year and the SD  was 2.2. Assuming this SD , a study with 30 patients randomised 
to arimoclomol and 15 patients randomised to placebo has 80% power to detect a difference 
between arimoclomol and placebo of approximately 2 units on the NPCCSS at the 5% 
significance level.  This would be based on a simple two- sample  t-test. Use of covariates and a 
repeated measurements model is expected to improve the power/allow a smaller difference to be detected.   
20.2. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Statistical analyses will be performed by Larix A/S . Statistical analyses will be carried out 
using SAS
®, Version 9.3 or later, SAS Institute, Cary, Northern Carolina, United States of 
America ( USA).  
The statistical methods summarised below,  for the 12-month blinded phase study period and 
the extension phase of the study, will be described in detailed statistical analysis 
plan(s) (SAP [s]) which will be finalized prior to relevant database’s  lock. Any deviations from 
the planned analysis as described in the SAP (s) will be justified and recorded in the final 
clinical study report. 
20.2.1. General Considerations 
Descriptive analyses will be performed. Data will be summarised as follows: Continuous variables by descriptive statistics (number of patients  [N], mean, SD, minimum, median and 
maximum); categorical data by absolute and relative frequencies  (n and %). 
Unless indicated otherwise, summary statistics will be reported for observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed  for reporting summary statistics .  
Baseline is defined as the latest assessment prior to randomisation . If a baseline value is 
missing, no change from baseline will be calculated. 
20.2.2. Other Considerations  
For MCID, t he CGI -S and CGI -I will be used as an anchor to estimate a threshold for 
determining the point at which change on the NPCCSS is considered meaningful.  For both clinic ian assessments a 1 -categorical change (reduction in severity by 1- category and 
improvement by 1- category respectively) between baseline and end of treatment will be used 
to provide an estimate on each anchor. 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 101 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  20.2.3. Populations for Analysis 
Summaries will be presented for all patients who were entered into the study and assigned a 
patient study number. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all patients who are randomised and who have at least 
one post -baseline assessment of NPCCSS. This will be used as the primary analysis set for 
efficacy.  
A Per Protocol (PP) set will also be used to present efficacy data. This will include only patients 
who have taken at least 80% of their randomised medication up to the 6- month assessment, 
and have an assessment at 6  mont hs or beyond (it will exclude all patients with less than 
6 months of follow up data). The 80% of medication criterion will be reviewed and re -
confirmed at the time of the blind review of the database. Patients without a confirmed 
diagnosis of NPC , accordi ng to the study inclusion criteria, will also be excluded from the 
PP analysis set.  Patients who receive the wrong treatment in error will be excluded from these 
efficacy analyses.  
A Completers Ana lysis S et (CAS) will also be used to present efficacy data.  This will include 
only patients who have taken at least 80% of their randomised medication up to the 12-month assessment and have, as a minimum, assessments at baseline and at 12  months (+/ -8 weeks). 
Patients without a confirmed diagnosis of NPC , if any, will also be excluded from the CAS . 
Patients who receive the wrong treatment in error will be excluded from these efficacy analyses.  
•The safety set  will in
 clude all patients who receive any IMP, regardless of whether that
was their correct medication, or not. The safety set will be used for all safety analyses.
The precise details of how the safety data will  be presented for the under 12 -year olds will be 
described in the SAP .  
20.3. BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
The following demographic and baseline charac teristics will be summarised: 
•Demographics (date of birth, sex and race);
•Medical history (including concomitant diseases );
•NPC  disease history  (NPC -cdb disease history data)  including date of initial NPC
diagnosis, data of fillipin staining result  (if applicable ), cholestane triol/oxysterols (if
applicable), DNA disease confirmation (date, mutation/s), date of first NPC
symptom (s) (and description), history of neurological manifestations and past
treatments.
20.4. EVALUATION OF PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
The primary analysis is by a general linear mixed model for repeated measurements . The 
primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 12 months in the 5 domain NPCCSS. The 5 domain NPCCSS  score is derived as the sum of scores from the ambulation, speech, swal low, 
fine motor skills and cognition domains. 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 102 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  The model will be fitted with treatment, miglustat level and visit as fixed effects along with a 
treatment -by-visit interaction term. The estimated treatment effect will be taken from the 
treatment -by-visit interaction term at 12  months. 
The a
nalysis model is: 
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛽𝛽0∙𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0+𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖+𝑀𝑀𝑙𝑙+𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖+𝑇𝑇𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
where  
Yijk is the 5 domain NPCCSS endpoint for the jth patient of treatment group i  at visit k 
yij0 is the baseline value for the jth patient of treatment group i 
𝛽𝛽0 is the unknown fixed slope for the baseline covariate 
Ti is the unknown fixed effect of treatment i 
Ml is the unknown fixed effect of miglustat level l  
Vk is the unknown fixed effect of visit k  
TVik is the unknown fixed interaction effect of treatment i  and visit k  
sij is the effect associated with the jth patient of treatment i  
eijk is the error (residual) associated with the jth patient of treatment i at visit k  
sij and eijk are assumed to be independent from each other and follow a multivariate normal 
distribution. The covariance matrix for e  is chosen to be the unstructured variance -covariance 
matrix, it assumes pair -wise correlations are not constrained by the data.  
The estimated treatment effect is taken from the TV ik interaction term at Visit 6 (i.e. 12 months). 
Missing data will not be imputed for the primary endpoint analysis. If a baseline value is missing, no change from baseline will be calculated. 
The model allows for the calculation of the 95% confidence interval  (CI) for the treatment 
effect, and a P -value to test the null hypothesis that the effect of arimoclomol and placebo is 
the same. 
20.5. EVALUATION OF SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
Key Secondary Endpoints: 
•Responder analysis of patient’s CGI -I score remains stable or shows improvement at
12 months and descriptive summary of responder rate at 12 months.
•Responder analysis of patient’s 5 domain NPCCSS  score remains stable or improves
at 12 months and descriptive summary of responder rate at 12 months .
These will be analysed at 12  months using two- tailed chi -squared tests. If chi -squared 
conditions are not met, then a Fisher’s exact test will be used. A patient who discontinues 
before 12 months will be considered a non-responder. 
•Time to worsening (as defined by reaching the MCID on patient's 5 domain NPCCSS)

the PP set and the CAS. If chi -squared conditions are not met, then a Fisher’s exact test
will be used. A patient who discontinues before 6 months (or 12 months, as appropriate)will be considered a patient who has worsened. Change in full scale NPCCSS  score

domains) at 6  months.
•Change in Quality of Life (EQ 5D Y) at 6, 12  and 18 months and every 6  months
thereafter until End of Extension Phase at 60 months : The changes from baseline will
be simply compared by a Mann Whitney (independent samples) test and 95% CI at  each
of 6 and 12 months). Data from 18 months and every 6 months thereafter until End of

20.7. M
ISSING DATA AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES  
All reasons for missing data will be documented. 
Any patient with missing baseline NPCCSS data will have the median for all patients imputed. 
It is not expected that any patient will have this baseline missing.  
As a first anal ysis accounting for missing data, a multiple imputation approach will be taken, 
as follows: 
1.The missing values are filled in m  times to generate m complete data sets (using
SAS PROC MI).
This is done by fitting m  linear regression models using patients with observed values
for the endpoint and further covariates (these may be baseline covariates ormeasurements of the endpoint at earlier visits or others). Based on the fitted regressionmodel, a new regression model is simulated from the Bayesian posterior predictivedistribution of the regression parameters and is used to impute the missing values;
2. T he m complete datasets are analysed by using standard statistical procedures  (as
relevant for the specific endpoint);
3. T he results from the m analyses are combin ed for statistical infer ence (using
SAS PROC MIANALYZE).
The method described above assumes that the missing values are “missing at random” (MAR); 
that is, the probability that an observation is missing may depend on the observed  data, but not 
on the missing  data. This is particularly important to account for patients who progress quickly 
who need to jump to the “escape” section of the protocol and for whom their heightened disease severity will be recorded (and form the reason for them to jump to the escape therapy).  
As a second analysis accounting for missing data, a non- parametric approach will be taken, as 
follows: 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 106 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  1.Patients who withdraw early will be assig ned “worst” scores for their 12 -month
NPCCSS (i.e. worse than all patients, regardless of their treatment assignment) ;
2.Transformation of baseline and post -baseline values for all patients (regardless of
treatment groups) to standardized ranks ( i.e., ranks divided by the number of patients
ranked plus 1, mean ranks in case of ties);
3.Determination of residuals from the linear regression of the NPCCSS standardized
ranks on baseline NPCCSS standardized ranks;
4.Application of the two- sided Wilcoxon- Mann -Whitney test to these residuals. The
standardized test statistic with a continuity c orrection of 0.5 is asymptotically standard
normally distributed under the null hypothesis.
For the c linical global imp ression of severity (CGI -S) at 6 and 12  months, the cumulative 
distribution of total NPCCSS score s apart from hearing domains (probabilit y of attaining each 
score level, or worse) will be plotted, stratified by patients in each clinical global impression category and by treatment.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  21.2. REGULATORY BODY APPROVAL  
The study will not be started until Worldwide Clinical Trials  has received approval from 
relevant regulatory bodies. Worldwide Clinical Trials  will provide the Investigator with a copy 
of the relevant document on behalf of the Sponsor. 
21.3. INFORMED CONSENT AND SCREENING DATA 
PICDs (including patient assent as per local laws and regulations) will normally be based on a 
master document provided by CRO  or the study Sponsor and must be approved by the study 
Sponsor prior to submission to the IEC /IRB . The content of the PICD should re flect that 
described in Section  4.8.10 of the ICH Guidelines  and any local requirements e.g. IEC /IRB . 
Any changes requested by the  IEC/IRB  must be approved by study Sponsor  prior to the 
documents being used. A copy of the final, IEC /IRB -approved consent form must be submitted 
to the CRO  prior to initiation of this study. The Investigator should file the signed PICDs for 
review by Worldwide Clinical Trials  CRAs.  
Written informed consent (and assent as per local laws and regulations) will be obtained from each patient ( and/or their parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) prior to inclusion in the trial, and prior to 
any study- related assessments are performed, as described in Sections  10.1.  
21.4. CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENT VERIFICATION 
CRFs/ eCRFs of a design mutually agreed upon by the Sponsor and delegate(s)  will be supplied 
to the sites.  CRFs/ eCRFs are the sole property of KemPharm Denmark  A/S and should not be 
made available in any form to third parties, except for authorised representatives of appropriate Health/Regulatory Authorities, without written permission from KemPharm Denmark  A/S. 
A CRF/ eCRF is required an d should be completed for each included (consented) patient. The 
Investigator will be responsible for the accuracy of the data entered into the CRF/ eCRF. All 
data must be entered in  English and must be completed by designated study personnel . The 
completed  CRFs/ eCRFs must be reviewed, and ( electronically  for eCRFs ) signed/dated by the 
Investigator in a timely fashion.  If a change is made on any of the eForms /CRF pages  after the 
Investigator has signed that eForm /CRF , the Investigator must re-sign the eCRF /CRF. 
The relevant completed eForms must be available for review to designated Worldwide Clinical 
Trials  representatives at each scheduled monitoring visit. 
The Investigator will allow designated Worldwide Clinical Trials  representatives and 
regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs/eCRFs.  
Source documents (e.g., medical records, raw data collection forms, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, laboratory data) are the originals of any documents used by the Investigator or hospital/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
Source documents should be available to support all the data recorded in the CRF/ eCRF. The 
Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents. These documents are designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient included in this clinical trial.  
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 110 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  21.5. CONFIDENTIALITY 
Personal data of the patient shall be processed in a manner that ensures it has appropriate 
security.  This includes protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against 
accidental loss, destruction or damage and by using appropriate technical or organisational measures. One such measure is by the Investigator  ensuring that the patients’ pers onally 
identifiable information  is replaced through the use of pseudonymisation. 
On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to Worldwide Clinical Trials, patients will NOT be identified by their names but by the assigned patient number and their initials to  ensure 
confidentiality of the patients’  information and that data minimisation principles are 
maintained.  
If patient names are included in error on copies of documents submitted to Worldwide Clinical 
Trials , the names (except for initials) will be erased or securely destroyed and the assigned 
patient number added to the document. 
The Investigator should keep a separate log (Patient Master List) of patient’s codes (assigned 
patient number), names, addresses, telephone numbers and hospital numbers (if applic able).  
Documents not intended for submission to Worldwide Clinical Trials  (e.g. signed consent 
forms , completed Patient Master List, etc. ) should be maintained by the Investigator in strict 
confidence and not disclosed to any parties outside of this approved agreement.  eCRFs  should 
be protected by use of strong encryption. 
21.6. STAFF INFORMATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all personnel involved in the study are 
fully informed of all relevant aspects of the study, including detailed knowledge of and training in all procedures to be followed to allow collection of accurate, consistent, complete and 
reliable data.  
The Investigator will provide a list of delegated responsibility to Worldwide Clinical Trials , 
detailing the various study tasks to be performed by each member of his/her study staff. Each staff member should sign in agreement to their performing each of the tasks delegated to them on the list. Worldwide Clinical Trials  should ensure that the staff have  the required knowledge 
and training for the tasks delegated to them.  
21.7. ESSENTIAL DOCUMENT RETENTION  
All clinical information shall be recorded, handled and stored in such a way that it can be accurately reported, interpreted and verified, while ensuring confidentiality of the trial patients’ personal data. Documents that enable both the conduct of the clinical trial and the quality of the data produced to be evaluated; and show whether the trial is, or has been, conducted in accordance with ICH -GCP and appli cable regulatory requirements are considered essential 
documents. 
The Investigator will retain copies of all the essential documents (as defined by ICH -GCP) 
until at least 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region, and 
until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 
2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. The  
period of document retention is, however, also dependent on the applicable regulatory 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 111 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  requirements (e.g. EEC Directive 91/507 requires retention of patient codes for at least 15 years 
after the completion or discontinuation of a trial and retention of hospital records and other source data for the maximum time permitted by the institution where the study takes place). The Investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. 
The essential documents include: the signed protocol, copies of the completed CRFs/eCRFs, 
signed PICDs from all patients (and /or the patient ’s parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) who consented, 
hospital records and other source documents, IEC /IRB  approval and all related correspondence, 
including approved documents, and all other documentation included in the Investigator Site File. 
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor of the storage location of these essential documents and must contact the Sponsor before disposing of any. If the Investigator wishes to assign the files to someone else (e.g. if he/she ret ires) or to remove them to another location, the Sponsor 
Project Manager should be consulted about this change. 
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator in writing when these documents no longer need to 
be retained.

Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  22. STUDY MANAGEMENT
22.1. MONITORING  
Prior to stu dy commencement, the Investigator will be informed of the anticipated frequency 
of the monitoring visits. He/she will also receive a notification prior to each monitoring visit 
during the course of the study. It is expected that the Investigator and/or his /her 
Sub-i nvestigator(s) and other appropriate staff will be available on the day of the visit to discuss 
study conduct. Worldwide Clinical Trials  is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the 
clinical trial with regards protocol adherence and validity of the data recorded in the  
CRFs/eCRFs.  
A site initiation visit must  be conducted by the CRO  and the site must be activated prior to the 
commencement of any study activities requiring informed consent (i.e. any invasive screening tests).  
22.2. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
An independent audit of the study may be conducted during the study or after completion. The audit may be conducted by either Worldwide Clinical Trials  or the Sponsor’s Quality 
Assurance (QA) department or an independent auditor or a regulatory authority. 
22.2.1. Quality Control 
Quality Control (QC) is defined as the operational techniques and activities undertaken within the QA system to verify that the requirements for quality of the trial- related activities have been 
fulfilled.  
QC should be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly.  
22.2.2. Quality Assurance 
Quality Assurance  (QA)  is defined as the planned and systematic actions that are established 
to ensure that the trial is performed,  and the data are generated, documented (recorded) and 
reported in compliance with GCP  and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
22.2.3. Audit  
The Investigator will permit an audit mandated by the S ponsor after reasonable notice. The 
purpose of an audit is to confirm that the study is conducted as per protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, that the rights and well -being  of patients enrolled have been protected 
and that all data relevant for the evaluation of the IMP have been captured, processed and reported in compliance with the planned arrangements. The Investigator will permit direct 
access to all study doc uments, IMP accountability records, medical records and source data. 
The Investigator and his/her study team will also be available for discussion regarding study progress and procedures during the audit (both during the audit and at the end of the audit f or 
an “exit” discussion). 
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 113 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  22.3. DATA QUERY PROCESS  
Sites will enter the data from source documents into the eCRF /CRF  in timely manner and the 
data will be verified for missing data, inconsistencies, and for any necessary medical 
clarifications. Queries arising f rom these checks will be flagged within the eCRF  or by data 
clarification/query forms . The site staff will correct, confirm or clarify the data as appropriate. 
All possible attempts should be made by the site staff to resolve the queries within the request ed 
timeframes. If the site staff are unsure about the meaning of a query, or what data is required, then they should seek clarification from the Worldwide Clinical Trials  CRA assigned to their 
site. 
Once all data queries have been resolved, the study will be declared to be “clean”, and the eCRF will be locked ready for statistical analysis. After clean -file status has been achieved, 
Worldwide Clinical Trials  will provide copies of each patient’s eCRF to the Investigator for 
archiving. Copies of each patient ’s eCRF /CRF  will also be archived by the Worldwide Clinical 
Trials . 
The data management, data handling, and analysis will be conducted in accordance with good clinical, scientific and data management principles and in compliance with the Standard 
Operating  Procedures of the relevant KemPharm Denmark  A/S delegates . 
22.4. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS/AMENDMENTS  
The trial must be conducted in accordance with: 
•The protocol;
•Applicable regulatory requirement(s) or conditions linked to the approval(s) of thestudy;
•Applicable IEC /IRB  requirement or conditions linked to the approval(s) of the study;
•Any particulars or documents, other than the protocol, accompanying the regulatory orIEC/IRB  request or that application.
Any deviation from the protocol that has not been app rove
 d by KemPharm Denmark  A/S and 
the IEC/IRB  could result in a discontinuation from the  study at the site involved. Any 
amendment(s) to the protocol must be approved by both KemPharm Denmark  A/S and the 
IEC/IRB  which granted the original approval of the study prior to their implementation (unless 
only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial are involved).  All substantial amendments 
to the protocol must be approved by the applicable regulatory bodies prior to their implementation. 
However, in the event of any medical emergency, the Investigator is free to institute any 
me
dical procedure he/she deems appropriate. Such events and procedures must be promptly 
reported to the KemPharm Denmark  A/S and Worldwide Clinical Trials  representatives.

oConcomitant therapy  in cludes all medication and medical procedures (including any unplanned diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures) ongoing at or starting
after the time of written consent.
pAdverse events (AEs) :  ALL AEs which occur from the time of written informed consent to the end of t he extension phase  of the study or patient withdrawal,  will be
recorded in the eCRF.
qSingle dose arimoclomol administration : P atients less than 12 years of age  will initially receive a single oral dose of arimoclomol, followed by PK sampling.
rPK sampling : F or patients less than 12 years of age  only. PK sampling will be performed following a single dose of arimoclomol: pre -dose (immediately prior to
administration of the single dose of arimoclomol)  and 30  min (±5  min), 1  hour (±10  min), 2  hours (±10 min), 4  hours (±30 min) and 8 hours (±30 min) following
dosing.
The following information should be noted down:
1. The precise time of the blood sampling;
2. The precise time of the administration of food and liquid(s);
3. The type of liquid(s) administered;
4. The selected route for the single dose administration of arimoclomol including any type of liquid/soft foodstuff used for the  administration (as applicable).
The patient will be required to fast as follows:1. Food: At least 2 hours before the single dose administration and at least 2 hours following the single dose administration;
2. Liquids: Non -protein and non -fat liquids (e. g. juice) are allowed for up to 1 hour before the single dose administration and from 1 hour following the single
dose administration;
3. Water can be administered at any time during the PK procedure.
In the event that the patient requires a dose reductio n, the patient will be dispensed a further single dose of arimoclomol. Single dose PK evaluation will be performed 
following this single dose of arimoclomol in order to confirm the corresponding dose.  
Protocol CT -ORZY -NPC -002 Arimoclomol in Niemann -Pick disease type C  Page 127 of 173 
Final Version 1 1.0; 21-Jun-2022 CONFIDENTIAL  Should further dose adjustments be required based on t he single dose PK evaluation, the above procedure will be repeated . 
In the event that unexpected PK -profiles are obtained which are clinical significant and could potentially impact the safety of the patient (e.g. risk of acc umulation), 
the independent assessor can recommend additional PK sampling to be performed. If agreed by the Sponsor’s medical responsible person and the Principal Investigator, 
up to a maximum of 6 additional samples (corresponding to the full PK analysis set) can be taken at a subsequent visit prior to randomisation.  
sRandomisation  f or patients less than 12 years of age will take place following confirmation of the selected dose scheme after PK analysis.
tIMP dispensing and administration f or patients less than 12  years of age: Follow ing confirmation of the corresponding dose, IMP (arimoclomol or placebo, as per 
the study randomisation) will be shipped to the patient, who will commence dosing upon receipt of it.  
If required, the IMP can be dissolved in 10 mL (i.e. 2 teaspoons) of liquid or in a tablespoon of soft foodstuff. In the dissolved or dispersed state, the IMP  can also be 
administered via a gastric tube (as applicable).   
The patient’s weight should be measured at each visit and the IMP dose should be adjusted as required and IMP dispensed as relevant.  
During the blinded phase of the study, patients will be dispensed enough IMP for treatment as per the study flow chart.  
$In the event that the IMP (arimoclomol or placebo, as per the study randomisation) is shipped to the patient, the investigator will contact the patient (or patient’s 
parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) by telephone within 1 week following randomisation to confirm that the IMP has been received, the date that the patient has commenced 
IMP dosing and whether the patient has experienced any diffic ulties in taking the IMP.  
*The patient will be dispensed with sufficient arimoclomol at Visit 6 to continue treatment  (for patients who have not withdrawn from the study).
Early Escape Criteria Met: Should a patient meet the early escape clause and criteria, the patient should be offered  and dispensed treatment with arimoclomol. The 
patient should continue with their current  protocol schedule.  
IMP return:  Patients will be required to return all unused IMP (and relevant packaging [ used/ empty blister packs]) to the site staff. The site staff should aim to follow 
up on the reasons for any missing IMP or other discrepancies noted after performing the relevant IMP accountability.  
uPOP P K Sampling : POP PK sampling will be performed for all patients  as follows:
•V isits  3 & 5 : 3 hours (± 1 hour) following dosing.
•Visits  4 & 6 : 1.5 hours  (±30  min) , 3 hours (±30  min)  and 4.5-6 hours following dosing.  Note: The last POP PK sample should be taken as late as possible but
always before the subsequent dose of IMP .
v Patient Acceptability/Palatability : Refer to the hedonic scale template provided for use in the study.  
w Visit  2 will take place 7 -14 days after the patient has commenced taking the IMP t.i.d.  (continuous treatment). For patients less than 12 years of age, continuous 
treatment will commence following confirmation of the corresponding selected dose scheme.
xEnd of Blinded P hase  (Visit  6): The end of blinded phase  visit (Visit 6) should take place 12 months (±4  weeks) after randomisation  or within 4  weeks of patient 
withdrawal during the blinded phase . Withdrawal from study : Should a patient discontinue prematurely and choose to withdraw from the study during the blinded 
phase , all effort should be made to have the patient attend the site for the end of blinded phase  visit (Visit 6) within 4  weeks of patient withdrawal . Should the patient 
(or the patient's parent[s]/legal guardian[s]) refuse to attend the end of blinded phase  visit (Visit 6), the date and reason for study discontinuation (if known)  will be 
recorded in the eCRF as a minimum.  
yUnscheduled visit : T he patient may attend the site for unscheduled visits should the patient experience an unacceptable rate of progression or should there be any 
safety concerns. IMP dispensing and return will take place in the event that a patient meets the early escape clause and  criteria  or a dose reduction has occurred.

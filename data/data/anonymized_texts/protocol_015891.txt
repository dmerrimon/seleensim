1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background Information  
 
The current commercially available mechanical mitral valves range in sizes from 16mm to 37mm.  The mitral annulus in young pediatric patients can range from 12mm  to 30mm with a 
mean of 18mm .
1    A mitral valve annulus will typically require a sewing diameter of 
approximately 2mm larger than the valve size.  As a 16mm valve is currently the smallest 
diameter valve on the market there is a portion of the pediatric population that would benefit 
from the availability of a smaller diameter valve.    
 
Evidence exists to suggest that oversized valves are associated with increased mortality and 
morbidity rates particularly in the very young patient population.1-4   A small  mitral annulus can 
rarely be enlarged to accept a prosthesis larger than its diameter.5   Intraoperative problems 
associated with implantation of a mitral prosthesis too large for the size of the annulus include 
damage to the conductive system, obstructio n of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), 
impairment of valve mobility, and damage to the left circumflex artery.2,6   The need for 
pacemaker insertion after mitral valve replacement due to interruption of the conduction 
system of the heart has been estimated at 5 -16%.1,3-7  Mismatch of the  annulus size and the 
prosthesis can also lead to mitral stenosis necessitating a second valve replacement 
procedure.5,8,9 
 
1.2 Disease to be Treated  
 
Mitral valve disease can be the result of congenital valve anomalies such as mitral stenosis, mitral insufficiency and complete or partial atrioventricular canal.  Other causes of mitral valve 
disease include endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, and mitr al insufficiency associated with 
Marfan syndrome .
5,10   Approximately half of pediatric patients requiring mitral valve 
replacement have previously had valvuloplasty or valvulotomy to repair the diseased valve.4-
7,10,11 
 
1.3 Current Treatment Options  
 
Surgica l reconstruction to repair the mitral valve is the optimal treatment in the pediatric 
population.  Surgical repair can in some cases eliminate the need for future mitral valve 
replacement and in other cases postpone it.2,4,7,11   The pulmonary autograft tec hnique 
described by Ross and Yacoub and modified by Kabbani has shown promise in those patients 
with mitral  valves that have an effective orifice area of at least 3cm2.5,7 
 When the mitral valve cannot be repaired surgically the only remaining treatment option is replacement with a prosthetic valve.
7   A second and sometime s third valve replacement after 
initial mitral valve replacement is expected in the very young pediatric population.  The rate of mitral valve re -operation reported in the literature for patients younger than five years of age is 
approximately 40%.
4,7,10,11

Mechanical valves are generally chosen over bioprosthesic valves when a very small size is 
required because they exhibit better hemodynamic characteristics than bioprostheses.5   Valve 
replacement with allografts and xenografts are reported to show po or durability in pediatric 
patients.5   In addition, the rate of premature calcification observed with bioprostheses appears 
to be high in this population.2,7,8,11  
 
2 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
 
2.1 Device Name 
 
SJMTM Master s HPTM 15mm Rotatable Mechanical Heart Valve (15mm MHV) .    
 2.2 Device Description  
 
The investigational  device is a 15mm, rotatable, bileaflet  mechanical heart valve designed for 
implantation in the mitral p osition. This valve is part of t he SJM
TM Masters HPTM Series product 
line.  The Hemodynamic Plus (HP)  model has been designed to maximize  effective orifice area.  
This is made possible by rem oving the sewing cuff from the annulus.   
 
2.3 Intended Use  
 The 15mm MHV is intended for use as a replacement mitral valve in patients five years or less 
of age with a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning mitral valve.  This device may also be used 
to replace a previously implanted prosthetic mitral heart valve.     
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
The study  is a single arm, prospective, non- randomized, multi -center clinical investigation .   
 
3.1 Study Duration  
 
Each enrolled  subject will be assessed at baseline, procedure, post -procedure, 30 days, six 
months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for as long as the valve remains implanted.  Each 
enrolled subject will be followed for five years from the date of implant, until subject withdrawal, or until study closure, whichever occurs earliest.  
 4 STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE  
 
4.1 Purpose  
 
The purpose of th e study  is to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness to support a 
supplement to the St. Jude Medical Master s Series PMA (P810002) for approval of the 15mm 
MHV.    
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Pa ge 7 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
 
The rationale for this study  is to offer a replacement mitral valve for patients with anatomy  that 
is too small for the currently commercially  available valves ranging in size from 16mm to 37mm.  
 
4.2 Objective  
 
The objective  of this study  is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 15mm MHV in subjects 
five years or less of age with a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning mitral heart valve.  The 
objective will be evaluated by assessing  valve -related adverse events , subject  survival, subject  
growth , and echocardiogram assessment of hemodynamic  function through the five year follow -
up visit as long as the valve remains implanted .   
  
5 ENDPOINTS  
 
5.1 Primary Safety Endpoint  
 
The primary safety endpoint for this study is the actuarial ( Kaplan -Meier ) rate of total valve -
related adverse events experienced through 365 days post implant  or until the valve is 
removed/replaced due to anatomical growth of the subject, whichever occurs first .  Valve -
related adverse events to be evaluated are:  
• Death  
• Endocarditis   
• Hemorrhage (whether or not due to anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication) [all and 
serious]  
• Nonstructural dysfunction (including perivalvular leak [all and serious], hemolysis, and hemolytic anemia)  
• Reoperation  (including valve explant, not due to anatomical growth of the subject) [all 
and valve -related]  
• Structural valve deterioration   
• Thromboemb olism  
• Valvular  thrombosis  
 5.2 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint s 
 The primary effectiveness endpoint s in this study  include the following:  
1. Survival at 12 months post implant or survival until the valve is removed/ replaced due 
to anatomical growth  of the subject, whichever occurs first .   
2. Peak gradient  as assessed by echocardiography at  12 months post implant or when the 
valve is removed/replaced  due to anatomical growth of the subject , whichever occurs 
first.   
3. Mean gradient as assessed by echocar diography at 12 months post implant or when the 
valve is removed/replaced  due to anatomical growth of the subject , whichever occurs 
first.  
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Pa ge 8 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
4. Valvular  regurgitation as assessed by echocardiography at  12 months post implant or 
when the valve is removed/replaced  due to anatomical growth of the subject , 
whichever occurs first.   
 
5.3 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
 
The secondary effectiveness endpoints include the following:  
1. Increase in percentile ranking on the CDC growth chart  for height at 12 months  post 
implant or until the valve is removed/replaced due to anatomical growth of the subject , 
whichever occurs first, compared to baseline . 
2. Increase in percentile ranking on the CDC growth chart  for weight at 12 months  post 
implant or until the valve is removed/replaced due to anatomical growth of the subject , 
whichever occurs first,  compared to baseline . 
 
CDC growth charts are provided in Appe ndix 3 .  
 6 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 
6.1 Statistical Analysis and Reporting  
 Kaplan -Meier adverse event rates with 95% confidence intervals and early rates will be 
calculated for all safety and survival endpoints.   
 
 Hemodynamic function will also be evaluated at each visit for each of the following variables : 
• Mean pressure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Peak pressure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Cardiac output  
• Cardiac index  
• Valvular regurgitation  (and the site, as appropriate)  
 7 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
 7.1 Potential Benefits  
 
Replacement of a diseased mitral valve with the 15mm MHV may improve hemodynamic 
function of the valve thereby providing the opportunity for improved physical growth and development.  An additional potential benefit of receiving an appropriately sized mitr al valve 
replacement is avoidance of complications associated with implantation of a mitral prosthesis 
too large for the size of the annulus which may include damage to the conductive system, 
obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), impair ment of valve mobility, and 
damage to the left circumflex artery.  
 
7.2 Potential Risks  
 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Pa ge 9 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
Potential risks of receiving a mechanical mitral valve include:  
• The need for a second valve replacement due to either dehiscence, valve failure or 
malfunction, development of mitral stenosis, unacceptable hemodynamic status or 
eventual somatic outgrowth.  
• Heart failure requiring cardiac transplant.  
• Cardiac arrhythmia with or without the need of pacemaker implantation.  
• Hemolysis potentially resulting in anemia with or without splenomegaly and/or 
development of cholelithiasis.  
• Infection including but not limited to endocarditis, myocarditis, cellulitis and/or 
septicemia . 
• Thromboembolism or hemorrhage causing stroke, myocardial infarction or other significant impairment.  
• Obstruction or distortion of adjacent cardiac structures.  
 
All of the identified risks have the potential to result in death.  The mortality rate reporte d for 
mitral valve replacement in the pediatric population is highly variable and ranges between 
approximately 5 and 30%.
3,7,12- 15    
 
7.3 Risk Minimization  
 
Risks will be minimized by selecting Investigator s that:  
• Have experience implanting mechanical mitral valves in patients under the age of 
five. 
• Appreciate the need for closely monitoring and managing anti-coagulation regimens.  
• Are willing to partner with the subject’s personal cardiologist to ensure appropriate 
care and follow -up.

9.3 Baseline  
 
Obtain written informed consent from the subject’s legally authorized representative prior to 
conducting any study -related testing that is not considered standard of care for valve 
procedures.  All baseline tests must occur prior to the procedure.  It is pr eferable if the tes ting is 
completed no more than one  month prior to the procedure date.    
 
The following baseline assessments are required:  
• Medical h istory    
• Physical exam  
• Transthoracic echocardiogram  
• Blood collection (Plasma free hemoglobin for Hemolysis evaluation). Spot urine urobilinogen is an acceptable alternative if a non- hemolyzed blood sample cannot 
be obtained.   
• Anticoagula nt/antiplatelet  medication collection  
 For Adjunctive EU/CU S ubjects, baseline assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment . 
 9.4 Procedure  
 
The 15mm MHV is implanted surgically  pursuant to the Instructions for Use .   
 
The following assessments are required at the time of the procedure:  
• Anti coagula nt/antiplatelet  medication collection  
• Adverse event collection  
 For Adjunctive EU/CU S ubjects, procedure assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for procedures  conducted prior to enrollment . 
 
9.5 Post -Procedure  
 
If the subject does not have the 15mm MHV implanted the subject should be discontinued from 
the study and followed per the physician’s standard of care.  
 As there are insufficient data to indicate otherwise, the sponsor recommends that subjects 
implanted with the 15mm MHV be routinely maintained on anticoagulants unless, for other reasons, it is not medically indicated.   
 
The following assessments are required after the  enrolled  subject leaves the surgical suite  with 
the valve implanted. These assessments must be completed at least 24 hours after the 
procedure:   
• Physical exam  
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 14 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
• Transthoracic echocardio gram  
• Blood collection  (Plasma free hemoglobin  for Hemolysis evaluation ). Spot urine 
urobilinogen is an acceptable alternative if a non- hemolyzed blood sample cannot 
be obtained.   
• Anticoagula nt/antiplatelet  medication collection  
• Adverse event collection  
• Adverse event follow up  
 
For Adjunctive  EU/CU S ubjects, post -procedure assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment . 
 9.6 Post -Procedure Anticoagulation Recommendation  
 
As there are insufficient data to indicate otherwise, the sponsor recommends that patients 
implanted with the 15mm MHV be routinely maintained on anticoagulants to avoid the risk of 
thrombus formation and thromboembolic complications , unless it is not medi cally indicated.  
 
The recommended anticoagulation therapy for patients implanted with the 15mm MHV are 
based on the 2013 AHA Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Thro mbosis in Pediatric 
Patients24 in combination with experience from subjects previously enrolled in this study . 
 
Acceptable forms of anticoagulants include intravenous unfractionated heparin or oral warfarin.  When using warfarin the recommended target INR is 2.5 to 3.5 for valves impla nted 
in the mitral position in the absence of risk factors for thrombus formation.  In the presence of 
risk factors consider using a higher target INR or adding aspirin to therapeutic warfarin.   Risk 
factors include first 3 months post -implant, younger age  (< 6 months), small size (<6 kg), low 
flow state, unreliable oral intake, previous thromboembolism, and hypercoagulable condition.  Home INR monitoring may be associated with a reduced rate of complications .  Use of low 
molecular weight heparin may be ass ociated with an increased rate of complications  based on 
input from HALO IDE investigators . 
 In patients receiving warfarin, the INR should be monitored daily until therapeutic levels are achieved, and then may be decreased in frequency when stable with a minimum of monthly 
testing.  The INR should be tested whenever there is illness or with any changes in medication 
or diet.  
 
The final choice for anticoagulation therapy is left to the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
 
9.7 Additional Follow -up 
 Protocol required follow -up visits should be completed by the Investigator .  To aid in subject 
follow -up compliance, subjects can return to their primary cardiologist for follow up visits but 
data must be obtained by the Investigator  for review and submiss ion to the Sponsor .  
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 15 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
Investigators should inform cardiologists of all required follow -up tests prior to the visit and 
every effort should be made to obtain complete tests results with all required data points after 
the visit occurs.  Protocol deviations wi ll be required for all missed testing (refer to section 
17.2.5 Protocol Compliance).  
 
The following assessments are required at follow -up visits at the intervals noted on the 
assessment schedule in section 9.3 for all enrolled subjects that have the valve implanted:  
• Physical exam  
• Transthoracic echocardiogram  
• Blood collection (Plasma free hemoglobin for Hemolysis evaluation) . Spot urine 
urobilinoge n is an acceptable alternative if a non -hemolyzed blood sample cannot 
be obtained.   
• Anticoagula nt/antiplatelet  medication collection  
• Adverse event collection  
• Adverse event follow -up 
  
For Adjunctive EU/CU S ubjects, additional assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment . 
 10 Discontinuation  
 
Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled .  
Withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize the  subject’s future medical care or relationship 
with an Investigator .  All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subject in the clinical 
study until study completion.  Subjects will be asked what the reason for 
termination/withdrawal is but have the right not to answer.   
 
The Principal Investigator may also with draw a subject from the study at any time if he/she 
believes it is in the subject’s best interest.   
 
 
11 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY PROCEDURES  
 
Hemodynamic function will be evaluated by calculating the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for each of the following variables : 
• Mean pressure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Peak pr essure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Cardiac output  
• Cardiac index  
• Valvular regurgitation  
 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 16 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) examinations are required for each subject at baseline, 
post -procedure, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for as long as the valve 
remains implanted.   
 
The study specifies TTE rather than transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to minimize 
subject risk.  Echocardiographic data collected from TEE warranted for any other medical 
purpose is allowed.     For Adjunctive EU/CU Subjects, echocardiograms should be collected from subject’s medical 
records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment .  Additionally, 
echocardiograms should be collected even if any echocardiographic a ssessments occurred 
outside of a specified visit window as they may be used as supporting source documentation on 
the subject.  
 
CDs of the echocardiography  exams from  each required visit will be forwarded to the 
echocardiography core lab oratory (core lab)  for interpretation.  The primary responsibility  of 
the core lab is to provide consistent interpretation of TTE data across all study site s by 
completing the TTE Case Report Form (CRF) .   
 The sponsor will use only the measurements fr om the core lab for analysis.  If the core lab 
determines the echocardiogram is unreadable, the subject may be asked to return for another echocardiogram.   
 
12 BLOOD COLLECTION  
 
Plasma free hemoglobin wi ll be collected and analyzed for hemolysis at baseline, post -
procedure, 30 days, six months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for five years as long as the 
valve remains implanted.   Spot urine urobilinogen is an acceptable alternative if a non-
hemolyzed blood sample cannot be obtained.   
 
13 DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES  
 
13.1 Data Entry and CRF Submission  
 All required data will be recorded on standardized specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).     
 
14 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE HANDLING  
 
The sponsor will control the availability of the study valve  by shipping valves  only to qualified 
study  Investigator s who have IRB  and sponsor  approval.   The sponsor will keep records that 
indicate the destination and date of shipment.   Study v alves  are not transferab le between 
Investigator s unless prior written approval is obtained from t he sponsor . 
 
 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 17 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
14.1 Accountability  
 
Upon receipt of the 15mm MHV , Investigator s will maintain the following accurate, complete, 
and current records relating to device accountability (21 CFR 812.140 (2)):  
 
Records of receipt, use or disposition of study valves  including:  
• Type and quantity  
• Date of receipt  
• Location  
• Expiration dat e 
• Serial number  
• Names of all persons who received, used or disposed of each unit, and 
• Why and how many units of the study valve  have been used, returned to the 
Sponsor , repaired, or otherwise disposed of.  
 
All study valves  must be accounted for on the Device Disposition Report even if they are not 
used.  
 
14.2 Storage  
 
The sponsor requires that all study valves  be stored according to the labeling, in a secure area 
to prevent unauthorized access or use.  The study site will prevent use of the investigational 
product for non- investigational procedures.   
 
14.3 Returns  
 
Valves  which are expiring, not successfully implanted or are explanted should be returned to 
the sponsor .  All unused 15mm MHV product  must be returned to the sponsor at the 
completion of the study.   
 
Prior to returning study valves , contact the sponsor clinical  study team to obtain a r eturn 
number.  Communicate the serial numbers for all valves being returned.  After the return 
number is received, update the applicable Device Disposition Report(s) with the new 
disposition of the valve, reason for return, and return number.  Send a copy of the updated 
report to the clinical study team by email .  Keep the original for your records.   
 
Ensure all opened product is clearly identified.  If possible, return the valve in its original 
packaging and include all components (e.g. valve holder).  Include  a copy of the D evice 
Disposition Report (s) with the items being returned.  Write the return  number on the outside of 
the package and ship to  the address provided with the return number.

15 SAFETY  
 
Safety will be evaluated through the analysis  of adverse events related to th e 15mm MHV.   All 
valve -related adverse events will be collected and adjudicated by the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB)  in accordance with Akins et al.25  
 
15.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
 Adverse Event:  
 An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable clinical occurrence that is a negative change from baseline.   
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) : 
 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the Investigation al Plan  including a supplementary 
plan or application); or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects ( 21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
 
Serious Adverse Event:  
 
Serious adverse events will  be defined as those adverse events resulting in the following; death, 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospital 
stay, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or medically significant event.  
   
Non- serious Adverse Event:  
 
Non -serious adverse events will be defined as those events requiring health care professional 
directed medical intervention but that are not life threatening, and are not likely to have long -
term (> 6 months) sequelae, and do no t require long term (> 6 months) therapy.  
  
Anticipated Adverse Event s: 
 Complications associated with replacement mechanical heart valves include, but are not limited to: 
• hemolysis ;

15.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
15.2.1  Timeline for reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than 
outlined below.  
Clinical Site  Reporting timelines  
All Sites  SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor no later than 3 calendar days  from 
the day the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the 
investigative site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent 
than those outlined.  
 
The date the site staff became aware the event met the criteria of an SAE must be recorded in 
the source document.  The Investigator will further report the SAE to the local IRB according to 
the institution’s IRB reporting requirements.  
15.2.2  Reporting Valve -Related Adverse Events  
 
Safety surveillance within this trial (and the safety reporting performed by the investigator) 
starts : 
• as soon as the subject is enrolled for Pivotal IDE subjects  enrolled under protocol 
revision A or B . 
• as soon as the subject is enrolled for Adjunctive P rospecti ve Subjects . 
• from  the time of attempted initial  implant  (defined as the device physically 
contacting the subject’s cardiac anatomy)  for enrolled Adjunctive EU/CU Subjects .   
 
Safety surveillance and safety reporting will continue until the last study visit has been 
performed, or the subject is deceased, or the subject concludes participation in the trial.  
Invest igators are responsible for promptly reporting , as soon as they become aware,  all serious 
and non- serious valve -related adverse events as specified in Akins et al.25 to the sponsor by 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 20 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
completing the A dverse Event  CRF. Serious adverse events should be reported as specified in 
Section 15.2.1.   Reportable events include:  
• Death  
• Endocarditis  
• Hemorrhage  (whether or not due to anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication)  
• Nonstructural dysfunction (including perivalvular leak, hemolysis, and hemolytic 
anemia)  
• Reoperation (including valve explant, not due to anatomical growth of the subject)  
• Structural valve dete rioration  
• Thromboembolism (valve -related)  
• Valv ular thrombosis  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect s (UADEs)  
 
Refer to Appendix 11 for definitions of all reportable valve -related adverse  events.  All 
unresolved adverse events should be followed by the Investigator  until resolution.   Updates to 
adverse events should be provided to the sponsor by completing the AE  Follow -Up CRF.     
 
The sponsor may request that additional information such as operative notes, clinic notes, 
discharge summaries, histopathology reports, or a physician’s summary of the event be 
provided to the sponsor as supporting documentation for all reported events.    
 
15.2.3  Reporting Unan ticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
An Investigator  shall submit to the s ponsor  and the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated 
adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later 
than ten (10) working days after the Investigator  first learns of the effect (21 CFR 812.150 (a) 
(1)).  
 
15.2.4  Reporting Deaths  
 
An Investigator  shall submit to the sponsor a report of any death occurring during the  study  as 
soon as possible  without undue delay .  All deaths will be reported by the sponsor to the FDA 
within ten (10) working days of becoming aware of the death.  
 
 
Send all source documents to the sponsor clinical study team via email.   
 
15.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
 An independent DSMB will be  formed to regularly review study  progress with regard to safety.  
At a minimum, the DSMB will meet semi -annually.  Members of the DSMB will have no 
affiliation with the HALO  Clinical Study .   
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 21 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
 
A DSMB Manual of Operations will be developed and agreed upon by the sponsor and DSMB 
members prior to  initiation of the trial .  The manual will describe the specific funct ions of the 
DSMB.  The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to:  
• Establish adverse event definitions (and refine definitions as necessary during the conduct of the clinical study ) 
• The DSMB will act as a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) to adjudicate whet her or not 
adverse  events are valve -related and determine the severity of the events  
• Review and validate the subject sample (i.e., review inclusion/exclusion deviations and other protocol deviations)  
• Provide oversight for issues affecting general subject welfare  
• Establish study termination guideline criteria  
• Recommend premature study  termination  
 At any time during the course of the study , the DSMB may offer opinions or make formal 
recommendations concerning aspects of the study  that impact subject safety (e.g., safety -
related protocol changes or input regarding adverse event rates associated with the investigational study ).  Additionally,  the DSMB may act as an advisory panel for questions 
regarding informed consent, subject enrollment, protocol implementation, study  endpoints, 
data discrepancies, and other issues that may present during the course of the study .  
 The DSMB will review all adverse events reported by the site and determine the following: 
adverse event type, relatedness to the procedure or device (if known), and whether the event 
is anticipated or unanticipated.  Following each DSMB meeting a report will be sent to 
Investigato rs indicating the final adjudication of all adverse events reviewed during the 
meeting.  
 
In all reports to the FDA adverse events will be pulled from the DSMB adjudication unless the 
adverse event has not been adjudicated, as noted in the report.  
 
16 CONFIDE NTIALITY  
 
All subject information collected during the course of this study will be kept confidential  
according to applicable state and federal laws and regulations.   The FDA or other US government agencies (including regulatory agencies) and regulatory authorities in other countries may inspect and copy subject records or other information about 
subjects rel ated to this study.   
 
Any information about subjects that leaves the institution conducting the study will be modified 
to remove certain information that could identify the subject (e.g., subject’s name, age on the 
day of enrollment, address, and hospital  number) and only be identifiable by a s ubject  ID code.

Investigational Plan , the applicable regulations or any conditions of approval imposed by 
the reviewing IRB or FDA (21 CFR 812.46 (a)).  Depending on the severity and/or trend in 
non-compliance, the Investigator  may receive a formal warning or re -training through a 
site visit  or conference call.   
 
17.2.2.1  Deviations to the Investigational Plan 
 
A deviation is used to describe a situation in which the Investigational Plan  was not 
followed.  Deviations may be identified at the site or by in- house sponsor  personnel, 
and will be recorded on the Deviation CRF.  The site is responsible for notifying their 
IRB and pro viding IRB notification to the sponsor , if applicable.  
 
17.2.2.2  Emergency Deviations  from the Investigational Plan 
 
If a deviation from the Investigational Plan  is necessary to protect the life or physical 
well -being of a subje ct in an emergency, the Investigator  must notify the sponsor and 
the appropriate IRB within five (5) working days.  For all other changes in, or 
deviations from the Investigational Plan , prior written approval from the sponsor and 
the IRB is required.  
 
The FDA and IRB will be notified if the  deviation affects the scientific soundness of the 
Investigational Plan .

Appendix 11: Adverse Event  Definitions  
 
Listed below are guidelines for uniform reporting of adverse events related to the study valve.  The definitions and categorization of event types are consistent with those recommended by Akins et al .
25  The DSMB will review and adjudicate adverse events a ccording to these reporting 
guidelines.   
 
Death  
 All deaths will be reported and categorized as either ‘valve related’, ‘other cardiac related’, or ‘other cause’ as defined below.   
 
Valve -Related : 
 
Death due to any of the following events involving the study valve: structural valvular 
deterioration, nonstructural dysfunction, valve thrombosis, embolism, bleeding event, endocarditis, or reintervention .  Sudden, unexplained deaths of which the cause or  
relationship has not been determined by clinical investigation or autopsy findings are considered valve related .   
 
Other Cardiac : 
 Death resulting from cardiac causes, excluding valve -related death .  Examples include 
congestive heart failure, acute myoca rdial infarction, and documented fatal arrhythmias.  
 
Other Cause : 
 
Death due to any cause, excluding valve -related mortality or other cardiac death . 
 
Endocarditis  
 
Any infection involving the study valve  that is diagnos ed according to Modified Duke Criteria26 
for endocarditis  will be reported.  Modified Duke Criteria are defined as follows:   
 
1. Definite Infective Endocarditis  
 Definite infective endocarditis is defined by pathologic criteria or clinical criteria as 
defined below.  The presence of both pathologic and clinical criteria is not necessary to 
meet the definition of definite infective endocarditis.   
 
a. Pathologic Criter ia 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 39 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
i. Microorganisms demonstrated by culture or histologic examination of a 
vegetation, a vegetation that has embolized, or an intracardiac abscess 
specimen; or 
ii. Pathologic lesions; vegetation or intracardiac abscess confirmed by 
histologic examination showing  active endocarditis  
 
b. Clinical Criteria  
i. 2 major * criteria; or  
ii. 1 major * criterion and 3 minor ** criteria; or  
iii. 5 minor ** criteria  
 
2. Possible Infective Endocarditis  
a. 1 major * criterion and 1 minor ** criterion; or  
b. 3 minor ** criteria  
 
3. Rejected  
a. Firm alternate diagnosis explaining evidence of infective endocarditis; or  
b. Resolution of infective endocarditis syndrome with antibiotic therapy for ≤ 4 
days; or  
c. No pathologic evidence of infective endocarditis at surgery or autopsy, with 
antibiotic therapy for  ≤ 4 days; or  
d. Does not meet criteria for possible endocarditis, as above   
 
 *Duke Major Criteria : 
 
1. Blood culture positive for infective endocarditis  
a. Typical microorganisms consistent with IE from 2 separate cultures:  
i. Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bo vis, HACEK group, 
Staphylococcus aureus ; or 
ii. Community -acquired enterococci, in the absence of a primary 
focus, or  
b. Microorganisms consistent with infective endocarditis from persistently positive blood cultures, defined as follows:  
i. At least 2 positive cultures of blood samples drawn > 12 hours 
apart; or  
ii. All of 3 or a majority of ≥ 4 separate cultures of blood (with first and last sample drawn at least 1 hour apart)  
c. Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or antiphase I IgG 
antibody titer > 1:800 
 
2. Evidence of endocardial involvement  
 
3. Echocardiogram positive for infectiv e endocarditis (TEE recommended), defined 
as follows:  
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 40 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
a. Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the 
path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an 
alternative anatomic explanation; or  
b. Abscess; or  
c. New partial dehiscense of prosthetic valve  
 
4. New valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of pre -existing murmur not 
sufficient)  
 
 **Duke Minor Criteria : 
 
1. Predisposition, predisposing heart condition or injection drug use  
 
2. Fever, temperature > 38◦C 
 
3. Vascular phenomena, major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway’s lesions  
 
4. Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, Roth’s spots, and rheumatoid factor  
 
5. Microbiological evidence: positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion as noted above (excludes single positive cultures for coagulase -negative 
staphylococci and organisms that do not cause endocarditis) or serological 
evidence of active infection with organism consistent with infective endocarditis  
   
Endocarditis meeting the Duke definitions for ‘definite’ or ‘possible’ will be reported.  
 
Positive blood cultures are not required for the diagnosis of study valve endocarditis.  Morbidit ies associated with active infection, such as valve thrombosis, thrombotic embolus, 
bleeding event, or paravalvular leak, are  included under this category , and  not counted in other 
categories  of morbidity.  
 
Hemorrhage  
 Any episode of major internal or external bleeding that causes death, hospitalization, pericardiocentesis, permanent injury (e.g., vision loss) , or requires transfusion  will be reported .  
 Note: A bleeding event is reportable whether or not the subject is taking anticoagula nt or 
antiplatelet medication . 
 Note: Embolic stroke complicated by bleeding is classified as a neurological event under 
“embolism” and is not included as a separate bleeding event.

Nonstructural Dysfunction  
 
Any abnormality not intrinsic t o the valve itself that results  in stenosis or regurgitation of the 
study  valve or hemolysis  will be reported .  Nonstructural dysfunction refers to problems 
(exclusive of thrombosis and infection) that do not directly involve valve components yet result 
in dysfunction of a study valve , as diagnosed by reoperation, autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
 Examples of nonstructural dysfunction include:  entrapment by pannus, tissue, or suture; 
paravalvular leak ; inappropriate sizing or positioning ; residual leak or obstruction after  valve 
implantation or repair ; and clinically significant intravascular hemolytic anemia.   More than 
mild recurrent or residual mitral regurgitation after surgical or percutaneous interventional 
valve procedures (coronary sinus interventions, direct reparative methods, or other methods 
aimed at achieving ventricular remodeling) is nonstructura l dysfunction, unless there is 
disruption of the valve components themselves, which would then be structural deterioration.   
 Sudden or progressive dysfunction or deterioration of the study valve may be structural, nonstructural, or both as determined by reoperation, autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
 
Reoperation 
 
Reoperation is any operation that repairs, alters or replaces the study valve.  The reasons for 
reoperation are to be reported and may include reasons other than valve -related morbidity, 
such a s recall, excessive noise, or incidental or prophylactic removal.  
 
Thrombolytic or catheter -aided therapy of valve -related morbidity is not considered 
reoperation; however, the morbid event that prompted the intervention should be reported.  
 
Structural Valv e Deterioration  
 
Dysfunction or deterioration involving the study valve (exclusive of infection or thrombosis), as 
determined by reoperation, autopsy, or clinical investigation will be reported .  Structural valv e 
deterioration  refers to changes intrins ic to the valve, such as wear, fracture, poppet escape, 
calcification, leaflet tear, stent creep, and suture line disruption of components (e.g., leaflets) of 
the study valve. 
 
Thromboe mbolism  
 
Any thrombo embolic event that occurs in the absence of infecti on after the immediate 
perioperative period (when anesthesia -induced unconsciousness is completely reversed)  will be 
reported as valve -related .  Thromboembolic events occurring during the procedure will be 
reviewed and adjudicated by the DSMB to determine if the event is valve or procedure related.  
Subsets of thrombo embolic events are:  
 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page 42 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
Neurologic :  
 
A neurologic thromboembolism is one that results in a central, new  neurological deficit , 
whether temporary or permanent and whether focal or global, that occurs after the subject 
emerges from anesthesia .  Types of neurologic events are:  
 
• Stroke:  A prolonged (>72 hours) or permanent neurologic deficit that is usually 
associated with abnormal results of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scan s.  Subjects with minimal, atypical, or protean symptoms that 
lead to radiographic imaging demonstrating an acute ischemic event are considered to have sustained a stroke.    
• Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):  Fully reversible symptoms of short duration.  I f 
radiographic imaging demonstrates an acute central neurologic lesion (“cerebral infarction with transient symptoms”), however, such subjects are reclassified as having sustained a stroke.  
 
Noncerebral : 
 A thromboembolism documented operatively, at autops y, or clinically that produces signs 
or symptoms attributable to complete or partial obstruction of a peripheral artery.     
 
Valv ular Thrombosis  
 Any thrombus  not caused by infection attached to or near the study valve that occludes part of 
the blood flow path, interferes with valve function,  or is sufficiently large to warrant treatment.  
Valv ular thrombosis found at autopsy in a subject  whose cause of death was not valve related 
or found at operation for an unrelated indication should also be counted as valv ular 
thrombosis.

InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  4 1.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate the ocular  safety  and efficacy of topical administration of ISV -305 
(0.1%  dexamethasone  in DuraSite 2 ) compared to vehicle when dosed BID for 1 4 days in 
subjects diagnosed with blepharitis . 
 
2.0 OVERALL STUDY  DESIGN  
This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -controlled , parallel -
group clinical study . Patients  ≥ 1 year of age diagnosed with active, symptomatic blepharitis 
(e.g., flare -up) will be enrolled.   
Prior to enrollment, the study will be discussed with prospective subject s, and th ose wishing to 
enter will be asked to give written informed consent. For subjects who, according to local 
regulations, have not yet reached the age of majority, the subject’s parent(s) or legally authorized 
representative must sign the  Informed Consent For m (ICF) and the minor’s written assent will be 
obtained according to the local requirements.  
Once informed consent has been obtained, the subjects will be questioned regarding their 
medical history  to determine whether or not they are in satisfactory health to enter the study and 
to determine if they meet the specific entry criteria.   
Clinically -diagnosed , active, symptomatic blepharitis  (e.g., flare -up) is defined by a minimum 
combined score of 6 for the following signs and symptom in at least one eye , with a minimum 
score of 2 for eyelid redness , and a minimum score of 1 for eyelid irritation.  
1) Eyelid redness  
2) Eyelid swelling  
3) Eyelid debris  
4) Eyelid irritation  
Subjects meeting all entry requirements will be asked to use lid scrubs for at least 7 days  prior  to 
Day 1 , and will then be reassessed for eligibility  prior to being randomized into the study . 
Subjects still meeting the entry criteria will be randomized into the study and begin a 14-day 
dosing phase (Day 1 – Day 14) followed for approximately 2 weeks  during the  follow -up phase 
(Day 15 – Day 29). Five visits will be required for full study participation: Screening Visit (Day 
-10 to Day -7), Rescreening/ Randomization /Dosing visit (Day 1), Dosing visit (Day 7), and the 
Follow -up visits (Day 15 and Day 29 ). 
Approximately 550 evaluable subjects with blepharitis will be randomized into the study in a 2:1 
ratio: ISV -305: approximately 366 subjects  and vehicle : approximately 184 subjects.

InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  5 Some subjects may have both eyes qualify for the study. In these cases,  data from the eye with 
the highest combined clinical signs and symptoms score on Day 1 will be designated by the 
investigator as the study eye and analyzed for efficacy.  
Subjects (or parent or care giver for subjects too young or otherwise unable to self -apply the IP) 
will be instructed to self -apply their first dose of IP at the study site on Day 1, and will receive 
instructions for dosing at home and completing a dosing diary , to be used as a memory aid . 
Subject safety will be evaluated throughout the st udy. The safety parameters to be assessed are 
the incidence of AEs and SAEs , discontinuations due to AEs, changes in best corrected visual 
acuity ( BCVA) and IOP , and biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic findings .  
Efficacy will be assessed by biomicroscopic measurement of the clinical improv ement in signs 
of eyelid swelling, eyelid redness, eyelid debris, and subject -reported symptom of eyelid 
irritation . Improvement is defined as a reduction in baseline signs and symptoms score by at least 
2 units by Day 15 with no worsening of any sign or symptom . Other  secondary efficacy analyses 
will be performed as outlined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  8 4.0 STUDY TREATMENTS  
4.1 Investigational Product  
ISV-305 is a topical ophthalmic formulation of 0.1% dexamethasone in DuraSite  2. The vehicle 
utilized in this study is the same formulation as ISV -305 (i.e., DuraSite 2) without 
dexamethasone.  
4.2 Instructions for Use and Administration  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either ISV -305 or vehicle  which will be 
administer ed BID to the closed study eyelid and if needed to the closed non-study  eyelid along 
the eyelash line as a topical ophthalmic:  1 drop per eye in the morning and 1 drop per eye in the 
evening for 1 4 days. Subjects (including parent and/or caregiver) will be instructed to smear 1 
drop of IP to the closed study eyelid along the eyelash line  on Day  1 at the study site  upon 
randomization  and 1 d rop in the evening , and to continue dosing BID at appro ximately 12 -hour 
intervals for a total of 1 4 days . Subjects will then be followed for an additional 15 days. Subjects 
will be given a do sing diary to record I P application times , and will be questioned  to determine if 
they have followed the dosing schedule .  
5.0 CONTRAINDICATIONS, W ARNINGS AND PRECAUTI ONS  
Contraindications, warning and precautions for ophthalmic dexamethasone as described in the 
labeling of the approved product Maxidex (0.1% dexamethasone)  are presented below.   
Use of ophthalmic dexamethasone is contraindicated in epithelial herpes simplex (dendritic 
keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and most other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, 
tuberculosis of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures.   
Class warnings for corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are well known and state that 
prolonged use may result in ocular hypertension and/or glaucoma, with damage to the optic 
nerve, defects in VA and fields of vision, and posterior su bcapsular cataract formation. 
Prolonged use may also suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary 
ocular infections. In diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been 
known to occur with the use of topical  corticosteroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, 
corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. I t is recommended that if 
corticosteroids are used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored 
even t hough it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients .  
The possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged 
corticosteroid dosing.   
Subjects are excluded from participating in the study if there is  known hypersensitivity or poor 
tolerance to any component of the IP or any of the procedural medications such as anesthetic 
and/or fluorescein drops, dilating drops, etc.  See Exclusion Criterion a.

prohibited)  
Note: Unscheduled visits may occur during the study period. All assessments will be recorded on the eCRF for unscheduled visits, but it is up to 
the investigator which assessments to conduct. If the subject exits early, all Visit 5 assessments should be conducted, including ophthalmoscopy if 
not obtained at Day 15 (Visit 5).  
 
6.2 Examination Procedures  
The following ophthalmic examinations will be conducted at intervals specified in Table 1

InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  10  Clinical Signs and Symptom : The clinical signs of blepharitis: eyelid redness, eyelid 
swelling and eyelid debris will be evaluated at every visit and will be  scored by the 
investigator using a 0 -3 grading scale. The subject sympto m of eyelid irritation will also 
be evaluated at every visit and  graded by the subject using a 0 -3 grading scale.  
 Best Corrected  Visual Acuity ( BCVA): BCVA will be measured at every visit . The 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy  Study  (ETDRS) log of the minimum angle of 
resolution (logMAR) will be used to measure BCVA. As appropriate, Lea Symbols® will 
be used in children.  
 Intraocular Pressure (IOP)  IOP will be  measured  in mmHg using a n applanation 
tonometer  at every visit . IOP is to b e measured in all subjects .  
 Ophthalmoscopy : Ophthalmoscopy will be performed  by a board -certified 
ophthalmologist at Day -10 to -7 (Visit 1) and Day 15 (Visit 4)  or Day 29 (Visit 5) if no t 
completed at Visit 4 .    
 Biomicroscopy:  Slit lamp biomicroscopy  will be performed at every visit during the 
study to observe  the overall health of the eye, including the lid/lashes,  conjunctiva, 
cornea anterior chamber , iris, and lens. Any observations at the screening visit should be 
recorded as ocular medical history, and any new or worsened observations may be 
recorded as AEs. Slit lamp biomicroscopy will be conducted by a board -certified 
ophthalmologist at every visit . 
7.0 EVALUATI ON, RECORDING AND REPO RTING OF ADVERSE EVE NTS  
All AEs either observed by the investigator or study site staff or reported by the subject 
spontaneously or in response to a direct question regarding the subject’s health by the 
investigator will be recorded i n the source document  and AE eCRF .  
Events reported before signing the consent form should be recorded as medical history ; once the 
ICF is signed new conditions or worsening of existing conditions or episodes  that increase in 
frequency should be recorded a s AEs in the source document and AE eCRF.  
To standardize the collection of AEs during a study, subjects should be asked a standard question 
to elicit AEs: “Have you had any problems since your last visit or telephone call?”  and “What is 
the status of [list  previously reported unresolved AEs]? ” Subjects will also be instructed to 
contact the investigator immediately if they note any unusual systemic or oc ular AEs between 
visits.   
Throughout the course of the study, the investigator must remain alert to poss ible adverse 
experiences or untoward findings. If adverse experiences occur, the first concern will be the 
safety of the subject. Appropriate medical intervention will be provided by the investigator.  
The collection, review and management of safety data (A Es and SAEs) will be conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of the FDA as well as the local IRB /Independent Ethics 
Committee ( IEC).

Study No. C -12-305-001 Amendment 1 , Redacted – Clinicaltrials.gov  June 22, 2017  
 
 
InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  11 7.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in humans, whether 
or not considered rela ted to the I P. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP, without 
any judgment about cau sality. An AE can arise from any use of the IP (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation or dose, 
including overdose.  
Medical conditions or diseases present before a subject starts study t reatment are only considered 
AEs if they worsen after the subject signs informed consent.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedur e was performed should 
be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE -reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy 
noted  according to the eCRF completion guideli ne. 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period for this study  begins upon signing the consent form  and ends at the 
completion of the subjects ’ final visit exam. All AEs that occur in study  subjects during the AE -
reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the AE eCRF, whether or not 
the event is considered related to the IP. In addition, any known untoward event that occurs 
subsequent to the AE reporting period that the  investigator assesses as possibly related to the IP 
should be re corded  in the source documents and reported to the sponsor or designee . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is an event  that, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, results in any of the 
following outcomes : 
 death  
 a life-threatening  AE or sight -threatening AE, where ophthalmics are involved  
 inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the abi lity to conduct 
normal life functions  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Study No. C -12-305-001 Amendment 1 , Redacted – Clinicaltrials.gov  June 22, 2017  
 
 
InSite Vision, Inc.  Confid ential  12  an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening/sight -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above . Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The criterion of inpatient hospitalization is  met if the subject is admitted  to the hospital as the 
result of an AE, even if the subject is released on the same day. An emergency  room visit  does 
not qualify as “inpatient hospitalization” unless the subject i s admitted to the hospital during the 
visit; however, the reason for the emergency room visit may qualify as an SAE based on another 
SAE criteria (e.g., life threatening  or medically significant event).  
Pre-existing Conditions  
In this study , a pre -existing  condition is a disorder /disease  present before the AE -reporting 
period start s (i.e., prior to the subject signing the ICF ) and noted on the Medi cal History eCRF . 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or 
episodes increase in frequency during the AE -reporting period.  
7.2 Adverse Events Associated with Study Procedures  
Visual Acuity  
A worsening of BCVA of 3 lines or more in logMAR score should be captured in the source 
documents and the appropriate  AE eCRF . 
IOP 
An increase  in IOP  of ≥ 10 mmHg from Visit  1 or any subsequent visit should be captured  as an 
AE in the source documents and on the AE eCRF.  
Biomicroscopy  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed during the study to observe the overall health of the 
eye, inc luding the lid/lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Any 
observations prior to signing the ICF  should be recorded as ocular medical history . Any  new or 
worsened observations after sign ing the ICF may be recorded as an AE. 
Ophthalmo scopy  
A new finding or a significant worsening (2 units or more) from Visit 1 should be recorded as an 
AE.

Table  2Table 2 presents the reportin g guidelines for AEs and SAEs. It is important that the 
investigator comply with the SAE reporting timelines in order to assure that safety reporting 
timelines of IRB/ IEC and regulatory authorities such as the FDA can be met.  
Table  2: Requirements for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events to Sponsor  
Type  Reporting Time  Type of Report  
Serious  Within 24 hours  Adverse Event Report (AE eCRF)  
Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
Non-serious  Per eCRF submission procedure  Adverse Event Report (AE eCRF)  
 
All information relevant to the SAE  must be recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form, and 
the form submitted  immediately (within 24 hours  of learning of the event ) to the sponsor  
Medical Monitor or desi gnee.  
The investigator must also  provide sponsor  or designee a copy of all pertinent medical records 
such as source documents, hospitalization records, death cer tificates etc. that are de -identified 
and contain only the study subject number and the subject initials. The investigator should 
maintain  a copy of  these medical records  in his/her files , as well as  any information and medical 
judgments from colleagues  or other medical personnel  who assisted in the treatment and follow -
up of the subject .  
The investigator should ensure that the subject receives appropriate medical treatment and 
follow -up. Subjects should receive follow -up until the SAE resolves or resolves with sequelae  
(as judge d by the investigator) . 
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator will inform the IRB/IEC of any SAE/serious, unexpected, suspected adverse 
reaction according to the IRB/IEC’s specific reporting guidelines.  
For all serious , unexpected, suspected adverse reactions, the sponsor or designee will provide 
documentation to the investigator for the investigator’s report to the IRB/IEC or local regulatory 
authorities.  
The investigator must provide documentation of all such IRB/IEC  notifications to the sponsor or

Study Title  
Mindful Self -Compassion Training to Improve Retention, Job Satisfaction, and Attitudes 
toward Dementia among Long- Term Care Nursing Assistants: Certified Nursing 
Assistants’ Wellbeing  Program  
Objectives  
 This preliminary study will modify, refine, and test a MSC training intervention, 
otherwise to be known as the CNA Wellbeing Program, for CNAs who care for nursing home residents. The proposed research will be conducted in 3 similarly rated and structured community NHs . 
 
Aim 1: Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and adaptations of the CNA Wellbeing 
Program by conducting 8- week co urse in one NH with a goal of 15 CNAs , and up to 20 
CNAs per NH . Evaluation will focus on a) participation (including home practice 
adherence); b) attendee evaluation of training; c) barriers/facilitators of participation; d) use and retention of session  materials by participants; and e) recommendations for 
improvement.    
 Aim 2: Conduct a pilot test of adapted protocols and intervention in sample of 30 CNAs from 2 NHs to reexamine feasibility and acceptability. Evaluate fidelity and impact of training by measuring a) attendance, b) satisfaction with training, c) pre -post measures 
of self- compassion, intent to leave job, perceived stress, job satisfaction, burnout, and 
attitudes towards persons with dementia.  
Interventions and Duration  
Mindful Self -Compassion has been developed and validated in other populations as a 
course of eight 2.5-  hour weekly sessions. A modified version of this program will be 
tested in Aim 2, which is also a validated version of the MSC program. This version is six, 1 -hour weekly sessions. Each session  begins with meditation, follows with discussion 
of previous  week’s home practice, introduction of main theme of session  and new formal 
and informal practices. Each session  will be offered in a location convenient t o the NH, 
outside of work hours, at times convenient for participants, and offered at two different times to accommodate schedules.   
Sample Size and Population  
Eligibility to this study will include: Certified Nursing Assistant employed by participating nursing homes; over the age of 18; able to speak and write in English; works at NH 20 or more hours per week; expects to be employed with NH for the duration of the course; and expects to be able to attend 75%  of the sessions . Up to 20 
CNAs per NH will be able to participate , with a goal of 15 participants . If over 20 CNAs 
are interested, the study will enroll the 20 CNAs who score highest on the Screening Questionnaires’ Perceived Stress Scale who are interested in participating.

v. 3.18.2021  2 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
This preliminary study will modify, refine, and test a MSC training intervention, to be known as CNA 
Wellbeing Program,  for CNAs who care for nursing home residents. Our goal is to increase CNA coping 
skills and well- being, thereby reducing intent to leave the job, reducing burnout, and improving job 
satisfaction and attitudes toward people with dementia. The proposed research will be conducted in 3 
similarly rated and structured community NHs.  
1.1 Aim 1  Objective 
Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and necessary adaptations of the CNA Wellbeing Program 
needed to meet the diverse cultural background, limited literacy, and job and family challenges of the 
nursing home CNA workforce, including the unique challenges of caring for persons with dementia, and of 
the data collection methods.  
A. Conduct a field trial of the standardized 8- week CNA Wellbeing  Program with 15 CNAs  within a single 
community NH. Evaluation will focus on: (a) participation (including home practice adherence and 
attendance); (b) attendee evaluation of the training; (c)  barriers to and facilitators of participation; (d) 
use and retention of session  material by participants; and (e) recommendations for improvement of 
training.  
 
B. Field test the feasibility and acceptability of our study recruitment and evaluation strategy.  
 
C. Use data collected from the field test to modify recruitment strategies, protocols, and course structure, 
content and materials so as to be maximally feasible, acceptable and effective in a CNA population.  
1.2 Aim 2  Objective 
Conduct a pilot test of the adapted protocols and intervention in a sample of 30 CNAs from 2 similarly 
rated and structured community NHs to reexamine feasibility and acceptability, identify trends in key 
intermediate and long- term outcomes, and estimate effect size in preparation for a future randomized 
trial. 
 
A. Evaluate the fidelity and immediate impact of the modified training by measuring (a) training 
attendance; (b) satisfaction with the training; and (c) pre- and post -training measures of self -
compassion, perceived stress, job satisfaction, job burnout symptoms, and attitudes towards persons 
with dementia.  
 
B. Evaluate the sustained impact of the training by comparing baseline, 3- and 6- month post -training 
measurements of: intent to leave job, self -compassion, perceived stress,  job satisfaction, job burnout 
symptoms, and attitudes towards persons with dementia.  
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
Critical role of certified nursing assistants (CNAs) in nursing homes (NHs). U.S. NHs serve 
approximately 1.6 million complex and vulnerable persons daily, the majority of whom have Alzheimer’s disease or a related cognitive disorder, require extensive help with activities of daily living, and have 
multiple chronic illnesses.
1 In these settings, most hands -on care is provided by an estimated 634,000 
certified nursing assistants (CNAs) – a workforce that is racially diverse, predominantly female, with a 
high school or lower education, and an annual income equivalent to the poverty threshold for a family of four.
2 
 
CNA workforce experiences high stress and turnover, compromising resident care. Demand for 
CNAs is high and projected to grow;2 however, retaining CNA staff is a major challenge. National turnover 
rates average 65% annually.3 Equally concerning is CNA absenteeism, as nearly 10% do not report to 
work as scheduled.4 Turnover, absenteeism, and staff shortages have been linked to poor care, including 
negative resident outcomes such as pressure ulcers, infections, pain, and reduced overall quality of life.3-8  
v. 3.18.2021  3 CNAs are predominately female; nearly half are racial/ethnic minorities; and 75% have a high 
school degree or less.9 Two thirds live on a family income near or below poverty level and nearly a third 
receive public assistance and/or head a single- parent household. G iven limited resources, hardships 
such as inconsistent childcare, personal illness or injury, or transportation issues can be large sources of 
stress.10  
CNAs also face emotionally and physically demanding job tasks, particularly when working with 
persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Challenging behaviors such as verbal 
aggression and physical assault are common, especially during personal care11-13 with 56% of CNAs 
reporting at least one work -related injury in the prior year, including s cratches, open wounds or cuts, back 
injuries, bruises, black eyes and human bites.9 Additionally, CNAs report distress due to unappreciative 
residents and unhappy family members.14 
Job burnout, defined as a response to prolonged work -related stress that re duces job satisfaction, 
productivity, performance, turnover and well -being, is high among CNAs.15 In dementia care, CNA 
burnout has been correlated with reduced empathy and fewer positive attitudes towards persons with 
dementia.16 In contrast, our previous  work and that of others found that positive attitudes towards persons 
with dementia are associated with increased job satisfaction.17,18 
 
Current strategies to decrease job stress and improve job satisfaction have significant 
drawbacks. Driven by a desire to improve CNA recruitment and retention, many interventions have been 
identified, including increased compensation and benefits, organizational culture change, improved 
staffing ratios, and career advancement opportunities.3 Although these address import ant issues, most 
require significant financial resources and organizational change. Moreover, none address the adaptive 
skills necessary for an individual worker to effectively respond to inevitable job, life, and interpersonal 
stressors. Furthermore, heal thcare provider well -being and resilience are a priority focus,19 given that 
optimal resident care is impossible without provider self -care.20 The current project proposes to arm CNAs 
with larger life skills useful in difficult situations, many of which ar e beyond the person’s immediate 
control. These skills are an important adjunct to organizational change interventions and can yield 
positive effects beyond the workplace.  
 Mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) is a proven strategy for stress reduction and 
promotion of well -being in heterogeneous populations. Mindfulness has been described as paying 
attention to the present with nonjudgmental awareness.
21 MBSR training is a standardized approach that 
promotes well -being in a wide variety of populations, including healthy individuals,22 persons with chronic 
conditions,23 and family caregivers.24 Taught in a series of classes, MBSR is inexpensive and highly 
accessible. In health care professionals, MBSR training decreases burnout, perceived stress, anxiety,  
and depression, while increasing well -being, empathy and compassion for others.25,26 
MBSR has been extensively studied in nurses.27,28 In the limited research that has been 
conducted on  CNAs, sample sizes were small and results mixed.29 No published research has been 
conducted in NHs –  where CNA roles are most extensive (although a pilot study in dementia care homes 
is underway in Wales).30 Given the magnitude of job- related stress among NH CNAs and the success of 
MBSR with professionals , further exploration is needed. Indeed, the relative simplicity and low cost of 
mindfulness training coupled with high potential impact has led to calls for formal and informal 
mindfulness practices to be incorporated into CAN educational programs,31 and for research on the 
downstream effects of mindfulness on patient care.32 
 
Self-Compassion (SC) and Mindful Self- Compassion (MSC): an enhanced, focused training that is 
promising yet largely unexplored. SC – a closely related construct to mindfulness –  is a particularly 
powerful new tool to reduce stress and burnout.32,33 Compassion is “sensitivity to the experience of 
suffering, coupled with a deep desire to alleviate that suffering,” and SC is this same concept focused 
inward, often described as “like treating oneself as one would a good friend when they are struggling.”34 
SC has three main, interrelated components: self -kindness (responding to challenges with self -support 
and understanding); common humanity (recognizing hardships are part of the shared human experience), and mindfulness (responding to negative thoughts and emotions with a balanced rather than 
“catastrophic” response). Since its initial description in 2003, SC has been positively linked to multiple 
measures of well -being;
35 inversely correlated to stress, depression and anxiety;36 and associated with 
resilience in the face of stressful life events.37 There is also evidence that persons with greater levels of 
v. 3.18.2021  4 self-compassion experience better interpersonal relationships and express more empathy and 
compassion for others.32,38 –40 Furthermore, in nurses and nurse midwives, self -compassion protects 
against job burnout and compassion fatigue.41–43 A current training format for SC integrates it with 
mindfulness in an 8- session program entitled MSC w hich, in the limited intervention studies conducted to 
date, has demonstrated large, positive effects on compassion for others, stress, anxiety, depression and 
life satisfaction in community -based, mainly white, female, educated populations.44 MSC interventions 
have also been successfully adapted for adolescents by our research team,45,46 and for those with 
diabetes.47 MSC interventions in NH CNAs have not, however, been studied.  
Because CNAs have particularly high work and life stress burdens and fewer opp ortunities than 
more educated populations to learn stress management techniques, MSC skills hold particular promise 
for improving outcomes. Indeed, one study of residential dementia care found that CNAs employ a range 
of strategies, many of which are unhel pful, such as defensiveness/shutting down, unhealthy distraction 
(e.g., overeating), and psychological distress (e.g., anxiety or depression); and the authors suggested 
that mindfulness training might have a “preventive focus” by promoting self -care.48 Additionally, there is 
evidence that people with high levels of self -compassion more often use “positive cognitive restructuring” 
or changing one’s view of a negative situation to more a positive one,49 a reaction that has been found to 
buffer against burnout  in CNAs.15 
 Conceptual Model and Potential Impact.  Figure 1 (below) illustrates our conceptual model. Among NH 
CNAs, work and life stress combine with low coping skills to result in high levels of perceived stress, 
which in turn lead to negative attitudes toward the people they care for, life and work dissatisfaction, and 
burnout, culminating in high rates of absenteeism and turnover, leading to impairment on the quality of 
care they provide. The 
intervention we propose has 
been proven in other settings t o 
improve performance by 
enhancing coping skills. If successful, MSC could be 
incorporated into the curricula of 
CNA training programs, thereby helping create a more resilient, 
stable, competent workforce, 
and one better able to provide dementia- sensitive care.  
3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single -arm feasibility trial that will ref ine an existing MSC intervention  in preparation for a future, 
randomized controlled trial with the primary goal of improving CNA job retention. We will recruit 15 CNAs 
from a single nursing home (NH), pilot the 8- week intervention, and collect feedback via questionnaires , 
interviews  and a semi -structured focus group at the end of the course. Data from this cohort will be used 
to refine study protocols and course structure/materials for maximum feasibility and acceptability. A 
refined intervention will subsequently be tested in 30 CNAs from two NH settings (15 CNAs per home), 
with pre, post, and follow -up measurements of stress,  burnout, self -compassion, job satisfaction, attitudes 
towards dementia, and intent to leave their job.  
 
  

v. 3.18.2021  5 4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
In nursing home settings, most hands -on care is provided by an estimated 634,000 certified nursing 
assistants (CNAs) –  a workforce that is racially diverse, predominantly female, with a high school or lower 
education, and an annual income equivalent to the poverty threshold for a family of four.  The participants 
of this study will include only CNAs employed with the partnering three  Nursing Homes.  
 
The three nursing homes that have been chosen for participation fit the following criteria: overall quality (as defined by rec eiving a 4 or 5 star rating on CMS compare), bed size (80- 120 beds), non- profit status, 
and within 30 miles of the research team.  
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
Participants must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study : 
• Certified Nursing Assistant working at  3 participating NHs  
• Works at least 20 hours a week (on average) with participating NHs  
• Speaks and reads English  
• Over 18 years old  
• Intends to work with NH for the durat ion of the MSC course  
• Expects to be able to attend a majority (75%) of the sessions 
If over 20  CNAs are interested in the course, and we are not able to accommodate all whom would like to 
participate, an additional inclusion criteria will be scores on the Perceived Stress Scale portion of the 
Screening Questionnaire (see Appendix D1). The 20 CNAs with the highest scores on the PSS will be 
eligible for the intervention course.  As of the completion of this trial, this measure was unnecessary.  
4.2 Study Enrollment Procedures  
All candidates will be identified and recruited from the three participating Nursing Homes . The recruitment 
process will be a multi -step process, and will gather input from the participating NHs, as well as meeting 
with CNA representatives from the nursing homes  to gather their thoughts on recruitment materials and 
strategy . See Table 1 (below) f or details.

5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
CNA Wellbeing Program and Measures Intervention  
The study will take place over the course of 8 months for each participant –  this includes the duration of 
the intervention as well as follow up measures (see details below).   
Before the onset of the intervention , interested participants will complete the Screening Questionnaire, in 
order to gather their scores on the Perceived Stress Scale. If over 20  CNAs are interested in joining the 
course, this screening data will be used to choose the 20 CNAs with the highes t scores on the Perceived 
Stress Scale, and invite these participants to join the full study. Otherwise, all eligible CNAs will be 
included. This Screening Questionnaire will be administered in person, at the recruitment sessions. 
Alternatively, for CNAs unable to attend the recruitment sessions and who choose to reach out to the study staff directly instead, an option to have a verbal consent and phone version of the Screening 
Questionnaire will be provided.  
Once the final program list has been determined,  the study will begin with informed, written consent, and 
an initial Baseline Interview, no more than 2 weeks before the onset of the course.  
The intervention will be administered over the course of 8- weeks  for Nursing Home 1, and over the 
course of 6- weeks for Nursing Home 2 & 3 , and follows the pre- created agenda for the Mindful Self -
Compassion course (see below, Table 2) . Participants will be texted weekly by study staff, with reminders 
of the next session, as well as a recap of the previous session. At the beginning of  the course, study staff 
will collect Weekly Questionnaires on each participant.  This will be given by the intervention instructors 
during the sessions . If a participant has missed a session , study staff will follow up to collect a modified 
Weekly Questionnaire by phone.  Towards the end of the course, a half -day (4 hour) retreat was  offered to 
participating CNAs  (of Nursing Homes 1) . They were encouraged to attend this retreat, however, it was  
not required and attendance (or non- attendance) did not impact their participation in the study.  Ultimately, 
the retreat was not held due to difficulties with scheduling.  
No more than two weeks after the termination of the course, study staff will administer an End- of-Program 
Interview  either in person or via telephone, according to the convenience of the participant .  
Additionally, there will be one shortened weekly focus group session (1 hour in length) after the last week 
v. 3.18.2021  7 of the CNA Wellbeing Program in order to solicit further feedback on the course. This session will be 
audio recorded and transcribed, in order to collect and analyze feedback. The sessions for Nursing Home 
#2 & #3 wer e formalized into focus groups, whereas the session for Nursing Home #1 was an open 
discussion session.  
Study staff will reach back out to all participants after the culmination of the program, in order to 
administer the 3/6 Month Interviews  either in per son or via telephone. After the 6- month interview has 
been completed, participation in the study will have concluded.  
Additionally, in order to compare the stress levels and demographic information of CNAs who participate 
in the program versus those who work at the participating nursing home, we will ask CNAs present at a 
staff meeting to fill out a short survey with the Perceived Stress Scale and demographic information.

5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
This intervention will be given by K aren Bluth, PhD and Laura Prochnow Philips, both of whom are 
Certified Mindful Self -Compassion Trainers.  
5.3 Adherence  
Full participation will be encouraged and asked for all participants. Because this is a feasibility study, 
study staff will record adherenc e and non- adherence to the CNA Wellbeing Program through following  
attendance (including times in and times out of participants)  and practice between sessions. However, 
participants will have the option of continuing on, even if they do not adhere completely to the program.  
 
Study staff will continue to follow participants with the opportunity to complete questionnaires and 
interviews, regardless of their adherence to the program.   
6 STUDY MEASURES  
The following table lays out the various measures and data that will be collected from participants 
throughout the course of the study –  including before, during, and at 3 and 6 months after the conclusion

v. 3.18.2021  10 6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
 
Two consenting processes are included in this study , an embedded consent for participation in the 
Screening Questionnaire and a written consent for participation in the study.   
 
A. The initial consent process is for the Screening Questionnaire of eligible partici pants. In the event that 
there are over 20 CNAs interested in a course at a single nursing home, eligible participants will be 
chosen from the highest scores on the Screening Questionnaire (which includes the Perceived Stress 
Scale). This questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by the research assistant.  
 
While presenting on the course during the information session, the research staff  will have with them 
a sign- in/interest sheet in the course. The interest sheet will have ID  number s preprinted (i.e. for the 
Nursing Home in Aim 1, 101, 102, 103, 104, etc.) . The Screening  Questionnaire will have the ID 
number  pre-printed onto the questionnaire, so that when any individual chooses to sign up to the 
interest list, and wants to do the Screening Questionnaire, they will be immediately given an ID# and 
then handed the corresponding questionnaire.  
 Once they’ve received the Screening Questionnaire, they will be able to independently read the 
embedded consent form and determine thei r interest in participating in the Screening Questionnaire.  
Any CNAs interested in participating in the full study and adding their name to the interest sheet  will 
be told that the Screening Questionnaire must be eventually be completed in order to be eligible  for 
the full study, but that by completing the Screening Questionnaire, they are not automatically enrolled .  
 
Alternatively, for CNAs who reach out to the study staff directly from the posted recruitment flyers, a 
verbal consent will be read to them to participate in the Screening Questionnaire, if they are 
interested.  
 
While study staff is recruiting CNAs, [s]he will have a folder  with them in order to collect all 
Questionnaires. Identifiable information  from the interest sheets  and linking ID#s will be transferred to 
an electronic folder, stored on the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research’s secure 
servers, separately from any data.   
 
B. The second consent process will be with all participants’  who are committed to joining the intervention 
program. Throughout the recruitment process, participants will be able to sign up on an  interest sheet  
to indicate their interest. These participants will be able to sign up physically, during the recruitment 
sessions, or reach out directly to study staff to have their name included on the interest sheet . Once 
CNAs have expressed interest, the study staff will reach out to them one- on-one through their 
preferred method of communication (telephone, text, or email), and verify their commitment to the program.  
 
Once commitment and eligibility have been confirmed, study staff will set up one- on-one meetings 
with participants in order to review the written consent form.  This will take place up to 2 weeks before 
the start date of the program. During these in-person meetings , study staff will review the consent 
form with participants and answer any questions they may have. Additionally, study staff will ensure participants have their own copy of the consent form for their files . Once collected, all physical 
consent forms will be kept in a locked office in the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services  
Research, where only study staff will have access.   
 
 
 
v. 3.18.2021  11 Screening   
 
This study will take up to 20  CNAs per Nursing Home. If 20 or fewer CNAs are interested in the CNA 
Wellbeing Program, all those interested will be able to participate. However, if over 20 CNAs are 
interested in the program (within one Nursing Home), the Scr eening Questionnaire administered during 
the recruitment process will be used to determine the 20 CNAs with the hig hest scores on the Perceived 
Stress Scale.  The study’s goal is to recruit 15 CNAs per Nursing Home.  
 
In the event that there are over 20 CNAs interested and the study is not able to accommodate all CNAs, 
some Mindful Self -Compassion materials will be provi ded to those who are not able to join the program .  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
CNAs will be enrolled in the screening process after they have read the embedded consent form on the 
Screening Questionnaire, and have chosen to fill out the qu estionnaire. The Screening Questionnaire 
involves demographic questions as well as the Perceived Stress Scale.  
 
For the intervention portion of the study, CNAs will be enrolled after reviewing and signing the written  consent form with study staff in a one- on-one process. This process will occur up to 2 weeks before 
enrollment in the course  begins.  
 Once enrolled, participants complete an in- person interview  (the Baseline Interview ) with study staff . This 
baseline interview will capture their preliminary scores on:  
 
• Stress levels 
• Attitudes towards dementia  
• Job satisfaction and intent to leave job  
• Burnout score  
• Self-compassion score  
• Depression score 
 
6.2.3 Follow -up Visits  
After initial enrollment, and collection of the Baseline Interview, CNAs will begin p articipating in the 
intervention, the CNA Wellbeing Program. There will be 8 intervention sessions, as well as a 9th session 
for feedback (or, 6 intervention sessions, and a 7th for feedback , if taking the 6- week version of the 
program).  Additionally, CNAs will be approached at the End -of-Program  mark, and the 3/ 6 month mark 
post course, to gat her additional survey responses. These interviews will continue to capture the 
participants’  scores on:  
 
• Stress levels 
• Attitudes towards dementia  
• Job satisfaction and intent to leave job  
• Burnout score  
• Self-compassion scores  
• Depression score 
 See above (in section 6.1 Schedule of Evaluations)  for an exact  list of what will be collected from CNAs at 
each point,  baseline,  weekly, post course, 3- months,  and 6- months. 
 
6.2.4 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Study staff will continue to follow up with participants until the point of the final evaluation, the 6- month 
Follow Up Interview.  
v. 3.18.2021  12 7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants  
 
Potential Risks:  
 
The potential risks to study participants include:  
• Emotional discomfort caused by study questions.  
• Emotional or psychological discomfort or distress (e.g., agitation, anxiety ) caused by exercises, 
group discussion, or home practices.  
• Physical discomfort  during sitting exercises.  
• Emotional or economic (employment -related) harm due to breech of confidentiality. This includes 
breech of confidentially regarding any personal information shared during the group intervention 
sessions, questionnaire data, or outcome data collected from administrative records . 
 
Potential Benefits:  
 
The potential benefits to study participants include:  
• Stress -management skills that may improve well -being and positively impact relationships and job 
performance.  
• Lifetime access t o resources (e.g., audio guided meditations, course materials) that may help 
sustain well -being and stress -management skills.  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
This study employs a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), composed of 3 members in order to monitor 
the safety of this study. See below for details on the process by which Adverse Events/Serious Adverse 
Events are defined, and will be handled.    
7.2 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended change in physical or mental health status (i.e.  
new or worsening physical or mental health signs, symptoms, or disease) or loss of employment associated with participation in the study, regardless of whether it is considered related to the study.  
 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) : Any AE that: r esults in death; i s life threatening, or places the 
participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; requires or prolongs hospitalization; 
causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity ; results in congenital anomalies or bi rth defects  
 Unanticipated problems (UPs): Involves  risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
o Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
o Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research); and  
o Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater r isk of harm (including physical, 
psychological,
 economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
7.3 Reporting Procedures  
Given course content can bring up difficult emotions, study staff  will mon itor depressive symptoms 
weekly . Study staff will also ask participants to report any changes in their physical health that may be 
v. 3.18.2021  13 related to their participation in the study, with the exception of transient discomfort during sitting practices. 
Examples of potentially relevant, although unlikel y, physical health changes include: headaches, body or 
joint aches, or an injury occurring during mindfulness practice. These examples will be given to 
participants, with the caveat that they should err on the side of caution and over -reporting. Additional ly, in 
order to monitor for participants’ at risk of giving birth to a child with a birth defect, the intervention 
instructors will report to Principal Investigator and study staff if they learn of any pregnancy within their program participants.   
 
In order to facilitate the reporting of potential AEs to study staff, the following procedures will be in place:  
 
[1] During the 8- week intervention period, participants will be engaged in weekly  group discussions about 
home practice, challenges to practice, and well-being. Any participant endorsing difficulties that the 
course facilitators feel are potentially beyond transient or typical will be approached privately to gather 
details.  
 [2] Participants will be given study staff contact information, including st udy phone and e- mail addresses. 
Participants will be encouraged to contact study staff in the event of psychological or potentially relevant 
physical health concerns.  
 
[3] At the beginning of each weekly session , and at 3 and 6- months post -intervention, we will administer a 
brief adverse event form, through the Weekly Questionnaire. On this form, we will collect data on any 
serious adverse events in the previous week, depressive symptoms via the validated 8- question PROMIS 
Depression Short Form and physical health changes possibly related to study participation. Regarding depressive symptoms monitoring, we will collect the PROMIS depression screen at baseline. For the 
purposes of this study, any participant whose PROMIS depression score moves from a lower category 
into the severe category (i.e. greater than or equal to a T -score of 70) will be flagged as a potential 
adverse event and will prompt follow up by the study team via a phone call by the study staff to gather 
details. Study staff will also notify the course instructors of the increased emotional distress so that extra 
support can be provided as needed.  
 
The study team member receiving information from participants about a potential AE related to the study 
will complete an Adverse Event Form.  
7.4 Follow-up for Adverse Events  
 
Data on AEs and UPs will be collected on an ongoing basis from study start to study completion.  
 
General AE Procedures . The project manager or study staff will report all AEs to the PI immediately using 
the Adverse Event Reporting Form, after having gathered all necessary details  (from the Weekly 
Questionnaire, as well as further communication with the participant if needed) . The PI will determine the 
severity and the relatedness of the AE, and will confer with the SMC as needed. If the AE is serious and/or unexpected, possibly related to study participation, and suggests increased risk for participants, the procedures outlined below will also be followed.  
 AE reports will collected by the project manager or study staff, s ummarized and de - identified. A summary 
report of all AEs to date will be sent to the PI and the SMC in both Phases at: 1) mid- intervention (4- week 
mark); 2) post -intervention (8- week mark); 3) post 3- month follow -up; 4) post 6- month follow -up.  
 Furthermore, all AEs will be summarized as part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Report submitted 
post-Phase 1 and post -Phase 2 to the SMC and NIA program officer. As per UNC IRB guidelines, all AEs 
will reported to the UNC IRB during the yearly study review process.  
 
v. 3.18.2021  14 Serious AE Procedures . The project manager or study staff will report all SAEs to the PI immediately 
using the Adverse Event Reporting Form, after having gathered all necessary details. For all deaths and 
for any SAE related or possibly related to study participation, the PI w ill send this report and any 
additional information, including corrective actions already taken, within 24 hours to the SMC chair, UNC 
IRB and NIA program officer. The PI will follow any additional course of action recommended by the UNC 
IRB, NIA, and/or S MC.  
 
Unexpected and Related AEs/UPs with increased risk . All AEs that are deemed 1) unexpected; 2) 
possibly or probably related to study participation; and 3) suggests increased risk for study participants will be reported to the UNC IRB, NIA project offi cer, and the SMC chair within 48 hours of study team 
awareness of the event, using each organizations’ respective reporting formats. In these reports, the PI will identify any corrective action planned or already undertaken. The PI will follow any addition al course 
of action recommended by the UNC IRB, NIA, and/or SMC.  
 
The SMC will meet in person (or virtually for long- distance members as needed) at least 3 times 
throughout the study to review the Data and Safety Monitoring Report: 1) prior to first enrol lment ; 2) after 
completion of the field test (Phase 1) using the standardized intervention; 3) after completion of the 
refined intervention (Phase 2).  
 Additional meetings (ad- hoc) will occur as requested by the PI for review of unexpected adverse events 
or any SAEs that occur. Any recommended changes by the SMC will be submitted to the UNC IRB for 
approval.  
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
 
We will prepare interim analyses to evaluate the safety of the intervention after Phase 1 and again after 
Phase 2. One of the tasks of the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be to review preliminary data 
from the study and make a recommendation RE whether or not the study should continue. The following 
are the reasons we propose for discontinuing the study early:  
 
• The occurrence of a serious adverse event, possibly or definitely related to the study protocol, occurring in any participant. In this study, it would include serious psychological distress causing death, suicide attempt, or hospitalization.  
• Severe adverse events, possibly or definitely related to the study protocol, occurring in 3 or more participants. In this study, this would include participants who withdrew from the study due to new 
psychological symptoms or who were hospitalized for ment al health treatment. Given the high-
stress nature of the participants jobs and lives, and given MSC involves prompting participants to become aware of and attend to their own needs, it is possible that study participation prompts mental health care that had been needed previously, but was perhaps ignored or not prioritized. Thus, severe cases will be examined carefully by the PI and SMC to determine if the cases 
warrant study discontinuation.  
• Interim analyses will provide summary data related to the above bullets and study staff will make 
these data available to the SMC at least 2 weeks before meeting, or within 24 hours  
  
9 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
9.1 Data Collection Forms  
ID# Convention:  
 
All data will be de -identified with by using an ID# rather than names or other identifying information. 
This ID# will be composed of three numbers. The first number will be the Nursing Home with which 
v. 3.18.2021  15 the participant is associated. The following ID#s  numbers will be filled out by study staff after 
collecting completed Screening Questionnaires , starting with 01 and ending with 99.  
 
ID# Nursing Home  
1 Aim 1 NH  
2 Aim 2 NH  
3 Aim 2 NH  
 
A sample ID# will be as follows:  
 
First Digit: NH  Second and Third Digit: Participant  
1-3 01-99 
 
 
Screening Questionnaire:  
 
Initial data collection will begin with the Screening Questionnaire.  
 The Screening Questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by the research assistant. 
While presenting on the course during the information session, study staff will have an interest sheet, 
pre-printed with ID#s, as well as Screening Questio nnaires, pre- printed with ID#s . For CNAs 
interested in signing into the interest sheet and participating in the Screening Questionnaire, they will 
sign up to a specific ID# slot, and given the corresponding Screening Questionnaire. The first page of 
each questionnaire will have an embedded consent form. Those present at the information sessions 
will be able to independently read the consent form and determine their interest in participating in the 
Screening Questionnaire. Any CNAs interested in participating in the full study and adding t heir name 
to the interest sheet  will be told that the Screening Questionnaire must be completed in order to be 
eligible for the full study, but that by completing the Screening Questionnaire, they are not 
automatically enrolled.   
 
While study staff is recr uiting CNAs, [s]he will have a folder  with them in order to collect all 
Questionnaires , and will instruct CNAs to bring all completed Questionnaires directly to the study 
staff.  
 
Alternatively, this process will be available to CNAs over the phone if necessary (they reach out directly from flyers, are only able to stay for a few minutes at a recruitment session, but wish to 
complete the Screening Questionnaire at another time, etc. ). In these cases, a verbal consent will be 
read aloud to CNAs, and the Screening Questionnaire will be read for completion.  
 
Identifiable information from the interest sheet  and linking ID#s will be transferred to an electronic 
folder, stored on the Ceci l G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research’s secure servers, 
separately from any data.   
 
Baseline Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in- person or by phone by the study staff. Study staff will bring a copy of the 
Baseline Interview to each in- person interview , or have a hard copy of the interview present during 
the telephone call . Before beginning, the study staff will write the appropriate ID# onto each interview. 
This ID# will have previously been assigned from the Screening Question naires. This interview will be 
done immediately after collecting c onsent from the participant, and will be done one- on-one, in 
person with the study staff. If a participant cannot complete it at the time of consenting, research staff 
and the participant wi ll complete the interview at another convenient time over the phone (or in 
person). To aid in the data collection, study staff will provide the participant with Likert Scale cards 
(laminated cards with response options to various questions within the inter view). This data will be 
collected no more than 2 weeks before the first session . 
v. 3.18.2021  16 Weekly Questionnaire:  
 
During the weekly sessions , the Weekly Questionnaire  as well as the Weekly Attendance will be 
collected by the two study instructors.  
 In order to collect this questionnaire confidentially, the study instructors will have a set of manila 
folders – one for each participant in the program. On the manila folders, will be a Post -It note with the 
participants’ name. Within each folder, will be a Weekly Questionnaire (with their ID# already put into 
their questionnaire). The instructor will hand out each folder to the study participants at the beginning 
of the session. Study participants will be instr ucted to complete the questionnaire, and put their 
answers back into the manila folder. At this point, the study instructor will collect all manila folders, and remove the Post -It notes with names, in order to immediately de- identify the collected data.  This 
process will happen weekly, at each session . 
 
For participants who need to miss a session, for whatever reason, they will be followed up with on the 
phone by study staff. Study staff will administer the Weekly Questionnaire – Absent Version.   
 For weekly sessions, study staff will meet with the intervention instructors once a week, in order to collect weekly hard copies of data from study instructors.   
 
Semi -Structured Focus Group Guide : 
 
The final session, a semi -structured feedback session on the Program and concepts explored in the 
program, includes a semi -structured focus group guide. This session will be audio- recorded.  
 
End-of-Program  Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in phone or in person by the study staff. Research assistant will attend the 
final session , and bring an Sign Up for End- of-Program Interview  for participants to choose when and 
in what form they would like to do the End- of-Program  interview. Slots will be offered immediately 
following the session , and for immediately before and after the final semi -structured focus group . For 
interviews that cannot be completed at those times, study staff and participant will arrange an 
alternative time to either conduct a phone interview, or an in- person i nterview, according to the 
participants’ convenience. Study staff will bring a copy of the End- of Program Interview to each in-
person interview, or  have a hard copy of the interview present during the telephone call . Once 
interview is confirmed (in person or phone call), study staff will arrange to either bring with them, or 
email or mail beforehand Likert cards (with response options for various questions in the interview)  to 
aid in participants’ responses . Before beginning, the study staff will write the appropriate ID# onto 
each interview. This ID# will have previously been assigned.  This interview will be collected no more 
than two weeks after the  end of the final session .  
 
3/6 Month Follow Up Interview:  
 
This data will be collected in phone or in person by the study staff. Study staff will bring a copy of 3/6 
Month Follow Up Interview to each in- person interview, or  have a hard copy of the interview present 
during the telephone call.  Once interview is confirmed (in person or phone call), study staff will 
arrange to either bring with them, or email or mail beforehand Likert cards (with response options for various questions in the interview ) to aid in participants’ responses . Before beginning, the study staff 
will write the appropriate ID# onto each interview. This ID# will have previously been assigned.  This 
data will be collected as close to the 3 month and 6 month mark post Wellbeing Program as is 
possible within the participants’ schedules. This means data will be collected either within the two 
weeks before the 3/6 month mark, or within the two weeks  after the 3/6 month mark.  
 
v. 3.18.2021  17 9.2 Data Management  
All data will be stored on computers and secure servers in locked offices within the Cecil G. Sheps Center 
for Health Services Research. All hardcopies of data will be stored in locked offices within the Sheps 
Center, accessible only to study staff. All ha rdcopies of data will be de- identified, with a linking ID# (as is 
the case for the Screening Questionnaire, Baseline Interview, Weekly Questionnaire, End- of-Program 
Interview, and 3/6 Month Follow Up Interview).  
Study staff will be double entering data int o Access Databases housed on the Cecil G. Sheps servers to 
ensure mistakes are not made during data entry. Analysis will be completed by the study staff analyst with the Program on Aging, Christopher Wretman.  
10 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS , REIMBURSMENT  AND CONFIDENTI ALITY   
10.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document  and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and 
approved by the IRB or ethics committee responsible for oversight of the study.  
10.2 Informed Consent Forms  
Two consenting processes are included in this study , an embedded consent for participation in the 
Screening Questionnaire and a written consent for participation in the study.  
 
A. The initial consent process is for the Screening Questionnaire of eligible participants. In the event 
that there are over 20 CNAs interested in a course at a single nursing home, eligible participants 
will be chosen from the highest scores on the Screening Questionnaire (which includes the 
Perceived Stress Scale). This questionnaire will be collected during information sessions by the 
research assistant.  
 
While presenting on the course during the information session, study staff will have with them Screeni ng Questionnaires with pre- printed ID#s, as well as an embedded consent on the first 
page of the questionnaire. For CNAs who choose to take the Screening Questionnaire over the phone, a verbal consent will be read out to them for their response.  
 
B. The second consent process will be with all participants’ who are committed to joining the CNA Wellbeing Program. Throughout the recruitment process, participants will be able to sign up on the interest sheet  to indicate their interest. These participants will be able to sign up physically, 
during the recruitment sessions, or reach out directly to study staff to have their name included on 
the interest sheet . Once CNAs have expressed interest, the study staff will reach out to them one-
on-one through their preferred method of communication (telephone, text, or email), and verify 
their commitment to the Wellbeing Program.  
 
Once commitment and eligibility have been confirmed, study staff will set up one- on-one 
meetings with participants in order to review the written consent form. This will take place up to 2 
weeks before the start date of the CNA Wellbeing Program. During th is in-person meeting, study 
staff will review the consent form with participants and answer any questions they may have. The 
study staff will ensure that they have one copy of the consent form, and that the participant has 
another copy. Once collected, all  physical consent forms will be kept in a locked office in the Cecil 
G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, where only study staff will have access.  
 
v. 3.18.2021  18 10.3 Reimbursement Schedule for Participants  
Each component of the study is associated with a separate compensation (refer to Table 3), and is a 
nominal, non- coercive amount, to reflect the time that they will be dedicating to the study.  
The CNA Wellbeing Program is being administered in two different forms of the intervention:  
1. Nurs ing Home 1 will have the standard, MSC program (8 weeks, 2.5 hours per week) 
administered  
2. Nursing Home 2 & 3 will have the modified, MSC program (6 weeks, 1.25 hours per week)  
The original compensation of $180 was awarded to persons in the NH #1, 8- week program, in which they 
were reimbursed $25 per interview, and $10 per class ($25 x 4, $10 x 8 = $180). This equates to $5.00 
per 1.25 hours of class, and $25.00 per interview. This reimbursement amount & schedule was changed 
after Nursing Home #1 , after receipt of feedback from participants that the reimbursement was not 
commensurate to their time dedicated to the project.  We also readjusted our reimbursement schedule in 
response to feedback –  rather than waiting until the end of the intervention to reimburse participants for 
the first time, we added in a mid- intervention reimbursement point.  
In response to feedback, the compensation per time spent in class doubled. For those in the 6- week, 1.25 
hour-Program, participants will be reimbursed a total of $140. This includes $80 in par ticipation in all 4 
interview ($20 each), and $60 for their participation in 7.5 hours of intervention ($10 per 6, 1.25 hours 
classes) .

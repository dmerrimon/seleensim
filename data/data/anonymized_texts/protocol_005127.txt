Abstract
Objectives:
Primary Objectives:
1)  To characterize the safety of yttrium-90 ibritumumab tiuxetan calculated to deliver up 
to 10 Gy to critical organs, when administered in conjunction with fludarabine and 
bendamustine as non-myeloablative preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation
 
Secondary Objectives:
1)  To estimate the efficacy of this strategy (overall survival and event-free survival) in 
patients with b-cell lymphoid malignancies
2)  To determine survival rates by histology subtype3)  To correlate blood radioactivity level and time to neutrophil and platelet recovery
Rationale: (Be as concise as possible)
Allogeneic non-myleoblative stem cell transplantation (NST) with fludarabine bendamustine and rituximab has been a successful strategy for patients with lymphomas and CLL who had a chemosensitive relapse (Protocol 2008-0246). Results, however, need to be improved upon in patients who had refractory disease or are in

kinetic failure at the time of transplantation. Intensification of the preparative regimen 
has been associated with increased toxicity with no improvement in outcomes. Immunomanipulation with donor lymphocytes or rapid immune suppression withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease without documented improvement in survival.
The anti-CD20 radioimmunoconjugates (RIC) (
90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan and iodine-131 
(131I) tositumomab produce durable remissions in previously treated patients who have 
relapsed or refractory, low-grade, follicular or transformed lymphoma. The standard 
dose of (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan is based on weight and is equal to 0.4 mCi/kg. 
Protocol (ID01-233), involving the use of this radiolabeled antibody together with 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as NST conditioning, has shown adequate engraftment and time to  recovery of counts. Results also suggest that the addition of RIC can overcome the negative prognostic impact of PET+ in NST transplantation, and that it can be curative for patients with refractory, relapsed follicular lymphoma.
 Results 
remained suboptimal, however for patients with other histologies, such as mantle cell and diffuse large cell lymphoma.  Optimizing drug delivery may improve outcomes.
Because myelosuppression is the major toxicity of anti-CD20 RICs, they are ideal 
candidates for dose-escalation with stem cell support. Phase I/II studies have demonstrated that anti-CD20 RICs may be dose escalated with limited toxicity and that higher radiation doses are associated with improved clinical outcomes.
Conventional, therapeutic-dose 
131 tositumomab or (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan has been 
added to the most commonly used high-dose chemotherapy program (i.e., carmustine, 
etoposide, cytarbine, melphalan [BEAM]) to intensify the regimen for NHL, but the combination has not been shown to be superior to high dose BEAM alone. More 
recently, the RIC was combined with BEAM
  with the goal of administering the highest 
possible dose of RIC without increasing toxicity. 
The dose of RIC was patient-specific, was based on dosimetry rather than weight, and 
was calculated to deliver cohort-defined  radiation-absorbed doses (RADs) to critical organs, excluding bone marrow and spleen. Fifteen Gy proved to be the maximum-tolerated RAD to critical organs. When doses were calculated according to weight, there was considerable variability among patients, which justified the dosimetry-based approach. Patient specific activity doses calculated to deliver a cohort-defined RAD to the critical organ varied widely. For example, the (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan doses administered to deliver an estimated 15 Gy to the liver in six patients ranged from 0.50 to 1.39 mCi/kg. Although eight patients safely received doses of 0.8 mCi/kg or greater, a weight-based strategy at twice the conventional 0.4 mCi/kg dose would have resulted in a wide range of RAD (median, 13 Gy; range, 4 to 31). Forty-four patients were treated. 
Thirty percent of patients had achieved less than a partial remission to their most recent 
therapy and would not have been eligible for autologous transplantation at most centers. Results were encouraging with an estimated 3-year PFS and Os rates of 43%

Abstract - Page 6
rituximab. 111In Ibritumumab may be directly infused by stopping the flow from the IV bag 
and injecting the radiolabeled antibody directly into the line. A 0.22 micron filter must be 
on line between the patient and the infusion port. The line will be flushed with at least 10 
mL normal saline after 111In Ibritumumab has been infused. 
D-22, -21 to -16 , Imaging . Planar scintigraphy whole-body imaging will be started on 
D-22 post  111In Ibritumumab infusion prior to voiding. Imaging will be repeated 3-6 hours 
later.  Whole-body planar scintigraphy imaging will be repeated between 22-26 hours, then between 70-74 hours, and later between 142-146 hours post 
111In Ibritumumab 
injection.  
D-15, Dosimetry . This trial requires patient-specific activities of (90Y) ibritumumab 
tiuxetan to deliver a maximum radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) of 10 Gy to vital organs, 
including liver, lungs, and kidneys. The methodology for estimating the RAD will be 
based on quantitative whole-body planar (2D) radionuclide imaging of (111In) 
ibritumumab tiuxetan pretreatment diagnostic tracer at multiple time points (5 in this 
proposal). The time-activity curves (TAC) of radiopharmaceutical uptake for different organs will be calculated and used as input to the FDA-approved OLINDA/EXM 1.1 model-based internal radionuclide dosimetry software for calculation of radiation-absorbed dose to critical organs. The RAD estimates will be corrected for critical organ mass that will be calculated from CT-based volume measurements. 
D-14, (
90Y) ibritumumab tiuxetan Administration.  (90Y) ibritumumab tiuxetan will be given 
post rituximab, as described above.  While each patient will be receiving a mCi/kg 
Zevalin dosage based on patient-specific radiation dosimetry, an attempt to homogenize the dosage will be undertaken.  For this purpose, the dosage will be rounded to one of the following values:  0.5 mCi/kg, 0.75 mCi/kg, 1.0 mCi/kg, 1.25 mCi/kg, 1.5mCi/kg.  
 
Each patient’s dosage will be rounded to the highest mCi/kg level that maintains the absorbed dose estimated from the dosimetry nearest, but not below 10 Gy to the critical organs (liver, lungs and kidneys). Dose will not be allowed to exceed 12 Gy to critical organs, as this has been shown in a previous published study to be well tolerated by those organs without additional toxicity.  If the dose nearest to but not below 10 Gy exceeds 12 Gy, the patient will be treated at the mCi/kg one level below. Patients who would be estimated to receive > 12 Gy to any of the critical organs at the 0.5 mCi/kg level will be treated at standard dosage (0.4 mCi/kg up to 32 mCi).
D-5, -4 and -3
, Fludarabine and Bendamustine will be administered following SCT&CT 
department standard practice. These will be dosed per adjusted body weight for 
patients weighing > 20% above their ideal body weight.  For patients less than or equal to 20% above their ideal body weight, the actual body weight is used.
Fludarabine will be administrated at a dose of 30 mg/m2 intravenously followed by 
Bendamustine at a dose of 130 mg/m
2  intravenously.

Optional Research Blood Samples :
D0, Measurement of Peripheral-Blood Radioactivity . A peripheral blood sample will be 
obtained prior to stem cell transplantation  on D0 for measurement of residual (90Y) 
radioactivity level in the blood. 
Duplicate, 1.0-mL whole-blood aliquots will be drawn on day 0.  A 1.0 mL ( 90Y) standard 
will be prepared from a decayed, known, (90Y) activity sample prepared on day -14. 
Blood, standard, and background samples will each be counted for 1 minute with a wide 
energy window in a thallium-doped sodium iodide crystal gamma scintillation well counter interfaced to a multichannel analyzer. After background correction, patient 
blood sample results will be expressed as mean microCi (
90Y)/mL in whole blood.
Supportive Treatment . All patients will receive Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) 
prophylaxis, infections disease prophylaxis, growth factors, blood and platelet 
transfusion and other supportive treatment as per standard practice in patients receiving allogeneic transplant.

Statistical Considerations:
Statistical section - patient sample size and analysis plan:
This is a Phase II study of high-dose (90Y) ibritumumab tiuxetan added to fludarabine 
and bendamustine in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.  The study will enroll 
a maximum of 20 patients. Patients will be enrolled in one of three histologies: follicular + other indolent histologies, mantle-cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  We wish to ensure that at least 10 patients are enrolled in each histology.  With a true incidence rate of 25%, the probability that we enroll at least 10 out of 20 patients in a

particular histology is greater than 95%. 
The primary endpoint of the protocol is safety and feasibility. Several studies, including 
protocol ID01-233 (ASH 2011, abstract 662) are showing a similar safety profile between matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplants. We believe that the safety profile will be similar in this study as well. However, we will report the results within each category, and we have added as a secondary analysis that we will repeat the primary analyses of event-free and overall survival stratified by transplant graft source.
Monitoring:
Two statistical monitoring rules are used to monitor the rate of TRM in all patients and 
the rate of engraftment failure/acute grade 4 GVHD in patients who receive a cord blood transplant.
TRM (All Patients):
We will use the method of Thall, Simon, and Estey to monitor the TRM rate in all 
patients within the first 100 days during the course of the trial.  We will assume a Beta(0.40, 1.60) prior distribution for the 100-day TRM rate, which has a mean of 20%.
The following decision rule will be used: stop accrual if at any time during the course of 
the trial 
Pr{100-day TRM rate > 20% | data from patients evaluated} > 0.975In other words, if at any time during the study we determine that there is at least a 
97.5% chance that the 100-day TRM rate is at greater than 20%, we will stop enrollment into the study.  For logistical reasons, patients will be monitored in cohorts of 5.  Stopping boundaries corresponding to this probability criterion are as follows: stop if:
[# of patients with TRM at day 100/ # of patients evaluated at day 100]
>/= 4/5, 6/10, 7/15, or 9/20
The operating characteristics for this rule are found in the table below.  If the true 
100-day TRM rate is less than the maximum targeted rate of 20%, the trial will stop early less than 6% of the time.
Engraftment Failure/Acute Grade 4 GVHD (Cord Blood Patients):
2011-0393
September 2, 2014
Abstract - Page 9
Because patients who receive a transplant from umbilical cord blood are at higher risk 
of engraftment failure and GVHD, we will also monitor the rate of engraftment failure or acute grade 4 GVHD in these patients.  We expect no more than 10 patients will receive a cord blood transplant.
We will use the method of Thall, Simon, and Estey to monitor the combined engraftment 
failure/grade 4 acute GVHD rate in cord blood patients within the first 100 days during the course of the trial.  We will assume a Beta(0.60, 1.40) prior distribution for the 100-day rate, which has a mean of 30%.
The following decision rule will be used: stop accrual in cord blood patients if at any time 
during the course of the trial 
Pr{100-day engraftment failure/grade 4 acute GVHD rate > 20% | 
data from cord blood patients evaluated} > 0.975
In other words, if at any time during the study we determine that there is at least a 
97.5% chance that the 100-day engraft failure/grade 4 acute GVHD rate is greater than 20%, we will stop enrollment into cord blood patients.  Stopping boundaries corresponding to this probability criterion are as follows: stop if:
[# of cord blood patients with engraft failure or grade 4 acute GVHD at day 100/ 
# of cord blood patients evaluated at day 100]
>/= 3/3, 5/6, 6/8, 7/10, 8/12, 9/14, 10/17, or 11/19

MC1841 5 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  1.0 Background  
Pancreatic cancer is currently the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the US and will soon cause 
the death of more Americans than breast cancer. Therapies are very limited and largely 
ineffective. In our own data sequencing 3,000 patients with pancreatic cancer (accepted in 
JAMA), approximately 3% of pancreatic cance r patients harbor germline mutations in DNA 
repair genes such as BRCA1/2 and PALB2 , and are therefore potential candidates for PARP-
inhibitor therapy. In addition, somatic mutati ons in Homologous Recomb ination Repair (HRR) 
genes can confer sensitivity as well, and have b een reported to double the number of patients 
potentially eligible for such th erapy. Recently, Waddell et al de fined 5 subtypes of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, with BRCA-like tumors, categorized as such by genomic instability, comprising 
15-20% of pancreatic cancer, with the latter identified as a potential target for immunotherapy strategies. (1) In breast and ovarian BRCA-mutant tumors, neoantigen load alone did not correlate with T-cell infiltration, suggesting that other therapies to disrupt the tumor 
microenvironment may be necessary to induce an  immune response. (2) The Keynote-162 study 
of niraparib and pembrolizumab has validated this  approach, with early reports of impressive 
efficacy. Of the first 8 platinum-resistant ovarian  cancer patients, 4 had confirmed responses, and 
4 had stable disease. One triple negative breast can cer patient (of 5) had SD for 10 cycles. (3) 
Although unselected trials in pancreatic cancer  with immunotherapy alone have yet to be 
successful, we hypothesize that induced genetic va riation with PARP inhibition disrupting the 
tumor microenvironment and increasing neoepitope  expression can sensitize tumors to immune 
checkpoint inhibition.  
We are currently funded by a Project in our NCI Pancreas SPORE grant to more fully define genetic identification of this subset of patient s and develop a therapeutic strategy. We have 
developed preliminary data (Figure 1) with R NAseq suggesting that potent PARP inhibition (in 
this case, talazoparib) is associated with gain of novel mutations in pancreas cell lines, even 
compared to cisplatin alone, or  irinotecan alone. In addition,  double-stranded break repair 
deficient tumors are associat ed with increased expression of genes involved in antitumor 
immunity, including CD8 positive T cell activators a nd regulatory molecules, in a similar pattern 
of that seen with MMR deficient tumors. (4)  
We propose that a combination of PARP inhibiti on and anti-PD1 therapy has valuable therapeutic 
potential in this subset of pancreatic cancer. Th e strong activity seen in the dose escalation phase 
of Keynote 162 in refractory ovarian and TNBC cancer hold promise for pancreatic cancer as 
well, as long as properly selected patients are enrolled. No reports have been published for the combination of PARP inhibition and checkpoint bloc kade in pancreatic can cer to date. However, 
given the potential for neoepitope formation in  patients with defective HRR deficiency upon 
exposure to PARP inhibition, we propose that there could be an additive or synergistic effect of the combination in HRR deficient pancreatic cance r. HRR deficient pancreatic cancer has largely 
been defined to date based on mutati ons in well-established genes such as BRCA1/2  and PALB2. 
However, more DNA repair associated genes are becoming associated with risk for pancreatic 
cancer and may well impact tumor phenotype.  
Therefore, we propose this single arm-cohort study. The goal would be to evaluate the combination of niraparib and TSR-042 in patie nts with germline or somatic mutations in 
BRCA1/2 or PALB2 .  
MC1841 6 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021   
Pre-clinical data: 
There are in vitro studies to suggest that th e immunotherapy in combination with PARP 
inhibition provides synergy.(Higuchi, Flies et al . 2015) In a syngeneic model of breast cancer, 
PARP inhibition was shown to increase PD-L1 expression (Figure 1 from Jiao et al). (Jiao, Xia et 
al. 2017) Additionally in the same set of experimen ts, to corroborate these findings of extent of 
PARP inhibition (through measurement of PARy lation enzyme activity, which are inhibited by 
PARP inhibitors), showed an inverse correlation (Figure 2 – see below). This supports that high 
level of PARP activity suppresses PD-L1 expression or stated another way, PARP inhibition was 
led to increased PD-L1 expression in these tumors.(Jiao, Xia et al. 2017)

(B), andMDA-MB-231 cells (C)were inoculated in to the mammary fad pad of nude mice, and the 
mice with established tumors were treated with olap arib or rucaparib. Tumors were then isolated 
to evaluate PD-L1 expression by immunoblotting  (A and B) or IHC staining (C). Black 
arrowheads, detected PD-L1 signals. Scale bar, 50 mm.

[From Open Access Article Jiao et al: (Jiao, Xia et al. 2017)] 
 PARP inhibition combinatorial strategies: PARP inhibitors are being explored in various c linical trials in combination with various other 
classes of drugs.(Drean, Lord et al. 2016) These in clude chemotherapies, targ eted therapies, novel 
targeted therapies, as a radiation sensitizer, endoc rine therapies and most recently several trials 
exploring the combination with immunotherapies.(S chaefer, James et al. 2011, Drean, Lord et al. 
2016, Papa, Caruso et al. 2016) This as noted above h as been of particular interest in patients with 
homologous-repair related breast and/ or ovarian cancers as well as increased interest to study this 

MC1841 9 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  now in prostate and pancreas cancers.(Javle, Go lan et al. 2016, Ang and Tan 2017, Golan and 
Javle 2017, Ramakrishnan Geethakumari, Schiewer  et al. 2017, Turk and Wisinski 2018) 
Furthermore, there is some data to suppor t use of immunotherapy for BRCA-related tumors 
whereby immunotherapy alone could potentially be  effective.(Matsuo, Spragg et al. 2018) The 
addition of PARP inhibition to further help augment responses in an aggressive disease like 
pancreas cancer would be of further value with ra tionale to supports its use as outlined. Figure 3 
from a recent review summarizes some of the ways how some of the ‘DNA-damaging’ drugs including PARP inhibition can affect the immunogenicity of tumors.(Brown, Sundar et al. 2018)

Resources available: 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center operates in 3 phys ical sites – Rochester, MN, Phoenix, AZ, and 
Jacksonville, Fl. We have pancreatic  cancer expertise at all 3 sites,  with annual unique pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma patients seen upwards of 700  patients. TEMPUS, FoundationOne, Carris or 
equivalent testing will be performed on patients as pa rt of standard of care testing. We anticipate 
5-8% of patients to be eligible for cohort based on our experience and published data on 
frequency of BRCA1/2 , and PALB2  mutations. Given genomic test ing is now done as part of 
standard of care, we anticipate rapid accrual.  

MC1841 11 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  All 3 sites are fully capable of research blood draws and biopsies. Tissue will be managed in 
FFPE, which will not require special handling or shipping. Fresh samples would also be collected 
for xenograft and/or organoid deve lopment and potentially RNA-Seq. There is one Mayo Clinic 
IRB and Cancer Center approval process, and though all 3 sites contract independently, there is 
an internal requirement for budgets  to align within a tight range of one another. We have recently 
hired a program coordinator for our pancr eas cancer group to speed timelines for trial 
development.

MC1841 15 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Nonchildbearing potential is defined as follows (by other than medical 
reasons): 
• ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for >1 year 
• Patients who have been amenorrhoe ic for <2 years without history 
of a hysterectomy and oophorect omy must have a follicle 
stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon 
screening evaluation 
• Post-hysterectomy, post-bilate ral oophorectomy, or post-tubal 
ligation. Documented hysterecto my or oophorectomy must be 
confirmed with medical record s of the actual procedure or 
confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with 
medical records of the actual pro cedure, otherwise the patient must 
be willing to use an adequate  barrier method throughout the study, 
starting with the scr eening visit through 180 days after the last 
dose of study treatment. Info rmation must be captured 
appropriately within the site’s s ource documents. Note: Abstinence 
is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception 
for the patient . 
3.29k History or active TB (Bacillus Tuberc ulosis) that in th e investigator’s 
opinion would preclude part icipation within the study. 
3.29l Any gastro-intestinal conditions that to the judgement of the investigator 
would interfere with the absorption of niraparib. 
3.29m Active, known or suspected unstabl e auto-immune disease, are excluded 
from this study. Exceptions to this cr iterion are all auto-immune disease 
that have remained stable within th e past 3 months on corticosteroids ( ≤ 
prednisone 20 mg or equi valent) prior to first st udy treatment are allowed 
to enroll. Patients with autoimmune diseases that do not require active 
immunosuppression are also  allowed to enroll. 
Note: Paraneoplastic disease as a cause of auto-immune phenomenon will not be considered as auto-immune disease and are allowed to enroll. 
3.29n Evidence of serious uncontrolled me dical disorder, active infection or 
mental disorder that, to  the judgement of the investigator, makes it 
undesirable for the subject to partic ipate in the study or that would 
jeopardize compliance with the protoc ol. Examples include, but are not 
limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled majo r seizure disorder, unstable spinal 
cord compression, superior vena cav a syndrome, or any psychiatric 
disorder that prohibits ob taining informed consent 
3.29o Prior malignancy which required active  systemic treatment within 2 years 
prior to first study treatment. Excep tions are: successfully treated 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, and in 
situ carcinoma of the cervix. Since patients with BRCA 1/2 or PALB2 can 
have other tumors, as long as they have  been definitively  treated, it would 
not be considered an exclusion.

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  9.5 Immunotherapy-related Adverse Events 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immunotherapy-related adverse 
events, which include but are not limited to the following:  
• Pneumonitis  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with syst emic corticosteroids (1mg/kg daily 
prednisone equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, 
steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3-4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids (1-
2mg/kg prednisone equivalent). Admi nister additional anti-inflammatory 
measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportu nistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration. 
 
• Diarrhea/colitis Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and 
symptoms of enterocolitis (such as dia rrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus 
in stool, with or without fever) and of  bowel perforation (such as peritoneal 
signs and ileus).  
o All patients who experience diarrhea/ colitis should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For 
Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider  GI consultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids (1mg/kg 
daily prednisone equivalent).  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids followed

ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with cortic osteroids (1mg/kg daily prednisone 
equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement 
of appropriate hormones may be require d as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3-4 events, treat with an initia
 l dose of IV corticosteroids (1-
2mg/kg prednisone equivalent) followe d by oral corticosteroids. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less,  steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 week s. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
MC1841 29 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  • Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism Thyroid disorders can occur at any 
time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at 
the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid 
disorders.  o Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as initial therapy. 
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3-4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV co rticosteroid (1-2mg/kg prednisone 
equivalent) followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, ster oid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 week s. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
• Hepatic  
o For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
 For Grade 3-4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids (1-
2mg/kg prednisone equivalent) for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Renal failure or nephritis  o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Rash 
o Grade 2 - Treat symptomatically with topical steroid cream, as well as 
antihistamines (i.e., loratidine, diphenh ydramine, etc.). For patients that

MC1841 32 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Definitions 
Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Any adverse event for which there is a reasona ble possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. 
Expedited Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor within 24 hours, 5 days or 10 days of study team becoming aware of 
the event. 
Routine Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor via case report forms 
Events of Interest 
Events that would not typically be considered to meet the criteria for expedited reporting, but that 
for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the review of 
safety data (may be requested by the FDA or the sponsor).  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site : 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 5.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to  the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the timeframe/mechan ism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is  required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a seri ous AE, which is defined in Section 10.4. 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events  - are those described within the S ection 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicab le), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not require d, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events  or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not re quired or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
MC1841 33 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/interv ention might exacerbate the exp ected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the co mmercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information  at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that th is information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refe r to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure 
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is  related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) 
on the SAME (Combination) Arm 
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (a re) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting. 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for investigational  agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention 
must be assessed as specified in the prot ocol. In general, only Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
that are unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent 
require an expedited report, unless hospita lization is required. Refer to Section 
10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions. 
• An investigational agent/ intervention might exacer bate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercia l agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a highe r degree of severity or specificity, 
expedited reporting is required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected  adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at thei r site. A list of known/expected AEs is 
reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via 
MedWatch 3500A  for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the 
form).   
MC1841 34 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  10.32 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur 
within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These events must still 
be reported via Routine Re porting (see Section 10.6).* 
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected 
as an expedited event. 
*Specific protocol exceptions to e xpedited reporting s hould be reported 
expeditiously by investigators ONLY  if they exceed the expected grade of the 
event.

event results in hospitalization, then the standard expedited adverse events reporting 
requirements must be followed.  
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse event” 
(i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence)  associated with the hospitalization: 
● Hospitalizations for respite care 
● Planned hospitalizations required by the protocol 
MC1841 35 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  ● Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the hospitalization 
has not changed post study drug administration) 
● Hospitalization for elective procedures unrelated to  the current disease and/or treatment on this trial 
● Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration of study 
drug 
● Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device ( e.g., battery replacement) that was in place 
before study entry 
● Hospitalization, or other serious outcomes for signs and symptoms of progression of the cancer. 
 
10.4 Expedited Reporting Requirements for IND Agents  
10.41 Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies: Expedited Reporting Requirements for 
Adverse Events that Occur on Studies under an IND within 30 Days of the Last Administration of the Investigational Agent/Intervention

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312) 
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64) 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:  
1) Death 
2) A life-threatening adverse event  3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospita lization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the abi lity to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life th reatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgm ent, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the abov e criteria MUST be immediately reported to the sponsor within

10.5 Other Required Reporting 
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS)  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS) in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity , or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and in formed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
2. Related or possibly related to particip ation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, ec onomic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated  with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs. 
MC1841 37 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Note: If there is no language in the prot ocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pr egnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 
reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the study should be reported as a UPIRTSO. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions: 
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPIRTSO, provide the appropr iate documentation and use the Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center Expedited Event Report Form . The Mayo Clinic 
Compliance Unit will review and process th e submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB 
and work with the IND Coordinator for submission to FDA. 
10.52 Death 
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided. 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited reporting within 24-
hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/inte rvention under an IND requires expedited 
reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the 
first 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that canno t be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of  life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
progression” under the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and 
administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e .g., radiological changes suggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinic al deterioration associated with a 
disease process) shoul d be submitted. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with inves tigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND will be reported per SAE timelines. Three options are available to describe the event: 
MC1841 38 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms ou tlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
10.55 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
If a female subject (or female partner of  a male subject) taking investigational 
product becomes pregnant, the subject taki ng should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female should be advi sed to call her healthcare provider 
immediately. The patient should have a ppropriate follow-up as deemed necessary 
by her physician. If the baby is born w ith a birth defect or anomaly, a second 
expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information a bout a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal gua rdian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to th e IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obta ined, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or a bortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient. 
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonata l loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this Form . 
10.551 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy)”  under the Pregnancy, pu erperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. Pregna ncy should be followed until the outcome is 
known. 
10.552 Fetal Death 
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by death in utero; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respiration, heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. 
MC1841 39 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  10.553 Death Neonatal 
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
cessation of life occurring during the first 28 days of life” that is felt by 
the investigator to be at least possibly due to the investigational agent/intervention, should be  reported expeditiously.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 
“General disorders and administration - Other (neonatal loss)”  
under the General disorders and administration SOC.  
10.6 Required Routine Reporting  
10.61 Baseline and Adverse Events Evaluations

10.81    Pregnancy Reporting  
The Sponsor Institution must report all pr egnancies associated with GSK product 
including follow up outcomes to GSK within 24 hours of awareness.  
Each pregnancy must be reported on a Pregnancy Notification Form within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the pregna ncy. Pregnancy is not an AE, and 
therefore does not need to be reported as an AE unless there is a suspicion that 
the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication.  
An elective abortion without complications should not be regarded as an AE, 
however, it should be reported as the outco me to the pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Follow-Up Form. Therapeutic abortions  should be reported as a treatment 
procedure; the reason for the therapeutic abortion should be reported on the Pregnancy Follow-Up Form and as an AE . Hospitalization for normal delivery of 
a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Follow-Up Form reported as an SAE on th e SAE Report Form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic a bortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birt h defect) and reported to the Sponsor 
Institution and GSK within 24 hours. Ho spitalization for normal delivery of a 
healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE.  
10.82 Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI)  
An Adverse Event of Special Interest is defined as any AE (serious or non-
serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment, 
for which ongoing monitoring and ra pid communication to the Sponsor 
Institution and to GSK is required.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib include the following:  
• Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
• Secondary cancers (new malignancies [other than MDS or AML]) 
• Pneumonitis 
MC1841 41 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  • Embryo-fetal toxicity 
AESIs should be reported on SAE Repor t Forms whether serious or not, as 
follows: 
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to 
the Sponsor Institution and to GSK upon awareness for any patient who 
has received niraparib (regardless of the timeframe since the last dose). 
• Pneumonitis should be reported to th e Sponsor Institution and to GSK 
through 90 days after the last dose of niraparib. 
• Embryo-fetal toxicity should be re ported as outlined in the Pregnancy 
reporting section. 
10.83 Special Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Me dication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental 
or Occupational Exposure  
• Abuse:  is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study 
treatment which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
• Misuse:  medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the authorized/approved product information. 
• Medication error: is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to 
inappropriate study treatment use or pati ent harm while the study treatment is 
in the control of the health care profession als or patients. Such incident may be 
due to health care professional practice, product labeling, packaging and 
preparation, procedures for administ ration, and systems, including the 
following: prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring, and use. 
• Overdose:  is a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a 
study patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per 
the study protocol and under the direction of the Investigator. If an overdose 
with a GSK product, the Sponsor In stitution and GSK should be notified 
immediately, and the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Associated 
AEs should be treated and monitored by the Investigator. The dosage of study drug administered, any associated AEs, and/or treatment provided to the patient because of the overdose, should be reported.  
• Accidental /Occupational exposure: is the unintentional exposure to a study 
treatment as a result of one’s professiona l or non-professional occupation, or 
accidental exposure to a non-professional  to whom exposure was not intended 
(i.e., study product given to wrong patient).  
Reporting Special Situations: All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and accidental or occupational exposure associated with a GSK 
product must be reported on a GSK SAE Re port Form with associated coversheet 
to the Sponsor Institution and to GSK within 5 business days of awareness 
regardless of whether or not an AE or SAE has occurred. If the abuse, misuse, 
medication error, overdose, or accidental  / occupational exposure is associated 
with an AE, an SAE Report Form must  also be submitted to the Sponsor 
Institution and to GSK within 24 hours of awareness.  
  
MC1841 42 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  10.84 Reporting to GSK

applicable regulatory body. 
10.85 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
Per regulatory requirements, if an event is assessed by the Sponsor Institution as 
a Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), it is the responsibility of the Sponsor Institution to submit the SUSAR to Regulatory Authorities according to applicable regulations. 
In addition, the SUSAR will be distribute d to the Investigators/sites utilizing a 
Council for International Organizations  of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) report 
form, or the MedWatch 3500A form). The Investigator/site will submit a copy of 
the report to their respective Institutiona l Review Board (IRB) or Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) and GSK per the governing institutional requirements and in compliance with local laws and guidelines. 
10.86 Reporting Product Complaints for GSK Products

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  10.87 GSK Reporting Requirements for ALL Serious Adverse Events:  
The following must be reported: 
Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose; 
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening (i.e., an event in wh ich the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to  an event that hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
Is an important medical event (defined as follows: --Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determ ining whether situations or events 
should be considered serious adverse events:  an important medical event 
may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes.  Ex amples of such events are allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convul sions that may require intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home but do not result in 
hospitalization, development of drug) 
11.0 Treatment Evaluation/Measurement of Effect  
Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Cr iteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1)
17 and iRECIST criteria18 which is discussed further starting in Section 11.5 below. 
Since iRECIST still uses RECIST 1.1 principles, the RECIST 1.1 criteria is also in this section as 
well.  
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumors and the short axis 
measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline. 11.1 Schedule of Evaluations 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every 6 weeks.  
11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non-Measurable Disease 
11.21 Measurable Disease 
• A non-nodal lesion is considered measurable if its longest diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥2.0 cm with chest x-ray, or as ≥1.0 cm with CT scan, 
CT component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
• A superficial non-nodal lesion is measurable if its longest diameter is ≥1.0 cm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e .g. skin nodules) or imaging. In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by co lor photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
• A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.5 cm 
when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  
• Tumor lesions in a previously irradi ated area are considered measurable 
disease under the following conditions:  
MC1841 44 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  - If there is a soft tissue component that has grown since completion of 
radiation. 
- Bone metastases with a soft tissue co mponent are considered measureable.  
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease 
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non-measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflam matory breast disease, and abdominal 
masses (not followed by CT or MRI),  are considered as non-measurable as 
well. 
• Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represen t cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet th e definition of measurability described 
above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non -pathological (i.e., normal) and should 
not be recorded or followed. 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
11.31 Measurement Methods 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers. 
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-
up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least 1 cm to less than 2 cm 
must use CT imaging for both pre- a nd post-treatment tumor assessments.  
• Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
when both methods have been used at the same evaluation to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease 
• Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If 
CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
o As with CT, if an MRI is performed , the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with co nventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.  
MC1841 45 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  • FDG-PET: FDG-PET scanning is allowe d to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease. 
A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is FDG avid 
with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the 
attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG-PET scanned lesion is considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to th e following algorithm: 
o Negative FDG-PET at baseline with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
o No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, a dditional follow-up CT scans (i.e., 
additional follow-up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of 
PD will be the date of the initial abnormal PDG-PET scan.  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, 
it is not classified as PD. 
FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in  this circumstance has been described 
in the protocol and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
11.33 Measurement at Follow-up Evaluation:  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory  to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease. 
Cytologic and histologic techniques can be  used to differentiate between PR and 
CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
11.4 Measurement of Treatment/Intervention Effect  
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• The protocol defined irradiated tumor wi ll not be considered for response in the 
primary endpoint. 
• The protocol defined irradiated tumor will be considered for secondary endpoint response. 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21 ) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” 
MC1841 46 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  and recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non-nodal or 
nodal (as defined in Section 11.21 ), where no more than 2 lesions are from the 
same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
• Note: If fewer than 5 (for phase III trials  replace with “3”) target lesions and 
target lymph nodes are identified (as ther e often will be), there is no reason to 
perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover 
new lesions.  
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements. It may be 
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node ) which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected.  
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes 
will be calculated and reported as the pos t-baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD). 
If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or 
target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the 
target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measure, a default value of 0.5 cm should be assigned. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the PBSD. 
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non-Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease ( Section 11.22 ) are classified as non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. These 
lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
11.43 Response Criteria 
All target lesions and target lymph no des followed by CT/MRI/PET-CT/Chest X-
ray/physical examination must be measur ed on re-evaluation at evaluation times 
specified in Section 11.1 . Specifically, a change in obj ective status to either a PR 
or CR cannot be done without re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
Note: Non-target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be evaluated at each 
assessment, especially in the case of firs t response or confirmation of response. 
In selected circumst ances, certain non-target organs may be evaluated less 
frequently. For example, bone scans ma y need to be repeated only when 
complete response is identified in targ et disease or when progression in bone is 
suspected. 
MC1841 47 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.431 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
o Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
 Disappearance of all target lesions. 
 Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to < 
1.0 cm. 
o Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD (see Section 11.41). 
o Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
 At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.  
 At least a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD ( Section 11.41 ). In addition, the PBSD must also 
demonstrate an absolute increas e of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
 See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG-PET imaging. 
o Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD. 
11.432 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions & Non-target Lymph Nodes 
o Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
 Disappearance of all non-target lesions.  
 Each non-target lymph node must have a reduction in short axis 
to <1.0 cm. 
o Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions or 
non-target lymph nodes. 
o Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
 At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.  
 Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion and target lymph node status. It must be representative of overall disease status change.)  
 See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG-PET imaging. 
  
MC1841 48 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.44 Overall Objective Status 
The overall objective status for an evaluation is determined by combining the

11.45 Symptomatic Deterioration  
Patients with global deterioration of h ealth status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not 
either related to study treatment or othe r medical conditions, should be reported 
as PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even afte r discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration. 
11.5 Immune-Related Response Assessment (iRECIST) 
All study endpoints requiring measurement data will be assessed per RECIST criteria (defined above). Patients will not be requir ed to end study participation at the first 
evidence of progression since Immunotherapeuti cs may result in infiltration of immune 
cells leading to transient increase in the size of malignant lesions, or undetectable lesions 
becoming detectable. For this reason, iRECIST
18 will be utilized in order to help to make 
the decision to remove a patient from the study after first evidence of progression. The 
criteria are identical to those of RECIST 1. 1 in many respects but have been adapted to 
account for instances where an increase in tu mor burden, or the appearance of new 
lesions, does not reflect true tumor progression.  Key differences are described below. All 
responses defined using iRECIST criteria are designated with a prefix. 
MC1841 49 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.51 Confirming Progression  
Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses 
the terms iUPD (unconfirmed progressi on) and iCPD (confirmed progression). 
Confirmatory scans should be performed at least 4 weeks, but not longer than 9 
weeks after iUPD. 
For patients that had an iUPD in the pr evious assessment, iCPD is confirmed in 
two ways: 
1) Existing iUPD gets worse in any lesion type (target, non-target, or new 
lesions) which contributed to the current iUPD status (a patient can have 
more than one of the following sources of iUPD). 
If iUPD was at least partially based on… Then iCPD is confirmed if… 
Target lesions A cumulative in crease (can occur over multiple 
assessments) of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum from the first occurrence of the current iUPD 
Non-target lesions Any increase in the non-target lesion burden 
from the first occurrence of the current iUPD 
New lesions A cumulative increase (can occur over multiple 
assessments) of at least 5 mm in the absolute 
value of the sum of those considered to be target 
new lesions or any new lesions (from the first occurrence of the current iUPD) 
2) RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesion types (target, non-target, or new lesions) which did not contribute to current iUPD status, including the appearance of new lesions. 
If a patient meets either (or both) of these criteria, they are considered to have 
confirmed progression (iCPD). See Appe ndix III for examples of confirming 
progression. 
11.52 New Lesions  
New lesions should be assessed and measured as they appear using RECIST 1.1 
criteria, and recorded as New Lesion-Target (NLT) and New Lesion-Non-Target (NLNT) to allow clear differentiation fro m baseline target and non-target lesions. 
New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD). However, the measurements of NLT should NOT be included in the sum 
of measures of original target lesions identified at baseline. 
Progression is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging 
assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but  not more than 9 weeks) after iUPD 
confirms further progression from iUPD with either an increase of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR and increase (but not necessarily 
unequivocal increase) in the size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of new lesions. 
  
MC1841 50 Amendment 2

13.6 Non-CNS iCPD   
Patients who develop non-CNS iCPD at any time should have an end of treatment visit, then a clinical follow-up visit 30 days post-treatment, then go to the survival follow-up 
phase. These patients should be treated with a lternative chemotherapy if their clinical 
status is good enough to allow further therapy.  
13.7 Ineligible 
A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility criteria for study entry. If 
the patient received treatment, the patient may continue treatment at the discretion of the 
physician as long as there are not safety concerns. The patient will continue in the Active 
Monitoring/Treatment phase of the study, as per Section 4.0 of the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on-st udy material must be submitted. Survival 
Follow-up will be required per Section 4.0 of the protocol.

15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 TSR-042 (dostarlimab) 
15.11  Background TSR-042 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4) isotype that binds with high affinity to PD-1, resulting in inhibition of 
binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2. TSR-042 is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in a mammalian expression sy stem using a stable Chinse hamster 
ovary (CHO) cell line. 
15.12 Formulation 
TSR-042 50 mg/mL drug product is a single use sterile liquid formulation that 
can readily be diluted in an IV solution fo r intravenous administration. It is a pH 
6.0 formulation containing 50 mg/ml TS R-042, 25 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM 
arginine, 31 mM sodium chloride, and 0.02% polysorbate 80. The deliverable 
volume in each vial is 10 mL.15.13  
15.13 Preparation and storage 
The product should be stored between 2°C and 8°C, and in accordance with the 
Pharmacy Manual or protocol as provided by the Sponsor. 
15.14 Administration 
TSR-042 is administered as an intrav enous infusion in accordance with the 
Storage and Handling Guidelines provided by GSK.  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information  
Absorption: TSR-042 is administered IV, thus absorption is not 
applicable. Distribution: The Vss of TSR-042 was determined in subjects participating in 
Part 1 of Study 4010-01-001 following a 30-minute IV infusion. The mean Vss was 74.2, 71.7, and 60.7 mL/kg following the administration of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, respectively. These results sugg est a limited distribution outside the 
vascular space, which is consistent w ith the behavior of endogenous IgG.   
Metabolism: TSR-042 is a therapeutic mAb IgG4, which is expected to be catabolized into small peptides, amino acids, and small carbohydrates by lysosome through fluid-phase or receptor-mediated endocytosis.  
Elimination: The clearance of TSR-042 was dete rmined in subjects participating 
in Part 1 of Study 4010-01-001 following single IV infusion. The mean clearances were 0.201, 0.117, and 
MC1841 56 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  0.152 mL/h/kg for the 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Body weight 
(range 45.6 to 145.6 kg) was not a significant covariant for TSR-042 clearance. 
The estimated terminal t½ was approximately 13 to 18 days.  
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions  
No drug-drug interaction studies have  been conducted. Monoclonal antibodies 
such as TSR-042 are not substrates for cytochrome P450 or drug transporters, 
and are unlikely to be cytokine modul ators. Additionally, pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interactions of TSR-042 with small molecule drugs are not expected. There 
is no evidence of drug-drug interactions mediated by non-specific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies.
 
15.17 Known potential adverse events  
Common potential adverse events (>10%): Central nervous system: Fatigue 
Dermatologic: Pruritus, rash, maculopapular rash 
Endocrine & metabolic: im mune-mediate endocrinopat hy – especially thyroid, 
pituitary and adrenal  Gastrointestinal: Nausea, diarrh ea, vomiting, decreased appetite 
Hematologic: Anemia 
Neuromuscular & skeletal: arthralgia  
Less common potential adverse events, 1% - 10%: 
Hepatic: increased AST, increased ALT Respiratory: immune-mediated pneumonitis—dyspnea, chest pain, cough 
Rare potential adverse events, <1%: 
Gastrointestinal: immune-mediated colitis 
15.18 Drug procurement  
Investigational TSR-042 will be supplied free of charge by GSK. 
Outdated or remaining drug is to be destroyed on-site as per procedures in place 
at each institution. 
15.2 Niraparib (Zejula®, formerly MK-4827) 
15.21 Background 
Niraparib is an orally available, potent, highly selective poly (adenosine 
diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and PARP2 inhibitor being developed as a monotherapy agent for tumo rs with defects in the homologous 
recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway and as a sensitizing agent in combination with cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy as well as in combination 
with immune-oncology biologics. 
15.22 Formulation 
Investigational Niraparib is available for clinical trials as 100 mg capsules filled 
with a dry blend of niraparib tosylate  monohydrate, lactose monohydrate, and 
magnesium stearate in a hard gelatin capsule.  
15.23 Preparation and storage  
Niraparib 100 mg capsules are packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles fitted with child-resistant plastic  closures. Niraparib 100-mg capsules 
MC1841 57 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  have a proposed shelf-life of up to 36 months when stored in the intended 
container closure system and under the conditions specified in the Storage and 
Handling Guidelines. 
15.24 Administration 
Capsules should be administered once daily at approximately the same time each 
day.  
Food does not significantly affect the absorption of niraparib; therefore, niraparib 
may be taken without regard to meals. 
If a patient vomits or misses (greater  than 12 hours from normal dosing time) a 
dose of niraparib, an additional dose should not be taken. The next dose should 
be taken at the regularly scheduled time.  
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information  
Niraparib exhibits linear pharmac okinetics (PK), and exposure is dose 
proportional. Absorption and clearance are dose-independent (range: 30 to 400 mg). 
Absorption:  Following a single-dose administration of 300-mg niraparib under 
fasting conditions, niraparib was measurable in plasma within 30 minutes, and 
the mean Cmax for niraparib was reache d in about 3 hours. Following multiple-
oral doses of niraparib from 30 mg to 400 mg QD, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2-fold. 
The systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-
proportional manner when the dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of nirapa rib is approximately 73%, indicating 
minimal first-pass effect. 
Concomitant intake of a high-fat meal di d not significantly affect the PK of 
niraparib after administration of 300 mg of niraparib. 
Distribution: Niraparib was moderately boun d to human plasma proteins 
(approximately 83.0%). The apparent Vd /F was 1220 L, indicating extensive 
tissue distribution of niraparib. In a population PK analysis, the Vd/F of niraparib 
was 1074 L in patients with cancer. 
Metabolism:  Niraparib is metabolized primarily by CEs to form a major inactive 
metabolite, M1. In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed 
M1 glucuronides) were the major circulating metabolites. The mean t½ of M1 
was 88 hours. The exposure ratio of M1 to  niraparib was approximately 1.3- to 
2.2- fold in plasma. 
Elimination: Following a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean t½ of 
niraparib ranged from 48 to 51 hours (approxi mately 2 days). In a population PK 
analysis, the CL/F of niraparib was 16.2 L/h in patients with cancer. Niraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following administration of a single oral 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average, 
86.2% (range: 71% to 91%) of the dose was recovered in urine and feces over 21 
days. Radioactive recovery in urin e accounted for 47.5% (range: 33.4% to 
60.2%) and in feces for 38.8% (range: 28.3%  to 47.0%) of the dose. In pooled 
samples collected over 6 days, 40.0% of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as metabolites, and 31.6% of  the dose was recovered in the feces 
primarily as unchanged niraparib. 
MC1841 58 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  15.26 Potential Drug Interactions  
No formal drug interaction studies ha ve been performed with niraparib.  Neither 
niraparib nor the major metabolite M1 is an inhibitor of any drug-metabolizing 
CYP enzymes. A clinically meaningful drug interaction via inhibition of CYPs is highly unlikely. 
Niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 in vitr o; therefore, investigators should be 
advised to use caution with drugs that ar e sensitive substrates for CYP1A2 with a 
narrow therapeutic range, i.e., theophylline and tizanidine. M1 is not a CYP1A2 
inducer.
  
15.27 Potential adverse events   
Common potential adverse events (>10%):  
Cardiac: Hypertension, palpitations   Central nervous system: Fatigue, headache, insomnia, dizziness

medications for potential overlap of other medications that prolong the 
QTc interval. 
15.292  Fatigue was common. Instruct patient in energy conserving lifestyle. 
15.293 Gastrointestinal side effects, included diarrhea, anorexia, and nausea. 
Instruct patients to report these side effects and treat symptomatically. 
Monitor for effectiveness of intervention. 
MC1841 59 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  15.294 Dyspnea and cough have been seen. In addition isolated cases of 
pneumonitis have been seen. Instruct patient to report any shortness of 
breath to the study team. 
15.295 Pain including headache, back a nd extremity pain have been reported. 
Administer analgesics as needed and assess for their effectiveness. 
15.296 Monitor CBC w/differential as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
neutropenia are common. Instruct patients to report any unusual bruising or bleeding and/or sign/symptoms of infection to the health care team. 
15.297 Electrolyte abnormalities have been seen with agent. Monitor closely.  
15.298 Hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive 
medicinal products as well as adjustment of the niraparib dose, if 
necessary. Niraparib should be discontinued in case of hypertensive 
crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately 
controlled with antihypertensive therapy. 
15.299 Posterior revsersible encephal opathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare 
neurologic disorder that can pr esent with the following signs and 
symptoms including seizures, headache, altered mental status, visual 
disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated 
hypertension. In patients developing PRES, treatment of specific symptoms including control of hypertension is recommended, along with discontinuation of niraparib. 
16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Primary Endpoint and Analysis:  
This is a single arm Phase II study designed to determine as primary endpoint the disease 
control rate at 12 weeks (DCR12), using th e standard iRECIST criteria of patients 
receiving the combination of niraparib and TSR-042. Because the study features a heterogeneous population featuring 3 differen t genetic/somatic mutations, there will be 
no interim analysis. The study will stay rema in open, unless a higher than expected 
toxicity issue is identified.  
DCR12 definition and determination: 
For this protocol, the patients must undergo response scanning according to the iRECIST 
criteria. The DCR12 is defined as the percentage  of patients who have either iCR, iPR or 
iSD at 12 weeks. Patients who have developed a iUPD at 6 weeks will only be considered to have achieved disease control at 12 weeks, if at 12 weeks there is no confirmation of 
disease progression (iCPD) and the patient regresses to either iCR, iPR or iSD. DCR will 
be analyzed descriptively as a point es timate with a 95% confidence interval. 
The primary endpoint will assess the disease control rate at 12 weeks (DCR12), using the standard iRECIST criteria (see Section 11.0, where 11.5 specifically discusses iRECIST). All eligible patients who are registered and start treatment will be evaluable for the 
DCR12. A 1-stage design will be utilized (see below). This design has 80% power to 
detect an improvement in DCR12 from 25% to 50%, with a significance level of 0.10. See 1-stage design details below: 
Final analysis: We will enroll 19 eligible patie nts total. As various different types of 
mutations are to be included, various respon se patterns are possible; therefore the result 
MC1841 60 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  (expressed as the DCR12) might indicate but will not definitively be able to conclude that 
the treatment is worthwhile. If at least 8 pa tients are a success for DCR12 in the first 19 
eligible patients (41%), the treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation. 
Otherwise, depending upon per mutations results, the study might continue or the 
treatment is considered unworthwhile and can  be permanently closed due to lack of 
efficacy.  
16.2 Secondary Endpoints and Analysis:  
The following endpoints will be assessed  as well: objective response rate (ORR), 
duration of confirmed stable disease according to iRECIST, time to next treatment (TTNT), overall survival , time to and du ration of confirmed response, progression-free 
survival, and adverse events.  
Response rate: The confirmed response ra te (by iRECIST ) will be assessed. Any 
confirmed response that occurs during the fi rst 8 cycles of treatment will count as a 
success (24 weeks). Per iRECIST, responses need to be confirmed (2 consecutive 
responses at least 4 weeks apart) to count as a response. We will also assess the duration 
of confirmed stable disease according to iRECIST. All eligible patients who are 
registered and start treatment will be evaluable for response.  
Time to next treatment (TTNT): The TTNT is  defined as the time from the end of study 
treatment to receiving the next treatment. TTNT will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method.  
Overall Survival: Overall Survival (OS) is  defined as the time from study entry to death 
from any cause. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Time to and Duration of Confirmed Respon se: The time to response and duration of 
confirmed responses will be assessed using th e Kaplan-Meier method, where the time to 
response will be the time from registration to  confirmed response and the duration of 
confirmed response will be defined as the time from the first documented date of 
confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date at which progression is first documented.  
Progression-Free Survival: Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
study entry to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause, where 
disease progression will be determined based on iRECIST criteria. PFS will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Adverse events: The maximum grade for each t ype of adverse event will be summarized 
using CTCAE version 5.0. The frequency and percentage of gr ade 3+ adverse events will 
be estimated. We’ll also assess AEs at least possibly related to treatment as well.  
16.3 Translational endpoints 
The goals of the translational studies are to assess germline DNA and serum markers of 
immune response, to determine changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profile after 
therapy with a PARPi and a PD-1 inhibitor, to study mechanisms of resistance in ctDNA 
profile after therapy with a PARPi and a PD-1 inhibitor, to assess the tumor microenvironment for immune related chang es (immune infiltration, PD-L1 and PD-1 
expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL ]), to assess genetic profile of the tumor 
pre- and post-treatment, and to determine cha nges in the cytokine profile pre- and post-
treatment. 
Due to the limited sample size, these analyses will be hypothesis generating and 
descriptive in nature. Descriptive statistics will be summarized and the blood and tissue marker data will be correlated with clini cal endpoints (response, DCR12, duration of 
MC1841 61 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  response, OS, PFS, advere events, etc.). For time-to-event data, the Kaplan-Meier method 
will be used. For categorical data, we’ll use th e Fisher’s exact test. For marker data used 
to predict binary outcomes (i.e. response vs . no response), we’ll use Logistic regression 
models.  
16.4 Total sample size and study duration 
To account for possible drop-outs, cancellations, etc. we plan to accrue 20 total patients. 
We plan to accrue around 2 patients per month, so the study accrual phase should be 
around 10 months total. The final analysis can be done around 24 months after the study 
begins, which includes time for data entry, clean-up, and analysis.  
16.5 Data & Safety Review 
16.51 Reviews 
The principal investigator(s) and the st udy statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
16.52 Adverse Event Stopping Rule: The stop ping rule specified below is based on the 
knowledge available at study developmen t. We note that the Adverse Event 
Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduc t of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. Accrual may be temporarily su spended to this study if at any time we 
observe events considered at least possi bly related to study treatment (ie, an 
adverse event with attribute specified as  “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) 
that satisfy the following: 
• If 3 or more of the first 10 patients (or 30% or more of all patients after 10 are accrued) experience a Grade 4 AE. With exceptions: cytopenia, 
fatigue,  
• If 2 or more experience a Grade 5 AE at any time. 
After consideration by the study team (study chair, statistician, etc.), a decision 
will be made as to whether accrual can be resumed. 
16.6 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
This study will be available to all eligible patients regardless of race, gender, or ethnic 
group.  
16.61 Statistical analysis by subset 
There is no information currently availabl e regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender , or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Ther efore, although the planned analyses will 
look for differences in treatment effect b ased on racial groupings, the sample size 
is not increased in order to provide a dditional power for subset analyses.

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  17.4 Background and Methodology 
17.41 For tissue biopsies before, during and post treatment, goal is to study changes in 
tumor microenvironment and mutational st atus post-exposure to PARP inhibition 
and immunotherapy. The biopsy samples will be biobanked for these analyses in 
the future. These would include assessment of PD-L1 expression and assessment 
of mutational status pre- and post-e xposure to immunotherapy. PD-L1 expression 
and changes in microenvironment woul d be assessed by immunohistochemistry 
using standard approved antibodies. 
17.42 For assessment of mutational status, co mprehensive tumor based genetic testing 
will be performed to study changes in mutational load to exposure of PARP 
inhibition and immunotherapy over time. 
17.43 If feasible, samples would also be collected for xenograft development for 
potential future studies looking into drug based studies and to study uptake of grafts from these patients.

organization roster at the enrolling site. 
18.4 Site responsibilities 
Each site will be responsible for insuring th at all materials contain the patient’s initials, 
MCCC registration number, and MCCC protoc ol number. Patient’s name must be 
removed. 
18.5 Supporting documentation 
This study requires supporting documentation for diagnosis, progression, and genetic 
sequencing prior to study entry as well as for evidence of response to study therapy and 
progression after study therapy. These documents should be submitted within 14 days of 
registration (for prior to study entry materials)  or within 14 days after the visit at which 
response or progression is determined. 
 If a bone marrow aspirate collection is conducted (as indicated in the test schedule for 
subjects diagnosed with MDS/AML), the bi opsy report will be required as supporting 
documentation.

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Appendix III Examples of confirmed progression  
The following examples show how a patient that is currently an iUPD can become an iCPD (confirmed 
progression). These examples all use target lesion growth as the source of the first progression (iUPD) 
and show how additional informati on in future assessments can lead to iCPD. The examples are not 
exhaustive, but are meant to be illustrative of how  iCPD can occur. Similar examples can be created 
where non-target lesions and/or new lesions led to the initial iUPD. 
1) iUPD due to target lesion growth from baseline followed by iCPD due to continued growth of 
target lesions (by at least 5 mm).

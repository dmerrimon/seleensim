 BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) relieves pain and improves function in patients with rotator cuff -
deficient arthropathy .2, 5 RTSA has consistently been reported to improve forward elevation and pain, however,  
its effect on inte rnal and external rotation has been  less predictable .6 Some studies indicate that humeral 
component version plays a role in improvement of humeral rotati on following RTSA, however, the published 
data is contradictory and inconclusive. Several biomechanical studies have suggested that increasing humeral 
component retroversion may improve external rotation, while subsequently decreasing internal rotation . 1,2,4 
Conversely, Henninger et al . reported on a cadaveric study that showed no differences in rotation over a range 
of different humeral component versions .3  A retrospective study by Rhee et al.  also suggests that increasing 
humeral component retroversion does not affect measured internal or exter nal rotation. H owever , they found 
that patients with neutral version may experience better function with daily activities requiring internal rotation 
compared to those with 20 degrees of retroversion .5  Prospective  data on clinical outcomes comparing different 
humeral component versions in RTSA is currently lacking.   
The proposed study is a prospective, double -blinded, randomized trial to investigate the impact of humeral 
component version on shoulder range -of-motion and patient -reported functional outcomes following reverse 
total shoulder arthroplasty . 
OBJECTIVE  
➢ The primary objective  of this study is to determine whether external rotation  and internal rotation  two 
years postoperatively  is impacted by  humeral c omponent version  in reverse shoulder arthroplasty  
➢ The secondary objective  is to determine  whether functional outcomes  two years postoperatively  are 
impacted by  humeral component version in reverse shoulder arthroplasty  
HYPOTHESIS  
➢ Patients that receive  RTSA  with  the humeral component positioned in  30 degrees of retro version will 
have greater external rotation  and worse internal rotation  postopera tively than those that have  0 
degrees of  version . 
➢ Patients  that receive RTSA with the humeral component positioned  in 0 degrees of version will have 
higher functional outcomes scores , due to improved internal rotation, than those that have 30 degrees 
of retroversion.  
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY  
We will perform a prospective, randomized tria l with a total of 85 patients. Patients undergoing  primary  RTSA by 
Dr. J. Michael Wiater at Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak  will be screened for eligibility . After the patient has been 
consented they will be randomized to one of the following two groups:  
1. RTSA with h umeral component positioned in 0 degrees of version  
2. RTSA with h umeral component positio n in 30 degrees of retroversion  
The patient will be blinded to the study group.

• Patients not undergoing a standard -of-care  physical therapy proto col 
• Pregnant, patient -reported  
• Minors (under 18 years of age)  
• Cognitively impaired  
ENROLLMENT AND CONSE NT 
Patients scheduled to undergo reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with Dr. Wiater will be screened 
preoperatively for eligibility . Patients will be identified  in the clinic  and by operative schedules. Patients that 
meet all criteria will be contacted by personnel on the delegation of authority as a consent provider before their 
procedure. If the patient is interested, the research coordinator will offer  to email or mail a copy of the consent 
for the patient to review beforehand. During the time of consent, the patient  will confirm they have read and  
understand the consent. Patients can discuss any questions they may have with the consent provider at this 
time. Patients will be allowed to drop out of  the study at any time before or after their procedure.  
RANDOMIZATION  
The 85 patients enrolled in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to have their procedure performed either 
with a humeral component positioned in 0 degrees of version or 30 
 degrees of retroversion . Randomization as signments will be contained in  sequentially numbered, opaque , 
sealed envelopes, which will be prepared by a statistician in the research institute. After the patient is 
consented, the y will be assign ed to a group following the treatment  listed in the envelope . Key personnel not 
collecting data will perform randomiz ation and  inform the surgeon  of the group  in order to keep data collection 
blinded . The patient will  also remain blinded to their assignment. Logs will be maintained by the randomizing  
personnel.  
DATA COLLECTION  
Baseline data will be collected before the patient’s procedure, after consent has been signed. Patients will be  
followed at standard -of-care  follow -up appointments in the clinic at 3 months, 6 months, one year, and two 
years postoperatively.  To help prevent dropouts, follow -up requirements will be discussed with the patient 
before consent and all patients will be called as each time point approaches to schedule follow -up 
appointments.  At each appointment the patient will complete  patient -repor ted outcomes questionnaires  and 
will undergo a physical exam with a clinical research coordinator  blinded to the patient’s study group . Standard -
of-care x -ray images will also be assessed .

STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
SAMPLE SIZE 
We performed a sample size  analysis to determine how many patients are needed to be able to detect the 
minimal clinically important difference in shoulder external /internal  rotation , which is between 14 ° and 22° .7 We 
used  80% power and a significance level  of 0.05 , and  based on a review of the literature, we expect a standard 
deviation between 8 ° and 18°.5 Table I illustrates for each effect size, the minimum detectable difference with a 
standard deviation of 8° and of 18°. Using a sample size of 35  per gro up (effect size = 0.68), we would be able to 
detect between 5.4 ° and 12.2° difference , which will be sufficient to detect a clinically important difference.

DATA ANALYSIS  
The range -of-motion, strength measures , patient -reported outcomes scores,  and patient demographic factors 
will be compared between the two treatment groups. A table of descriptive summaries by treatment group will 
be prepared (means and standard deviations if normally distributed, median and range if not normally 
distributed, counts and percentages for categorical variables). Confidence intervals for the means/medians fo r 
each of the two groups will also be computed . The change from baseline as well as  the absolute postoperative 
outcomes measurements will be used for comparison. Before comparing continuous variables, data sets will be 
assessed for normality using a Shapiro -Wilk Test. For normal data , an independent student’s t -test will be used 
to compare means.  A Mann -Whitney Rank Sum Test will be used for data that is  ordinal or  not normally 
distributed. The two treatment groups will be compared on categorical vari ables using the Fisher’s Exact test.  
Missing data will not be imputed, but the number of data points available at each time point postoperatively will 
be clearly reported in publications. For all test s, a p-value < 0.05 will be considered statis tically sig nificant . A 
Bonferroni correction will be used to account for repeated measures and control for a Type I error . Graduate -
trained engineers will analyze data with SPSS stati stical software (SPSS Version 22 .0, IBM, Inc).

 RISKS AND BENEFITS  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  TO SUBJECTS  
Patients enrolled in the study may have better range -of-motion or function if one technique proves superior. 
However, there may be no direct benefit from inclusion in this study.  It is hoped that the results of this study 
will help doctors le arn which treatment is most effective for maximizing outcomes after reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty.  
POTENTIAL RISKS TO S UBJECTS  
The risks of participating in th is study include the same risks normally associated with reverse total shoulder 
arthroplast y surgery whether the patient is in the study or not. Both techniques ( 30 degrees of humeral 
component retroversion versus 0 degrees of version) are standard -of-care, based on surgeon preference. There 
is a chance that patients enrolled in the study may ha ve worse range -of-motion or function if one technique 
proves inferior. However, this has yet to be proven.  
With any procedure, unusual, unexpected or previously unreported side effects may occur. Risks will be 
assessed throughout the course of the study.  
There is also the rare risk of brea ch of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to maintain p atient privacy, 
however this cannot b e guaranteed.  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
The participant s will be monitored for risks and AEs related to surgery or the device throughout the course of 
the study. The PI will be responsible for tracking the occurrence of AEs while the patient  is enrolled in the study. 
The PI will determine the relationship between the study -based  surgical technique  (i.e. humeral version) and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE .

Subjects will then switch to using S tudy Catheter   immediately without interruption. The 
 begins the day they use their first study Catheter  Subjects ar e expected to use  
 ICs  according to their typical routine . Study events include 
completion of electronic ICF, eligibility screening form, baseline form, daily questionnaires, and one end -
of-study questio nnaire.  There are no in -person study visits during this study. Subjects will use and 
evaluate the study product at their respective homes. Study events  for the subjects in Group 2  are 
summarized below:  
 

 
9.8 Subject Instructions  
Subjects will be provided  Instructions for Use   
 depending on which 
Group they have been assigned to . The IFU provided to the subject are based o n the currently approved 
IFU for the currently marketed  product. The steps to use Study Catheter  remain the 
same  as the currently marketed product . The p articipant study instructions include steps  for completing 
the study procedures /questionnaires  and contact information for research staff  if they experience  any 
issues while participating in the study.  
9.9 Compliance  
Subjects are expected to fully comply with the protocol procedures and study instructions.  If a subject 
deviates from the protocol at any point, study staff will use  to document 
the event in the EDC system.   
 
The site will be  monitored for compliance. If site is found to have multiple deviations, corrective action or 
re-training may be necessary.  
9.10 Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may elect to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Data collected up to the point 
of withdrawal will be eligible for analysis, unless the subject documents in writing to the PI that they refuse 
use of any and all of their data for analysis. Any new information gained during the study that might affect 
the subject’s desire to continue parti cipation will be conveyed to them in a timely manner. These 

procedures are expressed in the ICF that the subject signs. Subjects electing to withdraw from the study 
are required to return all unused study product.  
 
The Investigator may discontinue a subjec t from the study at any time without prejudice.  
Discontinuations are documented on  in the EDC system.  
Furthermore, the Sponsor may end the study at any time.   
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a subject, which does not necessarily 
have to be related to the device under investigation .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease experienced  while also using the device, whether or not considered related to the 
device.   
• Based on literature evaluation, expected adverse events that could occur in subjects recruited for this 
study include :  
 
 These are possible risks  with any 
intermittent cathete r usage on the market and are not unique for the study product.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is one that results in death, results in life -threatening illness or injury, requires in -
patient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results i n medical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment, or results in permanent impairment of body structure or function, or that result in injury or death to 
a fetus.    
• There are no SAE related to the study product anticipated in this study.  
 
An Unantic ipated Adverse Event (UAE) occurs when the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the known or foreseeable risk of the anticipated adverse events associated with the study product 
or procedures involved with this research.  
10.1 Handling Adverse Events  
Upon study enrollment, all subjects are informed to notify the Investigator immediately if they experience 
any health or study -related problems. Subjects will be asked daily to report any change in their health 
status during the course o f the study on the D aily Questionnaire s . The 
PI or designee will contact the subject if clarification of the information reported on the daily form is 
needed. The PI will determine if an AE has occurred, the severity of the AE, and if it was related to the 
study product.  AEs will be documented  on  in the EDC system.  
Subjects who report AEs may be directed to seek care from their healthcare provider or emergency room, 
as appropriate.   
 
All AEs are followed to determine resolution for up to  by the Invest igator and the Adverse Event 
Form is updated to indicate date of resolution.  If at any point, the Investigator determines the subject 
should no longer remain on the study product, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  

10.2 Reporting Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Adverse Events (UAE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) related to the study product must 
be reported by the Investigator or Sub -Investigator through the EDC system within  by 
documenting on . 
 
Investig ators are also required to submit a report of SAE to IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later 
than  after the investigator first learns of the event  (Guidance for Clinical Practice Adverse 
Event Reporting to IRB s Improving Human Subject Protection , 2009) . 
10.3 Study Stopping Rules  
All adverse events will be evaluated and handled according to procedures in Section 11.1.  
 
11.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure the completeness and accuracy of all study data collected in 
the EDC system. Subject name and contact information will be treated as Protected Health Information and not 
included in any data set for analysis.  All datasets for study analysis will include only de -identified data.  
 
The electronic ICF and electronic case report forms (eCRFS) will be collected directly from research subjects using 
a secure, cloud -based EDC and electronic patient r eported outcomes (ePRO) system .   will 
be configured by the Sponsor Data Manager for study -specific data c apture.  Study  forms such as the Adverse 
Event Form , Protocol Deviation Form , and Contact Log  will be entered by the study personn el at the site .  
 
Subjects will be provided with a link to the EDC/ePRO system via an email, as each study form is made available 
to them to complete.  Subjects will set up their own, secure password to the system  and that password remains  
unknown to the S ponsor. The  EDC will provide an audit log that verifies that all ePRO data were entered 
by the subjects themselves. The audit log will also document when and by whom any modifications were made to 
the data after initial entry.  
 
To the best of the Sp onsor’s ability, data logic and validation checks will be configured in the ePRO system so that 
subjects will receive warning messages at time of entry regarding inconsistent or invalid entries, in order to assure 
quality and completeness of data. Because the study collects self -report data directly from the study participants, 
there will be minimal corrections or modifications by the Sponsor to ePRO data. Any modification of any ePRO 
data will only be done following direct contact and clarification from th e research subject. There will be no 
modification to any data capturing subject opinion or assessment of study product.  The Sponsor may contact the 
subject to clarify factual data, such as date of first study product use, or any unclear responses on  the ICF and the 
Eligibility Screener, to assure proper and full consent of subjects, as well as confirmation of eligibility before study 

enrollment.  The Sponsor will contact any subject who directly reports or implies a change in their health status, 
in order  to assure subject safety while using the study product.  
 
Access and permissions to the EDC system for data entry, approval signatures, and/or data export are controlled 
by user identification and password, which are provisioned by the Sponsor. Investigators and other study 
personnel are trained by the Sponsor in the use of the EDC and application of electronic signatures before the 
start of the study.  The Study Investigator will electronically sign all study data captured in the EDC, 
 prior to data export and analysis.  
12.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 Analysis Principles  
Enrolled subjects who provide product assessment data will be eligible for analysis; subjects who screen 
fail or did not provide any s tudy product assessment data will be excluded from analysis.  
12.2 Incomplete Follow -up and Missing Data  
In the event that a subject does not complete the full study period, the complete set of data available for 
that subject prior to loss -to-follow -up will be u sed for analysis. No imputation of missing data will be 
performed.  
12.3 Multi -Center and Multiple Comparison/ Multiplicity Adjustments  
Data collected from all study sites will be combined and analyzed as a whole. No multi -center adjustments 
will be made.  
12.4 Sampl e Size and Power  
A sample size of  end-users was chosen to attain a margin of error of approximately . Assuming a 
 dropout rate, up to  end users will be enrolled to reach a target final sample size of up to  
13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
13.1 Primary and Secondary Objective  
Study data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods as defined by the variable’s 
data level (i.e. continuous, ordinal, categorical, etc .). This includes but is not limited to frequency and 
percentages for categorical measures and mean [standard deviations] for continuous measures . 
 
13.2 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis is planned for when one of the following milestones occur, whichever occurs first: 1) 
 subjects have provide d product assessment data via the end of study questionnaire or 2) the study 
reaches .  All subject data that has been gathered and released  on or prior 
to this milestone  will be included in the interim analysis.  
 Any amendments will be documented per Section 
17.0. 

14.0 STUDY DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING  
The Sponsor and clinical site are required to retain essential study documents within a study TMF. The Spo nsor is 
responsible to retain study documentation per the retention schedule set forth in  Clinical 
sites other than Hollister Incorporated are required to retain study documentation for  
following Sponsor notific ation of study closure.  
15.0 FINAL REPORT  
The Sponsor will write and issue an interim report per the schedule provided in Section 1 3.2 and a final report at 
study completion. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to provide the interim and final report s to the IRB, as 
required. In the event that the target sample size is enrolled and available for analysis by the time of the planned 
interim analysis, a final report will be issued in lieu of an interim report and a note to file will be created to 
document  this event.  
16.0 MONITORING  
A qualified Hollister Incorporated monitor or designee will monitor the study data to verify that forms are 
completed, and that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/  amendment(s) 
procedures, GCP, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
All data collected for this study is subject self -report data via ePRO questionnaire, and therefore there will be no 
source documents for monitoring.  To the best of the Sponsor’s ability, data logic and validation checks will be 
configured in the EDC ePRO module so that subjects will receive warning messages at time of entry about 
inconsistent or invalid entries, in order to assure quality and completeness of data. Since  the study collects 
 there will be minimal corrections or modifications by the Sponsor to ePRO 
data. Any modification of ePRO data will only be done following direct contact and clarification from the subject. 
There will be no modific ation to any data capturing subject opinion or assessment of study pro duct.  The Sponsor 
may contact subject s to clarify factual data, such as date of first study product application, or any unclear 
responses on the ICF and the Eligibility Screener, to ass ure proper and full consent of subjects, as well as 
confirmation of eligibility before study enrollment.  The Sponsor will contact any subject who directly reports or 
implies a change in their health status, in order to assure subject safety while using th e study product.  
17.0 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES  
The Sponsor is responsible for initiating any protocol amendments. The amendments will be reviewed by the PI 
and approved by the IRB before they are implemented. Investigator(s) are notified of changes, and a copy of t he 
amendment is kept in the TMF.

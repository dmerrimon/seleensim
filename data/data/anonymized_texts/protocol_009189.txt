Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate:
0.6mg arm: 1 capsule containing 0.6 mg laquinimod and the other 2 containing placebo, to be 
administered orally once daily.
1.5mg arm: 3 capsules containing 0.5 mg laquinimod to be administered orally once daily (Note:this 
arm was discontinued as of 0 1January2016).
Placebo arm: 3 capsules containing placebo to be administered orally once daily.
Duration of Participation: The study will include screening up to 6weeks and 2 parts: Part A (core study) and 
PartB (data analysis).
Part A will last at least 48 w eeks, and individual patients will experience variable treatment durations, depending on 
the order of enrollment . 
Once the last ongoing patient completes the week 48 visit, the sponsor will declare end of Part A and begin 
performing study analyses .
In Part B, patient s will continue their randomly -assigned blinded treatments with visits every 12 weeks until the 
completion visit. After up to approximately 24weeks of Part B, or once data analysis has been completed an d the 
design of a potential extension study hasbeen finalized (including blinded or open -label treatment allocation ), 
patients will be invited to the clinic for the completion visit and will be offered the opportunity to continue into an 
extension study .
General Design and Methodology: This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, 
placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the efficacy, safety ,and tolerability of daily oral administration of laquinimod 
(0.6or 1.5mg) in PPMS patients.

Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily
Laquinimod 1.5 mg daily
Daily placebo
As of 01January2016, following a decision to discontinue the l aquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm ,additional eligible 
patients who are enrolled will berandomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the following treatment arms:
Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily
Daily placebo
A capped randomization procedure w ill be employed to ensure that the number of EDSS 6.0 and 6.5 patients will be 
no more than 20% of all enrolled patients.
Patients will have the following study visits: screening visit ( -6weeks), baseline visit ( week0), weeks4, 8, 12, 24, 
36, 48, and every 12weeksuntil study completion or early termination (ET) .

result, study drug should not be dispensed, until results of serum β -hCG test areavailable. The rest
of the visit activities should be performed.
Starting from week 12visit, between study visits, women of child-bearing potential will be 
provided w ith home pregnancy urine β -hCG test kits and will be instructed how to perform the 
test. The site staff will schedule the home test to be performed every 28 ±2days. To verify 
whether the test has been performed and to record the result of the test, a mandatory phone call 
will be performed by the Treating Neurologist or by the site’s nurse/study coordinator with in 
72hours after the test was scheduled to be performed and the patient will be asked specific 
questions regarding the test . In case of a suspected pregnancy (positive urine β -hCG test result,

proportion of patients (%) who prematurely di scontinue treatment, reason sfordiscontinuation ,
and time to ET
proportion of patients (%) who prematurely discontinue treatment due to adverse event s and time

Statistical Considerations:
Sample size calculations were based on the following assumptions:
2-sided alpha level of 5%
treatment difference (delta) of 0.3 in PBVC
standard deviation of 0.8
Under the above assumptions 25 2patients enrolled for 0.6 mg and placebo (12 6per arm) w ill provide 8 4% power to 
detect a statistical ly significant result for the 0.6mg laquinimod arm comparison to placebo. To adjust for the 
anticipated 10% dropouts, the sample size was increased to 28 0patients. Adding 9 5patients on 1.5 mg yields a total 
of 375 patients.
Due to the decision from 01January2016to discontinue the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, and a low  studyexposure 
at this time, the l aquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm will be presented descriptively only, and will not be included in any 
inferential analyses .
In addition, all efficacy analyses will be performed based on the measurements recorded during t he study treatment 
period, ie, data captured following an early termination visit w ill be excluded from the analyses. The data captured 
after an early termination visit w ill be used for the sensi tivity analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
Based on that, t he following analyses will be performed using data collected during Part A (Core Study):
1.Primary Endpoint Analysis:
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
12The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is BAas measured by the PBVC from baseline to week48. This 
endpoint will be analyzed using the modified intent -to-treat1 (mITT1)population with at least 1post-baseline 
PBVC value , and will include assessments taken up to/including early termination/study completion visit (data 
recorded follow ing an early termination visit will be excluded from this analysis) . BAwill be analyzed using 
baseline-adjusted repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA -SAS®PROC MIXED ) in which 1contrast 
will be constructed in order to co mpare between laquinimod 0.6 mg and placebo. The model w ill be comprised from 
the treatment group as a class variable ( 2levels). In addition to the treatment group, week (categorical), w eek by 
treatment group, normalized brain volume at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline ,and 
Country/Geographical Region (CGR) will be used as covariates. Additionally, week (categorical) w ill be specified 
as a repeated effect and unstructured (UN) correlation matrix will be used to model intra -subject correlation. In case 
aconvergence issue will arise using the UN correlation matrix, (1) AR1 or (2) Compound Symmetry (CS) will be 
used to enable model convergence (in this order).
2.Secondary Endpoints Analysis:
a.Time to CDP as measured by EDSS confirmed afterat least 12weekswill be analyzed using the
intent-to-treat (ITT)population and data from all the study assessments up to/including early 
termination/study completion visit (data recorded follow ing an early termination visit will be excluded 
fromthis analysis) .This analysis will be performed using baseline adjusted Cox ’s proportional hazards 
regression model (SAS®PROC PHR EG) in which 1contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto 
placebo w ill be constructed. In addition to treatment group, categorical EDSS at baseline (≤4.5 or 
>4.5), age at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline ,and CGR will be used as 
covariates. 
b.Time to CDP,confirmed after at least 12 weeks as measured by EDSS or T25FW w ill be analyzed 
using the ITT population and data from all the study assessments up to/including early 
termination/study completion visit (data recorded follow ing an early termination visit will be excluded 
from this analysis) . This analysis will be performed using baseline adjusted Cox’s proportional hazards 
regression model (SAS®PROC PHREG) in which 1contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto 
placebo w ill be constructed. In addition to treatment group, categorical EDSS at baseline ( ≤4.5 or 
>4.5), age at baseline, T25FW at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline, and CGR 
will be used as covariates.
c. Change from baseline in the T25FW score at w eek48 will be analyzed on the mITT2 population and 
will include assessments taken up to/including early termination/study completion visit (data recorded 
following an early termination visit will be excluded from this analysis) . Since this variable might not 
follow normal distribution, the ranked values of this measurement will be defined and analyzed using 
baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA (SAS®PROC MIXED) in which 1contrast w ill be 
constructed in order to compare between laquinimod 0.6 mg and placebo. In addition to treatment 
group, T25FW score at baseline and CGR will be used as covariates. Due to the fact that the 
ANCOVA model will use ranked values and not the actual changes in the T25FW, Hodges-Lehmann 
estimates will be used in order to present the magnitude of the treatment effect and the corresp onding 
two-sided 95% confidence limit .
d.The number of new brain T2 lesions at week 48 will be analyzed using the mITT1 population with at 
least 1post-baseline T2 scan available if it was performed at least 36 weeks under treatment and will 
include assessments taken up to/including early termination/study completion visit (data recorded 
following an early termination visit will be excluded from this analysis) . This analysis will be 
performed using baseline adjusted negative binomial regression m odel (SAS®PROC GENMOD) in 
which 1 contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto placebo w ill be constructed. In addition to the 
treatment group, the natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline , age at baseline, and CGR will 
be used as covariates.
All the secondary analyses mentioned in this section will be repeated while including observations that were 
recorded follow ing an early termination visit .
Detailed statistical modeling of exploratory endpoints , as well as combined part A and B data ,will be described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Similarly, descriptive statistics for safety and tolerability measures will also be 
described in the SAP.

261. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1. Introduction 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the central 
nervous s ystem (CNS), characteriz ed by inflammation anddemyelination, as well as 
oligodendrocy te and neuron dysfunction. The prevalence varies considerably, from regions with 
low prevalence (<5 cases per 100000) across much of central Asia, to areas with high prevalence 
(greater than 30 cases per 100000) across the United States ( US), Canada, Australia and large 
parts of Europe and northern Asia ranging from 50 to 100 per 100000.
Approximately  15% of MS patients develop a sustained deterioration of neurological function 
without distinct exacerbations from the onset ; this MS phenoty peis known as primary  
progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) ( Lassmann and van Horssen 2012, Lublin et al 2014 ). At 
diagnosis, approximately  85% of patients have relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 
characterized b y recurrent acute exacerbations of neurological d ysfunction(relapses) ,followed 
by recovery. Over time, the majority of patients with RRMS will develop secondary  progressive 
multiple sclerosis (SPMS), in which a le ss acute inflammatory  and more neurodegenerative 
course of the disease take sover. SPMS develops with progression in disability  independent of
relapseswhich usually  have subsided. The diagnosis of the transition into this SPMS phase of the 
diseaseis usually made retrospectivel y.
Progressive MS subty pes, such as PPMS and SPMS, ty pically feature gait dysfunction due to 
steadily worsening spastic paraparesis, progressive urinary  symptoms, and gradual cognitive 
decline (Koch 2013) . The disease mechanisms driving progressive MS remain unresolved, and 
there is currently no animal model available that accuratel y reproduces this phenomenon. 
Therapeutic options for progressive MS are currently  limited to sy mptomatic treatments and 
physiotherapy(Koch 2013 ); in this context, a therapy  which is effective in limiting the 
neurodegenerative process and associated disability  accumulation would address a major unmet 
medical need in the treatment of MS. Recently, positive results have been reported in a PPMS 
trial with the monoclonal antibody  ocrelizumab.
The investigational medicinal product(IMP) , laquinimod ( international non-proprietary  name 
[INN]), also known b y the laboratory code TV -5600 or ABR -215062 sodium sa lt, is a 
quinoline -3-carboxamide derivative. It is a novel chemical compound with the International 
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry  (IUPAC) name sodium 
5-chloro-3-(ethyl(phenyl)carbamo yl)-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin -4-olate.
Laquinimod, an innov ative oral immunomodulator, is currentl y undergoing a third Phase3study 
of its development for RRMS (see Section 1.3.2). Itsemerging clinical and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) efficacy  profile, supported b yextensive pre -clinical evidence, suggests a direct 
protective effect in the CNS, largely independent of its peripheral anti -inflammatory effects, 
supporting the evaluation oflaquinimod’s efficacy in progressive MS.

271.1.1. Study Rationale 
Several disease modify ing treatments have been registered to treat RRMS, mostly  targeting 
relapse activity  and MRI  parameters of inflammation, however their effects on brain tissue 
damage and progressive disability  arelimited. 
Some of the neurodegenerative process in the MS brain aredue to inflammation transmigrating 
fromthe peripheral blood and ly mphatic s ystemand some are independent ( Lassmann and van 
Horssen 2011, Luessi 2012 ). Importantly , degeneration starts at the earliest stages of the disease
andmay be responsible for the slow accrual of disability  observed in progressive MS subty pes
(Trapp 1998).
While none of the tested drugs which work in RRMS have been efficacious in progressive MS, 
some key  learnings hav e emerged. Given what is known about the pathophysiology of 
progressive MS, it is reasonable to assume that beneficial drugs would ideally  enter the CNS, 
target microglial and astrocy tic activation (Prineas et al 2001), mitigate axonal degeneration 
(Fitzner and Simons 2010), or block glutamateexcitotoxicity (Gonsette 2008), as well as 
promote remyelination (Irvine and Blakemore 2008 ). Laquinimod is a small molecule that 
passively crossesthe blood brain barrier ( BBB)and is detectable in CNS tissues. Ithas been 
shown to modulate severalsignificant pathway s common to key neurodegenerative diseases. 
More specificall y, laquinimod modulates the immune cell lineages in the periphery  and in the 
CNS. In the periphery , laquinimod down -regulates monocy tic activation and pro -inflammatory  
cytokine secretion. In the CNS, l aquinimod reduces tissue damage b y down regulating microglial 
and astrocy tic activation, which is amajor cause for tissue destruction, myelin, axonal and 
neuronal loss.
In the toxic cuprizone rodent model, a well -known model of demy elination and secondary  
neurodegenerative BBB damage, laquinimod p enetrated the intact BBB(Brück and Wegner 
2011) and preventeddemyelination, microglia activation, axonal transections, reactive gliosis 
and oligodendroglial apoptosis ( Brück et al 2012, Matsushima and Morell 2001).
In addition, 2 recent separate experimental autoimmune encephalomy elitis (EAE) studies 
revealed that laquinimod can r egulate synaptic transmission by  increasing inhibitory  GABAergic 
post-synaptic currents and reducing glutamatergic excitatory  post-synaptic currents ( Ruffini et al
2013), and improve axonalremyelination and integrit y(Moore et al 2013), thus supporting its
functional neuroprotective and neurorestor ative effects.
Importantly , the clinical efficacy  profile of laquinimod derived from the 2 completed pivotal 
RRMS studies, ALLEGRO and BRAVO, is distinctive and different from other disease 
modifying treatments in MS because t he reduction in disease progre ssion isconsistent lylarger 
than expected based on the relapse based outcomes . 
In the pooled anal ysis, laquinimod demonstrated a 34% reduction in disability  progression 
confirmed after 3 months and a 45% to 47% reduction in disability  confirmed at 6, 9, and 
12months. By  using the Sormani meta -analysis, it was found that t he predicted reduction in 
3-month confirmed disability  progression ( CDP)with laquinimod, given the observed effect on 
relapses, should be onl y 5%, whereas the observed reduction in 3 -month CDPusing the relative 
risk was 29% (p=0.007), suggesting a pronounced dissociation between the effect on relapses 
and the effect on disability . 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
28The central action is further supported by laquinimod’s consistent effect on reduction of brain 
atrophy(BA) (30%) as well as other MRI markers of neurodegeneration including thalamic 
atrophy, preservation of magnetization transferratio (MTR) in whole brain and in 
normal-appearing white matter, and reduction in the evolution of permanent T1 hy pointense 
lesions (Filippi 2013). While the effects on brain volume change occur early  following treatment 
initiation, this effect is evidence for central CNS target organ engagement and will be utilized as 
the primary  endpoint in this study .
Further assessment of the large RRMS clinical studydataset was performed in order to assess
patient subgroups which may bemore informative with respect to a progressive MS population. 
Post-hocanalyses were performed on subgroups defined bybaseline Expanded Disability  Status 
Scale (EDSS)and presence of relapsesduring study . Thesesubgroup anal yses showed that in 
those with baseline EDSS >3, laquinimod treatment led to a 40% reduction in 3- month CDP, and 
a 53% reduction in 6- month CDP compared to place bo.Patientsin the EDSS >3 group who 
received placebo declined by 2.79 seconds more on the timed 25- foot walk ( T25FW)after 
24months compared to patientswho were treated with laquinimod (p=0.0035; relative 
difference =59%).Also, although the number of e vents was low, laquinimod treatment reduced 
3-month CDP by 38.9%in patients who were relapse -free throughout the studies.
Takentogether, pre -clinical and clinical data support testing of the h ypothesis that laquinimod 
exerts its effect b y a direct prote ctive effect in the CNS largely independent of its peripheral 
anti-inflammatory  effects. This preclinical and clinical profile meets the requirements for clinical 
testing of laquinimod as a candidate drug in progressive MS.
The rationale for including exclusively PPMS patients in this study  is to allow testing of 
laquinimod in a relatively homogenous patient population . 
1.1.1.1. Rationale for Laquinimod 0.6 mgDose
The selection of the 0.6 mg as the therapeutic dose for pivotal RRMS studies was based on 
results from two Phase 2clinical studies (01506203 and LAQ/5062) and anascending -dose 
study (99506202).
In the Phase2 Study01506203, which evaluated daily  doses of laquinimod 0.1 and 0.3 mg, only 
the 0.3mg dose reduced the cumulative number of active lesions at week24. In the Phase2b 
StudyLAQ/5062, which evaluated daily  doses of laquinimod 0.3 and 0.6 mg, only the 0.6mg 
dose achieved a statistically  significant (p=0.0048) 40% reduction in the mean cumulative 
number of gadolinium enhancing (GdE) T1 lesions at weeks24, 28, 32 ,and 36 (the primary  
endpoint of the study ). However, unlike in S tudy01506203, statistical significance was not 
achieved on this primary  endpoint for laquinimod 0.3 mg versus placebo. The lack of effect for 
the 0.3mg dose is attributed to the fact that stud y LAQ/5062 used a standard gadolinium (Gd) 
dose for detection of enhancing MS lesions, whereas Study01506203 used a triple Gd dose. 
The data from the two Phase 3 studies were obtained with the 0.6 mg dose, here the clinical 
hypothesiswas generated, including data from subgroups with aspects of progressive disease or 
more advanced RRMS. This extensive safety  and efficacy database derived from RRMS makes 
the use of 0.6 mg as a reference dose useful ,as it will allow comparison to these data.The 
current stud y includes laquinimod 0.6 mg as the minimal effective dose noted in previous RRMS 
studies with laquinimod.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
291.1.1.2. Rationale for Laquinimod 1.5 mgDose
The Phase2studies (01506203 and LAQ/5062) suggest a dose response up to 0.6 mg based on 
MRI parameters. In addition, in the rodent cuprizone model laquinimod reduces callosal 
demyelination in a dose -dependent manner supportive of a linear dose response.
In light of the dose -dependent effects, evaluat ion ofa higher dose of laquinimod in the c urrent 
Phase2study is appropriate and to test whether a further dose response on the pronounced effect 
on brain volume preservation is noted and whether this 1.5mg doseisassociated with greater 
efficacyon other endpoints , while preserving an adequate safety and tolerability  profile.Notably, 
an ongoing Phase3studyin RRMS includeda laquinimod dose of 1.2 mg (CONCERTO).
Two studies to evaluate the maximumtolerated dose ( MTD)of laquinimod in healthy  volunteers 
and MS patients have been performed. Amultiple ascending dose stud y in MS patients 
(StudyMS-LAQ-101), in which a safet y committee recommended dose escalation following data 
availability  for each dosing cohort, did not reveal dose-dependent adverse events , laboratory  or 
electrocardiogra m(ECG) findings up to and including the dose of 2.7 mg/day. The results of 
StudyMS-LAQ-101did not reproduce the results from an earlier multiple ascending -dose study  
in healthy  volunteers and MS patients ( Study99506202 ), which had established adose of 
1.2 mg/day as the MTD in MS patients, based solely  on laboratory  findings that were predefined 
in the protocol as dose limiting toxicity  (increased levels of C- reactive protein [CRP])and 
fibrinogen) . The sample size, treatment duration (4 weeks) and overall ex posure were greater in 
StudyMS-LAQ-101 compared to Study 99506202, and assessment of tolerability  of dose was 
based on a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory  parameters. Hence , study 
MS-LAQ-101 is considered to more accurately represent the safet y profile of higher doses of 
laquinimod , justifying the use of the 1.5 mg dose . The last cohort of patients received 2.7 mg 
laquinimod with no dose limiting adverse events or laboratory  findings. An MTDhas not been 
established as the dose escalation b eyond 2.7 mg which had no dose limiting effects was not 
performed .Therefore , laquinimod 1.5 mg was selected as the maximal dose to b e tested for the 
current stud y. 
While laquinimod at the 0.6 mg dose has been extensively  studied in RRMS, this is the first 
study assessing laquinimod in PPMS patients, bridging the 0.6 mg dose experience and assessing 
a higher dos e of 1.5 mg versus placebo . 
Note: On 30 December 2015 the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the CONCERTO and 
ARPEGGIO studies held an unschedule
d meeting to review cardiovascular events. The DMC 
found an imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in the high dose treatment arms (1.2mg in 
CONCERTO, 1.5 mg in ARPEGGIO) : in CONCERTO there were 6 such cases in the 1.2 mg 
arm but none in the 0.6mgorplaceboarms, along with a m yocardial infarction in the 
ARPEGGIO 1.5 mg dose group and a cerebral infarct ionin a 31-year old patient in the 1.2 mg 
armof CONCERTO . Due to these events and the DMC recommendation to stop all laquinimod 
treatment arms above 0.6mg in the MS trials, the 1.5 mg treatment arm in the ARPEGGIO stud y 
was discontinued as of 0 1January2016. The risk/benefit balance of this dose was considered 
negative at that point.
The DMC did not identify an yovertcardiovascular risk in the 0.6mg treatment arm, but felt that 
long term monitoring for emergence of an y signal is necessary. Therefore, the 0.6 mg treatment 
arm will be continued while the sponsor closel y monitors cardiovascular events in all laquinimod

30studies.Additional measures implemented in this protocol amendment includean empha sis on 
disallowed medications and stopping rules for organ impairment (ie, factors which may  increase 
laquinimod exposure) ,as well as regular evaluation and management of major modifiable 
cardiovascu lar risk factors.
1.1.1.3. Rationale for Primary Endpoint
MRI-measured BAis a quantitative measure of the irreversible tissue loss observed in MS
(Miller et al 2002 ). Accordingl y, significant associations were found between cerebral atroph y 
and worsening of disability (Barkhof et al 2001, Fisher et al 2000, Kalkers et al 2001, L osseff et
al 1996, Pagani et al 2005), as well as with decline in cognitive functions (Christodoulou et al
2003).In the first large study in untreated patients with MSwith different disease subt ypes it was 
shown that BA proceeds relentlessly  throughout the course of MS, with a rate that seems largel y 
independent of the MS subty pe, when adjusting for baseline brain volume ( De Stefano 2010).
Reduced brain volume loss (measured b y Percentagein Brain Volume Change [PBVC]from 
baseline to month24)w as consistently  demonstrated in laquinimod studies: ALLEGRO 32.8% 
reduction compared to placebo (p<0.0001); BRAVO 28% reduction compared to placebo 
(p=0.0001).
Several longitudinal studies have reported that BA predicts disability  progression and cognitive
impairment over the longer term. Even if correlation between BA and disability  has been 
difficult to establish within the time frame of clinical studies, a recent meta -analysis of 
randomized controlled studiesdemonstrated a correlation between the effect of treatments on BA 
and the effect of treatments on disability  progression (Sormani et al 2013a) . The time course of 
the PBVC effect of laquinimod has not been clearly  defined, however, preliminary  data (Teva on 
file) suggest that there is a potential for the effect to occur early following treatment initiation. 
Therefore, PBVC measures at 24 and 48 weeks may  serve as a biomarker for laquinimod’s CNS 
target organ engagement and allow for the assessment of a potential dose response.
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product 
The IMP, laquinimod (INN), also known b y the laboratory code TV -5600 or ABR -215062 
sodium salt, is a quinoline-3- carboxamide derivative. I t is a novel chemical compound with the 
IUPAC name sodium 5- chloro-3-(ethyl(phenyl)carbamoy l)-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin -
4-olate.
Laquinimod is supplied as white opaque cap and body  hard gelatin capsules filled with white to

311.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies 
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies 
1.3.1.1. Pharmacology
In models of MS (EAE and c uprizone), the mechanism of action ( MoA)of laquinimod includes 
modulation of the peripheral inflammation and CNS-resident inflammatory  response resulting in 
down regulation of m yelin and axonal damage. These effects are compatible with interference of 
nuclear factor ( NF)-κB activation and may  represent a novel protective mechanism which down 
regulates peripheral and central inflammation, tissue damage and neurodegeneration in CNS 
demyelinating diseases.
1.3.1.2. Metabolism and P harmacokinetics
Laquinimod is rapidl y absorbed resulti ng with high oral bioavailability  of 80% to 90% in all 
animal species tested and its exposure was shown to increase proportionally  without major sex 
differences. Low or no accumulation of parent drug and/or metabolites in tissues was observed. 
Laquinimod d oes not preferentiall y distribute to skin and eyes, and no uptake of radioactivity 
was registered in melanin- containing structures in either skin or ey e. Laquinimod -related 
radioactivity  was shown to be covalentl y bound to plasma and liver proteins in vitr o however no 
adduct was found in human in- vivo. 
Laquinimod metabolism is mostly  cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A4-mediated biotransformation,
resultingin a few h ydroxylated and dealkylated minor metabolites which could undergo further 
glucuronidation. A ll circulating plasma human metabolites were formed in animal test species at
adequate exposure levels . Laquinimod was shown to cause a decrease of CYP3A4 activity and is 
a strong inducer of CYP1A enzy mes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of activation of the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) transcription factor : activation of this pathway by laquinimod has 
been demonstrated . 
For a complete overview of the ADME -PK program of laquinimod, please refer to the 
laquinimod I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) .
1.3.1.3. Toxicology
The noncli nical safet y program of laquinimod has encompassed separate investigations on vital 
organ systems, single and repeat dose toxicity  in mice (duration up to 13 weeks), rats (duration 
up to 26weeks), and dogs (duration up to 52 weeks), genotoxicity , carcinog enicity studies in 
p53+/-transgenic mice and in rats, toxicity  to reproduction, photosafety testing, immunotoxicity  
evaluation, and local tolerance.
Safety pharmacology  studies in the rat and dog did not demonstrate significant effects of 
laquinimod on th e function of cardiovascular, respiratory , central nervous, renal and 
gastrointestinal s ystems providing safety margins in the range of 32 -to 257-fold above the 
originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/daybased on maximal plasma concentrations.
Overall, the non clinical safet y program identified several safet y issues. Specificall y, the 
toxicities identified are pro- inflammatory  effects (including thy roiditis),mild liver toxicity , and 
mild reductions of red blood cell (RBC) indices. In general, the sev erity of these effects was 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
32dose-related and toxicity  was mostly  reversible upon drug discontinuation. The nature of these 
toxic events allows adequate monitoring in the clinical setting (for details please refer to the 
laquinimod IB). 
Laquinimod was neith er mutagenic nor clastogenic in in vitroand in vivoassays. Laquinimod 
treatment resulted in the formation of micronuclei in vitroandin vivothrough an aneugenic 
mechanism, with broad safet y margin (>32) above the originallyintended clinical dose of 
1.5mg/day. 
The carcinogenicit y program consisted of a 26 -week study  in transgenic p53+/ -mice and a 
2-year rat study . The study  in transgenic p53+/- mice did not show an increase in 
treatment -related neoplastic findings at an y tested dose. In the 2 -year rat carcinogenicity  study, 
increased incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas was observed in high dose female rats. It is the 
sponsor's position that t his finding is likely  dueto a decrease in the incidence of prolactin 
secreting pituitary  adenomas that was observed in this study. In contrast to rodents, in humans 
prolactin isnot a luteinizing hormone and does not affect the estrogen:progesterone ratio ; 
therefore th emechanism proposed by the sponsor is not considered relevant to humans. A higher 
incidence of thy roid follicular cell adenomas was observed in high dose male rats. This lesion is 
considered to be related to laquinimod’s induc tion ofliver enzy mes and consequently  enhanced 
clearance of th yroid hormones in rats, a well -characterized rat-specific mechanism proposed by 
the sponsor, that is not considered relevant to humans. In addition, an increase in the incidence of 
oral cavit y tumorswas noted in mid and high dose female rats (2/60 in each group). The oral 
effects may  relate to the AhR activation properties of laquinimod since similar lesions were seen 
following lifelong exposure of rats to other AhR activators. However, the incidence of oral 
cavity tumors in rats treated with laquinimod was lower than that seen with industrial chemicals 
such as 2,3,7,8- tetrachloro -p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD) ( NTP TR-521 ) and dioxin -like compounds 
(DLCs), and was more similar to the incidence seen with the dietary  ingredient indole -3-carbinol 
(I3C) found in cruciferous vegetables. Of note, the o ral tumors seen with I3C were considered b y 
the US National Toxicology  Program as irrelevant for I3C risk assessment ( NTP TR-584 ). No 
increased incidence of oral tumors was seen in humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a species 
specific response in rats. Therefore, oral cavit y tumors induced by laquinimod in rats after a 
lifelong exposure do not imply  an elevated carcinogenicity  risk in humans. Humans, in general, 
also seem to be less sensitive to AhR activation by laquinimod than rats, as shown by  the 
differential gene expression profiles discussed in the IB .
A standard pre -and post-natal toxicity  study and a follow -up investigational study  in rats
demonstrated urogenital malformations in female rat offspring exposed in utero to laquinimod at 
doses similar to the clinical dose of 0.6mg/day based on exposure. A slight delay  in pubert y and 
reduction in fertility  were noted in offspring exposed in utero to laquinimod at doses slightly 
higher than the originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/day  in humans. The mechanism 
leading to the malformations in rats is unknown . Induction of urogenital malformations in 
rodents has been reported for a variet y of agents including sex hormones and the AhR agonist 
TCDD. Several studies were performed to investigate the potential hormonal modulating activity  
of laquinimod, but no such effects were demonstrated at clinicall y relevant levels. An AhR 
mediated effect cannot be excluded since it play s a distinct role in developmental processes in 
many experimental animals. However, the relevance to humans of the teratogenic effects seen in 
rodents is unknown. In a pre-and post-natal toxicity  study in monkey s, the high dose level was 
associated with higher incidence of prenatal losswhich limited the num ber of monkey s that 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
33could be evaluated , but there were no treatment- related malformations at doses up to 9 -fold the 
expected plasma exposure at the originall y intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/day. Based on the 
above, humans should not be exposed to laquini mod during pregnancy .
Based on calculations from a study  to determine laquinimod levels in monkey  semen, in which 
the semen:plasma ratio of laquinimod was 0.32, the estimated exposure to a female partner of 
laquinimod -treated male patient via semen is appr oximately  600-fold lower than the exposure 
after oral administration of laquin imod at a dose of 1.5 mg, indicating that the risk of male-
mediated embry o-fetal toxicity  through laquinimod treatment is negligible.
A complete overview of the safet y pharmacolo gy and non clinical safet y program of laquinimod 
is presented in the l aquinimod IB.
In the planned clinical study , potential risks will be mitigated b y careful screening of patient s, 
frequent and proactive monitoring of patients and appropriate stopping ru les. Furthermore, an 
independent DMC will be assigned to assess the data (see Section 7).
1.3.2. Clinical Studies 
Fifteen Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and MS patients were completed. A 
placebo-controlled pharmacokinetic brid ging study  in Japanese and Caucasian patients was 
completed .
Two Phase 2studies (1 placebo -controlled [01506203] and 1 open- label [03506207] ) in MS 
patients were completed. Two Phase2 b studies, LAQ/5062 (a randomized, double -blind, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled study) and its double -blind active extension study  
(LAQ/5063) with 2 laquinimod doses (0.3 and 0.6 mg/day) were also completed. Based on the 
efficacy and safet y results of LAQ/5062, an amendment to the protocol of LAQ/5063 study  was 
submitted to change it into an open -label study  (LAQ/5063OL) with the 0.6 mg/day dose as a 
single active arm; this study  is still ongoing.
Two Phase 3studies, MS -LAQ-301 (ALLEGRO) and MS -LAQ-302 (BRAVO) were completed . 
Open-label extension studies MS -LAQ-301E and MS- LAQ-302E are currently  ongoing.
A Phase3study, LAQ–MS-305 (CONCERTO) ,is ongoing with laquinimod doses of 
0.6mg/day.As of 01 January  2016, and based on DMC recommendations, the 1.2mg/day arm 
was discontinued .
For further details refer to the laquin imod IB.
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
Laquinimod is considered to have high oral bioavailability  with linear, time independent and 
predictable pharmacokinetics, characterized by  high plasma protein binding (>98%), high oral 
bioavailability  (~90%), low or al clearance (~0.09 L/h), low apparent volume of distribution 
(~10L), and long half -life (~80h). Absorption under fasting conditions is rapid and maximal 
plasma levels attained generall y within 1 hour after laquinimod administration. Concomitant 
administration with a high -fat high-calorie meal results in reduction of the absorption rate 
reflected b y prolongation of the time to maxim umplasma drug concentration ( tmax) to 
approximately  5hours and reduction of the maximum plasma concentration (C max) by 30%.Food

34however did not significantly  affect the overall extent of absorption area under the concentration 
by time curve (AUC).
Laquinimod is extensively metabolized, predominantly  by CYP3A4. Laquinimod metabolites 
levels in plasma are very  low and parent la quinimod is the main sy stemically  circulating entity . 
Laquinimod pharmacokinetics are affected b y moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.5-and 
3.1-fold increase in laquinimod sy stemic exposure, respectivel y)andstrong CYP3A4 inducers. 
At doses of 0.6 a nd 1.2mg, laquinimod is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a strong inducer of 
CYP1A2; therefore, laquinimod may  affect the s ystemic exposure of other drugs metabolized by 
CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. For additional information on concomitant use of laquinimod with 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 substrates , please refer to the IB.
Studies in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment resulted in an increase of 
laquinimod exposure by  approximately  1.3-and 2.3-fold, respectivel y. In subjects with moderate 
renal impairment laq uinimod exposure was increased by  1.4-fold.Aphysiologicall y based 
pharmacokinetic modelwas further used to predict the effect of hepatic impairment and renal 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of laquinimod after a single and multiple doses of 0.6 to 
1.5mg in comparison to healthy  subjects(StudyDP-2015-017) . The model predictions indicated 
that mild hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment would result in further modest 
increases in exposure to laquinimod following multiple 0.6 mg dose adminis tration based on 
unbound drug concentration (1.71-fold and 1.65 -foldrespectivel y). More significant increases in 
laquinimod exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug fraction, are predicted in patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (3.41-and 6.51- fold respectively )and severe renal 
impairment (1.86-fold). The model predictions indicated similar increases in sy stemic 
laquinimod exposure with a given stage of organ impairment across the 0.6 to 1.5 mg dose range 
following single or multi ple dose administration, demonstrating that the dose proportional 
pharmacokinetics of laquinimod is maintained in subjects with hepatic impairment (mild to 
severe) and renal impairment (moderate to severe) across this dose range.
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies 
Results of Phase 2clinical studies led to the definition of 0.6 mg as the minimal effective dose in 
MS.
The Phase 3 of the clinical development of laquinimod for MS comprised of 2 pivotal studies, 
ALLEGRO and BRAVO. ALLEGRO met its primary  endpoint for reduction of annualized 
relapse rate (ARR; 23% reduction, p=0.0024) and 3key secondary  endpoints (EDSS, cumulative 
GdE T1 lesions and cumulative new T 2lesions) were met ( Table1).

Overall, the BRAVO study  did not meet its primary  endpoint (ARR; 17.7% reduction, 
p=0.0746), and some explanations forthis result are proposed based on lack of power to detect 
the observed effect and post-hocanalyses showing baseline MRI imbalance in favor of the 
placebo group. It is Teva’s assessment that the results obtained after a covariate anal ysis 
correcting for t hese baseline imbalances (ARR; 21.3%, p=0.0264) represent the true effect of 
laquinimod 0.6 mg in this patient population ( Table2).

The observed clinical benefits of laquinimod indicate a distinctive efficacy profile with a 
pronounced effect on disability which appears to be larger than that predicted by  the common

35.9% [p=0.0122], BRAVO: 33.5% [p=0.04a]. In addition, treatment with laquinimod 
demonstrated reduction in BA: ALLEGRO: 32.8% [p<0.0001], BRAVO a: 27.4% [p<0.0001]).
The safety profile of laquinimod is detailed in Section 1.4.
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients 
1.4.1. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits for Laquinimod
Unless noted otherwise, ch aracterization of the safety  profile (important risks and adverse drug 
reactions) of laquinimod is based on the pivotal MS studies, in which laquinimod was 
administered to a total of 983 MS patients at a dose of 0.6 mg/day  for up to 2 y ears. Very  
common or important adverse reactions include headache, abdominal pain, back and neck pain 
and appendicitis. Mild liver enzy me elevations (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT],and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [ GGT]) have been reported 
commonly , but Hy’s law criteria have not been met and there have been no cases of liver failure. 
Treatment with laquinimod may  be associated with some additional laboratory abnormalities, 
including hematological changes ( hemoglobin decreased/anemia, white blood cell count
increased, platelets decreased) and elevation of blood CRP or fibrinogen levels; these laboratory  
changes are generally  mild and as ymptomatic.
The safety profile of laquinimod is provided in detail below:

1.4.1.1.1. Liver Enzyme Elevations
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with mostly mild, as ymptomatic,and reversible
liver enzy me elevations ( Table4) that generall y occurred within 6 months after initiation of 
treatment.
In clinical trials, laquinimod was discontinued if elevation of liver enzy mes exceeded 5 times the 
upper limit of the normal range (UL N) for more than 2weeks in the absence of a clear 
alternative explanation; if the elevation exceeded 8 times the UL N, laquinimod was discontinued 
without further delay .

391.4.1.1.2. Elevated Blood Fibrinogen Level 
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence (43% versus 34%; 
laquinimod versus placebo) of shifts of blood fibrinogen to levels that are above normal, without 
clinical manifestations. Maximal fibrinogen level did not exceed 2.5×>ULN; maximal fibrinogen 
level was 9.0 g/L in the laquinimod group and 8.4 g/L in the placebo group until month 24 of the 
pivotal MS studies.
1.4.1.1.3. Elevated Blood C -Reactive Protein Level
An increase in blood CRP level has not been found in clinical studies in patients treated with 
laquinimod at a dose of 0.6 mg/day . In the pivotal trials, until month 15, the proportion of 
patients with elevations in CRP was slightly  higher in the laquinimod group compared to 
placebo. In the MS -LAQ-101 dose-escalation study , a higher proportion of patients with 
elevations in CRP was seen in the laquinimod groups compared to pl acebo.
1.4.1.1.4. Back and Neck Pain
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence of back and neck 
pain. Back and neck pains usually  occurred during the first 3 months of treatment, were 
generally of mild severity, but occasionall y occurred at a later time point, were of longer 
duration, or required s ymptomatic treatment.
1.4.1.1.5. Appendicitis
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence of appendicitis. 
There was no characteristic pattern for this risk in terms of dura tion of treatment and no 
predisposing factors were identified. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with ty pical 
symptoms.
1.4.1.1.6. Hematological Changes
Hemoglobin decrease/ anemia:
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with a mild, asy mptomatic, non-progressive 
decrease of the hemoglobin level, which occurred earl y after initiation of treatment and was 
usually transient without cessation of therapy  or need for anti -anemic therapy .
Decreased platelets :
Treatment with laquinimod has been associatedwith a generall y mild decrease of the platelet 
count, without clinical manifestations.
Increased white blood cells:
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with a generall y mild increase of the total white 
blood cell count that was consistent across white blood cell subty pes, without clinical 
manifestations.
1.4.1.1.7. Cardiovascular E vents (on Doses A bove Laqu inimod 0.6 mg)
On 30 December 2015, a DMC review of 8 unblinded cases from the ARPEGGIO and 
CONCERTO studies found an imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in the high dose 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
40treatment arms in the study : 6 cases of m yocardial infarction in the CONCERTO 1.2 mg 
treatment arm, compared to no events in the 0.6mg or placebo treatment arms, along with a 
cerebral infarctionin a 31-year old man on the 1.2 mg treatment arm. In the ARPEGGIO stud y, 
1myocardial infarction event was identified in the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm. The 
decisions were largel y based on data from 15November 2015 when total exposure in 
CONCERTO was 3070 patient -years in 2199individuals and total exposure in ARPEGGIO was 
35 patient -years in 191 individuals.
Due to these events, the DMC recommended stopping all laquinimod treatment arms above 
0.6mg in the laquinimod MS trials. The DMC did not identify  anyovert cardiovascular risk in
the 0.6 mg treatment arm, but felt that long term monitoring for emergence of an y signal was 
necessary . The DMC also recommend that study  subjects continuing on laquinimod 0.6 mg be 
reconsented with information about the cardiovascular risk seen in higher doses.
Currently  the mechanism of the cardiovascular events remains unknown. Although no specific 
time-to-event patterns have been identified, cardiovascular risk factors and demographics may  
play a role. Different pre -existing risk factors were noted, in cluding h ypertension, high 
cholesterol, and/or smoking history . While all cases exhibited signs of my ocardial tissue injury , 
the cardiac work -up in these cases revealed heterogeneous etiologies. Of note, the cases all had 
some established cardiovascular risk factors, including patients with probable my ocarditis or 
with probable familial h ypercholesterolemia. Further investigation into potential predictors and 
the potential causalit y are ongoing.
1.4.1.2. Potential Safety Issues with Laquinimod
1.4.1.2.1. Pregnancy
Studies in r ats have shown reproductive toxicity  including teratogenicit y (urogenital 
malformations) at doses similar to the clinical dose of 0.6 mg/day  in humans. Delay  in pubert y 
and reduced fertility  were noted in rat offspring exposed to laquinimod in utero at dos es slightly 
higher than the originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/day  in humans (Section1.3.1.3). The 
relevance to humans of these findings is not known, but cannot be excluded. 
Exposure to laquinimod dur ing pregnancy  should be avoided. 
To prevent such exposure, women who are of child- bearing potential (for example women who 
are not postmenopausal or surgical lysterilized)must practice an acceptable method of birth 
control (Section 4.1) for 30days before initiation of treatment, and 2 acceptable methods of birth 
control throughout treatment duration and for 30 days after cessation of treatment. Acceptable 
methods of birth control in this study  include: intraute rine devices, barrier methods (condom or 
diaphragm with spermicide), and hormonal methods of birth control (eg, oral contraceptive, 
contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptive). Use of acceptable contraception 
should be ascertained at every  study visit.
In addition, regular pregnancy  testing is required during the stud y. Women of child -bearing 
potential must have a negative ser um pregnancy  test within 7 day s prior to initiation of treatment. 
During treatment, i f pregnancy  is suspected despite all recommended precautions (based on a 
positive pregnancy  test, delay  in menstruation or any other reason to suspect pregnancy ), 
treatment should be discontinued immediately . The patient should be reminded of the potential 
risk to the fetus, and all optio ns, including termination of pregnancy , should be discussed.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
41All patients should be counseled b y the investigator about the potential teratogenicity and 
delayed risks for a child exposed in uterus to laquinimod and the need to use acceptable
contraception and avoid pregnancy  throughout treatment with laquinimod and for 30 days after 
the last dose of treatment was administered .
1.4.1.2.2. Cancer
The 2-year carcinogenicity  studies in rats demonstrated an increase in uterine and oral cancers
(Section1.3.1.3). These findings are likely  related to species- specific mechanisms, regardless, a
relevance of these cancers to humans cannot be definitively  excluded . Available Phase 3 and 
extension clinical trialdata show no association of 0.6mg/daywith an increased risk of cancer .
1.4.1.2.3. Cardiotoxicity and Systemic Inflammation
In clinical studies performed with laquinimod’s predecessor molecule, roquinimex, 
pericarditis/pleuritis and ischemic heart disorders were identified as important safe ty concerns. 
Serious toxicities that occurred during Phase 3 trials led to discontinuation of these trials. 
Roquinimex demonstrated serious toxicities including increased rates of myocardial infarction, 
pericarditis, and pleuri tis that were observed in thr ee Phase3, placebo- controlled studies in MS 
patients. The mechanism by  which roquinimex caused these events was not identified, but they  
were considered to be possible manifestations of a sy stemic inflammatory  response, an 
assessment which was also suppor ted by roquinimex nonclinical findings. A thorough anal ysis 
was done on the laquinimod safet y data (which is mostly  reflective of the 0.6 mg/day dose) to 
evaluate similar potential safety issues. Based on 2347 patients exposed to laquinimod 0.6 mg for 
over10,000patient-years.as well as the patients exposed to 0.6 mg in the CONC ERTO and 
ARPEGGIO studies , analyses showed that these safet y issues do not constitute a clear signal for 
laquinimod in doses up to 0.6 mg/day.However, at doses of 1.2 and 1.5 mg, laquinimod 
manifested clinical evidence of myocardial infarction .
1.4.2. Overall Risk Benefit Statement
This is the first study  to evaluate laquinimod treatment in patients with PPMS.
The effects of laquinimod in the 2 pivotal studies in RRMS describe a robust an d consistent 
effect on 3, 6, and 12 months CDP. This effect is larger than expected based on the outcomes 
projected from the relapse and suggests an effect on disability  progression independent from 
inflammation (Sormani et al 2 013b). This effect has also been demonstrated in subgroups 
indicative of transition to progressive stages. 
The effect of laquinimod on PBVCin RRMS patients is also consistent between studies and 
substantiated by  an effect on other MRI  markers of neurode generation. 
Theclinical and preclinical aspects of the known MoAsupport testing of the hy pothesis whether 
treatment with laquinimod changes MRI and potentially  clinical outcomes in patients with PPMS
in a dose responsive manner .The extensively  assessed clinically observed safet y profile of 
laquinimod 0.6 mg is favorable.
The 4-week MTD study  with doses up to 2.7 mg QD ( StudyMS-LAQ-101) did not show an 
increase in total adverse event s with increased dose. Higher incidence of post baseline shifts to 
abnormally high levels of laboratory  parameters compared to the pooled placebo included liver 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
42enzymes, P-amylase, CRP ,and fibrinogen ,but most shifts were no tto potentially  clinically 
significant levels, and no dose response was observed.
Due to cardiovascul ar events and a DMC recommendation to stop all laquinimod treatment arms 
above 0.6 mg in the MS trials, the 1.5 mg treatme nt arm was discontinued as of 01 January2016.
The risk/benefit balance of this dose was considered negative at that point.
The DMC di d not identify  anyovert cardiovascular risk in the 0.6 mg treatment arm, but felt that 
long term monitorin g for emergence of an y signal was necessary .As of 29 September 2015, 
2347 patients had been exposed to laquinimod 0.6 mg for 10 ,417patient-years. It is estimated 
that the rate for my ocardial infarction and cardiovascular death for patients treated with 
laquinimod 0.6 mg is about 0.1 6per 100person-years which is within range of the expected 
cardiovascular event incidence in the underl ying population .Therefore, while no increased risk 
was seen with laquinimod 0.6 mg, because of the findings with higher doses, there is a potential 
risk that some individuals may  be at increased risk of cardiovascular events while taking 
laquinimod 0.6 mg. Appropriate risk mitigation procedure s have been implemented via a
protocol amendment to restrict excess drug exposure due to disallowed medications or organ 
impairment, as well as to assure evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk factors .
Given the unmet need for treatments of progressive MS, the data supportive of a potential effect 
of laquinimod in this population, and the identified safety profile of laquinimod, it is judged that 
the administration of laquinimod to patients with PPMS has the potential to y ield clinical 
benefits which may  outweigh the potential risks, supporting investigation of its role in this 
patient population for which there is equipoise.

453. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Design and Study Schema 
This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, 
placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of daily oral 
administration of laquinimod ( 0.6 or 1.5 mg) in patient s with PPMS.
Prior to 01 January2016, e ligible patient s wererandomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1of the 
following treatment arms (a total of 286 patients were randomized 1:1:1 prior to 
01January2016):
Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily
Laquinimod 1.5 mgdaily
Dailyplacebo
As of 01January 2016, following a decision to discontinue the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, 
additional eligible patients who are enrolled will berandomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the 
following treatment arms :
Laquinimod 0.6 mg daily
Dailyplacebo
A capped randomization procedure will be employ ed to ensure that the proportion of EDSS 6.0 
and 6.5 patients will not exceed more than 20 % of all enrolled patients.
The study  will include screening up to 6weeks and 2parts: PartA (core study ) and Part B (data 
analysis).
Part A will last at least 48 weeks, and individual patients will experience variable treatment 
durations, depending on the order of enrollment.
Once the last ongoing patient completes the week 48 visit, the spo nsor will declare end of Part A 
and begin performing study  analyses.
In PartB, patient s will continue their randoml y-assigned blinded treatments with visits every  
12 weeks until the completion visit. After up to approximately  24 weeks of Part B, or oncedata 
analysis has been completed and the design of a potential extension study  has been finalized
(including blinded or open -label treatment allocation ), patients will be invited to the clinic for the 
completion visit and will be offered the opportunity to continue into an extension study , if 
applicable .
Patients will have the following stud y visits: screening visit ( -6 weeks), baseline visit ( week0), 
weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and every  12weeks until study  completion or early termination (ET) .
The study  schema is presented in Figure1(prior to 0 1January2016) and Figure 2(from

Blood samples for determination of plasma concentration of laquinimod will be collected at 
weeks 4, 8, 12, 24and 48. The patient should be instructed to take the daily  oral dose at the same 
time each day . The date and time of the blood sample, as well as the date and time of the last 
study drug dose prior to the sample will be recorded in the source document and on the CRF.
Pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated in this study  using a population 
pharmacokinetics (PPK) approach. The PPK model may  also include any  unscheduled 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
49pharmacokinetic samples collected to assist with further investigations of car diovascular events 
or other clinical event of interest (see Section8.1). Details of sample collection and processing 
are provided in the Laboratory  Manual.
3.3. Randomization and Blinding 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients will be randoml y assigned 
to receive treatment with laquinimod at a dosage of 0.6 or 1.5mg/day, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio
(prior to 01 January2016) or randoml y assigned to receive treatment with laquinimod a t a 
dosage of 0.6 mg/day, or placebo in a 1:1ratio(from 01January2016). Patients, investigators , 
and study site personnel will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the stud y.
Laquinimod and placebo will be packaged and administered in a blinde d manner. All patients 
that discontinued the 1.5 mg dose have been unblinded .
The randomization number will be generated by the sponsor or a vendor following specifications 
from the sponsor’s biostatistics department. A statistician not assigned to the study  will be 
responsible for reviewing the randomization number.
The sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study  will be blinded to the study  drug identity  
until the database is locked for anal ysis (end of Part A) and the treatment assignment revealed .
Patientswill be randomly assigned to treatment through a qualified randomization service 
provider (eg, interactive response technology  [IRT]). 
This system is used to ensure a balance across treatment groups. A capped randomization 
procedure will be emp loyed to ensure that the number of EDSS 6.0 and 6.5 patients will be no 
more than 20% of all enrolled patients.
The patientnumber assigned during the screening visit through the interactive voice response 
system(IVRS)/interactive webresponse s ystem(IWRS)will be used to identify patients during 
the whole course of the study  regardless of the r andomization number assigned during the 
randomization visit. The randomization number assigned is solel y for treatment group allocation. 
In addition to the randomi zation number, the I VRS/IWRS will assign a pack number. The patient
will be supplied and treated throughout the study  with IMP labeled with the pack number/s 
assigned b y IVRS/IWRS at each visit.
3.3.1. Emergency Code Breaking
In case of a serious adverse event, p regnancy,or in cases when knowledge of the study  drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may  unblind the patient’s 
drug assignment as deemed necessary , mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to
the investigator(s) at the study  center via the IRT, via theinternet.
If possible, t he sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If this is not 
possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately  afterwards, and the patient’ s drug code 
assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can alway s be performed by  
the site without prior approval by  the sponsor.
In case of pregnancy , if deemed necessary  by the investigator, the patient’s drug assignment may  
be unblinded; however, the sponsor should not be notified of the treatment assignment .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
50The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully  documented, in the 
investigator’s study  files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment 
should not be recorded in any  study documents or source document.
For adverse events that are defined as: Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Reaction 
(SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety  and 
Pharmacovigilance may  independentl y request that the treatment code be revealed (on a 
case-by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory  submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, anal ysis, and reporting of the data .
3.3.2. Reducing Assessment Bias
To maintain reliable evaluation and reduce the potential for bias, the following actions will be 
undertaken:
Site clinicians may  serve as either Examining Neurologist or Treating Neurologist.
Both Examining Neurologist and Treating Neurologist will remain bli nded to study  
drug assignment.
Only an Examining Neurologist will administer the EDSS and F unctional System 
Scores (FSS).
The Examining Neurologist will not have access to the patient’ s medical records or 
source documents, including previous EDSS/FSSformsoradverse events.
Safety evaluations and other clinical considerations will be the sole responsibility  of 
the Treating Neurologist. The Treating Neurologist will be responsible for patient 
eligibility  evaluation, the supervision of the study  drug administration, clinical 
assessment and treatment, the recording and treating of adverse events, the 
monitoring of safety assessments, including routine laboratory parameters, and 
coordinating MRI performance.
The Treating Neurologist and the E xamining Neurologis twill be instructed not to 
discuss the patients with each other . In particular, the Treating Neurologist and 
Examining Neurologist will not discuss the performance or scoring of the EDSS/FSS.
Patients will be instructed not to discuss theirgeneral health condition and adverse 
eventswith the Examining Neurologist.
Only a trained, blinded rater will administer the T25FW, 9HPT, BICAMS, and 
SDMT. The blinded rater need not be a ph ysician or nurse. The blinded rater will not 
have access to the patient’s medic al records or source documents, including previous 
T25FW, 9HPT, BICAMS, or SDMT forms.

blisters will be used to accomplish the dosing of 1 of the 3 treatment arms. One capsule from 
each blister sh ould be taken daily . Both blisters and outer pack will be labeled with a unique 
pack number.
3.4.5. Distribution, Storage, Dispensing and Return
Distribution of study  drugs will be performed under sponsor's responsibility . If the study  drug 
supplies appear to be damaged/missing upon arrival at the investigational site, the sponsor should 
be contacted immediately. Study  drug supplies will be kept in a secure, limited -access, 
temperature -controlled storage area. Onl y authorized personnel will have access to the stud y 
drug. The study site personnel at each site will be responsible for correct storage and handling of 
the study drug. All study  drug packs must be stored at room temperature 15°C to 25°C/59°F to 
77°F. Study  drug packs will be dispensed to the patient at the study  site at each dispensing visit 
through the IRT. Patients will be instructed to return all used blisters and unused study  drug at 
each visit. The Site Investigator/site coordinator is responsible for performing stud y drug 
accountability  at the site. The Monitor is responsible for the accountability of the returned study 
drugs.
3.5. Duration of Patient Participation 
For each patient, the study will consist of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, Part A (core study ) 
of at least 48 weeks, and Part B (data ana lysis) of up to approximately  24weeks or until data 
analysis is completed and the design of a potential extension study  has been finalized. Following 
the completion visit, patients will be offered the opportunity  to continue into an extension study .
3.6. Safety Guidelines and Stopping Rules
3.6.1. Pregnancy
Exposure to laquinimod during pregnancy  must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing 
potential (for example women who are not postmenopausal or surgicall y sterilized) must practice 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
52an acceptable method of bir th control for 30 day s before taking the study  treatment and have a 
negative serum pregnancy  test within 7 day s prior to initiation of treatment.
To further emphasize the importance of use of acceptable contraception and avoidance of 
pregnancy  under laquinimod exposure, and to reduce as much as possible the exposure to 
laquinimod if a pregnancy occur despite all recommended measures, all patients who are women 
of child-bearing potential (for example women who are not postmenopausal or surgical ly
sterilized)will be instructed about the teratogenicity  and potential delay ed risks for a child 
exposed in uter oto laquinimod. These patients will also be counseled about the importance of 
using 2methods of acceptable contraception throughout treatment duration, and until 30 days 
after the last dose of treatment isadministered ,and about the need to stop treatment immediatel y 
if pregnancy  is suspected .
Acceptable methods of birth control include intrauterine devices, barrier methods (condom or 
diaphragm with spermicide) and hormonal methods of birth control (oral contraceptive, 
contraceptive patch, long- acting injectable contraceptive) .
In case of suspected pregnancy (positive urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG]test 
result, delay of menstruation or an y other reason suggesting pregnancy ), the study  drug will be 
suspended, and follow -up will be done as detailed in Appendix B.
3.6.2. Liver Enzymes
Forany increase of ALT or AST to ≥2×ULN,the “Guidance on Safet y Monitori ng” in
Appendix Bshould be thoroughl y followed.
In the following circumstances, the patient’s participation in the study  will be discontinued
immediately  and liver enzy mes will be monitored until normalization o r stabilization, according
to the guidance in Appendix B:
Any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3×ULN,combined with international normalized 
ratio (INR) >1.5 or total b ilirubin >2× ULN.
Any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3×ULN, which is accompanied b y nausea,
vomiting, fever, rash, or eosinophilia.
Any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5×but <8×ULN, which is persistent for
≥2weeks of repeated measurements.
Any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8 ×ULN.
In any case where monitoring of liver enzymes cannot be performed according to the
protocol guidance (see Appendix B).
3.6.3. Cancer
Patientswhoare diagnosed with a malignant solid or liquid tumor while participating in the 
study should stop study  medication .
3.6.4. Liver Impairment
To avoid exposures to higher levels of laquinimod (see Section1.3.2.1), a stopping role related 
to liver impairment has been introduced. Patients who develop an y chronic liver disease 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
53associated with hepaticfunction impairment while participating in the study  should stop study  
medication.
3.6.5. Renal Impairment
To avoid exposures to higher levels of laquinimod (see Section1.3.2.1), a stopping role related 
to renal impairment has been introduced. Patients who develop renal disease associated with 
moderate or severe functional impairment, defined as glomerular filtration rate( GFR)
≤60mL/min/1.73 m2,while participating in the study should stop study medication temporarily 
and the GFR assessment should be repeated. If the renal impairment is confirmed (GFR
≤60mL/min/1.73 m2), the patient should stop study medication permanently .
3.6.6. Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug Treatment
Temporary  discontinuation is defined as missing of more than 3 consecutive doses of the study
drug. Skipping 14 or more consecutive doses of study  drug will be considered a major protocol
violation.
In the event of temporary study  drug discontinuation, the local clinical management should be 
notified.The patient will report an y temporary  discontinuation to the investigator and will be 
instructed by the investigator regarding continuation of treatment based on the reason and 
duration of discontinuation.
3.6.7. Early Termination (ET)
An ET visit should be completed for all patients who prematurel y terminate treatment or who 
become pregnant (see Section 3.11.4for details of procedures).
In all cases of ET due to ongoing adverse event , manifestation of a severe degree of intolerance 
to studydrug and/or ongoing MS relapse, the patientshould remain under medical observation 
andfollowed until the medical condition returns to ba seline or is considered stable or chronic.
Early termination refers to the study drug termination and not termination of the patient from the 
study. Patients will be encouraged to continue all scheduled visits and procedures after study  
drug discontinuatio n (with the exception of drug dispensing and accountability , pregnancy  
testing, and pharmacokinetic sampling).
Women of child bearing potential should continue using 2 acceptable contraception methods up 
to 30days after the last dose of treatment was admi nistered.
Moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed during the 30 days after the last dose has
been administered. For information on the use of CYP1A2 substrates following laquinimod 
cessation, please refer to the laquinimod IB.
3.7. Study Drug Supply and Accountability 
3.7.1. Study Drug Storage and Security
Study drug (laquinimod and placebo) must be stored at room temperature (15°C to 25°C), in a 
dry,temperature -controlled ,securely locked, substantially- constructed cabinet or enclosure. The 
study site personnel at each site will be responsible for correct storage and handling of the study  
drug.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
543.7.2. Study Drug Accountability 
Each stud y drug shipment will include a packing slip, listing the contents of the shipment. The
return instructions and the applicable form s will be provided to the site. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that deliveries of stud y drug and other stud y materials from the sponsor 
are correctly  received and recorded, handled and stored safel y and properly in accordance with 
the local r egulations, and used in accordance with this protocol. 
A record of stud y drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, 
returned) must be prepared and signed b y the principal investigator or designee, with an account 
given for any discrepancies. Reconciled stud y drug will be returned to the sponsor or its 
designee.
During the study , all unused study  drugs and the corresponding accountability  forms must be
returned b y the monitor to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee on an on-going basis for
reconciliation and destruction. A photocopy  of these records must be kept at the study  sites.
The accountability  of the returned stud y drugs should be performed and recorded b y the
sponsor’s assigned monitor. The Patient Number, the date, batch code/batch number, pack
number and quantit y of study drugs returned b y the patientwill be checked for correctness and
recorded on the appropriate accountability  forms, to be provided by  the CSC via I WRS and/or 
IVRS.The monitor will use the IRT to record the returns.
3.8. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding 
The relevant SOPs regarding the maintenance of randomization and blinding will be followed b y 
sponsor’s/vendor’s personnel .
Staff responsible for bioanaly sis and pharmacokinetic data analy sis will not have access to an y 
clinical data and will provide concentration data to other staff members in a manner that will not 
identify individual patients (ie, a dummy  patientidentifier will be linked to an individual 
patient’s concentration data).
For aSUSAR, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  andPharmacovigilance Department may  
independentl y request that the treatment code be revealed if needed (on a case -by-case basis). If 
this occurs, the investigator will remain blinded to treatment.
All patients that discontinued the 1.5 mg dose have been unblinded .
3.9. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form 
All patientdata must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they  are transcribed onto the CRF. Data m ay not be recorded directl y onto the 
CRF and considered as source data unless the investigational center obtains written 
documentation from the sponsor , before the beginning of the stud y, indicating which data are 
permitted to be recorded directly  onto theCRF. 
Source data, including test results and/or assessments (eg, clinical laboratory  test results, ECG 
data, safety  and efficacy  measurements) collected by  institutions outside of the study  centerare 
sent to the study center, where they  are retained butnot entered into the CRF. T hese results may  
be sent directl y to the sponsor for entry into the clinical database (see Section13.1).

4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country ’s 
acceptance), each patient is free to withdraw from the st udy at any time. The investigator also 
has the right to withdraw a patientfrom the stud y or stop drug treatment due to an y of the 
reasons listed in Section4.3.1.In addition, a patientmay be withdrawn from the study as 
described in Sections 3.6and5.3. 
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of study  drug(s), or should the 
investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all 
observations up to the time of withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the 
patient’s withdrawal should be made and an explanation given as to why  the patientis 
withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
76The reason for and date of withdrawal from study  drug treatment and the reason for and date of 
withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every  attempt will be made to determine the reason. If 
the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  test 
result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
specific event or test result(s) must be recorded on the sour ce documentation and transcribed 
onto the CRF. 
All evaluations should be performed according to the protocol on the last day the patienttakes 
study drug, or as soon as possible thereafter.
4.3.1. PatientWithdrawal Criteria
A patientmay withdraw or be withdraw n from the study  for the following reasons:
death
patientwithdrew consent
sponsor requested patient to be withdrawn
study terminated b y the sponsor
protocol violation
non-compliance with study  drug
lost to follow -up/failure to return
adverse event
lack ofefficacy (according to the investigators decision)

5.2.2. Concomitant Medications/Therapies During Study
5.2.2.1. Allowed Medications/Therapies D uring Study
Administration of all medications, including indication, dose, frequency , and route of 
administration will be recorded in the source documentation file and in the CRF.
Symptomatic MS agents, such as anti -cholinergic and spasmoly tic drugs, are 
permitted at clinicall y appropriate doses. Dose changes and initiation of symptomatic 
treatments during the study  should be avoidedif possible .
Short-term treatment (up to 5days) with intravenous corticosteroids will be allowed 
during relapses, although these are rare in PPMS .The suggested treatment for a 
relapse will be intravenous methy lprednisolone 500 to 1000 mg/day  for3 to 5 
consecutive day s.
Other medications, excluding those mentioned in Appendix Cmay be given 
concomitantly  as needed for the patient’s welfare.
Topical and inhaled steroids are allowed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist
for indications other than MS.
Clinical studies have shown laquinimod to be a strong inducer of CYP1A2. Patient s 
taking drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 (examples listed in Appendix E)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
79should be advised that plasma levels of these drugs could decrease when combined 
with laquinimod. In general, as a precautionary  measure, it is recommended to avoid 
the use of CYP1A2 substrates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives 
may be considered in the appropriate clinical context. Additional information on 
concomitant use of laquinimod and CYP1A2 substrates is presented in the 
laquinimod IB.
Drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with laquinimod doses of 0.6 and 
1.2mg.These studies show edthat laquinimod , at both doses, is a weak inhibitor of 
CYP3A4. Patients taking drugs that are metabolized by  CYP3A4 (specifically  those 
with a narrow therapeutic index listed in Appendix E) should be advised that plasma 
levels of these drugs could increase when combined with laquinimod.
Use of a currently  marketed drug in a clinical study within 24 weeks prior to baseline
is allowed.

alemtuzumab
inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin (more examples listed in Appendix C)
moderate/strong inhib itors of CYP3A4 such as erythromy cin and ketoconazole (more 
examples listed in Appendix C). Laquinimod is extensively  metabolized 
predominantly  by CYP3A4 , and ketoconazole and fluconazole, s trong and moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 ,were found to inhibit the metabolism , leading to 2.5- and 
3.1-fold increases in laquini mod exposure , respectively.
mitoxantrone
oral steroids , except as pre scribed for non- MS reasons (eg , asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary  disease)

other agents with the aim of disease modification
5.3. Procedures for Monitoring PatientCompliance
Each investigator will be responsible for monitoring patientcompliance. A check of stud y drug 
compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of study  drug, and 
study drug accountabilit y records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines 
that the patientis not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor 
should determi ne whether the patientshould be withdrawn. The IEC/IRB should be notified, 
according to local regulations.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
836.4.2. Neurological Evaluations (EDSS and FSS)
Neurological evaluations (EDSS and FSS) will be performed in atreatment blinded manner by 
the Examining Neurologist .The patientwill be instructed not to discuss his/her well- being and 
adverse event s with the E xamining N eurologist. Every effort should be made to ensure that the 
same Examining N eurologist will perform the neurological assessment at all visits for a 
particular patient.
EDSSandFSSwill be assessed based on the Neurostatus scoring guidelines ( Appendix G),a 
slightly modified neurological examination than the one described by  Kurtzke (Kurtzke 1983 ).
The results will be recorded in standardized and validated examination forms (see Appendix G) 
as well as in the CRF . Fatigue will not contribute to the cerebral FS S and EDSS step.
6.4.3. Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW)
The T25FWis a quantitative measur e of lower extremity function. The patientis directed to one 
end of a clearl y marked 25-f oot course a nd is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly  as possible, 
but safely. The task is immediately administered again b y having the patient walk back the same 
distance. Patient s may use assistive devices when doing this task.
The T25FWis administered in person by a blinded, trained rater . The raterneed not be a 
physician or nurse.
Full instructions for the T25FW are provided in Appendix H.
6.4.4. 9 -Hole Peg Test(9HPT)
The 9HPT is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. I t is a
component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Both the dominant and non -
dominant hands are tested twice. The patient is seated at a table with a small, shallow container 
holding 9 pegs and a wood or plastic block conta ining 9empty holes. A stopwatch is started and 
the patient picks up the 9pegs, 1at a time as quickly  as possible, puts them in the 9holes, and, 
once they  are in the holes, removes them again as quickly  as possible , 1at a time, replacing them 
into the shallow container. The total time to complete the task is recorded. Two consecutive trials 
with the dominant hand are immediatel y followed by 2consecutive trials with the non -dominant 
hand.
The 9HPT is administered in person by  a blinded, trained rater . The raterneed not be a phy sician 
or nurse.
Full instructions for the 9HPT are provided in Appendix I.
6.4.5. Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) 
Score
The BICAMS battery  of tests takes 15 minutes to complete, requires no specialist equipment and 
no specialist expertise in cognitive assessment ( Langdon 2012 ). BICAMS comprises:
SDMT (see Section 6.4.6). While part of BICAMS ,it will be administ ered as a 
standalone test, thus performing this as part of BICAMS is not required.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
84California Verbal Learning Test– II (CVLT-II) (first 5 recall trials): this comprises a 
16-item word list, with 4 items belonging to each of 4categories, arranged randomly . 
The list is read aloud 5times in the same order to the patient, at a slightl y slower rate 
than 1item per second. Patients are required to recall as many  items as possible, in 
any order, after each reading of the list. The test can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes, 
including instructions, testing and responses.
Brief Visuospatial Memory  Test –Revised(BVMT-R) (first 3 recall trials) : this 
requires the patient to inspect a 2× 3 stimulus array  of abstract geometric figures
(Form1 from the Recall Stimulus B ooklet). There are 3 learning trials of 10 seconds. 
The array  is removed and the patient is required to draw the array  from memory , with 
the correct shapes in the correct position. Scoring of the BVMT -R drawings will be 
performed b y a central expert vendor .
The BICAMS is administered in person b y a treatment blinded, trained rater. The rater does not 
need to be a ph ysician or nurse.
Full instructions for the BICAMS administration and scoring are provided in theBICAMS
administration manual.
6.4.6. Symbol Digit Modalities T est(SDMT)
SDMT is a traditional, person -administered cognitive test that measures visual processing speed 
in 5minutes. I t can detect cognitional changes over time and be done orall y or inwriting. 
Despite its brevity , the SDMT is probably  the most robust correlate with abnormal brain MRI 
findings, including brain lesion volume, BA, diffusion tensor indices of normal -appearing brain 
tissue, and retinal thickness. I n addition, other findings suggest that compared to other 
well-established measures of cognitive function, it more accurately reflects the qualitative nature 
of self-reported cognitive impairment.
Only verbal administration of the SDMT will be permitted in this study .
Full instruct ions for SDMT administration and scoring are provided in the BICAMS 
administration manual. Although SDMT is part of BICAMS ,it will be administered as a 
standalone test during this study .
6.4.7. Modified Rankin Scale
The mRS is a commonly  used scale for measuring the degree of disability  or dependence in the 
daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability
(Rankin 1957; Farrel let al 1991 ).The scale runs from 0 (no sy mptoms) to 5 (severe disability), 
with a score of 6 used in the event of a death (Appendix J).
6.4.8. Low Contrast Visual Acuity (LCVA)
It has been demonstrated that L CVA, as measured using the Sloan Charts, has a substantial 
capacity to capture visual dysfunction in patients with MS. 
LCVA will be assessed for each ey e separatel y and then binocularl y,at week0 (baseline), 
week24, and every  24 weeks until completion/ET. At each visit, the letter acuity  will be 
captured us ing 100%, 2.5%, a nd 1.25% contrast charts, from a distance of 2 meters, with the 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
85patient’s usual distance correction. In case the patient is not familiar with the English/Roman 
alphabet, the Tumbling E charts will be used.
Detailedinstructions for LCVA administration are provided in the operations manual.
6.4.9. 12 -Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12)
The MSWS -12 was designed as a disease -specific, patient -based instrument , ie a patient reported 
outcome, for use in clinical studiesand clinical practice, to capture th e complex impact of MS on 
walking ability (Hobart et al 2003). It contains 12 questions with ordered responses, and has a 
recall period of 2 weeks (Appendix K). Individual items are scored on a Likert scale . The test 
takes less than 5 minutes to complete.
6.4.10. Relapse Evaluation
6.4.10.1. On-Study Relapse Evaluation
Relapses are rare events in PPMS. In the event of neurological s ymptoms suggestive of a relapse,
patients will be instructed to telephon e their study site within 48 hours. The T reating Neurologist 
will evaluate the patient once any symptom suggestive of a relapse occurs. During ascheduled or 
unscheduled visit, in case of a suggested relapse, the Treating Neurologist will refer the patient
to theExamining N eurologist for performance of EDSS and FSS assessments . The Examining 
Neurologist will evaluate the patient within 7days of symptom onset, conditional upon a 
symptomatic period of ≥48hours.
6.4.10.2. The Treating Neurologist
The Treating Neurologist will determine if a patientexperiences a relapse (see relapse definition,
0)and whether to treat the relapse or not. The Treating Neurologist will remain blinded to study  
drug assignment.
6.4.10.3. The Examining Neu rologist
The Examining N eurologist will be responsible for all EDSS and FSS assessments . Throughout 
the study, the Examining Neurologist will remain unaware of the safet y profile and will be kept 
blinded to all treatment assignments. For each patient, the same Examining Neurologist should 
be used for all neurological exams performed throughout the stud y.
Note: It is particularl y important that the Treating Neurologist and theE xamining Neurologist do 
not discuss safet y issues orperformance or scoring of th e EDSS/FSS with each other. The
Examining Neurologist will not ask the patientany questions regarding his/her well being.
The Treating Neurologist will inform the patient of the importance of not discussingsafet y issues 
with the Examining Neurologist.
6.4.10.4. Relapse Determination
An Examining N eurologist will administer the EDSS and FSS , unaware of patient’s well-being.
The Treating Neurologist will make the decision as to whether the neurological change is 
considered a relapse (see relapse definition, 0).Clinicalrelapses must be recorded in the CRF. 
Patients with a relapse may  continue in the study .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
86The Treating Neurologist will prescribe steroids or other concomitant medications as needed. 
The suggested treatment fo r a relapse will be intravenous methy lprednisolone 500 to 
1000mg/day for 3 to 5 consecutive day s.
Follow-up visits to monitor the course of the relapse until stabilization will be made at T reating 
Neurologist discretion, in addition to the assessment at t he next scheduled visit.
In the case of an ongoing relapse at the study  completion/ET visit, patients willbe followed up 
until relapse stabilization, wherever possible.

877. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  staff by evaluating the following: 
reported adverse events ,clinical laboratory  test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, 
physical examination findings and concomitant medication usage.
During the conduct of the study , an independent DMC will review accumulating safet y data on a 
regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and study  conduct issues.
The DMC will be composed of independent phy sicians with expertise in the relevant therapeutic 
field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician. The DMC will receive safet y data 
periodicall y. They will have the right to recommend discontinuation of the study  for safety 
reasons. 
DMCsessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor may  
be present and information is provided and discussed in a blinded fashion. During closed 
sessions, the only  participants are members of the DMC and the designated unblinded 
statistician. 
The DMC chairperson will communicate with the sponsor in regard to issues re sulting from the 
conduct and clinical aspects of the study . The sponsor will work closel y with the committee to 
provide the necessary  data for review.
7.1. Adverse Events 
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patientadministered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. 
In this stud y, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patienthas signed the informed 
consent form should be recorded and r eported as an adverse event. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of the study, or 
significant worsening of the disease un der study or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present be fore study entry and do not worsen during the study  will not be considered adverse 
events. 
Worsening of the disease under study  should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
presentation and/or outcome is more severe than would normally  be expected f rom the normal 
course of the disease in a particular patient.
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
88significant worsening (change in nature , severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions. (N ote: A condition recorded as pre -existing 
that is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, headache] and which occurs during the study  
should be recorded as an adverse event.)
drug interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phase of the 
study
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered 
by the investigator to be clinically  significant. Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patientfrom enterin g the stud y or receiving study 
treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be evaluated to monitor data
from patients who do not meet screening criteria 
all events of possible drug- induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as 
AST or ALT ≥3×ULN, plus either bilirubin ≥2×ULN or INR >1.5) or Hy ’s Law 
events require immediate study  treatment cessation and reporting as a serious adverse 
event
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
For adverse event recording, the stud y period is defined f or each patient as that time period from 
signature of the informed consent form through the end of the follow -up period. For this study , 
the follow- up period is defined as 30days after the last dose of study drug. 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged 
relationship to the study  drug. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Form must 
also be compl eted and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately  (see 
Section7.1.5.3.1).
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must query  the patientfor adverse 
events by  asking an open -ended question such as, “Have you had an y unusual symptoms or 
medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and 
symptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical 
condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a 
diagnosis is made, all related signs, s ymptoms, and any  test findings will be recorded collectivel y 
as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious advers e event, on the Serious Adverse 
Event Form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved or 
stabilized or returned to baseline, or until the patientis referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is 
made.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
89The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
The relationship of each adverse event to study  drug treatment and study  procedures, and the 
severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged b y theinvestigator, must be recorded 
as described below.
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual ac tivities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relationship of an adverse event to the study  drug is characterized as follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events, which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
it does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
fromthe administration of the test drug.
it could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
it does not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
test drug. 
it does not reappear or w orsen when the drug is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the test drug ad ministration cannot be 
ruled out with certainty nor felt w ith 
a high degree of certainty to be 
related to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:
it follows a rea sonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.
it cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient .
it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness 
clearly exists.
it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
907.1.5. Serious Adverse Events 
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
death
a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patientwas at immediate ris k of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or p rolongation of hospital stay  were required for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations scheduled for an elective procedure or for treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened durin g participation in the study  will not be 
considered serious adverse events. 
persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
a congenital anomaly /birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may  jeopardize the patientand may require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note : Any suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event.
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
7.1.5.2. Expectedness 
A serious adverse event that is not include d in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safet y information for this study is the laquinimod IB.
The sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilan ce Department will determine the expectedness for all serious 
adverse events.
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, all serious adverse events (as described in Section 7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the study period (including the protocol- defined follow -up period), regardless 
of judged relationship to treatment with the study  drug, must be reported to the sponsor by  the 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
91investigator within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious 
adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the information is 
available. The investigator does not need to actively  monitor patients for adverse events once the 
study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patientafter the treatment of that patient
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them.
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the T eva local safety  officer (LSO) or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization [CRO] in a country  without a Teva LSO) 
Contact information is in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section; the L SO will 
forward the report to t hesponsor’s Global Patient Safety  andPharmacovigilanceDepartment.
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number TV5600- CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
investigator and investigational center identification
patientnumber
onset date and detailed description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information may  include the following:
age and gender of patient
date of first dose of study drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
explanation of assessment of relatedness
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) an d treatment of the 
event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data 
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event resulting in death: 
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study  drug)
autopsy findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated b y the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study  drug, study  
procedures, and to underlying dis ease.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
92Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes 
known to the same address as the initial report. 
For all cou ntries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  andPharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for I nternational Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/XML 
file to the L SO/CRO for local submission to the regulatory  authorities and IEC/I RBs and 
investigators, according to regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with local regulations.
The blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directl y in the study. Therefore, 
in case of a SUSAR, only  the LSO (or CROpersonnel involved with safety  regulatory  
submissions) will receive the unblinded report for regulatory  submission; the others will receive 
a blinded report. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a se rious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy  form (see 
Section7.2).
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility 
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of laquinimod and the appropriate regulatory  authorities/EC .
In addition to notify ing the investigators and regulatory  authorities/EC , other measures may  be 
required, including the following: 
altering existing research by  modifying the protocol
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
altering the process of informed consent b y modifying the existing consent form and 
informing current stud y participants of new findings
modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to laquinimod
7.1.6. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events for Expedit ed Reporting
Ischemic cardiac events (such as my ocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute coronary  
syndrome etc), and cerebrovascular events (such as cerebral arterial occlusion, cerebral ischemia, 
etc) should be reported to the sponsor within 48 hours, including completion of the 
corresponding dedicated CRF.
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may  be withdrawn from the study at any time at 
the discretion of the investigator . If a patient is withdrawn wholl y or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse event page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at 
that time. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
93The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the sponsor as soon as possible of all patients who are being consider ed 
for withdrawal due to adverse events . Additional reports must be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the 
termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event . 
An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that in the opinion of 
the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but thatrequires the use of a 
prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient . In such a case, the reason 
for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event.
7.1.8. Medical Emergencies
Medical emergencies must be reported to the individual identified in the clini cal study personnel 
contact information sectionof this protocol.
Equipment, supplies, and properl y skilled medical personnel must be accessible for an adverse 
event requiring immediate treatment. An y dose of study  drug (whether the investigational 
product, reference therapy , or a placebo), whether taken intentionally  or unintentionally , in 
excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the sponsor. When the identification of 
the study drug must be known, the investigator must follow the procedur es outlined in 
Section3.8. 
7.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event 
If a patientexperiences an adverse event or medical emergency , departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patientsafety, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact the individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soo n as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patientshould continue to participate in the study . Any 
departures from the proto col because of adverse events mus t be noted on the CRF and in source 
documents, along with the reason for such departures. 
7.2. Pregnancy 
Patients who are women of child -bearing potential ( for example women who are not 
postmenopausal or surgical lysterilized)must practice an acceptable method of birth control for 
30days before taking the study  drug, and use 2 acceptable methods of contraception throughout 
treatment duration and until 30 days after the last dose of treatment .
Acceptable methods of birth control include intrauterine devices , barrier methods (condom o r 
diaphragm with spermicide) , and hormonal methods of birth control ( eg, oral contraceptive, 
contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptive).
The patients’understanding of the importance of preventive pregnancy  measures and their ability  
to follow the required instructions will be ensured by  the investigator and documented in source 
documents .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
94Additionally , pregnancy  tests (urine dipstick and/or serum pregnancy  β-hCG test, as applicable 
per the relevant time point) will be performed.
All pregn ancies of women participating in stud ythat occur during the study , or within 30 days 
after the last dose of treatment was administered, are to be reported immediately  to the individual 
identified in the clinical study  personnel contact information section of this protocol, and the 
investigator must provide the L SO/CRO with the pregnancy  form. The process for reporting a 
pregnancy  is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section 7.1.5.3).
Any woman who becomes pregnant during the study  will discontinue treatment. Patientswho 
become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy  (including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination. If the pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 
8 weeks of age), details of birth, and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. An y 
complication of pregnancy  during the study  and any complication of pregnancy  that the 
investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study  will be reported as an adverse 
event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be ta ken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event .
For an elec tive abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event.
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests

7.3.4. Urgent Safety Laboratory Panel
Unscheduled urgent safety laboratory  samples may  be collected at the discretion of the 
investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigat ions of cardiovascular 
eventsor other clinical event of interest . The samples should be collected as soon as possible in 
association with the event.
The following tests will be performed on these samples:

antibodies (ASMA), anti -liver kidney  microsomal (LKM) antibodies (to be performed 
in a central laboratory , only if required according to the Guidance on Safety  
Monitoring, see Appendix B)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
977.3.6. Urinalysis
Urinalysis, performed at the screening visit, will include the following:
protein
glucose
ketones
erythrocytes
leukocytes
pH
7.3.7. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
Serum pregnancy  test (β-hCG) for women of child -bearing potential at all visits; at 
baseline, this will be done within 7 days prior to the initiation of treatment, such that 
the result is available prior to the first dose.
Urine pregnancy  test (β-hCG) for w omen of child -bearing potential at all visits . In 
case of positive result, study  drug should not be dispensed, until results of serum 
β-hCG test are available. The rest of the visit activities should be performed.
Starting from week 12visit, between study visits, women of child-bearing potential 
will be provided with home pregnancy  urine β-hCG test kits and will be instructed 
how to perform the test. The site staff will schedule the home test to be performed 
every 28±2days. To verify  whether the test has been performed and to record the 
result of the test, a mandatory  phone call will be performed b y the Treating 
Neurologist or b y the site’s nurse/study coordinator within 72 hours after the test was 
scheduled to be performed. I n case of a suspected pregnan cy(positive urine β -hCG 
test result, delayof menstruation or an y other reason suggesting pregnancy ), the caller 
will ensure that the study drug has been stopped and the patient will be instructed to 
arrive to the study site as soon as possible (within 10 day s)for further evaluations 
with the remaining stud y medications.
7.4. Vital Signs and Weight
Vital signs will be measured as detailed in Section 3.11. Weight will be measured at all visits.
7.5. Electrocardiography 
Central ECG reading is used in this study and ECGs should be performed according to central 
ECG reading instructions.
The patientshould rest for at least 10minutes before measurement is taken. Twelve- lead ECGs 
should be performed following the patientbeing ina supine position for 5 minutes. Three 
recordings will be performed before first dose during the baseline visit.
The ECG will be evaluated by the investigator at time of performance (signed and dated) and the 
printout should be kept in the source documentation file. When potentially clinically  significant 
findings are detected b y the site investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a definitive 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
98interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the source documentation 
file.
Objective alerts are pre- defined as described in the central ECG reading manual. I n these cases 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately .
The final decision whether the ECG findings are of clinical significance is under 
investigator/local cardiolog ist responsibility .
All unscheduled ECGs must be performed through central ECG reading.
7.6. Physical Examinations 
Any abnormal findings assessed by  the investigator as clinicall y significant should be recorded 
in the relevant CRF modules (eg ,adverse event, m edical history ).
7.7. Glomerular Filtration Rate Estimation
Significant changes in laquinimod exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug fraction, are 
predicted in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see Section1.3.2.1). 
Consequently , GFR will be estimated at all visits to monitor renal function in the study  in order 
to identify  patients with potentially  impaired laquinimod clearance. Pa tients with a confirmed 
GFR ≤60mL/min/1.73 m2should stop study  medication temporarily and the GFR assessment 
should be repeated. If the renal impairment is confirmed ( GFR≤60mL/min/1.73 m2), the patient 
should stop study  medication permanently (see Section3.6.5).
Following recent findings connecting Gd -based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic 
sclerosis, the GFR resultshould be available prior to the baseline MRI scan .GFR estimation will 
be done in acco rdance with the central lab oratorycreatinine value measurement performed at the
screening visit. The central laboratory  will report estimated GFR; however, if the result is not 
available prior to the baseline MRI  scan, the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation (2009) from the 
following online GFR calculator should be used by the investigator:
http://www.kidney .org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm
7.8. Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Management
Evaluation and management of major modifiable cardiac risk factors (e g, diabetes, high blood 
pressure, h yperlipidemia, tobacco smoking) will be performed at the time points indicated in 
Table5and Table6. In addition, an evaluation should take place as soon as possible for patients 
already in the stud y, following approval of Global Amendment 2.
Cardiovascular risk management should be conducted according to evidence -based, local 
standard-of-care procedures . Patients will undergo r eferral to asuitable clinic if needed.
7.9. Other Safety Measures and Variables : Concomitant Therapy or 
Medication
Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section 5.2.

998. ASSESSMENT OF  PHARMA COKINETICS/
PHARMACOGENOMICS/OTH ER ANCILLARY STUDIES
8.1. Pharmacok inetic Variables
Samples will be analy zed for laquinimod using an appropriate validated method. I ncurred sample 
reanalysis may be performed. 
Blood samples ( approximately  4mL) will be collected from all patients at weeks4, 8, 12, 24, 
and 48for plasma concentration measurements of laquinimod.
Unscheduled pharmacokinetic blood samples may  be collected at the discretion of the 
investigator or medica l monitor at any  time to assist with further investigations of cardiovascular 
eventsor other clinical event of interest . The samples should be collected as soon as possible in 
association with the event.
The dates and times of study  drug administration an d the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
Pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated in this study  using a PPK approach. Details of 
blood samplingcollection and pro cessing are provided in the Laboratory  Manual.
8.2. Potential Biomarker Measures
Potential biomarker assessments to better understand laquinimod MoA, as well as to explore 
response predictive markers for efficacy  or safety, may include 1) c ytokines and other so luble 
marker levels; 2) gene and RNA expression; 3) proteomic profile; and/or 4) o ther relevant 
biomarkers.
Details of sample collection and processing are provided in the Laboratory  Manual.
Analysis will be performed if and when required. Since new biomarker techniques continue to be 
developed, the method and laboratory  that will be recommended cannot be anticipated.
Unscheduled samples for potential biomarker assessments may  be collected at the discretion of 
the investigator or medical monitor at any  timeto assist with further investigations of 
cardiovascular event sor other clinical event of interest . The samples should be collected as soon 
as possible in association with the event.
8.3. Pharmacogenomic Variables
PGx studies investigate the association betwee n genetic sequence pol ymorphisms and/or gene 
expression signatures and clinical response to a certain therapeutic intervention. I t may help 
explaining inter- individual variability  and subsequently  identify population subgroups that 
respond differentl y to the drug. Furthermore, regulatory  guidance and white papers indicate that 
PGx analy ses employ ing DNA collected from all study  participants may  support investigation of 
unexpected adverse events.
In order to allow an y subsequent anal yses, appropriate samples will be requested from all 
patients in the study ; however this can be omitted if considered unacceptable per local 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
100regulations . PGx assessment might include DNA variations potentially  associated with clinical 
treatment responses to laquinimod (eg, clinica l effect, pharmacokinetics, tolerability , and safet y 
features or disease susceptibility  and severit y features). The final list of genes that might be 
investigated will be selected at a later stage before the anal ysis so as to allow updating with new 
scientific information. Genomic anal ysis could also include a sequencing of the whole genome if 
required.
The PGx sample should be collected at baseline; if the sample is not obtained at baselinefor any 
reason, it should be collected at the next possible visit.
8.4. Other Ancillary Studies
8.4.1. Cerebrospinal F luid (CSF) A ssessment
Putative neuroprotective effects of laquinimod will be explored in a subset of patients (only 
selected sites will participate) by analyzing CSF levels of axonal, neuronal , and/or inflammatory  
markers. CSF will be collected via lumbar puncture according to standard or local practice, using 
atraumatic needles. Additional detail can be found in the CSF Ancillary  Study Manual.
CSF (to be performed in selected sites) will be collected from all patients who signed an 
appropriate , ECapproved informed consent form, at week48.
8.4.2. Optical C oherence Tomography (OCT) E valuation 
OCT is a fast, non-invasive, interferometric technique that allows imaging of the retina, 
including the retinal nerve fiber lay er (RNFL), which is principally  composed of the axons of the 
ganglion cells that form the optic nerves. Since these axons are nonm yelinated until they 
penetrate the lamina cribrosa, the RNFL is an ideal structure for visualizing subtle processes of 
axonal degene ration.
Retinal degeneration in MS not only  reflects a morphological correlate of the functional visual 
deficits in MS patients, but also mirrors the overall disability  assessed by  the EDSS and the BA 
measured b y MRI. Therefore, OCT is an ideal tool for vi sualizing the processes of 
neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neurorepair in MS.
Additional detail can be found in Appendix Land the OCT Ancillary  Study manual.
OCT (to be performed in selected sites) will be performed in all patient s who signed an 
appropriate , ECapproved informed consent form, at week0 (can be performed up to 42 days 
prior to baseline), week48(or ET visit if performed after the week 24 visit and prior to 
week48), and week 96to assess retinal thickness.

1019. STATISTICS 
9.1. Study Design and Randomization
This study  is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of daily oral 
administration of laquinimod (0.6 or [until 01January2016] 1.5mg) in patients with PPMS.
Randomization will be as described in Section 3.3.The analyses described in S ections 9.6 and 
9.8will be performed using data collect ed during Part A (Core Study ). Data collected during 
PartB may be used for additional exploratory  analyses as will be described in a SAP, to be
approved and sign edprior to unblinding the Part Adata.
9.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Sample size calculations were based on the following assumptions:
2-sided alpha level of 5%
treatment difference (delta) of 0.3 in PBVC
standard deviation of 0.8
Under the above assumptions 252 patients enrolled for 0. 6mg and placebo (126 per arm) will 
provide 84% power to detect a statistically  significant result for 0.6 mg laquinimod arm 
comparison to placebo. To adjust for the anticipated 10% dropouts, the sample size was 
increased to 280patients. Adding 95 patient s on 1.5mg yields a total of 375 patients.
9.3. Populations 
9.3.1. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized patients. In this population, 
treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless 
of which treatment they  actually received.
9.3.2. Modified ITT 1(mITT1) Population 
The modified ITT 1(mITT1) population is a subset of the ITT set . It will include all patients in 
the ITT population with at least 1 post baseline PBVCassessment .
9.3.3. Modified ITT 2 (mITT2) Population 
The modified ITT 2 (mITT2) population is a subset of the ITT set . It will include all patients in 
the ITT population with at least 1 post baseline efficacy  assessment.
9.3.4. Safety (ST) Population
The safety (ST) population will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of 
study drug. In this population, treatment will be assigned based upon the treatment patients 
actually receive, regardless of the treatment to which they  were randomized. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
1029.3.5. Per-Protocol (PP) Population
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the mI TT1population and will consist of all 
patients with no major protocol violations.
9.4. Data Handling Conventions
Only the observed data from the patientswill be used in the statistic al analyses. There is no plan 
to estimate missing data .
The censoring rules for time to event anal ysis will be as described in Section 9.6.2.
9.5. Study Population
The ITT population (see Section 9.3) will be used for all study  population summaries unless 
otherwise noted. Summaries will be presented by  treatment group and for all patient s.
9.5.1. PatientDisposition
Data from patients screened, patient s screened but not randomized (and reason not randomized), 
patients who are randomized (ITT), patients randomized but not treated (and reason not treated) , 
patients in the safet y, mITT1, mI TT2,and PP populations, patient s who complete the study , and 
patients who perform ET will be summarized using de scriptive statistics. Data from patients who 
perform ET will also be summarized by  reason for discontinuation using descriptive statistics.
9.5.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Patientdemographic and baseline characteristics, including MS history, me dical history , prior 
medications, ECG findings, and baseline MRI will be examined to assess the comparability  of 
the treatment groups and will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, s tandard deviation, standard error, median, 
minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patientcounts and 
percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary .
Treatment groups will be compared for all baseline variables, using an appropriate methodology . 
Further details will be specified in the SAP.
9.6. Efficacy Analysis 
Due to the decision from 01January2016to discontinue the l aquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, and a 
low study exposure at this time, the l aquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm will be presented descriptively  
only, and will not be included in any  inferential analy ses.
In addition, all efficacy  analyses will be performed based on the measurements recorded during 
the study treatment period, ie, data captur ed following an earl y termination visit as described in 
Section3.6.7will be excluded from the anal yses. The data captured after an earl y termination 
visit will be used for the sensitivity  analyses of the primar y and secondary  endpoints.
9.6.1. Primary Variable
The primary  variablefor this study  will be BAas defined b y the PBVC from baseline to 
week48.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
1039.6.2. Secondary Variables
1.Time to CDP.
Time to CDP will be defined as increase in EDSS of 1 point from baseline EDSS, if EDSS at 
entry is ≤5.0 or increase of 0.5 point, if EDSS at entry  is 5.5. This increase should be 
confirmed after at least12weeks. Progression cannot be confirmed during a relapse.
To calculate the time of CDP, the following algorithm will be used:
Let Etbe an EDSS measurement of the patient under consideration observed at time (measured 
by weeksfrom the patient’s baselinedate). 
Let E0be the baseline EDSS measurement for that patient . 
Lets = t+12.
The time to CDP for the patientunder considerati on is defined as t if all the following conditions 
hold:
1.If 5 00Ethen let 1. Otherwise, let 5 . 0.
2. 0E Et .
3.For anyt < q1< s, if the patient’s EDSS was evaluated at time q1, thenEq1≥ E0+ ∆
4.Eq2≥ E0+ ∆ for some q2≥ s, and at time q2, the patient was not experiencing a relapse.
5.tis the earliest time point during the stud y in which conditions 2 -4 hold.
If no such t exists, then the time to confirmed progression will be right censor ed by the patient’s 
last EDSS evaluation date from Part A of the study . In case time t exists without fulfilling 
conditions 3 and 4 because time q2is after the patient completed Part A of the study  (or 
performed ET), and therefore cannot be seen, then theright censored will be on time t and not in 
the last EDSS evaluation.
If a patientdied due to MS disease progression, then this patientwill be analy zed as having CDP 
and the time to CDP will be calculated using the onset date of progression.
If a patientdied due to MS before having progression, then the time to disability  progression will 
be censored using the date of death.
2.Time to CDP event defined by reaching at least 1 of the following 2types of event for 
each individual:
An increase from baseline in EDSS score ( ≥1 point from baseline EDSS, if EDSS at 
entry is ≤5.0 or increase of ≥0.5 point, if EDSS at entry  is ≥5.5), confirmed after at 
least12weeks, or
An increase of at least 20% from baseline in the T25FW score, confirmed after at 
least12weeks
Similar algori thm to that described for CDP as measured b y EDSS confirmed after at least
12weekswill be used for definition and censoring rules of this variable.
3.Change from baseline to week48in the T25FW score.

unless otherwise noted .Summaries will be presented by  treatment group. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
1059.6.4.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  efficacy variablefor this study is BAas measured b y the PBVC from baseline to 
week48. This endpoint will be anal yzed using the mITT 1 population with at least 
1post-baseline PBVC value and will include assessments taken up to/including earl y 
termination/study  completion visit (data recorded fol lowing an earl y termination visit will be 
excluded from this analysis). BA will be analy zed using baseline -adjusted repeated measures 
analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA -SAS®PROC MIXED) in which 1 contrast will be 
constructed in order to compare between laqui nimod 0.6 mg and placebo. 
The model will be comprised from the treatment group as a class variable ( 2levels). In addition 
to the treatment group, week (categorical), treatment by  week interaction, normalized brain 
volume at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline ,and Country /Geographical 
Region (CGR) will be used as covariates. Additionally , week (categorical) will be specified as a 
repeated effect and unstructured (UN) correlation matrix will be used to model intra -subject 
correlatio n. In case a convergence issue will arise using the UN correlation matrix, (1) AR1 or 
(2) Compound Sy mmetry (CS) will be used to enable model convergence (in this order).
Mean values of the PBVCfrom baseline to week s 24 and48 will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.
The assumption of a no treatment -by-covariate interaction will be evaluated by  a separate 
repeated measures ANCOVA model (SAS®PROC MIXED) with the items treatment, week 
(categorical), week b y treatment interaction, CGR, baseline, and treatment -by-baseline covariate 
interaction included in the model. If there is evidence of treatment- by-covariate interaction 
(p≤0.10), further exploration of this interaction will be done graphically /descriptively  and the 
treatment p -values will still be reported from the main effects model ( repeated measures 
ANCOVA from above). 
The consistency  of treatment effects among different CGR will be evaluated by  a separate 
repeated measures ANCOVA model (SAS®PROC MIXED) with treatment, week (categorical), 
week by treatment interaction , CGR, and treatment -by-CGR interaction in themodel. If there is 
evidence of a treatment- by-CGR interaction (p ≤0.10), a descriptive summary  of treatment 
differences for each CGRwill be used to identify the Country  (or Countries) f or which the 
treatment effects are consistent with the remaining countries. This will be an exploratory  analysis 
and the treatment p -values will still be reported from the main effects model ( repeated measures 
ANCOVA from above).
9.6.4.2. Sensitivity Analys es
The robustness of the primary  analysis results will be explored by  applying it, as described in the 
previous section, to the PP population as well. In addition the, following sensitivity  analysis will 
be performed:
Repeat the primary  analysis without introducti on of covariates except for the 
treatment group , week,and treatment by  week interaction .
Repeat the primary  analysis when introducing additional baseline covariates variables 
that differ appreciably  between the treatment groups, if any . The list of baseli ne 
measurements will be provided in the SAP.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
106Repeat the primary  analysis while including observations that were recorded 
following an earl y termination visit.
9.6.4.3. Secondary Efficacy Analysis
a.Time to CDP as measured by  EDSS confirmed after at least12 weeks wil l be 
analyzed using the ITT population and datafrom all the study  assessments up 
to/including earl y termination/study  completion visit (data recorded following an 
early termination visit will be excluded from this analysis) . This analy sis will be 
performed using a baseline adjusted Cox ’s proportional hazards regression model 
(SAS®PROC PHREG) in which 1contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto 
placebo will be constructed. In addition to treatment group, categorical EDSS at 
baseline(≤4.5 or >4.5) , age at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at 
baseline,and CGR will be used as covariates.
The adequacy  of the proportional hazards assumption will be confirmed by  including 
1time-dependent covariate of dose (as dumm y variable) by log (time) interactions in 
the analysis model and testing each of them at the 5% level. In case the proportional 
hazards assumption will be rejected, the log rank test (SAS®PROC LIFTEST) will be 
used for statistical inference.
b.Time to CDP , confirmed a fter at least 12 weeksas measured b y EDSSorT25FW will 
be analyzed usingtheITT population and datafrom all the study  assessments up 
to/including earl y termination/study  completion visit (data recorded following an 
early termination visit will be exclu ded from this analy sis).This analy sis will be 
performed using baseline adjusted Cox ’s proportional hazards regression model 
(SAS®PROC PHREG) in which 1contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto 
placebo will be constructed. In addition to treatment grou p, categorical EDSS at 
baseline(≤4.5 or >4.5) , age at baseline, T25FW at baseline, natural logarithm of T2 
lesion volume at baseline ,and CGR will be used as covariates. 
The adequacy  of the proportional hazards assumption will be confirmed by  including 
1time-dependent covariate of do se (as dumm y variables) b y log (time) interactions in 
the analysis model and testing each of them at the5% level. Ifthe proportional 
hazards assumption will be rejected, the log rank test (SAS®PROC LIFTEST) will be 
used for statistical inference.
c.Changefrom baseline in the T25FW score at week 48 will be anal yzed on the mI TT2 
population and will include assessments taken up to/including early  termination/study  
completion visit (data recorded following an earl y termination visit will be excluded 
from this analysis). Since this variable might not follow normal distribution, the 
ranked values of this measurement will be defined and anal yzed using baseline 
adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA (SAS®PROC MI XED) in which 1contrast 
will be constructed in order to compare between laquinimod 0.6 mg and placebo. In 
addition to treatment group, T25FW score at baseline and CGR will be used as 
covariates. Due to the fact that the ANCOVA model will use ranked values and not 
the actual changes in the T25FW, Hodges -Lehmann estimates will be used in order to 
present the magnitude of the treatment effect and the corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
107d.The number of new brain T2 lesions at week48will be anal yzed using the mI TT1
population with at least 1 post- baseline T2 scan available if it was performed at least 
36weeks under treatment and will include assessments taken up to/including earl y 
termination/study  completion visit (data recorded following an earl y termination visit 
will be excluded from this analysis).. This ana lysis will be performed using baseline 
adjusted negative binomial regression model (SAS®PROC GENMOD) in which 1 
contrast for comparing laquinimod 0.6mgto placebo will be constructed. In addition 
to the treatment group, the natural logarithm of T2 lesion volume at baseline ,age at 
baseline, and CGR will be used as covariates.
All the secondary  analyses mentioned in this section will be repeated while including 
observations that were recorded following an early termination visit.
9.6.4.4. Exploratory Efficacy Analy sis
Detailed methodology  for analyses of exploratory  efficacy and other variables will be specified 
in the SAP signed and approved before treatment unblinding.
9.7. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
All statistical tests will be performed at 5% nominal sign ificance level to further define the 
effects estimates of laquinimod but not for strict statistical inferences. Therefore, no adjustments 
will be made for the preplanned multiple comparisons.
9.8. Safety Variables and Analysis
9.8.1. Safety Variables
All safety analysis will be performed for STpopulation. Summaries will be presented by  
treatment group and for all patientsunless otherwise noted. 
The overall safet y and tolerability of laquinimod treatment will be assessed throughout the stud y 
by evaluating adverse events and the following additional safety  variables:
clinical laboratory  tests
vital signs
12-lead ECG
concomitant medications use through out the study
9.8.2. Safety Analysis
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only  once in each preferred term or sy stem organ class 
(SOC) category  for the analy ses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events 
(overall and b y severity), adverse events determined by  the investigat or to be related to study  
treatment (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4) (defined as related or with missing 
relationship) (overall and by  severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing ET. 
Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be 
presented.

108Changes in laboratory  and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptivel y. All 
values will be compared with prespecified boundarie s to identify  potentially  clinically  significant 
changes or values, and such values will be listed. Additionally , descriptive summaries of 
potentially  clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory  or vital signs) will be 
provided.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by  preferred term and therapeutic class 
using descriptive statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while 
patientparticipated in the study .
For continuous variables, descriptive stati stics (n, mean, standard deviation, standard error, 
median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline 
to each time point. For categorical variables, patientcounts and percentages will be provided. 
If any patientdies during the study , a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patientnarrative included in the clinical study  report. 
9.9. Pharmacok inetic Analysis
A single blood sample will be collected from all patientsatweeks4, 8, 12, 24and 48. 
Unscheduled pharmacokinetic blood samples may  be collected at the discretion of the 
investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigations of cardiovascular 
eventsor other clinical event of interest . The samples should be collected as soon as possible in 
association with the event.
Pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated using a PPK approach .The PPK model may  
also include an y unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples collected to assist with furthe r 
investigations of cardiovascular events or other clinical event of interest (see Section 8.1).The 
effect of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated. Possible covariates 
will include d emographic variables (eg ,age, gender, body  weight and ethnicity ), clinical 
variables, concomitant medications, blood and urine chemistry  variables and markers of renal 
function (creatinine clearance and serum creatinine).
The date and time of the blood sa mple, as well as the date and time of the last study  drug dose 
prior to the sample will be recorded on the CRF.
9.10. Planned Interim Analysis
No interim anal ysis is planned for this study . 
9.11. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described 
in protocol amendments, the complete statistical plan, the clinical study  report, or an y 
combination of these, as appropriate.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
10910. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DA TA/DOCUMENTS 
The medical ex perts, study  monitors, auditors, IEC/I RB, and health authority  inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation (eg, medical charts/records, 
laboratory  test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verificati on, provided that patient
confidentiality  is maintained in accordance with local requirements.
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a 
at all times. Examples of source documents are hospital records , office visit records, examining 
physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory  reports, drug 
inventory , study drug label records, protocol required worksheets, and CRFs that are used as the 
source (see Section 3.9).
The investigator will maintain a confidential patientidentification list that allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient. All study -related documents must be kept until 
notification by  the sponsor.

11011. QUALITY  CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by  the IEC/IRB, except when necessary  to 
address immediate safet y concerns to the patients or when the change involves only  logistics or 
administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 
11.1.2. Protocol Deviations
Any significant deviation from the protocol will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol 
violations includenonadherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to 
protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP 
guidelines; noncompliance to study  drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any  
other deviations that may have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safet y of 
the patient s. Protocol violations will be identified a nd recorded b y investigational center
personnel on the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as 
required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patientfrom the stud y or permit the patientto continue in the study , with document ationfrom the 
medical representative. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety  of the patientand 
preserving the integrity  of the study . 
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion crite ria of the protocol are not prospectively  granted by  
the sponsor . If investigational center personnel learn that a patientwho did not meet protocol 
eligibility  criteria was entered into a study , they must immediately  inform the sponsor of the 
protocol vio lation. If such patienthas alread y completed the study or has withdrawn early, no 
action will be taken but the violation will be recorded.
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all staff m embers 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patientmanagement, both before starting the stud y and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new staff become involved). The investigator must 
assure that all stud y staff members are qualified b y education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the 
investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities. This list must b e updated throughout the study , as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  staff, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply with the protocol. Additional information will be 
made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study  and as otherwise 
agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.

11111.3. Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patient s have signed the informed consent form and the study  is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedure s (SOPs), the protocol, and other written 
instructions and regulatory guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and each investigator. The 
main responsibilities of the study  monitors are to visit each investigator before, during, and after 
the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely recorded 
and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals.
The study  monitors will contact each investigator and visit the investigational center at regular 
intervals throughout the study . The stud y monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, to include specific electronic 
source documentation [seeSection 3.9]) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being recorded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study , the study  monitor will in dicate verification by 
electronically  applying source document verification (SDV) flags to the CRF and will ensure that 
all required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingl y.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center . Each investigator and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the fin dings detected in the course of these monitoring 
visits and/or provided in follow- up written communication.
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinical device supplies used in a 
clinical research stud y sponsored b y Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not 
limited to the following: 
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change, f laking, crumbling, etc.)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside)
incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both
device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
112Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by  Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed f rom the Investigational Center
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available:
investigational center number and principal investigator name
name, phone number, and add ress of the source of the complaint 
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
product name and strength for open -label studies
patient number, bottle, and kit number s(if applicable) for double -blind or open -label 
studies
product available for return Yes/No
product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No
description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event Yes/No
clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Y es/No
date and name of person receiving the complaint 
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delay ed because not all the required information can be 
immediately  obtained. Known information must be immediately  reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with t he investigator to obtain an y outstanding information.
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study  supplies. The s ponsor may  request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the stud y drug.
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of the study  drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A seri ous adverse event or the potential for a product quality

113problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complai nt
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed.
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as an y actions taken to resol ve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, an 
eventclosure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to 
all investigational centers using the product.
11.5. Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance department , independent of t he Global Clinical Development department, is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
Each investigator must accept that regulatory  authorities and sponsor represe ntatives may  
conduct inspections to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.

11412. ETHICS 
12.1. Informed Consent
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by  the investigator, should fully  inform the 
patientof all pertinent aspects of the stud y, including the written information approved b y the 
IEC/IRB. Written informed consent will be obtained from each patientbefore any  study specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, a ccording to the IEC/I RB requirements. 
Overall, this study  includes: (I) an informed consent for the clinical study  (main study),(II) 
informed consent forms for theancillary studies (CSF and OCT ), and (III) informed consent 
forms for dumm y run scans (MRI  and OCT) required prior to initiation of the study  and ancillary  
study respectivel y.
The patient’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing in a consent 
form, which will be signed and personally  dated by the patient. The invest igator will keep the 
original consent forms, and copies will be given to the patients. It will also be explained to the 
patients that they  are free to refuse entry  into the study  and free to withdraw from the study  at 
any time without prejudice to future t reatment.
Written and/or oral information about the study  in a language understood by  the patientwill be 
given to all patient s.
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards 
Before this study  starts, the protocol will b e submitted to the national/local health authorities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center 
before the IEC/I RB and health authority  (where applicable) for the center give written approval 
or a favorable opinion.
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients 
The investigator must assure that the privacy  of the patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. I n CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by  their names, but by  an 
identification code (eg, initials and identification number).
Personal medical information may  be reviewed for the purpose of patientsafety and/or verifying 
data in the source and transcribed onto the CRF. This review may  be conducted by  the study  
monitor, properly  authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality  assurance unit, and/or 
regulatory  authorities. Personal medical information will alway s be treated as confidential.
12.4. Declaration of the End of the Clinical Study 
For clinical investigational centers located in the EU, a declaration of the end of the clinical 
study will be made according to the procedures outlined in Directive 2001/20/ED, Article 10(c); 
for other countries, local regulations will be followed.

11613. DATA HANDLING , DATA QUALITY  ASSURANCE, AND 
RECORD KEEPING  
13.1. Data Collection 
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21 CFR part 11. Before being used to capture data from this 
study, the CDMS will be fully  validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory , and 
logistical requirements of the study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on 
the system and any  study-specific training. After they  are trained, users will be provided with 
individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be complet ed for each patientscreened according to the data source. 
Patientidentity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be 
verified using the data source b y the stud y monitor, and reviewed for consistency b y Data 
Management usingboth automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected will be 
approved b y the investigator at the investigational center . This approval acknowledges the 
investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate. 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory , bioanalytical laboratory , central 
image center), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they  will be retained 
but not entered into the CRF. These resultsmay also be sent electronicall y to the sponsor (or 
organization performing data management) for direct entry  into the clinical database (see 
Section3.9). Laboratory  test results will not be entered into the CRF unless otherwise noted in 
the protocol.
For patients who enter a study  but do not meet screening criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF. 
13.2. Data Quality Assurance 
Data Management i s responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality  assurance, will 
comply with international regulatory  guidelines (eg, ICH GCP ). Data management and control 
processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken regarding data 
management and data quality  assurance, will be described in a data management plan.
CRFs received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the pr esence 
of mandatory  values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for 
this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality  and accuracy . Any 
necessary  changes will be made in the clinical database, and data rev iew and validation 
procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the 
information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
117Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. For each instance 
of data modifications, the system requires a reason for thechange and keeps a complete audit 
trail of the data values, dates and times of modifications, and authorized electronic approvals of 
the changes.
At the conclusion of the study ,the CDMS and all other study  data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed as accurate.
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents 
13.3.1. Investigator Responsibilities 
All records related to the study  (ie, source data, source documents, CRFs [see Section 3.9], data 
results from other sources [see Section 13.1], copies of protocols and protocol amendments, drug 
accountability  forms, correspondence, patient identification lists, signed informed consent forms, 
and other essential documents) must be retained until the sponsor notifies the institution, in 
writing, that records may be destroy ed. 
If the sponsor has not provided written notification of records destruction after 1 0years from 
study completion (or earlier in the event of an institution closing), and the institution determines 
the study record retention is unduly  burdensome, the institution may  submit a written request to 
the sponsor at least 60 days before the planned disposition of the study  records. No study  
document or image (eg, scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) should be destro yed without prior 
written agreement b etween the sponsor and each investigator. Should aninvestigator wish to 
assign the stud y records to another party or move them to another location, advance written 
notice will be given to the sponsor.
13.3.2. Sponsor Responsibilities 
The sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality  control (QC) of the data. Data 
management and filing will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies.
If data management and filing of documents for this study  aredelegated to a contract 
organization, these functions will be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at 
that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by  the sponsor before the start of data 
management and filing activities. The original CRFs will be archived b y thesponsor. 
Center-specific CRFs will be provided to the respective investi gational centers for archiving.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO )
12317. SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PROTOCOL
17.1. Amendment 02 Dated 01February 2016
The primary  reason for this global amendment was to discontinue treatment for patients 
receiving 1.5 mglaquinimod, and to implement additional safety  measures to help ensure the 
safety of subjects (both ongoing subjects and those still to be enrolled ) receiving 0.6 mg 
laquinimod. To avoid increased exposure to laquinimod at the 0.6 mg dose, stopping rules have 
been introduced for renal impairment and hepatic impairment, with additional assessments of 
GFR introduced for increased monitoring of renal fu nction.
Table5and Table6(Study Procedures and Assessments) have been revised to reflect changes 
described below. An additional study schema(Figure2)has been included to reflect the 
amended stud y design.
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol (and protocol s ynopsis, as 
appropriate) . A determination of which changes are considered to be substantial will be 
dependent on the region, and will be indicated in the covering letter or application form that 
accompanies the amendment in that region.
Where appropriate, the informed consent form will be amended to reflect the changes introduced 
into the protocol.

(DMC) for the CONCERTO and ARPEGGIO studies held an 
unscheduled meeting to review cardiovascular events. The DMC 
found an imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in the high 
dose treatment arms (1.2 mg in CONCERTO, 1.5 mg in 
ARPEGGIO): in CONCERTO there were 6 such cases in the 1.2 
mg arm but none in the0.6 mg or placebo arms, along with a 
myocardial infarction in the ARPEGGIO 1.5 mg dose group and a 
cerebral infarction in a 31 year old patient in the 1.2 mg arm of 
CONCERTO. Due to these events and the DMC recommendation 
to stop all laquinimod treatment arms above 0.6 mg in the MS 
trials, the 1.5 mg treatment arm in the ARPEGGIO study was 
discontinued as of 01 January 2016. The risk/benefit balance of 
this dose was considered negative at that point.
The DMC did not identify an yovert cardiovascular risk i n the 0.6 
mg treatment arm, but felt that long term monitoring for 
emergence of any signal is necessary. Therefore, the 0.6 mg 
treatment arm will be continued w hile the sponsor closely Text added to reflect

Additional me asures implemented in this protocol amendment 
include an emphasis on disallowed medications and stopping rules 
for organ impairment (ie, factors which may increase laquinimod 
exposure), as well as regular evaluation and management of major 
modifiable cardi ovascular risk factors.
1.3.1.3.Toxicology
Safety pharmacology studies in the rat and dog did not demonstrate 
significant effects of laquinimod on the function of cardi ovascular, 
respiratory, central nervous, renal and gastrointestinal systems 
providing safety margins in the range of 32 -to 257-fold above the 
originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/day based on maximal 
plasma concentrations.Safety pharmacology studi es in the rat and dog did not 
demonstrate significant effects of laquinimod on the function of 
cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous, renal and 
gastrointestinal systems providing safety margins in the range of 
32-to 257-fold above the originally in tended clinical dose of 1.5 
mg/day based on maximal plasma concentrations.Reflecting that 1.5 mg is 
no longer an intended 
clinical dose (changed

It is the sponsor's position that t This finding is likely due to a 
decrease in the incidence of prolactin secreting pituitary adenomas 
that was observed in this study . In contrast to rodents, in humans 
prolactin is not a luteinizing hormone and does not affect the 
estrogen:progesterone ratio; therefore the mechanism proposed by 
the sponsor is not considered relevant to humans . A higher 
incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas was observed in high 
dose male rats. This lesion is considered to be related to 
laquinimod’s induction of liver enzymes and consequently 
enhanced cle arance of thyroid hormones in rats, a 
well-characterized rat -specific mechanism proposed by the sponsor, 
that is not considered relevant to humans. In addition, a smallan
increase in the incidence of oral cavity squamous cell 
carcinomas tumorswas noted in mid and high dose female rats (2/60 
in each group). The oral effects may relate to the AhR activation 
properties of laquinimod since similar lesions were seen following 
lifelong exposure of rats to other AhR activators. How ever, the 
incidence of oral cavit y tumors in rats treated with laquinimod w as 
lower than that seen with industrial chemicals such as 2,3,7,8 -
tetrachloro -p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD) (NTP TR -521) and dioxin -like 
compounds (DLCs), and was more similar to the incidence seen 
with the dietary ingred ient indole -3-carbinol (I3C) found in 
cruciferous vegetables. Of note, the oral tumors seen with I3C were 
considered by the US National Toxicology Program as irrelevant It is the sponsor's position that this finding is likely due to a

for I3C risk assessment (NTP TR -584). No increased incidence of 
oral tumors was seen in humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a 
species specific response in rats. Therefore, oral cavity tumors 
induced by laquinimod in rats after a lifelong exposure do not imply 
an elevated carcinogenicity risk in humans. Humans, in general, 
also seem to be less sensitive to AhR activation by laquinimod than 
rats, as shown by the differential gene expression profiles discussed 
in the IBwith other AhR activators, including industrial chemicals 
(such as 2,3,7,8tetrachloro pdibenzodioxin [ TCDD]and 
dioxinlike compounds [DLCs]) and the dietary ingredient indole 3
carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous vegetables . However, the 
incidence of oral cavity tumors in rats treated with laquinimod w as 
lower than that seen with TCDD and DLCs, and w as more similar 
to the inciden ce seen with I3C. Importantly, the oral cavity tumors 
seen with TCDD in rats did not translate into increased incidence of 
oral tumors in exposed humans, indicating a species difference in 
this response between rats and humans. It should be noted that 
several lines of evidence suggest that the oral lesions seen in rats 
are mediated by direct contact of the rat oral mucosa with high 
concentrations of laquinimod in the dosing solution during the 
gavage procedure. An effect on the oral mucosa in rats is not 
considered relevant to humans, who take laquinimod as a capsule 
that dissolves in the stomach . Based on sponsor’s calculations, in 
the human stomach, the local concentration of laquinimod is 
expected to be low , and the type of epithelium exposed is not 
considered sensitive to the effects of laquinimod, w ith safety 
margins greater than 13 (dogs), 20 (rats) and 1000 (mice) for 
exposure in the stomach .for I3C risk assessment (NTP TR -584). No increased incidence of 
oral tumors was seen in humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a 
species specific response in rats . Therefore, oral cavity tumors 
induced by laquinimod in rats after a lifelong exposure do not 
imply an elevated carcinogenicity risk in humans. Humans, in 
general, also seem to be less sensitive to AhR activation by 
laquinimod than rats, as shown by the d ifferential gene expression 
profiles discussed in the IB.

Laquinimod pharmacokinetics are affected by moderate and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.5-and 3.1-fold increase in laquinimod 
systemic exposure, respectively ) andstrong CYP3A4 inducers and 
moderate hepatic impairment . At doses of 0.6 and 1.2 mg, 
laquinimod is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a strong inducer of 
CYP1A2; therefore, laquinimod may affect the systemic exposure 
of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. For 
additional information on concomitant use of laquinimod with 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 substrates, please refer to the IB.
Studies in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
resulted in an increase of laquinimo d exposure by approximately 
1.3-and 2.3-fold, respectively. In subjects with moderate renal 
impairment laquinimo d exposure w as increased by 1.4 -fold. A 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was further used to 
predict the effect of hepatic impairment and renal impairment on 
the pharmacokinetics of laquinimod after a single and multiple 
doses of 0.6 to 1.5 mg in comparison to healthy subjects (Study 
DP-2015-017). The model predictions indicated that mild hepatic 
impairment and moderate renal impairment would result in further 
modest increases in exposure to laquinimod following multiple 0.6 
mg dose administration based on unbound drug concentration 
(1.71-fold and 1.65 -foldrespectively). More significant increases in 
laquinimod exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug 
fraction, are predicted in patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment (3.41-and 6.51-fold respectively) and severe renal 
impairment (1.86-fold). The model predictions indicated similar 
increases in systemic laquinimod exposure w ith a given stage of 
organ impairment across the 0.6 to 1.5 mg dose range following 
singleor multiple dose administration, demonstrating that the dose

1.4.1.1.7. Cardiovascular Events (on Dos es Above Laquinimod 0.6 m g)
(new section) On 30 December 2015, a DMC review of 8 unblinded cases from 
the ARPEGGIO and CONCERTO studies found an imbalance in 
serious cardiovascular events in the high dose treatment arms in 
the study: 6 cases of myocardial infarction in the CONCERTO 1.2 
mg treatment arm, compared to no events in the 0.6 mg or placebo 
treatment arms, along with a cerebral infarction in a 31 year old 
man on the 1.2 mg treatment arm. In the ARPEGGIO study, 1 
myocardial infarction event was ide ntified in the laquinimod 1.5 
mg treatment arm. The decisions were largely based on data from 
15 November 2015 when total exposure in CONCERTO w as 
3070 patient -years in 2199 individuals and total exposure in 
ARPEGGIO w as 35 patient -years in 191 individuals .
Due to these events, the DMC recommended stopping all 
laquinimod treatment arms above 0.6 mg in the laquinimod MS 
trials. The DMC did not identify an yovert cardiovascular risk in 
the 0.6 mg treatment arm, but felt that long term monitoring for 
emergenceof any signal was necessary. The DMC also 
recommend that study subjects continuing on laquinimod 0.6 mg 
be reconsented with information about the cardiovascular risk 
seen in higher doses.
Currently the mechanism of the cardiovascular events remains 
unknown. Although no specific time -to-event patterns have been 
identified, cardiovascular risk factors and demographics may play 
a role. Different pre- existing risk factors were noted, including 
hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or smoking history. While all Text added to reflect

1.4.1.2.3. Cardiotoxicity and Systemic Inflammation
In clinical studies performed with laquinimod’s predecessor 
molecule, roquinimex, pericarditis/pleur itis and ischemic heart 
disorders w ere identified as important safety concerns. Roquinimex 
demonstrated clinical efficacy in MS in Phase 2 studies. However,
serious toxicities (including myocardial infarction, pericarditis and 
pleuritis) that occurred duri ng Phase 3 trials led to discontinuation 
of these trials. Roquinimex demonstrated serious toxicities 
including increased rates of myocardial infarction, pericarditis and 
pleuritis that were observed in three Phase 3, placebo -controlled 
studies in MS patien ts. The mechanism by which roquinimex 
caused these events was not identified, but they were considered to 
be possible manifestations of a systemic inflammatory response, an 
assessment which was also supported by roquinimex nonclinical 
findings. A thorough analysis was done on the laquinimod safety 
data (which is mostly reflective of the 0.6 mg/day dose) to evaluate 
these similar potential safety issues. Based on 2347 patients 
exposed to laquinimod 0.6 mg for over 10,000 patient-years. as w ell 
as the patient s exposed to 0.6 mg in the CONCERTO and 
ARPEGGIO study, analyses This analysis showed that none of these 
safety issues do not constitute a clear signalof concern for 
laquinimod in doses up to 0.6 mg/day. However, at doses of 1.2 and

infarction .In clinical studies performed with laquinimod’s predecessor

all laquinimod treatment arms above 0.6 mg in the MS trials, the 
1.5 mg treatment arm was discontinued as of 01 Janu ary 2016.
The risk/benefit balance of this dose w as considered negative at 
that point.
The DMC did not identify an yovert cardiovascular risk in the 0.6 
mg treatment arm, but felt that long term monitoring for 
emergence of any signal was necessary. As of 2 9 September 2015, 
2347 patients had been exposed to laquinimod 0.6 mg for 10,417 
patient-years. It is estimated that the rate for myocardial infarction 
and cardiovascular death for patients treated w ith laquinimod 0.6 
mg is about 0.16 per 100 person years which is within range of the 
expected cardiovascular event incidence in the underlying 
population. Therefore, while no increased risk was seen with 
laquinimod 0.6 mg, because of the findings with higher doses, 
there is a potential risk that some individual s may be at increased 
risk of cardiovascular events while taking laquinimod 0.6 mg. 
Appropriate risk mitigation procedures have been implemented 
via a protocol amendment to restrict excess drug exposure due to 
disallowed medications or organ impairment, as well as to assure 
evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk factors.cardiovascular findings at

13917.2. Amendment 01 Dated 01July2015
The primary  reasonsfor this global amendment were to introduce an additional secondary  
efficacy endpoint (c hange from baseline to week 48 in the T25FW score) and an additional 
exploratory  efficacy measure (mRS) .The T25FWendpoint was added due to its established role 
in quantify ing clinicall y meaningful benefit in MS, and due to the beneficial effects seen on this 
measure in previous RRMS trials of laquinimod.
Other important changes include:
Omission of the interim analy sis (this was intended to provide actionable information 
with respect to an ongoing p lanned Phase 3 trial; however, the rationale no longer 
applies, since that trial will not be initiated in parallel with ARPEGGI O).
Omission of baseline CSF sampling (omitted in order to maximize participation in the 
week48 sampling, which is more important scientifically ; the decision was taken 
based feedback from an expert who noted that previous trials were not successful in 
consistently  collecting 2 CSF samples, whereas the y ield was better with a single CSF 
collection).
Creation of 2 separate mITT popu lations: mI TT1 and mI TT2 (mITT1 introduced 
specificall y for the primary endpoint; mI
TT2 is what was previousl y defined as the 
mITT population).
Table5and Table6(Study Procedures and Assessments) have been revised to reflect changes 
described below.
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol (and protocol s ynopsis, as 
appropriate) . A determination of which changes are considered to be substantial will be 
dependent on the region, and will be indicated in the covering letter or application form that 
accompanies the amendment in that region.
Where appropriate, the informed consent form will be amended to reflect the changes introduced 
into the protocol.

151APPENDIX A.RELAPSE DEFINITION
Relapse (attack)
A relapse will be defined as the appearance of 1 or more new neurologic al abnormalities or 
reappearance or worsening of 1 or more previously observed neurological abnormalities. This 
change in clinical state must last at least 48 hours and be immediatel y preceded b y an improving 
neurological state of at least thirty  (30) daysfrom onset of previous relapse.
This criterion is different from the clinical definition of relapse: “at least 24 hours duration of 
symptoms.” Since "in study" relapse definition must be supported by an objective neurological 
evaluation (see next paragraph), a neurological deficit must be sustained long enough to 
eliminate pseudo -relapses.
An event is counted as a relapse onl y when the patient’s symptoms are accompanied by  observed 
objective neurological changes . A change in bowel/bladder function or in co gnitive function 
must not be entirely  responsible for the changes .
The patientmust not be undergoing an y acute metabolic changes such as fever or other medical 
abnormality .
Relapse Evaluation Procedures
Patients will be instructed to telephone their stud ysite within 48hours should any  symptoms 
suggestive of a relapse appear.
The Treating Neurologist will evaluate the patientonce any symptom suggestive of a relapse 
occurs.
In case of a suggestive relapse during a scheduled or unscheduled visit, the Treating Neurologist
will refer the patient to the Examining Neurologist.
The Examining Neurologist will evaluate the patient within 7days of symptoms onset, 
conditional upon a sy mptomatic period of ≥48hours.
PatientEvaluation by  the Examining Neurologist
EDSS and FSS will be administered .
Clinical Relapse Determination by  the Treating Neurologist
The determination whether objective neurological change s are present consistent with a relapse 
will be made b y the Treating Neurologist , without reference to the ED SS and FSS administered 
by the Examining Neurologist .
Follow-up visits to monitor the course of the relapse will be made at the Treating Neurologist’s
discretion .
Protocol-Defined Relapse
In addition to the criteria used by  the Treating Neurologist to determine that a clinical relapse has 
occurred, a per -protocol relapse definition will make use of EDSS data to confirm that the 
objective neurological changes include at least 1 of the following:
an increase of at least 0.5 in the EDSS score as compared to pr evious evaluation
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
152an increase of 1 grade in the score of 2 or more of the 7 functions from the FSSas 
compared to previous evaluation
an increase of 2 grades in the score of 1 function from the FSSas compared to the

153APPENDIX B.GUIDANCE ON SAFETY MONITORING
1.Guidance on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests
Liver enzy mes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP), as well as direct and total bilirubin will be measured at 
each stud y visit. 
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding of ≥2×ULN(including patients whose 
baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2×and ≤3×the ULN, who may  be enrolled in the study ), a 
thorough medical history and phy sical examination with a focus on liver disease should be 
undertakena. In addition, the patientshould be instructed to refrain from alcoholic beverages. 
In case of s ymptoms compatible with drug -induced liver injury , the patient should be invited for 
an unscheduled visit to measure liver enzy mes as soon as possible.
Solitary elevations of total bilirubin, not a ccompanied by  elevations of ALT or AST should be 
managed according to the discretion of the Treating Neurologist .
1.1. Elevation of Either ALT or AST to ≥3 x ULN :
Confirmation of the abnormality  (in case the abnormality  is of ALT or AST ≥8×ULN, no 
confirmation is required prior to study  drug discontinuation, but the assessments below should be 
performed):
The day in which 
the abnormal value is received from the laboratory  will be 
considered as Day 0.
The Investigator should repeat the test before Day 2, for confirmation purposes (this 
may be performed in a local laboratory  along with CBC and differential to assess for 
eosinophilia. I n general, in case a blood sample is sent to a local laboratory , the 
following assessments [and reference ranges] are mandatory : ALT [serum glutamic 
pyruvic transaminase; SGPT], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; 
SGOT], AL P, total bili rubin, CBC [with differential for eosinophil count, separate 
tube], and I NR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confirmatory  test]). The investigator 
should also question the patientregarding s ymptoms.
The abnormalit y will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios:
1. In case baseline value was within normal range and AL T or AST is still ≥3×ULN
2. In case baseline value was above ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2×the baseline value.
Upon confirmation of the abnormality  as noted above, the following additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF.
                                                
aThorough medical history with a focus on liver disease: Personal or family history of li ver disease; personal 
history of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcohol, medications (prescription or 
OTC), herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets or environmental chemical agents; 
potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developing countries, history of potential exposure to blood or 
blood products, high -risk sexual relations) and any additional information deemed relevant by the investigator.

Serology for Hepatitis A (antibody , immunoglobulin M and G) , B(core antibody  
total, core immunoglobulin M, and surface antigen) , and C viruses (central 
laboratory ). 
Serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti -nuclear antibodies (titer), Anti Smooth 
Muscle Antibodies (ASMA), anti -Liver Kidney  Microsomal (LKM) antibodies 
(central laboratory ).Further testing may  be required in case of a positive result for 
Hepatitis B or C .
An ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract.
Other diagnostic tests/consultations, as deemed necessary  by the investigator ,eg,
serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography  
Observation and Follow -Up (to be performed after the abnormalit y was confirmed as above)
1.1.1.ALT or AST 
≥3×and≤5×ULN (ifbaseline value is ≥2.5×ULN, ALT or AST 
≥3.5×ULN and ≤5×ULN)
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3 ×ULN:
ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential (to assess for 
eosinophilia) and INR should be monitored on day s 5 (±2), 8 (±2), 14 (±2), and 28 
(±2). On at least 1 of these day s, the test should be performed centrally . (INR should 
be sent to a local laboratory  only.)
In cases where a local laboratory  is used, the resu lts should be recorded in the CRF, 
accompanied b y the reference range of the relevant measurements.
Should the abnormality  (ALT or AST ≥3×and ≤5×ULN [if baseline value is 
≥2.5×ULN, ALT or AST ≥3.5×UL N and ≤5×ULN]) persist further, the patientwill 
be followed according to the investigator's discretion, but at least once a month a 
blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, AL P, and total and direct bilirubin should be sent 
to the central laboratory .
1.1.2.ALT or AST ≥5 × but less than 8×ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3× ULN:
ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential count (to 
assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a week.

2. Use of Moderate/Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
Laquinimod pharmacokinetics are affected b y moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; 
therefore, moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed during stud y and 30 day s after the 
last dose ha s been administered. A partial list of commonly  used CYP3A4 inhibitors is presented 
inAppendix C.
3.Management of Patients who are Diagnosed with C ancer 
Patientswhoare diagnosed with a malignant solid or liquid tumorwhile participating in the 
study should stop study  medication .
4.Management of Pregnancy and Pregnancy Testing During the Study
Exposure to laquinimod during pregnancy  should be avoided.
To further emphasize the importance of use of acceptable contraception and avoidance of 
pregnancy  under laquinimod exposure (see Section1.4), and to reduce as much as possible the 
exposure to laquinimod if a pregnancy  occurs despite all recommended measures, all patients 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
156whoare women of child bearing potential will be instructed about the teratogenicity  and 
potential delay ed risks for a child exposed in uterus to laquinimod. These patients will also be 
counseled about the importance of using 2 acceptable methods of birth con trol throughout the 
entire treatment duration and until 30 day s after the last dose of treatment was administered and 
about the need to stop treatment immediately  if pregnancy  is suspected.
Women of child-bearing potential (for example women who are not po stmenopausal or 
surgically  sterilized) must practice an acceptable method of birth control for 30 day s before 
taking the stud y drug and 2 acceptable methods of birth control for the duration of the study  and 
until 30 day s after the last dose of study  medication. Acceptable methods of birth control 
include: intrauterine devices, barrier methods (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) and 
hormonal methods of birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long -acting 
injectable contraceptive).
The patients' understanding of the importance of preventive pregnancy  measures and their ability  
to follow the required instructions will be ascertained by  the investigator and recorded in source 
documents at every  visit. Any  female patient who becomes pregnant during the study  will 
discontinue her participation in the study  and will not perform the activities described for 
scheduled follow -up visits.
At each scheduled visit, female patients of childbearing potential will undergo a urine β- hCG 
test. In addition , a serum pregnancy  β-hCG test will be performed at each visit to the site. At 
baseline, serum β- hCG will be done within 7 day s prior to the initiation of treatment, such that 
the result is available p rior to the first dose.
1.In case the urine test is negative, study  drugs will be dispensed according to planned visit 
tasks (see Table5).
a.If the blood test is positive, the patient will be contacted immediatel y and instructed 
to stop taking the study  drug. The patient should be invited to attend an early  
termination visit.
b. If the blood test is negative – study procedures will be undertaken as planned.
2.In case the urine test is positive – the study drug will not be dispensed (if this occurs at 
Baseline visit, the patientwill not be eligible to participate in the study  and will be 
considered as a screening failure)
a.If the blood test is positive, the patient will be invited to the site for an earl y 
termination visit
b. If the blood test is negative, the patient will be contac ted and informed about the test 
result and the study  drugs will be dispensed as soon as possible.
3.Starting from visit 3 ( week 12), the following actions will be taken:
a.The patient will be provided with home pregnancy  urine β-hCG test kits and will be 
guided how to perform the test.
b.The patient will be instructed to perform the test in monthly  intervals (every  28 (±2) 
days) from the visit date. These dates should be recorded by  the study coordinator and 
a telephone call, will be scheduled to be performed within 72 hours of the urine test 
date.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
157c.A mandatory  phone call will be performed b y the Treating Neurologist or by the 
site’s nurse/ study  coordinator every  month in order to verify  whether the test has 
been performed and to record the result of the test in the patient’s file. In case of a 
suspected pregnancy , the patient will be instructed to stop taking the study  drug and 
arrive to the site as soon as possible for an unscheduled visi t, with the remaining 
study medications. In the site, a quantitative urine β -hCG pregnancy  test should be 
performed and the rest of the activities will be as in 2.
In case of an established diagnosis of pregnancy , the Treating Neurologist should discuss wi th 
the patient the potential teratogenicit y and delay ed risks for a child exposed in utero to 
laquinimod. The possibility  of termination of the pregnancy  should be discussed. In case the 
patient decides to continue the pregnancy , she will be followed to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or elective termination, details of birth, and presence or absence of an y birth defect, 
congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications.
5.Guidance on monitoring patient s with elevated pancreatic amylase levels
Pancreatic am ylase will be measured at each study  visit. Lipase will be tested in case of 
abnormal pancreatic am ylase results. In case of suspected pancreatitis, the patientshould 
undergo a thorough clinical evaluation including an abdominal CT sca n as soon as possible in 
order to clarify  the diagnosis and enable assessment of severit y of this condition.
6.Liver Impairment
Patients who develop liver disease associated with liver functional impairment while 
participating in the stud y should stop study  medication.
7.Renal Impairment
Patients who develop renal d isease associated with moderate or severe functional impairment, 
defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤60 mL/min/1.73 m2, while participating in the study 
should stop study  medication temporarily and the GFR assessment should be repeated. If the 
renal impairment is confirmed (GFR≤60mL/min/1.73 m2), the patient should stop study  
medication permanently .

158APPENDIX C.MODERATE/STRONG CYP3 A4 INHIBITORS AND 
CYP3A4 INDUCERS
Laquinimod pharmacokinetics are affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; 
moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed within 2 weeks of baselineuntil 30days after 
the last dose has been administered.
Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are prohibited because concomitant admin istration is 
predicted to increase laquinimod exposure and may  increase the likelihood of adverse events.
A partial list of moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors follows: 
Medication class Drug name
Protease inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, nelfin avir, amprenavir, 
atazanavir, darunavir, ritonavir

163APPENDIX F.MRI PROCEDURES
The patients will undergo up to 3 MRI scans: baseline(at least 14daysbut not more than 
42days prior to baseline ), week 24, and week48 (or ET visit if performed after the we ek36 visit 
and prior to week 48). Weeks 24 and 48 (or ET) MRI  must be performed within 14 day s of study  
visit. Gdwill be administered at baseline MRI only .In case of steroid treatment, study  MRI 
should be performed before or be delayed to allow a minimu m of 14days, but not more than 
28days, from the completion of the steroid course.
MRIscans will be obt ained according to a standard protocol that will be provided by the MRI 
Reading Center. At baselineonly, MRI scans will be obtained before and after Gd 
administration. GFR calculation at the site should be done prior to the baseline MRI scan.
MRIfacilities will undergo a qualification procedure, which will include the performance of a 
healthy volunteer dummyrun to ensure that the implementation of the standard sequences on 
their system produces appropriate images for measuring the endpoints specified in the protocol. 
The health y volunteer must sign an EC approved informed consent form. Qualification of sites 
will be formally indicated bya dummy run approval certification. Sites must be qualified prior to 
the first patient inclusion.
Detailed instructions are provided in the MRI Technologist Manual and Operations Manual .
Confidential patient information such as patient full name must be omitted from the scan header, 
the compact -disclabels,andanyaccompanying documentation. MRI scans will be transferred to 
theMRIReading Center in electronic format. The procedure for sending electronic data and 
accompanying documentation is specified in the MRI Technologist Manual.
TheMRIreading center will perform QC of all images received. If a scan or seque nce fails QC, 
it will need to be repeated. If the baseline scan fails QC, rescanning of the patient should be 
performed as soon as possible prior to baseline . In cases of failed QC at all other visits, the 
window for rescanning will be no longer than 2 weeks. I maging should be reviewed, by the site, 
at the time of acquisition so that any sequences affected by obvious artifacts can be repeated 
immediatel y.
MRIscansareevaluated local lyforany incidental pathology  (ie, pathology unrelated to, or 
inconsistent with, the patient’s known MS) according to local ly determined procedures. If such 
pathology is found, the Treating Neurologist should be notified. The MRI reading center will 
evaluate the scans for the purposes of performing quantitative measurements and confirming 
Inclusion Criteria #2 ( Lesions consistent with PPMS in either or both brain MRI  and cervical 
spinal cord MRI) . In order not to compromise blinding of the stud y, the MRI Reading Center 
will not report MRI  findings back to the clinical site.

175APPENDIX H.INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TIMED 25 -FOOT WALK
Description
The Timed 25 -Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity  function. The patientis 
directed to 1end of a clearly  marked 25 -Foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly  
as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again b y having the patientwalk 
back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task.
Materials Needed
Stopwatch, clipboard, Timed 25- Foot Walk Record Form, marked 25 -Foot distance in an 
unobstructed hallway , assistive device (if needed)
Time Limit Per Trial
3 minutes (180 seconds) per trial.
Discontinue Rules
If the patientcannot complete Trial 2 of the Timed Walk after a 5- minute rest period.
If the patientcannot complete a trial in 3 minutes.
Administration
Trial 1
Make sure that the stopwatch is set to 0:00. For the Timed 25- Foot Walk, the patientshould be 
directed to 1end of a clearly  marked 25 -Foot course (clearl y defined on the floor or on the wall) 
and instructed to stand just behind the starting line. Point out where the 25 -Foot course ends, 
then instruct the patientas follows: " I'd like you to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. 
Do not slow down until after you've passed the finish line. Ready? Go. "
Begin timing when the lead foot is lifted and crosses the starting line. The examiner should walk 
along with the patientas s/he completes the task. Stop timing when the lead foot crosses the 
finish line. The examiner should then record the patient's walk time to within 0.1 second, 
rounding as needed. Round up to the next tenth if hundredth's place is > (greater than or equal to) 
.05, round down if hundredth's place is <.05 (eg, 32.45" would round to 32.5" but 32.44" would 
round to 32.4"). Once the time is recorded, be sure to reset the stopwatch.
Trial 2
After completing the first timed walk, position the patient just behind the line where s/he is not 
standing, repeat the same instructions, and have the patient complete the walk again.
Assistive Devices
The goal is to have the patientuse the same assistive device at each stud y visit. The Treating 
Neurologist will select an assistive device at the beginning of the stud y for each patientthat 
needs 1, keeping in mind that the patientmay deteriorate modestl y during the trial.
In general, patients should use their customary  assistive device(s), NOT the least assistance 
possible to comple te the test. For patients with significant gait impairment, the Treating 
Neurologist should have the patientuse a rolling walker even if this is not the patient 's customary  
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
176device. In general, non -wheeled walkers should not be used. If a patientdoes use an assistive 
device, this should be noted on the Record Form.
Completing the Record Form
Record an y circumstances that y ou believe may  have affected the patient's performance. These 
are factors that may  have affected the trial but were not severe enough tonecessitate repetition of 
the trial. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:
The patienthad a cold or reports not feeling well.
The patienttripped but did not fall.
If a situation arises that necessitates the repetition of a trial, indi cate the reason a trial had to be 
repeated on the Record Form. Examples of reasons to repeat a trial include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
The patientfell during the walk.
Examiner forgot to start or stop stopwatch.
Examiner forgot to reset stopwatch in between trials.
The patientstopped to talk to someone while walking, or another person/thing 
somehow interfered with walk.
Record only the times for the 2 successfully completed trials of the Timed 25- Foot Walk. If the 
patientcould not complete 1 or both of the trials of the Timed 25-Foot Walk, record this in the 
appropriate section of the Record Form. For example, if the patient's disease has progressed 
and/or ph ysical limitations prohibit him or her from completing the trial, you should indicat e 
"Unable to complete trial due to phy sical limitations" and record any  specifics that y ou can 
observe (ie, patient in a wheelchair now and unable to walk, etc.). If the patient did not complete 
a trial for an y other reason, specify  this as well (eg, patie ntfell and was too fatigued to complete 
another trial, patientrefused to complete trial).

177APPENDIX I.INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 9-HOLE PEG TEST
Description
The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity  (arm and hand) function. The 9- HPT is 
the second component o f the MSFC to be administered. Both the dominant and non -dominant 
hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediatel y by 
two consecutive trials of the non -dominant hand). It is important that the 9-HPT is administered 
on a solid table (not a rolling hospital bedside table) and that the 9 -HPT apparatus be anchored.
Materials Needed
9-HPT Apparatus, Anchor, stopwatch, clipboard, 9- HPT Record Form
Time Limit per Trial
5 minutes (300 seconds) per trial
Discontinue Rules
1.If the subject cannot complete one trial of the 9 -HPT in 5 minutes.
4.If the subject cannot complete a trial with his or her dominant hand within 5 minutes, 
move on to the trials with the non- dominant hand.
5.If the subject cannot complete a trial with his or hernon- dominant hand, end the test.
Administration
Dominant Hand Trial 1
Make sure that the stopwatch is set to "0:00." Introduce this section b y saying, "Now, we're 
going to be measuring your arm and hand function. " If this is the first visit, determine the
dominant hand, ask, " Are you right or left -handed?"  If the subject is not sure, then the dominant 
hand is determined b y asking the subject which hand he/she did or does write with. Make a note 
of the dominant hand for subsequent instructions. Place the 9 -HPT apparatus on the table, 
directly in front of the subject. Arrange the apparatus so that the side with the pegs is in front of 
the hand being tested and the side with the empty  pegboard is in front of the hand not being 
tested. Secure with anchor.
Read the following instructions to the subject: " On this test, I want you to pick up the pegs one 
at a time, using one hand only, and put them into the holes as quickly as you can in any order 
until all the holes are filled. Then, without pausing, remove the pe gs one at a time and return 
them to the container as quickly as you can. We'll have you do this two (2) times with each 
hand. We'll start with your [DOMINANT] hand. You can hold the pegboard steady with your 
[NON-DOMINANT] hand. If a peg falls onto the tab le, please retrieve it and continue with the 
task. If a peg falls on the floor, keep working on the task and I will retrieve it for you. See how 
fast you can put all of the pegs in and take them out again. Are you ready? Begin. "
Start timing as soon as the subject touches the first peg, and stop timing when the last peg hits 
the container. If a peg drops on the floor, the examiner may retrieve it and put it back in the peg 
box. However, if a peg drops onto the table, allow the subject to retrieve it.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Multiple Sclerosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
178Recordthe subject's time under "Dominant hand Trial 1." If the subject stops after having put all 
the pegs into the holes, prompt the subject to remove them as well b y saying, "And now remove 
them all." If the subject begins to remove more than one peg at a tim e, correct him/her by  saying, 
"Pick up one peg at a time ."
Dominant Hand Trial 2
After the first trial with the dominant hand, say , "Good. Now, I'd like you to do the same thing 
again, once again using your [DOMINANT]  hand. See how fast you can put all of the pegs in 
and take them out again. Ready? Begin ." Again, start timing as soon as the subject touches the 
first peg, and stop timing when the last peg hits the container. Record the subject's time under 
"Dominant hand Trial 2."
Non-Dominant Hand Trials 1 and 2
After the second trial with the dominant hand, rotate the apparatus 180 degrees such that the side 
with the pegs is now in front of the non- dominant hand and the empt y pegboard is in front of the 
dominant hand. Then say, " OK. Now, I'd like you to swi tch and use your [NON -DOMINANT]  
hand. This time, you can use your [DOMINANT]  hand to stabilize the pegboard. Ready? Begin ." 
Administer, time and record the two non -dominant hand trials following the procedures 
described above for dominant hand trials.
Completing the Record Form
Record an y circumstances that y ou believe may  have affected the subject's performance. These 
are factors that may  have affected the trial but were not severe enough to necessitate repetition of 
the trial. Examples include, but are no t limited to, the following:
The subject dropped a peg.
The subject has a cold.
The subject forgot ey eglasses and had difficulty  seeing pegs.
The subject talked during the task.
The subject knocked entire apparatus on the floor.
If a trial is repeated, ind icate this and specify  the reason it had to be repeated. Examples of 
reasons to repeat a trial include the following:
The subject knocked entire apparatus on the floor.
The examiner forgot to start or stop stopwatch.
The examiner forgot to reset the stopwa tch in between trials.
Record onl y the times for the two successfully completed trials for each hand on the 9 -HPT. If 
the subject could not complete one or both of the trials for either hand of the 9 -HPT, record this 
in the appropriate section of the Recor d Form. If the subject's disease has progressed and/or 
physical limitations prohibit him or her from completing the trial, the examiner should mark, 
"Unable to complete trial due to phy sical limitations." and then record an y specifics that can be 
observed (eg, subject unable to use right hand, subject could not complete within time limit, 
etc.). If the subject did not complete a trial for any  other reason, describe the specific 
circumstances (eg, subject refused).

Clinical Study  Protocol with Global Amendment 02 Study TV5600-CNS-20006 (ARPEGGIO)
181APPENDIX L.OCT ANCILLARY STUDY DESIGN AND 
METHODOLOGY
The patientsparticipating in the OCT ancillary  study will undergo scheduled OCT testing and 
ophthalmological examination at week0 (up to 42 days prior to baseline), and follow -up OCT 
testing at weeks 48 and 96. Additional OCT and ophthalmological examinations may  be 
performed in case of an y AEconcerning the patient’s vision. 
The assessments will be performed using the following methodology : 
Ophthalmological examinations at baselinewill include slit lamp, impression tonometry , 
refractometry  and funduscopy  to identify  retinal ex clusion criteria to this ancillary stud y.
Spectral domain OCT at week0 (up to 42 days prior to baseline)and weeks 48 and 96 
will be performed using a Spectralis®device (Heidelberg Engineering) assessing 
peripapillary  RNFL, optic nerve head and macula.
Confidentiality  of study patientswill be maintained and patientswill be identified only  
by the study  identification numbers.
OCT results as well as ophthalmological parameters will be transferred directly  to the 
OCT Reading Center via a designated web site. The OCT reading center will perform 
quality control (QC) of all results received. If a scan fails QC, it will need to be repeated. 
OCT facilities will undergo a qualification procedure, which will include the performance 
of a dummy  run to ensure that the implementation of the specific OCT protocol technique 
in the facility ’s setting produces appropriate images for comparison with other centers 
and measurement of the endpoints specified in the protocol. For this purpose, after 
signing an EC approved inf ormed consent form , 1volunteer per site will undergo 
2consecutive OCT scans measurements on separate day s prior to the first patient 
inclusion in the OCT ancillary  study. OCT scans should be performed according to the 
manual using the software’s follow -
up function to ensure identical positioning on the 
follow up scan. Ophthalmologic examinations or visual testing are not necessary  for these 
qualification scans. Qualification of sites will be formally  indicated by  a dummy  run 
approval certification.
Detailed instructions are provided in the OCT operation manuals.
ANCILLARY STUDY ENDPOINTS
Neuronal and axonal atrophy  as defined b y the change in thickness of the inner retinal 
layers (RNFL, ganglion cell lay er, and inner plexiform lay er) in macular volume scan s 
and 12° peripapillary  ring scans from baseline to w eeks 48and 96.
Eyes with an acute optic neuritis during the study interval or with an ocular exclusion 
criterion will be excluded from anal ysis of the above endpoints.
ANCILLARY STUDY ADDITIONAL EXCLUSI ON CRITERIA
The following criteria lead to exclusion of affected ey es only. However, the patient can 
participate in the OCT ancillary  study with a single ey e, if it is unaffected.

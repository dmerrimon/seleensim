1 INTRODUCTION  
Intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage incidence can vary depending on the type of 
surgery and can lead to severe clinical complications ranging from mild anemia to fatal 
hemorrhagic shock. Those that recover from severe hemorrhagic events often have poor 
functional outcomes and are at risk for greater long -term mortality. Numerous studies reveal that 
post-operative hemorrhagic events are also quite frequent, occurring in as many as 13 to 19%  
of patients following various type of surgeries (i.e., major  pancreatic resections, transoral robotic 
surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and living -donor transplants). 
Hemorrhagic shock is also a leading cause of death in trauma.1-6   
Monitoring and detecting fluid changes in patients can be complicated. Physiological responses 
associated with hemorrhagic events are often delayed because of compensation mechanisms 
that act to sustain blood pressure and protect tissue perfusion.1 The ability to continuously and 
non-invasively detect changes in central blood volume and blood loss will permit appropriate 
hemodynamic management during events at high risk for acute blood loss such as surgery, 
trauma, post -operative care and other thera peutic procedures.  Through early detection and 
improved hemodynamic monitoring, optimization of fluid balance, anesthesia titration, and 
augmenting other acute care management requirements, a clinician should be able to improve 
overall patient stability, minimiz e complications, diminish surgical trauma and reduce recovery 
time.  
Current methods for acutely monitoring blood volume and blood loss include monitoring of vital 
signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure respirations, and oxygen saturation), invasive central 
venous (right heart central venous pressure measurement and swan  ganz pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure measurements) and arterial catheters designed to monitor hemodynamic status 
centrally.  Vital sign monitoring may not indicate small amounts of acute blood loss and arterial 
and venous cannulations can create insert ion complications such as perforations in the 
vasculature, pneumothorax, arrhythmias, thrombosis and infection.  While invasive central 
monitoring may provide extremely accurate information, changes may not be good indicators of 
early central hypovolemia o r with smaller blood volume reductions1-2.   
The Zynex Cardiac Monitor  (CM) Device , uses a relative patient standard approach by non -
invasively and simultaneously monitoring five (5)  physiological parameters, including 
bioelectrical impedance, ECG amplitude, photoplethysmogram (PPG) amplitude, heart rate, and 
skin temperature. The CM  Device  starts by creating a baseline for each patient in a normal 
state. When the monitoring session starts, each patient starts with a Relative Index of 100, 
signifying the collection of parameters near their original ba seline value(s). The Relative Index 
value acts as a combinational score for all the parameters indicative of relative fluid change.   
There are two (2) models of the CM Device, Model 1500 (CM -1500) and 1600 (CM -1600) which 
measure the same five (5) parameters and utilize the same algorithm to output the Relative 
Index value.

1.1 CLINICAL RATIONALE  
The proposed clinical study is designed to confirm that the  Zynex  non-invasive monitoring 
device can track blood volume changes in healthy individuals consented to undergo an 
apheresis blood donation.  An initial feasibility was conducted (n = 12 subjects) to confirm that 
the CM -1500 can  be used to  track  acute blood loss in healthy individuals  donat ing 500mL of 
blood.   Additional research is required to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the CM  Device  
to tracking blood loss and blood volume changes during an apheresis blood donation  as well as 
establish the changes in the RI with loss of different blood components .    
2 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
2.1 OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objective of the study is to characterize  changes in the CM  Device  Relative  Index  
during an apheresis procedure.   
The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the following:  
• Changes in blood pressure  relative  to changes in the Relative Index   
• Relative Index changes when using Trima or Amicus  apheresis devices  
• CM Device’s  ability to detect different  blood components  and fluid  
2.2 STUDY DURATION  
Enrollment in the study is expected to take up to 12 months, and data analysis may take up to 
an additional 2 months to complete.  
2.3 STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a prospective, single -arm, non -randomized, non-blinded, non-controlled, non-
significant risk, single center study enrolling up to 200 healthy adult subjects consented to 
undergo an apheresis do nation procedure. The study will be enrolled in two (2) phases .  The first 
phase will include 2 5 subjects consented to any automated blood component device procedure 
at the study site.   
At the end of the first phase of 25 subjects, the CM -1500 data will be evaluated to determine if 
sufficient Relative Index changes can be detected during an apheresis procedure to warrant 
continu ing study enrollment and assess the potential need to sub-select a specific population of 
apheresis procedure(s) to optimize the ability of the CM  Device  to track the fluid changes  in the 
subjects.  For example, it’s  possible  that certain apheresis procedures (e.g. platelet donation) may 
provide greater opportunity for detection of fluid changes than others. The Sponsor will 
communicate the decision with the study site , and if determined appropriate, enrollments will 
continue  as communicated  up to a maximum of 200 subjects .  
Note: Any significant changes to the study protocol  (and subsequent consent)  that are required  
after the  analysis  of the first phase of 25 subjects will require IRB approval prior to continuing with 
the remaining study enrollments.

3 STUDY  DEVICE   
3.1 CARDIAC MONITOR, MODEL 1500 (CM -1500)  
The CM -1500 is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared non -invasive monitoring 
device that simultaneously monitors five (5)  parameters of a patient’s body. Parameters include 
bioelectrical impedance, heart rate, ECG amplitude, PPG amplitude, and skin temperature. A 
combination of these parameters is represented by a single number known as the Relative Index 
value. This value is indicative of relative changes in fluid volume. The Relative Index is a unique 
functionality of the Zynex Cardiac Monitor ing Device . 
3.1.1  DEVICE DESIGN AND COMPONENTS  
The CM -1500 is an all -inclusive device that includes the following components: display monitor 
(1), power supply (1), trunk cable (1), wrist cuff with attached PPG finger glove (1), wrist strap (1), 
and electrode array set (2). The wrist cuff with attached  PPG finger glove may be cleaned and 
reused. The wrist strap is single -subject use. The electrode array sets are single -use, single -
subject.  
3.1.2  PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
The CM -1500 measures bioelectrical impedance (ohms), heart rate (BPM), ECG amplitude, PPG 
amplitude, and skin temperature (◦C or ◦F). As parameters change, towards indications of fluid 
change/imbalance, the Relative Index, which acts as a combinational score of percent change 
values for all of the parameters, will compound these changes into a singular value to signify 
overall fluid chan ges/imbalances within the patient’s body. When the monitoring session starts, 
every patient will start with a Relative Index of 100, signifying the combination of physiological 
parameters is near or at their original baseline values for all five monitored parameters. All 
parameters are continuously measured and tracked during a monitoring session. ECG and PPG 
amplitude values are only visible on the Advanced monitoring session display mode, as selected 
in the Setup screen.  
3.1.3  INDICATIONS FOR USE  
Per the device’s FDA clearance, the CM -1500 is indicated for monitoring bioelectrical impedance, 
heart rate, ECG amplitude, and PPG amplitude and their relative changes, indicative of relative 
changes in fluid volume in adult patients.  
3.1.4  INTENDED USE  
Per the device’s FDA clearance, the CM -1500 is intended to be used in professional medical 
environments, i.e., hospitals, clinics, and research institutions. The CM -1500 is a standalone 
device intended for desktop use, w here device operation is to be performed as uninterrupted 
patient monitoring. The CM -1500 shall only be used by a qualified device operator. The operator 
shall have knowledge of the system and data interpretation obtained via medical education, 
system docu mentation, and specific courses. The  device does not report any diagnosis but 
provides numerical values; it is ultimately the physician’s responsibility to make proper diagnosis 
and judgments based on these values.

copy of the ICF. The Investigator or qualified designated study personnel will record that consent 
was obtained prior to performing study procedures.  
5.2 BASELINE DATA  
Baseline data collection  will include  obtaining health screening data directly from the standard 
research screening  record at the study site. Data not available on the apheresis procedure record 
will be captured on a paper case report form (CRF). These data will include skin tone, smoking 
history, and if they are currently taking any cardiovascular medications  or supplements that could 
impact their physiological response to the donation procedure . Subjects will self -report they are 
not currently pregnant or have been pregnant in the previous 6 -weeks, and that will be captured 
on the research screening record.  
5.3 STUDY PROCEDURE  
The study procedure will consist of connecting the CM  Device to the study subject and starting a 
monitoring session at least 8  minutes prior to starting the scheduled apheresis procedure , wearing 
the monitor during the blood component donation, and continuing to wear  the monitor for 10 
minutes  after the apheresis procedure is complete.   
5.3.1  PREPARING DEVICE FOR OPERATION  
The Investigator or qualified designated study personnel  will prepare the device for use  by 
following the directions within the CM  Instructions for Use (IFU) m anual .

8.1 SAFETY DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1  ADVERSE EVENT  (AE)  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence , whether or not related to 
the study  device or study  procedure. AE’s are characterized by grading, actions taken, 
relationship to donation or study procedure , and outcome . These definitions are in the 
corresponding tables below. All adverse events related to the blood donation procedure will be 
recorded and reported  in addition to those that may occur specific to the protocol -defined study 
procedure.   All attempts should be made to ensure resolution of the adverse event upon study 
completion.

Table 4: Adverse Event Outcome  
 
Outcome  Description  
Recovered/Resolved  Subject recovered and event was resolved upon study completion  
Recovered/Resolved with 
Sequelae  Subject recovered but exhibited lingering minor symptoms upon 
study completion  
Recovering  Adverse event persisted upon study completion but was 
improving  
Not Recovered  Adverse event persisted upon study completion and was not 
exhibiting any signs of improvement  
Death   Subject expired  
Unknown  Status of the adverse event was unknown upon study

8.1.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)   
An SAE  is defined a s an AE  that meets any of the following criteria: Fatal or life -threat ening*; 
requires or prolongs in -subject hospitalization **; results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity ; congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical event. An event’s  severity  
grading , action (s) taken , relationship to the donation or study procedure , and the outcome  will all 
be used for SAE’s.  
*Life-threatening is defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically may have caused death if it was more 
severe.  
**In-subject hospitalization is defined as an event in which the subject was admitted to the hospital 
for one or more days, even  if released on the same day  or an emergency room visit , which results 
in admission to the hospital. Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital 
should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes criteria . 
8.1.3  UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)   
An unanticipated adverse device  effect is d efined by  21 CFR 812 .3 as any serious adverse effect 
on the health of safety or life -threatening  problem or death caused by or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including supplementary plan or application, 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects . The Investigator  or designee  will indicate if they believe an event 
was an unanticipated adverse device effect on the case repo rt form, and the Sponsor will evaluate 
for reporting requirements defined below.  
8.2 SAFETY  REPORTING  
Safety r eporting begins at the time of signed Informed Consent and ends at subject study 
completion.

9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
This is a two -phase  hypothesis generating study; therefore, hypothesis testing will not be 
performed. The sample size of 25 subjects for the first phase and 200 total subjects is empirically 
determined to be sufficient for an early -phase pilot study characteriz ing the performance of the 
Relative Index during an apheresis donation procedure. The results in the first phase will be used 
to help the sponsor determine if the enrollment is continued in the second phase. This decision 
based on the results in the first pha se will be p urely empirical, not based on planned statistical 
hypothesis testing.

PROTOCOL:  ZMS -1500 -2021 -Apheresis  
    
 
REV: 2.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 24 
 
9.2 ANALYSIS SET   
All eligible subjects wh o were  enrolled in the study  and use d the study  device will be included in  
the analys es. Subjects who withdraw after enrollment  and before device use will  be excluded from 
the analyses .  
9.3 DESC RIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all endpoints and measures. Continuous variables will 
be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum, 
maximum and number of observations. Categorical variables will be s ummarized in terms of the 
number of subjects providing data, frequency count and percentage.  
 
9.4 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
All demographic and baseline variables collected at enrollment will be summarized  using 
descriptive statistics .   
9.5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The data for this study will be summarized using descriptive statistics. There is no formal 
hypothesis testing planned for th is study. Point estimates and the corresponding confidence 
intervals will be presented for the statistical analysis. If data are normally distributed, the 
confidence interval of the mean will be constructed based on a t -distribution. Otherwise if data are 
skew ed, distribution -free confidence interval of the median will be calculated. For proportions, a 
two-sided 95% confidence interva l will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method.  
 
The primary evaluations  pertaining to  the performance of the CM  Device  will examine  the 
behavior  the Relative Index  value  in accordance with  subject  outcomes  and conditions that 
present  during the apheresis donation procedures.  Baseline performance of the CM  Device  will 
be set in the Relative Index before the procedure.  The primary analysis will utilize the descriptive 
statistics to characterize the changes in the CM  Device  Relative  Index  during an apheresis 
procedure  comparing to the baseline values.  The analysis , however, can include  investigation 
into individual vita l sign parameters that the CM  Device  (or another  source)  produces  during a 
subject’s donation or 10-minute  post-donation observation period .  
 
Analysis of  data sets collected from  all subjects  aim to  satisfy the following purposes, included 
but not limited to:   
• Examine, on a case -by-case review basis, the results produced by the CM  Device for 
relevant subject case results. This could include analyzing data and comparing to 
expected/observed information as a result of this trial, from either the CM  Device, from the 
principal investigator, designated study personnel, or Sponsor observers.  
• Classify aggregate results by subject outcomes, particularly nominal and hemorrhagic 
shock/complications (if observed), and evaluate the performance of the CM  Device  to 
indicate either the presence of the presenting complication or specify the absence of 
presenting complications.  
• Investigate statistical relevance of aggregate subject outcomes (where applicable for 
similar resulting outcomes and/or presenting complications), with analytic components 
possibly including but not limited to:

o Determination of the sensitivity for the CM  Device to identify fluid changes in study 
subjects  
o Determination of the specificity of the CM  Device to identify normal recovery 
conditions of a subject after the apheresis donation procedure where no cases of 
hemorrhage, related shock, or other complications present.  
o Compilation of relevant trends and patterns, including applicable metrics such as 
mean, max/min, standard deviation, expected linear trajectories, etc. of the 
Relative Index data results for aggregate data, as classified by patient outcomes 
and total fluid  lost and re -infused.  
 
Descriptive analysis will be conducted when 25 subjects are enrolled and complete the first phase. 
The analysis results will be used to determine the enrollment for the second phase in an empirical 
manner. The final analysis will be conducted when the study is complete.   
 
10 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION, AND MONITORING   
10.1 DATA COLLECTION  
The Investigator will prepare , maintain, and retain complete, current, accurate, organized , and 
legible Source Documents  to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject. In 
some instances , case report forms (CRFs)  will serve as source documentation. The Investigator 
or designated study personnel will provide the Sponsor redacted standard procedure records  with 
the subject ID number  for the majority of the data collection  requirements . Any required data not 
collected as standard of care for the apheresis procedure will be captured on study -specific paper 
case report forms.   
Corrections of data on paper CRFs  or source documents  will be made by crossing out the 
incorrect data and making the correction. Each correction will be initialed and dated by the study 
personnel making the correction.  
The Investigator is responsible for the information collected on subjects enrolled in the study. All 
data collected during the study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuracy by 
the Investigator.  If any corrections are made after the Investigators signature, the Investigator will 
also initial and date the correction.  
10.1.1  SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
In order to  maintain subject confidentiality, records identifying the subject will be kept in a safe 
and secure location; access to these records will be on a limited basis. Only the subject  
identification number, gender , and age will identify study subjects on CRFs and other 
documentation submitted to the Sponsor.   A limited number of Sponsor representatives may have 
access to identifiable information and will take reasonable precautions to maintain the 
confidentiality of the subject ’s identity . 
10.2 DATA RETENTION  
All study records will be stored in a safe and secure location. Records will be retained per 
applicable regulatory requirements , which include for a period of 2 years after the latter of the

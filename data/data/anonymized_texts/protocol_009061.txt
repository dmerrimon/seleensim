1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stati ng the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
The benefits of sport and recrea tional activities for the disab led are well recognized f rom the standpoint of 
health and quality of life.  Yet t here remains a lack of option s for most disabled pe ople, especially the young. 
Sailing is an attractive sport th at can be pursued at recreatio nal and competitive leve ls. We outline a pilot 
therapeutic sailing program usi ng the VSail-Access Sailing Simu lator system. This program is a good fit with 
our current Activity Based Restorative therapy practices, and w e expect that findi ngs will add to our 
understanding of recovery from sp inal cord injury and how to pr omote it. Participatio n in sailing by people 
with disabilities, particularly in small sailboats, is widely r egarded as having positive outcomes on self-esteem 
and general health for the partic ipants.  However, a major hurd le for people with no exper ience of sailing, even 
those without disabilities, is the perception that sailing is e litist, expensive and dange rous. Real time “ride on” 
sailing simulators have the pot ential to bridge the gap between  dry land and on water sa iling. They provide a 
realistic, safe and easily supe rvised medium, in which non-sail ors can easily and syste matically learn the 
required skills before venturing on the water. The task of sail ing on a simulator can tak e place under specified 
conditions (eg wind strength) a nd be taught as individual compo nents (e.g. steering, sail tr imming) in a way that 
is not possible on the water where there is a large number of i nteracting variables. The individual components 
can then be brought together so that the novice sailor rapidly achieves a degree of competence that would take 
much longer on the water. The aim of this project is to establi sh protocols for effective use of a simulator by 
people with disabilities and t hen to conduct a pilot trial to t est two hypotheses: (1) Tha t the use of the sailing 
simulator technology enables peopl e with spinal cord injury to learn the skills required to sail on the water in a 
safe, non-threatening environmen t;  (2) Teaching patients with SCI to sail using simulator technology will 
provide them with a safe, effec tive introduction to a healthy, environmentally-friendly, lifelong sport and 
recreation that will ha ve measurable impr ovements on their phys ical health and psyc hological well-being, 
including their confidence (self- esteem), morale, and optimism about the future. In this  pilot trial 20 subjects 
with spinal cord injury will be recruited, assessed medically, and with questionnaires to establish baselines for 
evaluation of quality of life and self-esteem.  All subjects wi ll follow a course of instr uction leading to mastery 
of basic sailing techniques such that at the end of the course the subjects will be able to perform a series of 
standard sailing maneuvers and navi gate competently a triangula r racecourse on the simulator’s display in 12 
knots of wind within a preset ti me.  The deliverables will be a  detailed protocol for the use of sailing simulators 
to prepare people with disabilit ies to start sailing on the wat er.  A secondary deliverable will be a structured 
protocol for use by sailing cente rs working with people with di sabilities who enter sailing by direct participation 
on the water. Once the participan ts have completed the 12 week course they will have the opportunity to sail on 
the water with the assistance of the Downtown Sailing Club (DSC ), Baltimore; however, t his is not part of the 
formal pilot trial, which is aimed primarily at determining the  optimum use of a sailin g simulator for training 
purposes.  The information from t his pilot trial will be used t o formulate a future more comprehensive study, 
which will include a major on wat er component in collaboration with the Downtown Sailing Club.

Objectives 
 
b. Include all primary and secondary objectives.  
The objective of this propose d project is to develop an instruc tional and therapeutic sai ling program for spinal 
cord injured individu als using the VSail- Access system.  In the  proposed study, we shall test two hypotheses: 
 
Hypothesis 1: That the use of the sailing sim ulator technology enables people  with spinal cord injury to learn 
the skills required to sail on t he water in a saf e, non-threate ning environment. 
Hypothesis 2: That learning to sail by people with  spinal cord injuries to a stage where they are competent to 
begin to sail on the water in mod erate conditions (wind strengt h up to 12 knots) show s measurable 
improvements on their physical health, quality of life, morale,  self-esteem, and s elf confidence. 
 
Specific Aims:  
Aim 1: To use novel technology in the form of a real-time physical sai ling simulator to enhance the 
effectiveness of a spinal cord  injury rehabilitation program. 
Aim 2: To investigate what positive outco mes in terms of physical and psychological well-being are 
demonstrable when a person i s using the simulator. 
Aim 3: To investigate a person’s percep tion of their point of readines s to transition to the water from sailing 
simulation and how this compares w ith the therapist’s assessmen t of a person’s point of readiness. 
 
Deliverables  
1: A detailed protocol for the use of sailing simulators to prepar e people with disabilities to start sailing on the 
water. 2: A structured protocol for use  by sailing centers working with p eople with disabilities who enter sailing by 
direct participation on the water,  rather than via initial sail ing simulator experience. 
 
2. Background  
a. Briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current exp erience with procedur es, drug or device,  
and any other relevant information to justify the research.  
Participation in sailing by peopl e with disabilities, particula rly in small sailboats is wi dely regarded as having 
positive outcomes on the self-est eem and general health of the participants. There is evidence that there are 
psychological benefits  of virtual reality s ystems for patients in rehabilitation thera py (Chen et al, 2009). In 
addition, sailing is a family r ecreational activity; learning t o sail will improve family relations and reintegration 
into the community.  For the com petitively minded, the worldwid e organization Sailability World, Inc. 
(www.sailability.org ) promotes sailing for the disabled. With suitably equipped sai lboats, the disa bled are able 
to compete on equal terms with the able-bodied. 
Pilot trials in Australia and N ew Zealand have successfully use d this simulation tec hnology to introduce people 
with severe disabilities to s ailing on dry land, with successfu l transfer to on water com petitive and recreational 
sailing.  One patient competed in a World Championship event in  July 2010 and qualified for the 2012 
Paralympics, less tha n one year after her i nitial simulator exp erience.  However, these pilot trials did not assess 
the impact of the experience of t hese people, apart from verbal  reports of enthusiastic enjoyment of the 
experience. 
Our relationship with the Accessi ble sailing program at the DSC  is significant and is  being formalized. The 
DSC is two miles from Kennedy Kri eger Institute. Several of the  International Center for  Spinal Cord Injury’s 
therapy staff are sailors and als o volunteer at the program.  S ome of our patients have a lready participated in on- 
water sailing at that venue.  We will include Kennedy Krieger s taff coaching sessions given by experienced

DSC staff in the VSail-Access program. This partnership will pr ovide the best available sailing instruction to 
our subjects and therapists.  Thi s will provide insights to the  DSC staff on how to imp rove their own program 
for spinal cord injured individuals.  The relationship will pro vide continuity for Kennedy Krieger Institute 
trained sailors transitioning to t he water in Baltimore as well  as for the family members who will support them. 
We expect that this continuity w ill enhance the sailing experie nce for all and will foster continued participation 
in the sport. 
 
 
3. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, includi ng the sequence and timing of study procedures 
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care).  
This is a within subject pilot study that plans to enroll 20 ch ronic (more than 6 months) SCI patients as per 
recruitment matrix in Table  1.  This pilot study will provide p reliminary evidence w ith respect to both 
Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 (s ee above).  Organization of a l arger trial is planned, the detail design of which 
will depend upon the outcomes fr om this study, and subjects wil l be recruited from individuals already 
undergoing rehabilitative interve ntions at the International Ce nter for Spinal Cord I njury (ICSCI) at the 
Kennedy Krieger Institute and near by military medical centers ( Walter Reed, Baltimore VA). In addition to 
their already prescribed rehab ilitation regimen, the eligible s ubjects will engage in a virtual reality sailing 
program (VSail) once a week, 1h/session for 12 weeks.  The subj ects will be assessed using a battery of 
physical and neurological indicators before starting the traini ng (baseline), after 6 w eeks and 12 weeks of 
training, and at 6 and 12 months f ollowing the completion of th e training. During each training visit outcomes 
will be assessed by the trainer .  The study timeline is found i n Figure 1.

All activities will be conducted at Kennedy Krieger Institute a nd are supervised by the P rincipal Investigator. 
 
(1) Study Intervention:  
All activities will be conducted at Kennedy Krieger Institute b y a VSail trainer. 
 
While undergoing the virtual sai ling training, the subjects wil l use a VSail-Access simulator (Virtual Sailing, 
Melbourne, Australia).  The VSa il simulator will be set in the Access Dinghy mode. The VSail sailing 
parameters will be set to the subjects skill set and progressio n in the training pr ogram: wind speed from 
minimum (8 knots) to moderate s trength (14 knots), pneumatic ra ms (simulating the heeling of the hull) on or 
off. 
 
The subjects will be transferred t o the VSail cockpit and secur ed. Following the traine r’s instruction, the 
subject will sail the simulator around virtual courses displaye d on a computer screen, u sing a joystick to control 
the rudder angle and a mainsheet t o control the set of the sail . 
 
Training will be interrupted f or fatigue (17 or over on the Rat e of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale), signs and 
symptoms of Autonomic Dysreflex ia (headache, sweating, facial f lushing, goose bumps/piloerection, 
irritability, crying, sudden and p rofuse sweating above injury level, intense head/neck t ingling), symptomatic 
orthostatic hypotension (dizzine ss, light headedness, palpitati ons, sudden vision loss, p rofuse sweating). 
Session will resume whe n symptoms resolve. 
 
All subjects will continue the ir already prescribed rehabilitat ion regimen as per clinical plan and indications.

This pilot study will include a combination of pre- and post-qu alitative assessments, as well as 6 and 12 month 
follow-up.  All study assessments w ill be conducted at Kennedy Krieger Institute by a study team member 
trained in the assessm ent.  The data collec tion schedule is in Table 2. 
 
(a) Vital Signs:  This is a routine test performed  for people with spinal cord in jury. Resting heart rate and 
blood pressure in sitting position. This test will be performed  on all subjects. 
 
(b) Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs):  This is a routine test performed  for people with spinal cord in jury. 
Three respiratory functions will be  measured: Vital Capacity (V C) is the maximal amount of air that can be 
exhaled after a maximal inhalation; Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF) is the ability to take a deep breath in and 
to generate a cough strong enough to clear secretions;  Peak Co ugh Flow (PCF) measures the expiratory muscle 
force and the ability to cough.  Thi s test will be performed on  all subjects. 
 
(c) ASIA Test:  This is a routine test performed  for people with spinal cord in jury. The ASIA (American 
Spinal Injury Association) exam assesses motor function at 10 k ey muscles in the body and light touch and 
pinprick sensation at 28 key poi nts on each side of the body. I t is also used to classify injury level and severity. 
This test will be per formed on all subjects. 
 
(d) Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Lif e Questionnaire (SCI QL-23): This is a routine te st performed for 
people with spinal cord injur y.  The SCI QL-23 is a 23-item hea lth-related quality of life questionnaire 
(weighted scale, aggregate sco re: GQOL: overall rating of life situation; FUNC: physical and social 
limitations;  DEPR: distress and d epressive feelings; PROB: per ceived loss of independe nce and other issues 
relating to injury [Copyright ©  1990 Health Care Research Unit,  Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden]). 
The subject will read the ques tionnaire and answer the question s; if needed ,assistan ce will be provided to 
record the answers on the form.  The SCI QL-23 questionnaire wi ll be used for all subjects. 
 
(e) Veterans RAND 36-Item He alth Survey (VR-36): This is a routine test performed for people with health 
related issues. The VR-36 is a health-related quality of life q uestionnaire (weighted  scale, aggregate score 
[Copyright © Boston University S chool of Public Health, MA]. Th e subject will read the questionnaire and 
answer the questions; if needed, assistance will be provided to  record the answers on t he form. The VR-36 
questionnaire will be u sed for all subjects. 
 
(f)Functional Reach (FR) Test:  This is a routine test performed for people with spinal cord in jury. This test 
is used to evaluate trunk balan ce.  This test is performed by p atient reaching forward as far as they can while 
seated in their wheelchair. The  distance traveled by the top of  the reference shoulder is measured; 2 practice 
trials and 1 actual reach test is  performed for the purpose of the study. The forward and lateral reach will be 
assessed on all subjects. 
 
(g)Level of Trunk Activation:  This is a routine test performed  for people with spinal cord in jury. This test 
will assess the activation of t runk muscle by asking the patien t to perform a sit-up from the supine position. 
Using landmarks such as sterna  angle, nipple line, supra-sterna l notch, and ribs the lowest level of trunk 
activation will be determined.  Thi s test will be performed on all subjects. 
 
(h) Grasp/Pinch Testing:  This is a routine test performed  for people with spinal cord in jury.  This is a 
standard test used to assess strength of grasp and lateral pinc h. The Jamar dynamometer will be used to assess 
grasp and lateral pinch.  This t est will be performed on all su bjects.

4. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
The VSail-Access simulator (V irtual Sailing, Melbourne, Austral ia) is the first sailing simulator available for 
people with disabilities. 
 
The VSail simulator is a generic sailboat cockpit powered by a pneumatic ram and custom designed software. 
The sailor sails the simulator around virtual courses displayed  on a computer screen or  overhead display in the 
same way as a real sailboat on w ater (a tiller to control the r udder angle, a mainsheet to control the set of the sail 
and body position to control heeling of the hull). Electronic s ensors provide real time feedback to match the 
movements of the virtual sail boat displayed on the screen with those of the simulator. Sailors can select wind 
strength and conditions to suit th eir ability. The VSail-Access  simulator is a variatio n on the VSail where the 
cockpit is fitted with a seat based on the design used for Acce ss dinghies ( http://accessdinghy.org ).

The medical risks are defined i n the section below.  This allow s combining the risk an d risk management in the 
same section for each risk. 
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
All assessments and interven tion sessions will be supervised by  the Principal Investigator. 
 
For all the study procedures, the  risks and risk management are  defined in the sections below. 
 
 
VSail:  (1) Intervention Risks:  
There is a minimal risk of pre ssure sores, and skin break down.  To further minimize the risk , the subject 
seating in the VSail will be a ssessed and necessary precautions  will be taken and proper  protection equipment 
(gloves) will be used.

There is a minimal risk of fa lls during transfers in/out of the  VSail. To minimize the risk , subjects will be 
transferred using standard transfe r procedures that are in use clinically at the ICSCI. 
 
There is a minimal risk of fa tigue, autonomic dysreflexia, or o rthostatic hypotension. To minimize the risk , 
subjects are activel y monitored during VSa il training as descri bed above ( (j) Cardio-Vascular Monitoring ), by 
a study team member traine d in the procedure. 
 
(2) Assessment Risks:  
Vital Signs: There are no known risks associat ed with this measurement. 
 
Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs): The risk is minimal for most people.  Since the test involves s ome forced 
breathing and rapid breathing, patien ts may have some temporary  shortness of breath or light-headedness. 
Patients breathe through a ti ght-fitting mouthpiece, and will h ave nose clips.  To minimize the risk , a study 
team member trained in the pro cedure will perform the test. 
 
ASIA test:  There is a risk of discomfort at  the site of the pin prick duri ng the ASIA Exam. To minimize the 
risk, a study team member trained in the procedure will perform the  ASIA exam. 
 
Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Questionnaire (SCI QL-23): Aside from the risk associated with 
disclosing personnel or protected health information outside th e research study, there are no known risks 
associated with this measurement. 
 
Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey (VR-36):  Aside from the risk associ ated with disclosing personnel 
or protected health information outside the research study, the re are no known risks associated with this 
measurement. 
 
Functional Reach (FR) test:  Patients may feel anxiety rel ated to loss of balance.  To minimize the risk , a 
study team member trained in the p rocedure will perform the tes t and will position thems elves in the direction 
of the lean so subject does not fall. 
 
Level of Trunk Activation:  Patients may feel anxiety rel ated to loss of balance.  To minimize the risk , a 
study team member trained in the p rocedure will perform the tes t. 
 
Grasp/Pinch Testing:  There are no known risks associated with this measurement. 
 
Sailing Ability Questionnaire: Aside from the risk associated  with disclosing personnel or pro tected health 
information outside t he research study, t here are no known risk s associated with this measurement. 
 
Cardio-Vascular Monitoring:  This is a vital signs measurem ent.  There are no known risks as sociated with 
this measurement. 
 
Sailing Score: There are no known risks associated with this measurement. 
 
Weekly Diary: Aside from the risk associate d with disclosin g personnel or pro tected health information 
outside the research study, the re are no known risks associated  with this measurement.

Follow-up Questionnaire: Aside from the risk associated  with disclosin g personnel or pro tected health 
information outside t he research study, t here are no known risk s associated with this measurement. 
 
(3) Other Risks:  
Time Commitment:  The time commitment for the tra ining over the 12 weeks may be i nconvenient, as well as 
the follow-up. To minimize the risks : 1] The subject will be asked to contact the study coordinator  if having 
problems scheduling the visits; 2] If we feel that the subject can not commit the time and effort, he/she will be 
excluded from the study;  3] The vi sits may cause moderate soci al, school and work disruption. The start of the 
study will be scheduled to lessen t hose disruptions; 4] the fol low-up questionnaire can be  mailed to the subject 
or done over the phone. 
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated pr oblems or study deviations.  
Adverse events, unanticipated pr oblems and/or study deviations will be reported in wr iting by the Principal 
Investigator to the JHM-IRB and K KI Office of Research Complian ce. 
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated w ith breach of confidentiality.  
There are minimal legal risks associated with breach of confide ntiality for this study. To minimize the risk of 
breach of confidentiality, access t o participant/study data wil l be limited to study tea m members only.  All study 
data will be stored in a depar tment al locked cabinet and secur e database program. 
 
e. Financial risks to the participants.  
There will be no financial ris ks to the subject for any of the study tests. 
 
Any complications that arise fr om any study related injury will  be billed to the patients insurance. If the study 
participant has health insuran ce, the costs for any treatment o r hospital care received as the result of a study- 
related injury will be billed to their health insurer. Any cost s that are not paid for by the  health insurer will be 
billed to the patient.  If the study participant does not have health insurance, he or she w ill be billed for the costs 
of any treatment or hospital care received as the result of a s tudy-related injury. 
Subjects will be responsible for the cost of travel to and from  the Institute, as well as any food/meals purchased 
throughout the day while engaged i n study procedures. Valet par king is available at no cost. 
 
 
7. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society.  
There are no known benefits for t hose who participate in this s tudy. 
 
 
8. Payment and Remuneration

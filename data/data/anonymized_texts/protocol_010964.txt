Abbreviations/ Definitions   
 
 
2.0 Objectives* 
2.1 The current study aims to explore  the efficacy of a text message 
based Safety Behavior Fading Intervention compared to a control intervention. 
2.2 We hypothesize that individuals practicing safety behavior fading 
will exhibit (1) decreased social anxiety symptoms and report (2) increased levels of emotional disc losure, and (3) greater reductions 
of perceived loneliness compared to the  control group. 
 
3.0 Background* 
3.1 Safety behaviors are defined as be havioral strategies deemed 
necessary for preventing or minimizing a feared outcome. Theoretical models suggest that excessive use of safety behaviors 
may serve a casual and/or maintaining role among a range of psychopathology, including social anxiety disorder  (Well et al., 
1995), a disorder characterized by an  intense fear of being judged or 
negatively evaluated by others, or rejected in a social or 
performance situation.. While social  anxiety disorder causes both 
distressing and impairing symptoms , studies have begun to show a 
link between increased so cial anxiety and decreased self-disclosure, 
and resulting decreased feeli ngs of emotional intimacy. 
 Page 5 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020   
4.0 Study Endpoints* 
4.1 N/A 
 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent 
5.1 Description: Social anxiety safety behavior fading intervention 
procedures will follow methodology previously used in the Cougle Lab. The safety behavior fading inte rvention is designed to target a 
decrease or elimination of five soci al anxiety safety behaviors that 
an individual has self-identified that  they engage in most frequently 
and/or to the greatest extent.  
Individuals randomly assigned to the safety behavior fading 
condition will receive instructions to  decrease or eliminate their five 
social anxiety safety behaviors. In addition, they will receive daily 
reminders via text message to decrea se these behaviors, along with a 
safety behavior monitoring checkl ist in which the participant 
indicates the extent to which they decreased and/or eliminated each 
safety behavior over the previous  day. The daily reminder will 
include the following language: “Hi! This is a friendly reminder to avoid using your checklist behavio rs. Please tap the link below to 
access today’s checklist: [link to checklist].” 
Individuals randomly assigned to th e control condition will receive 
text messages to encourage fadi ng of “unhealthy behaviors”. They 
will follow the same procedure as the safety behavior fading group. 
  
6.0 Procedures Involved* 
6.1 Participants will be recruited through online postings. 
Once they sign up, all participants will be asked to provide informed 
consent before participating in th e current study. After consenting, 
the participant will complete the firs t battery of self-report measures. 
If the participant scores a 30 or lower on the SPIN, they will not be eligible to participate 
If they score a 30 or above on the SPIN and meet a ll eligibility 
criteria, participants will be r andomly assigned to one of two 
experimental conditions: Safety Beha vior (SB) Fading Condition or 
control condition. During this pr e-assessment virtual appointment, 
participants will complete a question naire battery assessing related 
symptoms and concerns, as well as safety behaviors. Participants in the SB fade condition will select five behaviors from their completed 
Safety Avoidance Frequency Exam ination (SAFE) that they engage 
in the most. They will be informed th at the researchers are interested 
 Page 6 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020  in the extent to which people can engage in these behaviors less than 
they normally do on a daily basis, for twoweeks. Participants in the “healthy behaviors” group will be told  they will be sent a checklist 
of healthy behaviors. 
Participants will also receive in structions regarding how to 
complete their daily safety behav ior monitoring checklist. They will 
receive 14 checklists via text over th e course of the nexttwo  weeks 
(assessment period).  Daily checkl ists will take roughly 5-minutes 
each.   
At the end of four weeks all participa nts will be sent a second set of 
questionnaires via email to complete. 
6.2 Screening:  Social Phobia Inventory (S PIN; Connor et al., 2000) 
Pre-assessment virtual appointment components: Component 1: Self-Report Assessmen ts – Participants will complete 
a battery of self-report measures that assess relev ant constructs.  
The questionnaires included are: 
1. Basic demographic information 2. SCID-II Personality Questionnaire: Avoidant Personality 
Disorder (AVPD) Items (American Psychiatric Association, 1986) 
3. Center for Epidemiologic St udies Depression Scale (CESD; 
Radloff, 1977) 
4. Self-Disclosure Index (S DI; Miller et al., 1983) 
5. Emotional Self-Disclosure Sc ale (ESDS; Snell et al., 1988) 
6. UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS; Hays & Dimatteo, 1987) 7. Subtle Avoidance Frequency Examination (SAFE; Cuming et al., 
2009) 
8.Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor et al., 2000) 
Component 2: Treatment rationale . Participants wil receive the 
following treatment rationale:  
Safety Behavior: Safety behaviors are be haviors we use to make us feel less 
anxious and prevent bad things from happeni ng. For example, when in a social 
situation, some people might hide their fa ces so others won’t see them blush, or 
they may seek reassurance from others about  things they said or how they look. 
Safety behaviors can be problematic bec ause when we use them, we are never 
able to see that the outcome we fear doesn ’t come true. We say to ourselves, “the 
reason nothing bad happened is because I got  reassurance from others, I spoke 
softly, I didn’t draw attention to myself… ” or used other safety behaviors. Safety 
behaviors can become a crutch and make you feel less confident in social 
situations. Research has found that dr opping safety behaviors can help reduce 
anxiety. 
 Page 7 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020   
Unhealthy Behaviors: Social anxiety like many other problems can keep us from 
taking care of ourselves. Engaging in unhe althy behaviors can make us feel even 
worse, and more anxious. For example, if people don’t sleep or eat enough, they might tend to be tired and f eel like they are less able to  handle their anxiety. This 
can create a cycle where we engage in unhealthy behaviors because of our anxiety and then that can make our anxiety worse and then engage in more unhealthy behaviors as a result. Also, spe nding too much time on social media or 
not moving around enough might lower your confidence and make it harder for 
you in social situations. Research ha s found that decreasing certain unhealthy 
behaviors can make you more confident and help improve mood and anxiety. 
They will then complete the Cred ibility/Expectancy Questionnaire 
(CEQ; Devilly & Borkovec, 2000). 
twp-week assessment period:  Component 3: Safety Behavior Checklist (completed daily) 
Post-treatment: 
Component 4: Self-Report Assessmen ts – Participants will complete 
a battery of self-report measures that assess relev ant constructs.  
This battery will include a ll items from Component 1. 
Component 7: Debriefing – All par ticipants will be informed of the 
actual, full study purpose. 
One month follow-up: Component 8: Self-Report Assessmen ts – Participants will complete 
a battery of self-report measures that assess relev ant constructs.  
This battery will include a ll items from Component 1 
6.3 The potential risks associated with participation in this study appear 
to be minimal (see below). Neverthele ss, precautions will be taken to 
minimize participants’ risk in the proposed study. All individuals will 
be informed of the nature of the investigation and the types of 
assessments and procedures. Partic ipants will asked to sign an 
informed consent statement prior to participating in the project. 
Several safeguards for maintaining participant confidentiality will 
also be in place (see below). In addition, referrals to appropriate 
clinical services (e.g. FSU Psychology Clinic) will be provided for any participants seeking treatment.  
7.0 Data and Specimen Banking* 
7.1 Data will be stored in de-identif ied databases in password protected 
files on encrypted computers.  
7.2 Results from questionnaires and surveys will be stored.  
7.3 Data will not be released. 
 Page 8 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020  8.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects* 
8.1 Individual results will not be shar ed with participants. Participants 
will be able to read resulting j ournal articles as they are published.  
9.0 Study Timelines* 
9.1 The total duration of an individual  subject’s participation in the 
study is 6 weeks. This will include an initial questionnaire battery , four week manipulation assessmen t period, and the post-treatment 
questionnaire’s and one month follow up. We predict that it will take 
roughly 12-18 months to enroll all study subjects. 
 
10.0 Subject Population* 
10.1 Adults aged 18-65 recruited from  across the United States  
10.2 Inclusion Criteria: The primary inclusion criteria for this study will 
be elevated social anxiety symptoms  as defined by a score of 30 or 
higher on the SPIN. The only soft ware/hardware requirements are 
that participants have access to a smartphone or computer that is 
connected to the internet.  
Exclusion Criteria: 1) Score of 29 or lower on the SPIN, 2) 
Currently receiving treatment (thera py, counseling, etc.) for anxiety 
or depression, 3) If applicable,  unstable psychia tric medication 
usage any time over the past 4 weeks.  
10.3 We will not include: Adults unable to consent, Individuals who are 
not yet adults (infants, childre n, teenagers), Pregnant women, or 
Prisoners. 
11.0 Vulnerable Populations* 
11.1 N/A 
 
12.0 Local Number of Subjects 
12.1 500 
13.0 Recruitment Methods 
13.1 Participants will be recruited from  across the United States through 
posting on internet websites such as Craigslist, Facebook, Reddit 
etc. Participants will be asked to sign consent before completing the 
SPIN and other screening questions. 
13.2 Participants will be recruited from across the United States. 
13.3 Participants who score at or above a 30 on the SPIN be invited to 
participate in the current study and provided with their questionnaire battery. 
 Page 9 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020  13.4 Potentially eligible par ticipants will be contacte d via email, with the 
initial questionnaire battery. 
13.5 Participants will be entered into  a raffle for 10 $20 Amazon gift 
cards when they complete the post treatment assessment and will receive an additional entry into th e raffle if they complete the one 
month follow up assessments. Raffles will occur at the end of 12 months of study enrollment. We an ticipate participants will have 1 in 
10 chance or greater of receiving a gift card. Participants email 
addresses will be retained until that ti me to deliver the gift cards. No 
other identifying information will  be retained for this purpose. 
 
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects* 
14.1 Participants will be withdrawn if there are circumstances that 
severely compromise the integrity of their data such as experimenter error, or if they do not meet eligibility criteria. 
14.2 Participants are allowed to withdraw  from participation in the study 
at any point, and data collection will stop at that point. Participants 
will be consults as to whether or not they want their data removed from the final dataset. 
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects* 
15.1 Risks to human subjects in the pr esent study are believed to be 
minimal. Nevertheless, precautions will be taken to minimize participants’ risk in the proposed  study. All individuals will be 
informed of the general nature of  the investigation and the types of 
assessments and procedures. Pa rticipants will be given an 
opportunity to have any questions an swered to their satisfaction and 
then will be asked to sign an in formed consent statement prior to 
participating in the project. The spec ific potential risks involved in 
the proposed investigation are enumerated below.  
There are two main areas of risk: 1) Self-report Measures: Some par ticipants may be hesitant to 
record their social anxiety and/or depressive symptoms on 
assessment forms. It is possible that  questionnaires relating to social 
anxiety, depression, and percei ved loneliness could lead to 
emotional discomfort for some participants. 
2) Confidentality: We will be  collecting information about the 
participant that could cause social and psychological risk if released 
inappropriately. 
The above areas of risk will be minimized by the following 
procedures: 
 Page 10 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020  1) Participants will be made aware that they are free to omit 
questions they feel uncomfortabl e answering and are free to 
terminate their participation at an y time during the study without 
penalty. While some participants may be hesitant to answer the 
assessment forms, others may deri ve benefit from the self-assessment 
as it could increase their awarene ss of the relationship between their 
symptoms and environmental, cognit ive, and interpersonal factors. 
Participants will be encouraged to contact study staff at any point during the study if they have questio ns or concerns. Referrals to 
appropriate clinical services (e.g., FSU Psychology Clinic, the 
Anxiety and Behavioral Health Clin ic) will be provided for any 
participants seeking treatment. All re search staff will be trained to 
deal with sensitive clinical issues and will be available during the assessment process should par ticipants need  assistance. 
2) Breach of confidentiality is highly unlikely. Researchers will 
emphasize that information obtained during the study is confidential 
and will be used solely by research  staff for research purposes. No 
data form will ever have a partici pant’s name on it. All records will 
be kept in locked files and secu re servers and it will only be 
available to the necessary research personnel who know about human participant protection guidelin es. A cross index of identity 
information will be kept in a se parate location. In addition, all data 
will contain only a codified Iden tification Code, all assessment 
procedures will be closely superv ised, and staff will be trained and 
reminded of the need to keep all information confidential. No names 
will be used in presenting the data in lectures, seminars, and papers. 
No individual responses will be reported in any publications.  Information will be released only with the written consent of the participant. Having all informa tion collected and handled by 
research staff trained to deal appr opriately with sensitive clinical 
issues will minimize potential risk of loss of confidentiality. All information will be treated as c onfidential material and will be 
available only to research and clinic al staff. The Key-file associating 
Identification Codes with identify ing information will be destroyed 
once data collection is complete. We have used this approach with 
hundreds of participants in th e past and have never had any 
problems with a breach of confidentiality.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects* 
16.1 A direct benefit to participants is th at they will be entered in a raffle 
for 10 $20 gift cards. We anticipat e participants will have 1 in 10 
chance or greater of receiving a gift card. 
Based on previous research, we ant icipate, the safety behavior 
fading group may benefit from th e study, as it is possible that 
reducing safety behaviors may resu lt in reductions in symptoms and 
an increase in emotional disclosure.  
 Page 11 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020   
17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality 
17.1 2 X 2 mixed model ANOVAs will be conducted to evaluate the effect 
of the manipulation on study variables of interest.  
17.2 Subjects’ names and email addresses will be recorded upon their 
consenting to participate and used to send participants reminders about appointments. Further, participants in the SB Fade group will receive daily emails/texts during th e two assessment weeks to remind 
them to complete their Behavior Checklist each day. However, no 
names or direct identifiers will be linked with the data collected over 
the course of the study. Each par ticipant will be assigned a unique, 
codified Identification Code that is unrelated to the participants’ 
identifying information. All question naires will be labeled using their 
codified Identification Code. The K ey-file associating Identification 
Codes with participant names, email addresses, and phone numbers 
will be kept by the principal investigator separate from all other study data and consent forms in a secured file. Email addresses are 
needed in order to send links to and reminders for the online appointments. Phone numbers are needed in order to send daily text message reminders to participants in  the SB Fade condition. If an 
individual is unable or unwilling to supply their phone number, daily 
reminders will be sent to their em ail address. All study data will be 
stored in de-identified databases in password protected files on encrypted computers.  
No individual will ever be publicly  identified. We will only report 
results that have been averaged ov er participants. No records or 
assessment information will be re leased to any other person. All 
identifying information will be deleted after data collection is 
complete.  
Participants will be informed that there are certain situations in 
which we may break confidentiality . If during the study we learn 
about child neglect, child or elder a buse, or that someone is a clear, 
serious, and direct harm to self  or others, we may report the 
information to appropriate authorit ies, including the police or an 
emergency medical facilit y. Such a possibility is  therefore explicitly 
stated in the consent document.  All data and paperwork will be 
protected to the extent  provided by law. 
 
18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*  
 NA 
 
 Page 12 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020  19.0 Provisions to Protect the Pr ivacy Interests of Subjects 
19.1 To facilitate privacy,  participants will be in formed that they can 
decline to answer any questions they do not wish to. 
Participants will not have access to  responses to any questionnaire 
from any other participants, nor will future participants have access 
to the current partici pant’s responses.   
19.2 Participants are explained the limits  of confidentiality and are told 
they do not have to answer any que stions they do not want to.  
19.3 The aforementioned Key-file will contain identifying information 
(e.g., subject name, contact inform ation) and study Identification 
Code numbers. This list will be ke pt separate from all other study 
data and will be password protecte d. Only study personnel will be 
given the password to this Key-file by the PI. All other data will contain Identification Code  numbers only—no identifying 
information will be listed on any other data.  
20.0 Compensation for Rese arch-Related Injury 
20.1 We do not anticipate any risk of research related injury to our 
participants. 
20.2 NA 
21.0 Economic Burden to Subjects 
21.1 We do not anticipate that participation in our study will cause any 
economic burden to our participants. 
22.0 Consent Process 
22.1 The participant will be given the opportunity to read through the 
consent form and give signed informed consent if they agree to participate.  No data will be collected before consent is obtained. 
23.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing 
23.1 We will follow “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-
091).”  
24.0 Setting 
24.1 Participation will involve completion of questionnaires and computer 
tasks on their personal computer.  
25.0 Resources Available 
25.1 Costs of research are estimated to be minimal and will be covered by 
funds from the Cougle Lab. 
 Page 13 of 13  Revised: June 11, 2020   The research group has had success in the past recruiting 
student populations for online and in person studies including 
intervention studies.  
 The researchers will have access to the research group lab 
space located on the Florida St ate University Campus, which 
will provide the necessa ry staff, equipment, and materials.  
 All research personnel will complete the required Human 
Subjects Training and will be asked to demonstrate competence with the procedures per the st andards of the study prior to 
their involvement. They will re ceive supervision and training 
from the graduate student ove rseeing the project regarding the 
study protocol, procedures, and their duties. All study personnel will also be trained to deal with sensitive clinical issues and will be available during the assessment process should participants need assistance.

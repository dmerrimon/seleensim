BACKGROUND:    
Recently, the opioid epidemic has been the center of focus for healthcare providers and 
governmental agenc ies due to rising rates of opioid abuse, opioid -related fatalities, and overall 
economic burden of treating the opioid epidemic.  The prescribing patterns of opioid pain 
medications have fallen under scrutiny and healthcare providers have sought alternativ e pain 
management strategies that have limited opioid  pain medication use.  As orthopaedic surgeons 
account for 7.7% of all dispensed opioid prescriptions within the United States, surgeons have 
investigated multimodal pain management strategies to assess effectiveness in controlling 
postoperative pain as well as limiting opioid use and opioid related complications.  Currently, 
there remains no clear consensus on the ideal pain management strategy following shoulder 
arthroplasty and the vast majority of strategies are based on opiate -driven protocols.  We are  
investigat ing the effectiveness of a n opiate sparing  protocol following shoulder arthroplasty on 
2 week postoperative pain scores  and 12 week opiate consumption .  We will also collect pain 
scores,  patient satisfaction,  and complications, reoperations, and readmissions during the 12 
week episode -of-care.  We are confident in the safety and effectiveness of an opiate sparing, 
multimodal pain management protocol in properly selected patients u ndergoin g shoulder 
arthroplasty1. Continuous circulating flow cryotherapy is expected to be advantageous as part 
of our multimodal protocol for  demonstrating better outcomes and significantly lower pain 
scores as compared to standard c old therapy2,3.  Additionally  we anticipate patients 
randomized to continuous circulating flow cryotherapy multimodal opioid protocol to use a 
significantly lower number of opioids4.  
 
The protection of our patient’s safety and welfare has prompted this investigation.  We believe 
that minimizing a patient’s exposure to opiates can help prevent respiratory depression, 
nausea, vomiting, constipation, and most significantly, opiate addiction.    
 
PURPOSE:  
To investigate the difference in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores between two protocols 
following shoulder arthroplasty at the 2 week postoperative time point.  The differences 
between opioid consumption, postoperative pain scores,  patient satisfaction, and episode -of-
care factors (reoperations, readmission, and complications)  will be evaluated at the 12 week 
(90-day) postoperative time point. The two protocols are:  
 
Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial of An Opiate Sparing Protocol Versus Standard 
Opiate -Based Protocol Following Shoulder Arthroplasty  
 
Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 2 Group 1  (opiate sparing protocol) -a multimodal  postoperative opiate sparing  pain 
management protocol including continuous circulating flow cryotherapy versus  
 
Group 2 (opiate -based protocol) -a standard postoperative opiate -based pain management 
protocol including standard cold therapy . 
 
HYPOTHESIS:  
A multimodal postoperative opiate sparing pain management protocol including continuous 
circulating flow cryotherapy (Group 1) will be non-inferior  in the 2 week  postoperative  VAS pain 
scores  using a non -inferiority margin of 2, as compared to a standard p ostoperative opiate -
based pain management protocol including standard cold therapy (Group 2).   
 
STUDY DESIGN /DURATION :   
This is a single center, investigator initiated, p rospective, randomized, controlled trial  
conducted among subjects who have given volu ntary consent to participate.  Participation will 
last until the completion of the 12  week standard of care follow up visit.  The entire study will 
last for 2 years . Randomization will occur following signing of the informed consent document.  
No parties i nvolved in the study will be blinded to randomization assignment.  
 
STUDY SETTING:  
Preoperative and postoperative office visits will be conducted at Campbell Clinic Collierville 
(1458 W. Poplar Ave., Ste. 100, Collierville, TN  38017) or Germantown Office ( 1400 S. 
Germantown Rd., Germantown, TN  38138).  Perioperative care will be conducted at Baptist 
Memorial Hospital -Collierville (1500 W. Poplar Ave., Collierville, TN  38017 ). 
 
SAMPLE SIZE:    
76 subjects  with 1:1 randomization  (38 in opiate sparing and 38  in opiate -based)  to account for 
a 20% lost to follow -up.  Group sample sizes of 31 will achieve minimum 80% power to detect a 
one-sided non -inferiority margin of 2 on the VAS scale, where the true difference is assumed to 
be 0, the significance level (alp ha) is set at 5%, and data are drawn from populations with 
standard deviations of 3. The standard deviations of 3 and non -inferiority margin of 2 were  
derived from the Hattrup article that compared liposomal bupivacaine nerve block to standard 
bupivacaine.5 Power was determined using PASS 2008 software version 08.0.6.  Because 
postoperative VAS pain scores reported in the literature vary greatly, if a difference in VAS pain 
scores is observed, then a superiority test comparing the two groups will be allowed  to be 
conducted per The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Evaluation of 
Medicines for Human Use.6 
 
PRIMARY OUTCOME:  
Primary outcome measure will be VAS pain sc ale at 2 weeks  where the opiate sparing group 
pain is expected to be no w orse than the standard opiate -based  group using a non -inferiority 
margin of 2 points . VAS pain scale ranges from 0 -10 with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating most 
intense pain.

Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 3  
SECONDARY OUTCOME:  
The secondary outcome measure will be Oral Morphine Equivalents (OME) which will be 
collected  in hospital on day of surgery,  POD #1 -7 via home diary, and 2 week, 6 week, and 12 
week at in-office visits. Because this is an important outcome, a power analysis was conducted 
to ascertain if the  minimal planned  sample size of 38 subjects in each group w ould be sufficient  
to conduct a superiority analysis comparing OME between the two groups.  Using the observed 
24-hour median difference of 16mg OME observed between the acetaminophen+ibuprofen 
(median=20mg) and ac etaminophen only (median=36mg) group s in the Thybo paper7, along 
with the provided standard deviations of 20mg, a sample size of 26 in each group will achieve 
minimum 80% power using an a lpha of 5%.  Therefore, this secondary endpoint s hould be 
adequately p owered with the planned sample size of 38 subject s in each group.

Version 1. 4 dated January 28 , 2021  Page 7 BENEFITS:  
There are no promises of benefits to taking part in this research.  However, it is possible that 
postoperative pain can be controlled with minimal or no opiate use.  
 
RISKS:  
Randomization will expose the subjects to the specific risk associated with either of the 
medication  regimens laid out in this  protocol.  All medications included in the protocol are 
approved by the Federal Drug Administration ( FDA).  The most common side effects of each 
medication (and the continuous circulating flow cryotherapy if applicable) will be 
communicated in the informed consent document.  
 
There is a rare risk of bowel perforation resulting from constipation with opioid use .  This 
information has been added to the ICF and a bowel regimen was prescribed with discharge 
medications.  
 
A subject may experience uncomfortable or troublesome feelings in conjunction with 
completion of the home diary . 
 
Loss of confidentiality is a pot ential risk.   
 
RISK MINIMIZATION PLAN:  
1. Subject selection based upon inclusion/exclusion criteria to safeguard enrollment of 
medically cleared patients.  
2. A detailed disclosure of the  side effects of each medication is communicated to the 
Subject in the cons ent form.  
3. Emergency contact with a Campbell Clinic Physician 24 hour/7 day through answering 
service.  
4. If a Subject does not achieve adequate pain control per self -reported VAS, additional 
opiate  medications will be prescribed, regardless of randomization a ssignment , to 
protect the welfare of the Subject.  These additional opiates will be included in data 
analysis .  
5. If a subject randomized to the opiate sparing group consumes all of the prescribed 
opiate pills in the first fourteen (14) days following surger y, the subject will be grouped 
into the opiate -based group for analysis of VAS score.  
6. The information requested in the home diary is the minimum required to evaluate study 
outcomes.  
7. All paper and electronic research records are securely stored and accessib le only to 
study personnel.  
SUBECT STIPENDS:  
Subjects will receive a $25 pre -paid card at completion of the 2 week office visit and a $50 pre -
paid card at completion of the 12 week office visit.  These two stipends are to offset any

studies conducted at Campbell Clinic.  
  
 
PROTECTION OF PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI):  
Multiple layers of security will be in place to insure protection of confidential information.  All 
paper records will  be locked in the Research Office at Campbell Clinic.  Electronic records will be 
stored within the Campbell Clinic secure server.  Only authorized study team members will have 
access to paper and/or electronic study records.  
 
OPERATIONAL  OVERSIGHT/SAFETY MONITORING:  
All adverse events will be monitored by the Principal Investigator and reported accordingly to 
the IRB at Baptist Memorial Hospital.  Appropriate treatment will be give n to protect the rights 
and welfare of all subjects.  
 
PREM ATURE WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS:  
A subject may withdraw his/her consent through a verbal request or by sending a letter to the 
Principal Investigator.  This information is included in the informed consent document.  
Participation is voluntary.  Early withdraw al from the study does not result in a  loss of rights or 
privileges.  
 
A subject may  be withdrawn by the study team without his/her consent if he/she does not 
show up for visits or does not follow the physician’s instruction.

STATI STICAL ANALYSIS:  
Statistical methodology will consist of summarizing collected data descriptively using 
percentages (numerator/denominator) for categorical outcomes, and means, medians, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum  for continuous variables  over the 12  week peri od 
of interest.  Return to function using established outcome assessment tools will be used to 
compare the two groups using parametric or nonparametric methods, as appropriate .

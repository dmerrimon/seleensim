1. Methods  
a) Pre-rinsing of Dialyzers  
Setting up and preparation of the dialyzer s will be performed per the clinic’s normal 
procedure. This involves a pre -rinsing step before the start of dialysis. . The priming 
solution will not be infused to the patient. Dialysate flow rate is to be initiated at the 
beginning of the rinsing procedure.  All the dialyzers will be pre -rinsed in the same 
procedure.  
b) Heparinization  
The usual heparin type and dosage normally used for each individual patient, including  
the administration reg ime (bolus injection and continuous infusion) , will be maintained

 Page 5 
 for each patient  unless specified otherwise by the investigator/physician during the 
evaluation . The total amount of heparin given per treatment will be documented.  
   c) Blood Flow / Dialys ate Flow  
Hemodialysis: Blood and dialysate flow rates should be between QB= 300 - 500 ml/min 
and QD= 2 times QB but should follow existing flow rates for the patient, based on clinic 
procedure.  Blood flow and dialysate flow should remain unchanged for all patients for the 
duration of dialysis and throughout the evaluation. The ultrafiltration rate, appropriate for 
each patient and treatment will be maintained and recorded. The blood flow will al so be 
determined in the fistula using a Doppler flow device.  
   d) Dialysis Regime and Number of Applied Dialyzer s 
Three consecutive treatments will be performed with each dialyzer type. Blood sampling 
for measurements will be taken as shown in appendix . 
   e) Performance and Hemocompatibility Parameters to be measured   
Please refer to Appendix.  
 
   f) Blood Sampling  
Blood will be collected pre -, during and post -dialysis at appropriat e time intervals (see 
Appendix ) for the evaluation of:  
1. Clearance of urea, creatinine, phosphate , beta -2-microglobulin, myoglobin at 
60 min. Five minutes b efore the collection the flow rate will be adjusted  so that 
at time of collection, QB= 350 mL/min, QD=  700 mL/min  and UF= 0 for all  
patient s. Blood is to be collected from venous side first followed by arterial  
side. 
2. Removal Rate for urea, creatinine, phosphate , beta-2-m and myoglobin at 0 
min and 240 min  will be calculated.  
3. Hemocompatibility  
(a) Blood cell count (white blood cell and platelet counts).  
(b) Hb / Hct . 
(c) C5a (activation of complement)  
(d) Thrombin -Antithrombin Complex (TAT)

 The samples  will be collected after confirming  that the blood and dialysate flows are at 
the targeted rates  listed above , venous and arterial pressure at point of collection  are to 
be recorded as well.  For blood volumes see appendix B.  
   g) Visual estimation of th e amount of clotted capillaries  
After dialysis removal of the residual blood is performed by means of ultrafiltration with 
reverse osmosis water from dialysate comp artment to blood compartment (0.5 -1 bar 
water pressure and the overall appearance of dialyzer will be photographed, with focus 
on the clotted fibers and any residual header blood . This will be carried out at the end of 
each treatment for each dialyzer  (3 times each  dialyzer) . The number of clotted 
capillaries in the dialyzer are counted  after removal of the plastic casing and classified by 
the following table . 
  
 Number of clotted fibers  
 0 – 10 11 – 20 21 – 50 51 – 100 >100  
Score  1 2 3 4 5 
 
2. Data Collection  
All data, including blood flow rates, dialysate composition, heparin schedule (i.e. 
concentration in the pre -rinsing solution, bolus and infusion rates, all medications given to 
or taken by the patient, and standard dialysis symptom/events seen routinely in dialysis 
patients will be recorded in the case report form. The patients’ records will contain the 
patients’ names, dates of birth, patients' ESRD diagnosis, and duration of treatment on 
dialysis.  Data will be entered into a locked dataset on a locked computer in the Nephrology 
Research Laboratory. Data will be analyzed in house with the exception of digital analysis 
of the photos taken of the dialyzers when dialysis is completed which will be done by the 
sponsor who will be blind to source of the photos. At this time it is not anticipated that any 
individual data, only aggregate  results will be sent to the sponsor but if any individual data 
is sent to the sponsor will be blinded. All data will be stored by the Division of Nephrology in 
the Neph rology Research Laboratory for the designated time period and then destroyed.  
 
8. Patient Informed Co nsent Form  
The investigation has the character of a clinical study  according to the US requirements  
and with reference to the European Standard ISO 14155 and the Declaration of Helsinki .  
All patients must be  informed about the aim of the study, the risks, and rights and have  to 
sign a consent form.

1) The goal of the protocol is to maintain  Hgb at 11 -12 g/dl. Erythropoietin doses are to 
be based upon the estimated dry weight.  
2) The protocol will change the erythropoietin dose no more often than every 4 weeks 
except in the following cases:  
a. Discontinue erythropoietin when Hgb is greater than 13 g/dl . 
b. Increase the erythropoietin dose when Hgb is less than 11 g/dl and the 
previous dose change was a reduction in erythropoietin.  
c. Decrease erythropoietin dose based upon rules 8g -8i when Hgb is between 
12-13 g/dl.  
d. Increase erythropoietin according to rule 8 a when Hgb decreased from above 
10 g/dl to below 10 g/dl.  
3) If Hgb is greater than 13 g/dl then discontinue erythropoietin and check Hgb weekly. 
Resume erythropoietin at 25% less than the previous dose as soon as the Hgb is below 
12.5 g/dl. If Hgb remains hi gher than 12.5 g/dl for more than three months return to 
the clinic’s policy of testing Hgb.  
4) For established patients who have had not had an erythropoietin within the last 3 
months and have a Hgb <11 g/dl start erythropoietin at 300 units/kg/week; for a H gb 
of 11 -11.9 start erythropoietin at 150 units/kg/week.  
5) For new patients without erythropoietin orders who have a Hgb <11 g/dl start 
erythropoietin 300 units/kg/week; for a Hgb of 11 -11.9 start erythropoietin at 150 
units/kg/week; for those with a Hgb > 1 1.9 g/dl do not start erythropoietin.  
6) The weekly doses described in number 4 and 5 above will be equally divided into IV 
dosing for each HD treatment and will be given SQ as a single weekly dose for PD 
patients.  
7) Increase erythropoietin dose by protocol no higher than 900 units/kg/week or 400,000 
units per month.  
8) For patients who have an erythropoietin (EPO) order and the order was not changed 
within the last 4 weeks or cases described in Number 2 above:  
a. If Hgb  < 10 g/dl then increase EPO 50% but not less than 300 unites/kg/week.

 b. If Hgb is between 10 -10.9 then increase EPO 25% but not less than 75 
units/kg/week.  
c. If Hgb is between 11 -11.9 and Hgb has decreased 0.5 g/dl or more since last 
dose change then increase  EPO 10%.  
d. If Hgb is between 11 -11.9 and Hgb has increased/decreased 0.5 g/dl since last 
dose change then do not change EOP dose.  
e. If Hgb is between 11 -11.7 and Hgb increased0.5 g/dl or more since last dose 
change then do not change EPO dose.  
f. If Hgb is betwe en 11.8 -11.9 and Hgb increased 0.5 g/dl since last dose then 
decrease EPO dose by 10%.  
g. If Hgb is between 12 -12.4 g/dl and Hgb decreased 0.5 g/dl or more since last 
dose change do not change EPO dose and check Hgb in 2 weeks.  
h. If Hgb is between 12 -12.4 and H gb increased/decreased less than 0.5 g/dl since 
last dose change then decrease EPO 10% and check Hgb in 2 weeks.  
i. If Hgb is between 12 -12.4 g/dl and increased 0.5 g/dl or more since last dose 
change then decrease EPO 25% and check Hgb in 2 weeks.  
j. If Hgb is between  12.5 -13 g/dl and Hgb decreased 0.5 g/dl or more since last 
dose change then decrease EPO 10% and check Hgb in two weeks.  
k. If Hgb is between 12.5 -13 g/dl and Hgb increased/decreased less than 0.5 g/dl 
since last dose change then decrease EPO 25% and  check Hgb in 2 weeks.

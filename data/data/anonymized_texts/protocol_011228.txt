1.1
Lay
Summar y
Public
health
professionals
think
that
COVID-19
vaccination
is
the
most
promising
solution
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
Vaccination
can
only
be
successful
if
a
large
number
of
people
get
vaccinated.
Some
people
are
not
sure
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
Some
have
used
the
term
‘vaccine
hesitancy’
to
describe
this
uncertainty.
People
are
hesitant
to
get
vaccinated
for
many
reasons.
Some
people
worry
that
scientists
developed
the
COVID-19
vaccines
too
quickly.
Other
people
worry
there
are
not
many
research
studies
on
the
safety
of
the
COVID-19
vaccine.
Information
on
the
internet
is
often
of
poor
quality,
or
misleading.
There
are
also
some
people
that
are
actively
spreading
misinformation
about
the
vaccine.
As
a
result,
many
have
false
beliefs
and
mistrust
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
Some
groups
in
the
U.S.
have
higher
rates
of
vaccine
hesitancy.
This
includes
a
group
of
healthcare
professionals
who
work
in
places
like
nursing
homes,
usually
called
long-term
care
workers
(LTCWs).
Many
LTCWs
do
not
want
or
plan
to
get
vaccinated.
LTCWs
are
an
important
group
to
target
because
they
serve
a
high-risk,
elderly
population.
They
have
a
higher
risk
of
passing
the
virus
on
to
others.
LTCWs
are
among
the
lowest
paid
workers
in
the
US.
They
come
from
diverse
communities,
including
those
that
have
experienced
high
rates
of
infection,
illness
and
death
from
COVID-19.
There
are
policy
mandates
that
were
developed
in
2021
requiring
LTCWs
to
get
vaccinated,
which
may
increase
vaccine
rates.
The
mandates
may
also
cause
some
LTCWs
to
leave
their
jobs
or
be
unhappy
if
they
did
not
want
the
vaccine.
It
is
therefore
important
to
increase
LTCWs
confidence
in
the
COVID-19
vaccines
for
their
own
protection
and
wellbeing.
It
is
not
clear
how
best
to
do
this.
In
this
trial,
we
will
study
LTCWs
from
nursing
home
and
residential
care
settings,
who
are
typically
certified
nurse
assistants
and
residential
care
assistants.
We
plan
to
compare
two
promising
methods
to
increase
confidence
in
COVID-19
vaccines.
One
method
is
a
live
webinar,
which
is
a
meeting
that
happens
online
using
a
video-conference
platform.
In
this
meeting,
we
will
ask
LTCWs
to
look
at
information
about
the
COVID-19
vaccine,
talk
about
concerns,
and
ask
questions
that
they
may
have.
The
webinar
will
be
led
by
another
LTCW.
Questions
will
be
answered
by
a
medical
doctor
who
has
experience
addressing
LTCW
concerns
about
the
COVID-19
vaccine.
The
other
method
is
a
website
that
will
contain
posts
derived
from
social
media
platforms,
such
as
Facebook,
YouTube,
Instagram,
and
Tik
Tok.
The
posts
will
be
short
video
messages
and
other
content
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
Posts
will
be
about
common
questions
and
concerns
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
The
posts
will
come
from
people
who
are
popular
on
social
media
and
will
include
content
from
other
LTCWs.
LTCWs
in
our
study
will
look
at
and
reply
to
the
posts
using
likes
and
comments.
We
will
invite
adult
LTCWs
to
participate
in
the
study
who
have
concerns
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
or
who
have
not
received
a
booster
vaccine.
We
will
not
include
people
who
are
pregnant
or
breastfeeding.
We
will
advertise
the
study
to
LTCWs
using
email
lists,
social
media,
and
professional
networks
that
include
LTCWs.
5
We
will
compare
the
live
webinar
and
social
media
website
methods
to
other
information
that
people
would
usually
get
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
We
will
place
people
in
one
of
these
three
groups
(the
live
webinar
group,
the
social
media
website
group,
or
the
usual
information
group)
based
on
chance.
We
will
compare
peoples’
level
of
confidence
in
the
vaccine
across
these
groups.
To
better
understand
how
the
social
media
website
and
live
webinars
might
influence
people,
we
will
also
measure
how
informed
people
feel
about
the
vaccines,
what
they
believe
about
the
vaccines,
and
their
trust
in
information
about
the
vaccines
given
by
different
people
and
groups.
We
will
collect
this
information
using
online
surveys.
We
will
give
the
first
survey
to
participants
when
they
join
the
study.
Then,
we
will
invite
them
to
join
the
live
webinar,
use
the
social
media
website,
or
access
the
usual
information
website
(CDC
website).
Lastly,
they
will
get
three
more
surveys,
3
weeks,
3
months
and
6
months
after
joining
the
study.
This
study
will
tell
us
how
to
help
people
become
more
confident
in
COVID-19
vaccines.
This
may
be
especially
helpful
for
people
who
rely
on
information
that
is
out
of
date
or
wrong.
1.2
Scientiﬁc
Abstr act
Background
and
Significance:
Vaccination
programs
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
COVID-19
as
well
as
serious
illness
and
mortality
associated
with
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
However,
success
depends
on
widespread
vaccine
confidence
and
uptake.
The
speed
of
vaccine
development
and
limited
research
data
on
both
efficacy
and
adverse
effects
have
caused
concerns.
Misinformation
and
disinformation
have
eroded
confidence
in
the
vaccine,
causing
hesitancy
and
reduced
uptake.
Long
term
care
workers
(LTCWs)
report
substantial
vaccine
hesitancy.
Unvaccinated
LTCWs
pose
a
risk
of
transmission
to
vulnerable
long-term
care
residents.
Further,
over
50%
of
LTCWs
are
from
minority
and
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
groups,
and
may
be
more
vulnerable
to
severe
disease
if
they
become
infected.
While
vaccine
mandates
have
recently
been
announced
for
workers
in
long-term
care
facilities,
mandates
also
have
the
potential
consequence
of
job
losses,
workplace
shortages,
and
reduced
LTCW
wellbeing.
It
is
therefore
important
to
increase
LTCWs’
confidence
in
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
In
this
trial
we
will
recruit
LTCWs
in
nursing
and
residential
care
settings.
Objectives:
Working
with
our
stakeholders,
we
chose
the
following
research
questions:
1.
What
is
the
comparative
impact
of
two
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
(primary
outcome)
and
influence
secondary
outcomes,
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
in
LTCWs?
2.
What
is
the
most
effective
intervention
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
among
different
subgroups
of
LTCWs,
including
those
who
experience
different
levels
of
health
disparities?
3.
What
are
the
delivery
characteristics,
contexts,
and
processes
needed
to
sustain
and
scale
up
the
implementation
of
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
among
LTCWs?
6
Design
&
Population:
We
will
conduct
a
three-arm
online
randomized
controlled
trial,
with
randomization
at
the
LTCW
level.
We
will
use
an
effectiveness-implementation
hybrid
design
(type
2),
guided
by
relevant
domains
of
the
Consolidated
Framework
for
Implementation
Research
(CFIR).
We
will
partner
with
the
National
Association
of
Health
Care
Assistants
(NAHCA)
to
recruit
1800
LTCWs.
Eligible
LTCWs
will
self-identify
as:
1)
being
at
least
18
years
old,
2)
living
in
the
United
States,
3)
having
worked
in
a
long-term
care
setting
in
the
past
two
years,
4)
able
to
verify
their
LTCW
status,
5)
not
currently
be
pregnant
or
breastfeeding,
and
6)
able
to
read,
write,
and
understand
English,
and
7)
being
at
least
somewhat
worried
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
and/or
not
having
received
any
COVID-19
booster
vaccine.
Contingent
on
study
results,
in
the
sustainability
phase
(see
Figure
3),
we
will
open
the
materials
to
other
LTCWs.
Interventions:
We
selected
two
interactive
interventions
with
our
stakeholder
partners,
based
on
provisional
evidence
of
their
effectiveness
and
Peretti-Watel’s
vaccine
hesitancy
framework.
Interventions
will
be
co-designed
and
adapted
with
LTCWs
and
the
Institute
for
Healthcare
Improvement
(IHI)
co-investigators.
We
will
include
an
enhanced
usual
practice
arm.
Arm
1:
Dialogue-Based
Webinars
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
attend
virtual
dialogue-based
webinars
in
groups
of
20.
An
existing
COVID-19
conversation
aid
(English
version)
will
be
available
to
all
participants.
Each
webinar
will
be
co-facilitated
by
a
LTCW
and
physician
expert,
and
assisted
by
a
communication
expert.
Arm
2:
Social
Media
Website
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
be
invited
to
visit
a
curated
COVID-19
social
media
website,
co-designed
with
LTCWs
and
NAHCA.
The
site
will
be
interactive,
dynamic,
and
have
multi-component
content
derived
from
LTCW-nominated
platforms,
e.g.,
Facebook,
YouTube,
etc.
It
will
address
frequent
concerns
and
topics
that
are
deemed
relevant
by
LTCWs.
Arm
3:
Enhanced
Usual
Practice
Six
hundred
LTCWs
will
be
directed
to
visit
the
COVID-19
vaccine
information
on
the
CDC
website.
Outcomes:
Our
primary
outcome
is
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
as
assessed
by
the
Vaccine
Confidence
Index,
which
measures
confidence
in
vaccine
safety,
efficacy,
and
importance.
Our
secondary
outcomes
include
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(any
dose,
initial
series
completion,
booster
completion),
an
adapted
Net
Promoter
Score
(likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
vaccination
and
booster
vaccination),
initial
vaccine,
booster,
and
future
vaccine
intent,
feeling
informed
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines,
identification
of
COVID-19
vaccine
information
and
misinformation,
and
trust
in
COVID-19
vaccine
information
provided
by
different
people
and
organizations.
Exploratory
outcomes
will
include
identifying
external
factors
that
may
contribute
to
vaccine
decisions
and
contextual
factors
experienced
before
and
during
the
study
period
that
relate
to
COVID-19.
We
will
also
collect
demographic
information
in
the
baseline
survey,
7
including
age,
race,
ethnicity,
gender,
zip
code,
duration
of
experience
in
long-term
care,
educational
attainment,
health
literacy,
COVID-19
vaccine
status,
perceived
influence
of
others,
and
religiosity.
Our
primary,
secondary,
and
exploratory
outcomes
will
be
collected
by
online
surveys
at
baseline
(T0),
3
weeks
post
baseline
(T1),
3
months
post
baseline
(T2),
and
6
months
post
baseline
(T3).

Backgr ound
and
Rationale
3 . 1 . 1
B a c k g r o u n d
The
COVID-19
pandemic
has
been
aﬀecting
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
worldwide
for
nearly
two
years.
Despite
the
emergence
of
new
variants,
vaccination
programs
continue
to
show
the
most
promise
at
mitigating
the
severity
of
illness
and
mortality
caused
by
the
virus
1
.
However,
vaccination
success
depends
on
widespread
uptake.
Because
of
increased
virulence
in
the
most
recent
wave
and
some
loss
of
protection
as
the
virus
mutates,
coverage
rates
need
to
exceed
90%
2
to
minimize
the
risk
of
outbreaks
of
current
SARS-CoV-2
variants.
The
unprecedented
speed
at
which
new
vaccines
were
developed
and
the
use
of
the
mRNA
technology
have
raised
public
concerns
about
safety
3
.
While
hesitancy
about
vaccines
existed
before
this
pandemic,
such
concerns
have
been
accentuated
by
the
lack
of
prior
data
about
COVID-19
vaccines
and
limited
follow-up
data
4
.
Additionally,
political
and
ideological
allegiances
have
reinforced
certain
objections
and
resistance
to
vaccination
5
.
Given
that
the
internet
has
become
a
prominent
source
of
information
for
many
people,
it
has
also
been
diﬃcult
to
limit
the
rapid
spread
of
misinformation
or
disinformation
while
promoting
evidence-based
information
6
.
Misinformation
about
the
virus
and
the
COVID-19
vaccine
are
a
major
threat
to
conﬁdence
in
the
importance,
safety,
and
eﬀectiveness
of
vaccines,
which
reinforce
mistrust,
and
lead
to
vaccine
hesitancy
7–11
.
Some
subgroups
of
the
US
population,
including
long-term
care
workers
(LTCWs),
have
higher
rates
of
COVID-19
vaccine
hesitancy
5
.
LTCWs
include
people
who
work
in
long-term
care
facilities
or
home-based
care,
and
include
roles
such
as
certiﬁed
nurse
assistants,
residential
care
assistants
and
non-clinical
support.
Although
long-term
care
facilities
have
been
epicenters
of
COVID-19
outbreaks,
warranting
widespread
vaccination,
there
is
reported
low
vaccination
coverage
among
LTCWs
12,13
.
LTCWs
usually
serve
those
most
vulnerable
to
serious
complications
of
COVID-19
14
.
LTCWs
are
also
likely
to
be
more
vulnerable
to
complications
of
COVID-19
themselves.
More
than
50%
of
LTCWs
are
from
minority
and
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
groups,
often
working
multiple
jobs
15,16
.
Given
the
vulnerability
of
the
populations
they
serve,
the
possibility
of
transmission
in
their
local
communities,
and
their
own
increased
risk
of
COVID-19
morbidity/mortality,
it
is
important
to
increase
COVID-19
uptake
among
LTCWs.
In
August
2021,
the
US
Federal
Government
announced
its
intent
to
impose
a
mandate
that
LTCWs
be
vaccinated
in
order
to
be
eligible
to
work.
This
mandate
has
now
been
expanded
to
include
employees
in
all
health
facilities
that
receive
federal
funding.
The
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
(CMS),
working
with
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
11
(CDC),
will
be
responsible
for
imposing
the
broad
mandate
and
planned
to
release
an
interim
rule
in
October
2021.
While
vaccine
mandates
have
clear,
positive
implications
for
reducing
COVID-19
spread
and
disease
severity,
other
potential
consequences
should
not
be
overlooked.
At
the
forefront
are
job
losses
and
workforce
shortages
if
workers
do
not
adhere
to
mandates,
and
reduced
workplace
trust
and
increased
vaccine
hesitancy
17
.
The
likely
legal
challenges
and
conﬂict
created
between
management
and
employees
may
also
have
a
damaging
impact
on
relationships
at
work
and
the
wellbeing
of
long-term
care
workers.
These
consequences
highlight
the
importance
of
eﬀorts
to
increase
conﬁdence
in
the
COVID-19
vaccines,
so
decisions
to
vaccinate
are
made
willingly.
Increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence
will
also
help
alleviate
the
concerns
of
those
already
vaccinated,
but
still
hesitant
to
follow
future
vaccination
recommendations.
Evidence
for
vaccine
conﬁdence
in
LTCWs
is
limited;
a
cross-sectional
study
in
Italy
of
LTCWs
found
vaccine
conﬁdence
correlated
with
inﬂuenza
vaccine
uptake
18
.
In
a
global
survey,
conﬁdence
in
the
importance
of
vaccines
had
the
strongest
association
with
vaccine
uptake
compared
to
other
factors
11
.
For
people
who
have
been
partially
or
fully
vaccinated,
increasing
conﬁdence
in
the
importance
of
the
vaccine
will
also
be
vital
for
future
uptake,
adherence
to
vaccination
protocols,
and
the
acceptance
of
scheduled
boosters.
3 . 1 . 2
R a t i o n a l e
The
best
strategy
for
increasing
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
among
LTCWs
remains
unclear.
As
demonstrated
by
multiple
reviews
(and
an
overview
of
existing
reviews)
19–21
,
addressing
vaccine
hesitancy
is
a
complex
task,
and
there
is
no
strong
evidence
supporting
any
one
single
intervention.
Nevertheless,
there
is
some
emerging
evidence
that
identiﬁes
the
features
of
the
interventions
that
are
most
likely
to
be
eﬀective.
For
example,
Jarrett
et
al.
suggest
that
multi-component,
dialogue-based
interventions
targeting
speciﬁc
unvaccinated
and
vaccine-hesitant
populations
were
most
eﬀective
22
.
Other
evidence
indicates
that
social
media
interventions
can
improve
attitudes
towards
vaccines
and
increase
uptake
23–25
.
Lastly,
shared
decision-making
(SDM)
interventions
that
involve
patients
and
healthcare
providers
sharing
information
and
making
vaccine
decisions
collaboratively
have
also
been
shown
to
improve
vaccine
uptake
26,27
.
Thus,
in
this
study,
we
will
co-develop
and
test
two
scalable,
multi-component
interventions
targeted
at
LTCWs
–
one
dialogue-based
that
explicitly
incorporates
SDM
principles
and
a
conversation
aid,
and
the
other
social
media-based
–
to
improve
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
and
other
outcomes
in
the
US
LTCW
population.
This
study
will
focus
on
three
research
questions
that
address
compelling
clinical
and
implementation
questions
raised
by
the
COVID-19
vaccines:
12
1.
What
is
the
comparative
impact
of
two
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
(primary
outcome)
and
inﬂuence
secondary
outcomes,
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
in
LTCWs?
2.
What
is
the
most
eﬀective
intervention
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
among
diﬀerent
subgroups
of
LTCWs,
including
those
who
experience
diﬀerent
levels
of
health
disparities?
3.
What
are
the
delivery
characteristics,
contexts,
and
processes
needed
to
sustain
and
scale
up
the
implementation
of
interventions
designed
to
increase
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
among
LTCWs?
3.2
Aims
and
Objectives
S p e c i ﬁ c
A i m
1
:
To
compare
the
impact
of
two
interventions
delivered
online:
1)
a
dialogue-based
webinar
using
the
existing
COVID-19
Option
Grid
conversation
aid
and,
2)
an
interactive,
dynamic,
and
multi-component
social
media
website,
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
(link
to
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
vaccine
website),
on
COVID-19
vaccine
conﬁdence
(primary
outcome),
and
other
secondary
outcomes
among
LTCWs
(see
Figure
1).
H y p o t h e s i s
1 :
Each
intervention
will
be
superior
to
enhanced
usual
practice
at
increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence.
H y p o t h e s i s
2
:
The
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
arm
at
increasing
vaccine
conﬁdence.
We
predict
superiority
of
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
based
on
stronger
evidence
that
exists
for
dialogue-based
approaches
and
SDM
for
improving
vaccine
hesitancy
and/or
uptake,
as
compared
to
social
media
approaches.
While
our
social
media
website
intervention
includes
elements
of
dialogue,
this
component
is
more
explicit
in
the
webinar
intervention
(see
‘Interventions
and
control’).
S p e c i ﬁ c
A i m

:
To
determine
if
LTCWs’
characteristics
and
other
factors
mediate
and
moderate
the
interventions’
impact
on
vaccine
conﬁdence
and
other
secondary
outcomes
(See
Figure
1).
H y p o t h e s i s

:
Increased
perceptions
of
feeling
informed
about
the
vaccines,
identiﬁcation
of
vaccine
information
and
misinformation,
and
trust
in
vaccine
information
provided
by
diﬀerent
sources
will
explain
(mediate)
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
E x p l o r a t o r y :
We
will
conduct
exploratory
heterogeneity
of
treatment
eﬀects
(HTE)
analyses
to
identify
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
moderate
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
13
Variables
to
be
explored
will
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
vaccination
status,
religious
beliefs,
perceived
inﬂuence
of
others,
age,
race,
ethnicity
and
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19.

We
will
conduct
an

group
trial
with
a
hybrid-eﬀectiveness
implementation
design
type

28
.
This

includes
evaluating

in
the
randomized

alongside
an
exploration
of
implementation
(tasks
1-5
of

29
.
Contingent
on
the
trial
results,
implementation
will
then
be
evaluated
in
a

phase
after
randomized
trial
assessments
are
completed.
If
trial
results
do
not
support
immediate
implementation,
we
will
focus
our
eﬀorts
on
further
engaging
key
stakeholders
to
identify
possible

for
future
implementation.
We
will
draw

co-design
and
co-manage
this

with
LTCWs,
the

The
randomized
controlled
trial
will
have
three
arms,
with
randomization
at
the
individual
person
level.
Arm
1
is
a
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention.
Arm
2
is
a
social

website
intervention.
Arm
3
is
enhanced
usual
practice.
Intervention
and
comparator
arms
are
described
in
detail
in
section
4.4.
We
will
use
online
and
in-person
recruitment
strategies
to
enroll
1,800
LTCWs
to
the
trial.
Trial
data
will
be
obtained
primarily
via
four
self-reported
participant
surveys,
delivered
to
each
participant
over
a
period
of
approximately
six
months
(Figure
2).
We
will
also
collect
online
activity
data
in
each
intervention
arm.
In
the
trial
set-up
period,
an
additional
online
survey
will
be
administered
to
a
sample
of
~500
people
from
the
general
population
who
are
demographically
representative
of
LTCWs,
to
test
novel
trial
screening
questions
(e.g.,
COVID-19
vaccine
concerns)
and
adapted
outcome
measures
(e.g.,
vaccine
conﬁdence),
and
help
reﬁne
the
content
of
the
interventions.

We
are
undertaking
a
process
called
“intervention
and
implementation
mapping,”
which
is
a
co-design
and
co-development
approach
to
intervention
design
and
implementation
strategy
29
.
In
Aim
3,
we
hypothesized
that
this
co-development
and
co-learning
approach
would
facilitate
implementation
of
the
interventions
in
both
the
trial
phase
and
the
sustainability
phase.
Aim
3
will
primarily
involve
interviews
with
key
stakeholders,
including
LTCWs
and
others
identiﬁed
as
current
or
future
adopters,
implementers,
and
maintainers
of
the
study
interventions.

Aim
3
and
the
associated
intervention
and
implementation
mapping
processes
are
integrated
in
every
stage
of
the
broader
study,
including
the
trial
setup
and
intervention
development
phase
(1),
trial
phase
(2),
and
sustainability
phase
(3)
(see
section

interviews
will
be
conducted
by
research
team
members
at
IHI
and
the
Center
for

(CPDE)
at
Dartmouth
College.
Much
of
our
intervention
and
implementation
mapping
activities
will
occur
during
the
preparatory
stages
of
the
study.
Guided
by
Fernandez’s
implementation
mapping
approach
29
,
we
have
developed
a
set
of
tasks
and
criteria
to
operationalize
implementation
mapping
for
our
study.

online
activity
data,
webinar
recordings,
and
online
observation
(during
and
after
webinars;
over
the
course
of
the
social
media
website)
from
team
members,
trained
LTCW
peers
and
expert
facilitators,
we
will
measure,
analyze,
and
report
the
ﬁdelity
of
delivering
each
intervention,
the
dose
of
intervention
delivered,
participants’
views
toward
the
interventions,
and
the
achieved
versus
intended
reach.
The
process
evaluation
will
be
primarily
conducted
by
the
CPDE
at
Dartmouth
College,
in
order
to
retain
more
independence
compared
to
the
team
responsible
for
the
outcome
evaluation
(Aims
1
and
2).
For
each
arm,
we
will
use
a
maximum
variation
sampling
approach
31
,
to
include
data
extremes
for
analysis
(with
maximum
diversity),
through
the
selection
of
key
diversity
dimensions
(generic
and
speciﬁc
to
each
arm).
For
the
webinar
arm,
we
will
ﬁrst
record
all
webinars
and
select
up
to
12
webinars
for
process
ev
aluation
analysis,
by
using
a
range
of
extremes.
32
To
select
the
webinars
for
analysis,
key
diversity
dimensions
may
include:
number
of
attendees,
number
of
messages
posted
in
the
webinar
chat,
timing
of
the
webinar
in
the
context
of
the
overall
duration
of
recruitment
(e.g.,
start
of
recruitment,
two
months
into
recruitment,
six
months
into
recruitment),
duration
of
the
webinar,
proportion
of
male/female
attendees,
perceived
richness
of
the
verbal
exchanges
(rated
at
the
end
of
each
webinar
by
the
facilitating
team),
presence
of
conﬂicts/heated
discussions,
and
number
of
people
dropping
oﬀ
before
the
end
of
the
webinar.
For
each
of
the
12
selected
webinars,
we
will
measure,
analyze,
and
report
the
ﬁdelity
of
delivering
each
intervention,
the
dose
of
intervention
delivered,
and
reach
(proportion
of
eligible
participants
who
attend
the
webinars).
We
will
also
conduct
a
thematic
analysis
of
the
chat
posts
and
of
the
transcribed
discussions.
We
will
use
the
same
approach
for
the
social
media
platform.
We
will
analyze
up
to
12
independent
weeks
of
social
media
platform
content,
by
selecting
a
range
of
extremes.
To
select
the
days
of
social
media
platform
content,
key
diversity
dimensions
may
include:
speciﬁc
timepoints
across
the
study
recruitment
continuum
(e.g.,
start
of
recruitment,
two
17
months
into
recruitment,
six
months
into
recruitment),
number
of
visits
per
day,
number
of
messages
posted,
number
of
likes,
etc.
For
each
of
the
12
weeks
of
selected
content,
we
will
measure,
analyze,
and
report
the
ﬁdelity
of
delivering
each
intervention,
the
dose
of
intervention
delivered,
and
reach.
We
will
also
examine
how
the
media
platform
was
used
based
on
website
activity
data
33
.
The
activity
data
will
include
user
ID,
time
stamps,
and
page
URL
of
each
action
completed
on
the
social
media
platform:
reading
a
page,
posting
a
comment,
liking
a
comment,
etc.
We
will
measure
the
mean
total
time
spent
on
the
social
media
website,
the
mean
number
of
pages
accessed,
identify
the
most
frequently
visited
pages,
the
most
frequently
liked
pages
or
sections,
etc.

Setting
The
randomized
trial
will
be
conducted
entirely
online,
and
will
be
open
to
LTCWs
residing
anywhere
in
the
United
States.
We
will
use
a
combination
of
online
and
in-person
recruitment
strategies.
In-person
recruitment
will
occur
at
a
convenience
sample
of
LTC
settings
in
North
Carolina,
identiﬁed
by
our
collaborator
(NRL),
who
has
extensive
professional
LTC
experience
and
trusted
relationships
with
LTC
leaders
in
the
North
Carolina
area.
Settings
will
include
large
and
smaller
size
for-proﬁt
and
not-for-proﬁt
nursing
homes
and
continuing
care
retirement
communities
in
both
rural
and
urban
locations.
Additional
settings
will
include
the
New

Eligible
LTC
settings
will
include
nursing
homes,
skilled
nursing
facilities,
assisted

facilities,
home
health
care,
hospice

The
two-year
timeframe
will
avoid
excluding
those
who
are
currently
unemployed,
and
will
approximately
cover
the
duration
of
time
since
the
COVID-19
pandemic
began.
To
ensure
a
high
proportion
of
study
participants
represent
our
low
conﬁdence
target
group,
we
will
use
two
criteria
–
worry
about
the
vaccines
and
booster
uptake
–
to
screen
participants
for
eligibility.
These
criteria
are
based
on
a
preliminary
analysis
of
panel
survey
data,
which
found
associations
between
booster
intent,
worry
about
the
vaccines,
and
vaccine
conﬁdence.

R e c r u i t m e n t
We
will
utilize
a
diverse
range
of
recruitment
methods,
both
online
and
in-person.
First,
we
plan
to
recruit
and
engage
LTCWs
using
methods
that
have
been
previously
eﬀective
for
our
partners
at
NACHA.
We
will
therefore
use
NAHCA’s
communication
channels
and
their
networks,
consisting
of
social
media
followers
and
contacts
with
NAHCA
registered
employers.
NAHCA
membership
is
characterized
by
care
workers
who
place
value
on
professional
development,
however
this
does
not
apply
to
NAHCA
non-members
who
are
NAHCA
followers
on
Facebook
and
YouTube.
NAHCA
has
the
capability
to
reach
care
workers
in
all
50
US
states,
and
has
members
in
all
states,
except
Alaska.
NAHCA
has
24,500
members,
with
22,685
subscribing
to
their
list-serv,
2,150
YouTube
subscribers,
and
18,263
Facebook
followers.
Response
rates
to
emails
via
their
list-serv
average
a
33%
open
rate
and
a
12%
click
rate.
Typical
engagement
on
their
Facebook
posts
ranges
from
5%
to
15%;
and
their
YouTube
videos
reach
3,500
views
on
average.
Using
these
estimates
and
given
the
survey-response
incentives
($30
per
time-point),
we
anticipate
interest
from
at
least
2,722
LTCWs
via
the
list-serv
and
900
LTCWs
via
Facebook
using
a
conservative
5%
engagement
level
(3,622
in
total).
These
numbers
combined
exceed
the
1,800
LTCWs
that
we
need
to
power
the
trial.
Our
collaborator,
Dr.
Tim
Holahan,
Clinical
Director
of
the
American
Medical
Director
Association,
has
conﬁrmed
excellent
collaborative
arrangements
with
NAHCA
to
support
recruitment.
Both
Lori
Porter
(NAHCA
CEO)
and
Matthew
Cantrell
(NAHCA
COO)
conﬁrm
that
LTCWs
can
be
eﬀectively
engaged
using
their
membership
list
outreach
methods
and
social
media.
To
further
enhance
diversity
and
reach,
we
will
also
utilize
paid
social
media
and
online
advertisements
for
study
recruitment.
Lastly,
in-person
recruitment
strategies
will
include
sharing
recruitment
materials
via
visits
to
LTC
settings,
conferences,
and
other
events,
and
outreach
to
LTC
settings
with
requests
to
display
study
recruitment
materials.
23
We
also
intend
to
make
all
recruitment
and
other
study
materials
available
via
mobile
technology
so
that
participants
can
easily
access
them
on
a
telephone
or
tablet
if
they
do
not
have
reliable
access
to
desktop
computing.

C o n t e n t
F o u n d a t i o n s
We
designed
two
multi-component,
interactive,
online
interventions
(arms
1
and
2),
informed
by
theoretical
and
practical
information
from
the
vaccine
conﬁdence
and
hesitancy
literature.
Notably,
our
intervention
development
and
hypothesized
mediators
(see
Figure
3)
were
initially
informed
by
Peretti-Watel’s
vaccine
hesitancy
framework,
which
conceptualizes
vaccine
decision-making
as
a
process.
The
framework
also
distinguishes
between
two
types
of
vaccine
hesitant
people:
1)
those
with
poor
knowledge
of
and/or
indiﬀerence
to
vaccination
issues,
and
2)
those
who
are
interested
in
vaccination
issues
and
seek
more
information,
yet
are
hesitant
38
.
We
were
also
informed
by
the
Report
of
the
SAGE
Working
Group
on
Vaccine
Hesitancy
and
its
conceptualization
of
the
“three
Cs”
of
vaccine
hesitancy:
Conﬁdence,
Complacency
and
Convenience;
and,
we
considered
all
three
Cs
39
.
Additionally,
our
interventions
were
informed
by
the
literature
on
reducing
vaccine
hesitancy,

The
overall
designs
of
the
dialogue-based
webinar
and
social
media
website
interventions
were
informed
by
prior
studies
22,23,26
and
developed
using
participatory
research
approaches
40,41
.
In
developing
content
for
each
intervention,
our
goal
was
to
maximize
consistency
of
major
topics
across
interventions,
in
order
to
isolate
eﬀects
of
each
intervention
delivery
method.
To
inform
the
intervention
content,
we
initially
derived
topics
from
several
sources,
including
social
media
monitoring,
news
surveillance,
online
public
opinion
polls
42,43
,
and
peer-reviewed
literature
39
.
The
major
topics
for
inclusion
in
both
interventions
were
then
reﬁned
via
interviews
with
our
LTCW
partners
as
part
of
Aim
3.
Additional
information
was
gathered
to
inform
the
development
of
the
social
media
website
intervention,
the
details
of
which
are
published
25

elsewhere
44
.
The
ﬁnal
list
of
major
topics
includes
COVID-19
in
general,
vaccine
beneﬁts,
vaccine
risks,
and
vaccine
development
44
.
We
also
developed
community
standards
to
ensure
all
participants
felt
welcome
and
comfortable
when
engaging
with
the
interventions.
These
standards,
which
are
similar
across
both
interventions,
were
based
on
the
rules
of
existing
vaccine
discussion
forums
and
were
co-created
with
our
LTCW
partners
44
.
Also
included
in
both
interventions
is
a
video
that
we
developed
featuring
LTC
residents
voicing
their
views
on
why
it
is
important
for
LTCWs
to
be
vaccinated.
In
response
to
low
intervention
exposure
in
one
trial
arm
(webinar
attendance)
experienced
in
the
ﬁrst
several
weeks
of
data
collection,
we
developed
intervention
‘refreshers’
for
each
trial
arm.
The
refreshers
for
trial
arms
1
and
2
are
briefer,
modiﬁed
versions
of
each
primary
intervention.
They
include
content
on
new
and
emerging
COVID-19
and
vaccine-related
topics,
as
well
as
popular
questions
trial
participants
have
voiced
through
their
primary
intervention
engagement.
New
and
emerging
topics
were
derived
from
several
sources,
including
social
media
monitoring,
news
surveillance,
online
public
opinion
polls
45
,
and
consultation
with
our
LTCW
partners
and
other
stakeholders.
Topics
for
inclusion
were
reﬁned
primarily
via
a
poll
to
identify
stakeholders’
information
needs
(process
adapted
from
46
).
Refreshers
for
trial
arms
1
and
2
will
be
updated
as
required
when
there
is
suﬃcient
new
and
emerging
COVID-19
related
public
discourse.

W e b i n a r
LTCWs
will
attend
one-time
virtual
webinars
in
groups
of
no
more
than
20,
scheduled
at
diﬀerent
times,
and
diﬀerent
days
(including
weekends).
Each
webinar
will
be
led
by
a
LTCW
peer
trained
in
SDM
principles.
It
will
also
be
co-facilitated
by
a
physician
with
expertise
in
COVID-19
vaccination,
and
a
communication
expert
with
experience
in
SDM.
The
webinar
intervention
agenda
is
as
follows:
i)
the
LTCW
facilitator
will
introduce
the
session
and
go
over
important
instructions,
including
the
set
of
community
standards,
ii)
the
physician
facilitator
will
review
the
COVID-19
vaccine
Option
Grid
TM
conversation
aid
(see
Appendix
A)
and
other
related
topics
of
interest
using
the
principles
of
the
SDM
three-talk
model
47
.
A
link
to
the
online
Option
Grid
TM
will
also
be
sent
to
participants
prior
to
their
webinar
commencing
iii)
participants
will
then
be
presented
with
the
four
major
content
topics
pertaining
to
COVID-19
and
the
vaccines
(consistent
with
those
listed
above
in
section
4.4.2)
and
will
vote
(via
a
poll)
on
the
two
content
topics
that
matter
most
to
them.
The
physician
facilitator
will
then
start
by
answering
questions
from
participants
related
to
the
top
voted
content
areas,
and
then
open
questioning
up
to
all
topics
until
there
are
no
remaining
queries.
The
webinars
will
end
with
the
LTC
resident
video
described
earlier.
26
Throughout
the
webinars,
the
communication
expert
will
assist
with
any
related
discussions
where
needed
and
respond
to
study-related
questions/issues
or
technical
troubleshooting.
Webinar
durations
will
vary,
running
up
to
1
hour,
or
less
if
there
are
no
remaining
questions
.
Participants
will
also
be
invited
to
join
a
facilitated
online
discussion
in
the
webinar
chat
and
their
engagement
will
be
monitored
(e.g.,
number
of
chat
messages
posted
during
each
webinar
and
webinar
content).
A
dialogue-based
webinar
refresher
will
also
be
delivered
to
all
participants
in
this
arm
one
week
prior
to
their
T2
survey
invitation
(see
Figure
2).
The
refresher
will
be
a
pre-recorded
webinar
(video
and
audio-only
versions)
lasting
~20
minutes,
sent
to
participants
via
email.
The
structure
of
the
recorded
webinar
will
closely
resemble
that
of
the
primary
intervention,
and
will
include
a
review
of
the
COVID-19
Option
Grid
TM
,
question
and
answer
discussion,
and
LTC

M e d i a
W e b s i t e
LTCWs
will
be
invited
to
visit
a
social
media
website.
The
website
is
curated
with
popular
and
topical
posts
from
social
media
platforms
such
as
Facebook,
TikTok,
and
YouTube
that
are
made
by
medical
experts,
LTCWs,
and
other
creators.
The
content
and
topics
addressed
on
the
website
are
dynamic
in
nature,
with
two
new
posts
added
daily.
The
top
of
the
website
homepage
features
the
four
major
content
topics
pertaining
to
COVID-19
and
the
vaccines
(consistent
with
those
listed
above
in
section
4.4.2).
Participants
can
navigate
the
website
by
selecting
from
these
major
topics,
selecting
subtopics
listed
in
the
sidebar
menu
or
as
hashtags
assigned
to
each
post,
or
by
scrolling
the
remainder
of
the
homepage
(organized
as
an
inﬁnite
scroll
of
all
posts,
sorted
by
most
recently
uploaded).
The
website
supports
participant
interaction
with
features
such
as
reactions
and
comments.
Participants
also
receive
email
notiﬁcations
when
other
users
react
or
reply
to
comments
they
have
made.
Three
special
website
users
aﬃliated
with
the
study
team
who
have
worked
as
CNAs
in
LTC
settings
contribute
to
the
website
as
‘Community
Ambassadors’.
Their
role
is
to
promote
user
engagement
by
reacting
and
replying
to
posts
and
participants’
comments
based
on
their
own
experiences
as
CNAs.
Ambassadors
also
provide
factual
information
on
COVID-19,
the
vaccines,
and
boosters
should
participants
ask
any
direct
questions.
A
social
media
website
refresher
will
also
be
delivered
to
all
participants
assigned
to
this
arm
one
week
prior
to
their
T2
survey
invitation
(see
Figure
2).
The
refresher
will
be
an
email
with
previews
and
links
(back
to
the
full
post
on
the
social
site)
to
a
selection
of
featured
website
content.

C o m p a r a t o r
LTCWs
will
be
directed
to
COVID-19
vaccine
information
on
the
CDC
website
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html).
The
CDC
website
addresses
common
questions
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
and
provides
information
on
related
topics,
such
as
specifics
about
getting
vaccinated
and
staying
up
to
date
on
the
vaccines
and
boosters.
To
address
concerns
of
intervention
inferiority,
LTCWs
will
be
given
access
to
active
trial
arms
shown
to
have
impact,
after
their
6
month
follow-up.
An
enhanced
usual
practice
refresher
will
also
be
delivered
to
all
participants
assigned
to
this
arm
one
week
prior
to
their
T2
survey
invitation
(see
Figure
2).
The
refresher
will
be
an
email
with
a

to
COVID-19
vaccine
information
on
the
CDC
website.

To
monitor
the
adaptations
made
to
the
interventions
over
the
course
of
the
project
(and
primarily
in
the
sustainability
phase),
we
will
collect
data
from
online
activity
data,
ﬁeld-notes,
and
observations
using
FRAME
(expanded
F
ramework
for
R
eporting
A
daptations
and
M
odiﬁcations
to
E
vidence-based
interventions)
48
.
According
to
the
FRAME,
an
adaptation
is
deﬁned
as
a
“process
of
thoughtful
and
deliberate
alteration
to
the
design
or
delivery
of
an
intervention,
with
the
goal
of
improving
its
ﬁt
or
eﬀectiveness
in
a
given
context”
48
.
This
is
particularly
relevant
in
the
context
of
implementation
and
thus
most
applicable
to
the
second
part
of
this
project:
during
the
sustainability
phase
of
the
study.
Understanding
what,
how
and
when
adaptations
are
made
is
an
essential
aspect
of
implementation
science.
In
this
context,
adaptation
will
primarily
be
made
and
documented
during
the
sustainability
phase
(year
03
of
the
project).
Whereas
the
content
of
the
interventions
will
be
responsive
to
participant
engagement,
signiﬁcant
adaptations
to
format
and
delivery
during
the
randomized
controlled
trial
(years
01
and
02)
will
be
minimal
and
only
implemented
if
judged
essential
by
the
research
team.
These
adaptations
will
also
be
documented
using
the
FRAME
guidance.

Individual
participants
may
choose
to
not
participate
in
a
study
intervention.
They
can
also
actively
withdraw
from
the
study
at
any
time
by
either
opting
out
of
both
forms
of
contact
(email
and
text),
directly
contacting
the
research
team
to
request
withdrawal,
or
they
may
withdraw
passively
by
choosing
to
not
complete
study
surveys.
Because
interventions
are
not
administered
to
participants
on
an
individual
basis,
it
is
not
possible
to
modify
allocated
interventions
for
any
one
speciﬁc
person.
28
Throughout
the
trial,
each
intervention
will
be
monitored
by
trained
team
members
to
identify
any
breaches
to
community
guidelines
or
other
potential
safety
events.
Intervention
moderators
will
have
the
ability
to
limit
participants’
ability
to
interact
within
the
interventions
to
varying
degrees,
in
the
event
of
disruptive
or
unwelcome
behavior.

These
outcomes
were
selected
to
address
vaccine
conﬁdence.
To

we
will
use
validated
short-form
questionnaires
when
possible.
Our
primary,
secondary,
and
other
outcomes
will
be
collected
via
web-based
electronic
surveys
at
baseline
(T0),
3
weeks
post-baseline
(T1),
3
months
post-baseline
(T2),
and

in
the
COVID-19
vaccines
using
an
adapted
version
of
the
Vaccine
Conﬁdence
Index
(VCI)
49
for

The
COVID-19
VCI
is
a
3-item
measure
that
assesses
vaccine
conﬁdence
across
three
domains:
safety,
eﬀectiveness,
and
importance
(see
Table

Each
item
is
rated
on
a
5-point
scale
ranging
from
1
('Strongly
disagree')
to
5
('Strongly
agree').
Participants
will
be
considered
'conﬁdent'
(score
of
'1')
if
they
respond
'Agree'
or
'Strongly
agree'
on
all
three
items
and
'not
conﬁdent'
(score
of
'0')
if
one
or
more
item
responses
is
not
'Agree'
or
'Strongly

will
be
assessed
using
two

We
will
monitor
the
extent
to
which
participants
engage
with
their
assigned
primary
and
refresher
intervention
content.
We
will
collect
online
activity
data
(i.e.,
social
media
website
user
history,
webinar
attendance
records,
email
click
rates)
and
participant
self-reported
engagement
data
via
surveys.
We
will
prioritize
the
use
of
online
activity
data
to
minimize
potential
measurement
error
36
.
However,
survey
questions
may
be
used
where
online
activity
data
is
not
available
or
is
incomplete;
for
example,
to
determine
engagement
with
the
webinar
refresher
recording
(adapted
from
36
)
and
enhanced
usual
practice
information.
Data
on
engagement
will
be
used
to
inform
secondary
trial
analyses,
as
well
as
Aim

We
will
conduct
a
process
evaluation
as
a
component
of
Aim
3
to
inform
implementation
and
sustainability
activities.
Process
evaluation
questions
will
be
administered
in
all
follow-up
surveys
(T1-T3).
Acceptability
of
the
interventions
and
control
arm
will
be
determined
via
adapted
NPS
questions
50
(i.e.,
likelihood
of
recommending
to
a
coworker).
Similar
approaches
have
previously
been
used
for
evaluating
SDM
interventions
36,63–65
.
We
will
also
assess
how
new
the
information
was
that
participants
were
exposed
to,
the
comprehension
of
and
trust
in
the
information
(informed
by
66
),
the
degree
to
which
they
felt
listened
to
and
respected
by
those
running
the
interventions
(informed
by
67
),
and
reasons
for
not
engaging
with
the
primary

Using
historical
Vaccine
Conﬁdence
Index
(VCI)
data
70
and
current
vaccination
rates
71
,
a
VCI
threshold
was
determined
that
was
signiﬁcantly
correlated
with
rates
of
vaccination
(p=0.0001).
Assuming
the
analytic
approaches
outlined
in
sections
4.7.2
and
later,
the
sample
size
of
1,800
32
LTCWs
(600
per
arm)
provides
80%
power
to
detect
an
8%
diﬀerence
in
the
rate
of
scores
above
this
threshold
between
groups
with
a
two-sided
test
at
type
I
error
rate
of
0.05.
The
sample
size
is
suﬃcient
to
retain
80%
power
to
detect
a
10%
diﬀerence
(assuming
outcomes
are
randomly
distributed
across
retained

Prospective
participants
will
be
recruited
via
several
online
channels.
We
will
co-design
engaging
recruitment
materials
with
our
stakeholder
partners,
including
brief
animated
videos
that
describe
the
study.
We
will
utilize
the
existing
networks
of
our
partner
organizations,
stakeholders,
and
consultants,
to
share
recruitment
messaging.
This
will
include
email
listservs
and
social
media
platforms
(e.g.,
Facebook
groups).
We
will
also
utilize
paid,
targeted
social
media
advertising
to
share
recruitment
messaging
on
various
platforms,
including
Facebook
and
Instagram,
among
other
platforms.
Lastly,
we
will
utilize
in-person
recruitment
which
will
include
sharing
recruitment
materials
during
visits
to
LTC
settings,
conferences,
and
other
events,
and
outreach
to
LTC
settings
with
requests
to
display
study
recruitment
materials.
Recruitment
messaging
(i.e.,
emails,
social
media
ads,
posters,
table
tents,
and
business
cards)
will
include
links
to:
1)
a
study
landing
page
where
prospective
participants
can
learn
more
about
the
study
via
brief,
plain-language
study
information
in
both
video
and
written
formats
,
and,
2)
a
Qualtrics
survey
where
they
can
proceed
straight
to
eligibility
screening.
Screening
will
involve
prospective
participants
answering
a
series
of
questions
to
self-assess
their
eligibility
(see
Table
2).
The
study
landing
page
will
also
include
a

to
the
Qualtrics

Those
who
meet
the
eligibility
criteria
will
proceed
to
a
study
Information
Sheet
that
will
provide
information
about
the
study
objectives,
processes,
risk,
beneﬁts,
and
data
protection
and
sharing.
To
improve
accessibility
and
facilitate
the
uptake
of
study
information,
we
are
also
developing
an
animated
video
version
of
the
Information
Sheet
that
will
contain
the
same
information
as
the
text
version.
Participants
will
be
able
to
choose
if
they
want
to
watch
the
video
or
read
the
text
version
of
the
Information
Sheet
in
the
online
Qualtrics
survey
platform
(or
see
both).
At
the
end
of
the
Information
Sheet,
prospective
participants
will
be
asked
if
they
have
read/watched
and
understood
the
information
and
if
they
agree
to
take
part
in
the
study.
Those
who
respond
‘
Y e s
’
to
both
questions
will
be
considered
to
have
consented
to
the
study
and
will
proceed
to
the
T0
Survey.
Because
of
the
online
nature
of
the
trial,
incentives
provided,
and
early
instances
of
fraudulent
activity
72
,
we
will
implement
several
strategies
to
prevent,
detect,
and
respond
to
fraudulent
study
enrollment.
The
strategies
we
will
adopt
were
informed
by
a
prior
review
of
methods
73
33
and
recommendations
74,75
on
this
topic.
We
also
engaged
our
stakeholders
in
this
development
process
to
ensure
a
range
of
strategies
feasible
and
acceptable
to
LTCWs
.
First,
in
the
baseline
survey,
we
will
add
a
reCAPTCHA
bot
detection
ﬁlter
73,74,76
,
cookie-based
settings
that
prevent
multiple
submissions
from
the
same
web
browser
73,74,77
,
and
a
message
discouraging
duplicate
survey
completion
73,74
.
After
consent,
participants
will
be
asked
to
provide
the
name
of
their
current
or
former
workplace
and
the
type
of
long-term
care
setting
it
is.
Additionally,
in
order
for
us
to
verify
that
they
have
worked
in
a
long-term
care
setting
within
the
last
2
years,
they
will
be
required
to
choose
one
of
four
diﬀerent
veriﬁcation
options:
1 )

Participants
will
be
able
to
directly

ID
badge,
or,
arrange
a
time
to
speak
with
us
to
show
their
badge
over
a
brief
Zoom
video

We
will
review
badge
images
uploaded/shown
to
ensure
the
participant’s
name,
place
of
work,
and
LTCW
role
(if
listed)
matches
the
information
they
have
provided
in
the
T0

We
will
also
conduct
an
online
search
(using
Google
Chrome
Incognito
mode)
of
workplace
names
to
conﬁrm
they
are
a
long-term

in
this

We
will

uploaded/shown
to
ensure
the
participant’s

Participants
with
certain
roles
(e.g.,
certiﬁed
nursing
assistants
in
most
states,
health
care
providers)
will
be
able
to
provide
their
Certiﬁcation
Number
or
Professional
License
Number,
alongside
the
state
they
are
registered
in
and
their
associated
professional
role.
We
will
verify
Certiﬁcation/License
Numbers
by
searching
state
online
registries
(e.g.,
https://forms.nh.gov/licenseveriﬁcationtest/
).
Participants’
names
may
also
be
used
to
aid
in
this
search,
if
required.
We
will
also
conduct
an
online
search
(using
Google
Chrome
Incognito
mode)
of
workplace
names
reported
in
the
T0
(baseline)
Survey
to
conﬁrm
they
are
a
long-term
care
setting.
Participants’
zip
codes
may
also
be
used
to
aid
in
this
search,
if
required.
4 )
W o r k

Participants
who
have
workplace
email
accounts
will
be
able
to
email
us
directly
from
their
account
with
their
ﬁrst
and
last
name,
the
name
of
their
workplace,
and
the
name
of
the
study.
We
will
conduct
an
online
search
(using
Google
Chrome
Incognito
mode)
of
workplace
names
and
associated
email
domains
to
conﬁrm
they
match,
and
that
this
34
place
of
work
matches
the
information
they
have
provided
in
the
T0
(baseline)
Survey
and
is
a
long-term
care
setting.
Participants’
zip
codes
may
also
be
used
to
aid
in
this
search,
if
required.
We
will
also
employ
TransUnion’s
TLOxp
veriﬁcation
service
(www.tlo.com),
to
conﬁrm
the
identity
of
participants
recruited
online
75
.
TLOxp
aggregates
publicly
available
databases
and
records
to
authenticate
and
verify
identity
information.
We
will
develop
a
standardized
process
for
identity
veriﬁcation
using
participant
name,
zip
code,
age
range,
cell
phone
number,
and
email
address.
We
will
inform
those
who
select
the
option
to
upload
an
image
of
their
badge
or
recent
pay
stub
that
we
only
need
to
see
their
name,
workplace,
and
LTCW
role
(if
listed).
They
will
be
instructed
to
cover
up
any
other
sensitive
information
or
information
they
do
not
wish
to
share.
Reminder
messages
(text
and
email)
and
phone
calls
73,74
will
be
utilized
to
gather
further
information
from
participants
who
fail
to
provide
the
requested
information
in
the
time
frame
speciﬁed.
Participants
recruited
in
person
will
be
presented
with
the
same
veriﬁcation
survey
questions
as
other
participants,
however,
the
need
for
follow-up
contact
to
conﬁrm
their
LTCW
status
in
some
situations
will
be
relaxed
due
to
veriﬁcation
not
being
necessary
for
this
sub-population.
Participants
who
do
not
pass
a
veriﬁcation
check
(including
those
who
fail
to
provide
the
requested
information
in
the
time
frame
speciﬁed)
will
be
sent
a
message
stating
that
they
can
no
longer
remain
in
the
study
and
will
be
unenrolled
74
.
Once
participants
have
provided
veriﬁcation
information
or
selected
a
veriﬁcation
option
that
requires
completion
later
(e.g.,
scheduling
a
video
call
with
a
member
of
the
research
team),
they
will
proceed
to
the
remainder
of
the
T0
Survey.
The
T0
Survey
will
include
capturing
participant
contact
information
and
an
assessment
of
outcomes
indicated
in
Table
3
and
participant
characteristics.

We
will
use
the
randomizer
function
built
into
the
online
Qualtrics
survey
platform
to
allocate
participants
to
a
trial
arm
and
associated
intervention.
At
the
very
end
of
the
T0
Survey,
the
Qualtrics
survey
platform
will
automatically
generate
participants’
trial
arm
and
they
will
be
presented
with
basic
information
pertaining
to
their
assigned
intervention
at
that
time.
A
1:1:1
allocation
ratio
will
be
used.
After
submitting
their
survey,
those
randomized
to
Arm
1
(Dialogue-Based
Webinar)
will
be
automatically
redirected
to
a
separate
Qualtrics
survey
where
they
can
sign
up
for
one
of
several
pre-scheduled
webinar
sessions.
Those
randomized
to
Arm
2
(Social

Website)
will
be
automatically
redirected
to
the
Social
Media
Website.
In
order
35
to
access
website
content,
they
will
ﬁrst
be
required
to
create
a
username
and
password
for
the
site.
Those
randomized
to
Arm

will
be
automatically
redirected
to
a

on
the
CDC

Due
to
the
nature
of
the
interventions
and
intervention
delivery,
it
is
not
possible
to
blind
facilitators,
research
team
members
or
participants
to
the
allocation.
Participants
may
be
aware
that
they
are
in
a

will
be
delivered
three

We
will
monitor
trial
enrollment
on
a
daily
basis.
Particular
attention
will
be
paid
to
ensuring
that
enrollment
numbers
do
not
exceed
the
capacity
of
scheduled
Dialogue-Based
Webinars.
Should
enrollment
numbers
exceed
the
capacity
of
these
webinars,
we
will
pause
study
enrollment
across
all
trial
arms.
In
this
situation,
prospective
participants
would
still
be
screened
for
eligibility
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
consent
and
the
T0
Survey
questions,
their
contact
information
would
be
retained
by
the
study
team,
and
we
would
reach
out
to
them
when
recruitment
opens
up
again.
We
will
also
pay
particular
attention
to
recruitment
milestones
for
25%,
50%,
75%
and
100%
enrollment
targets.
If
enrollment
numbers
suggest
we
will
not
meet
a
recruitment
milestone,
we
will
employ
additional
recruitment
eﬀorts,
such
as
increased
advertising
and
outreach
to
additional
people
and
organizations
to
utilize
existing
LTCW
networks.

to
manage
participant
recruitment
and
retention.
Selected
survey
data
collected
in
Qualtrics
will
be
pushed
into
Salesforce
on
a
real-time

through
an
automated

across
all
four
surveys
in
one
central
database,
in
order
to
reliably
and
eﬃciently

Through
Salesforce,
we
will
also
automate
all
survey
invitations
and
survey

(sent
via
email
or

All
analyses
pertaining
to
study
Aims
1
and
2
will
be
conducted
on
an
intention-to-treat
(ITT)
basis
(i.e.
the
arm
participants
were
assigned
to)
and
as-treated
basis
(i.e.
whether
they
engaged
with
their
assigned
intervention
or
control).
A
detailed
data
analysis
methodology,
including
planned
statistical
tests,
timepoints
for
outcome
assessment,
and
treatment
of
missing
data,
is
included
in
Appendix
B.
For
Aim
1,
hypothesis
1.1,
we
will
conduct
one-tailed
tests
(superiority
analysis)
to
compare
the
impact
of
each
of
the
two
intervention
arms
against
the
enhanced
usual
practice
arm
on
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
For
Aim
1,
hypothesis
1.2,
we
will
conduct
a
two-tailed
test
(equivalence
analysis)
of
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
between
the
two
intervention
arms.
While
we
hypothesize
that
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
(Arm
1)
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
website
intervention
(Arm
2),
a
ﬁnding
of
superiority,
inferiority,
or
no
distinguishable
diﬀerence
will
be
a
valuable
ﬁnding.
For
Aim
2,
hypothesis
2.1,
our
mediation
analyses
seek
to
identify
the
relationship
between
the
interventions,
mediator
variables,
and
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
We
are
interested
in
whether
interventions
operate
through
the
mediator
rather
than
directly
aﬀecting
the
outcome.
If
the
results
for
Aim
1
are
non-signiﬁcant,
we
will
determine
whether
it
is
a
null
eﬀect
of
the
intervention
on
the
mediator
or
a
null
eﬀect
of
the
mediator
on
the
outcome.
We
will
determine
mediation
strength
and
mechanism
generalizability
by
comparing
eﬀects
across
subgroups.
For
Aim
2,
hypothesis
2.2,
our
exploratory
moderation
analyses
(also
referred
to
as
heterogeneity
of
treatment
eﬀects
(HTE)
analyses)
seek
to
understand
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
inﬂuence
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
conﬁdence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
We
will
explore
moderators
including
(but
not
limited
to)
vaccination
status,
religious
beliefs,
age,
race,
ethnicity,
perceived
inﬂuence
of
others,
and
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19.
Because
of
the
size,
scope,
and
complexity
of
this
study,
exploratory
analyses
of
relationships
within
the
data
will
be
conducted
to
identify
factors
to
inform
future
analysis
(see
Additional
File
4).
Exploratory,
hypothesis-free
analyses
will
be
performed
using
data
clustering
to
analyze
participants’
demographic,
geographic,
or
temporal
links,
which
may
deﬁne

To
reduce
the
duration
that
identifying
information
will
be
linked
to
other
study
data,
at
the
completion
of
data
collection,
we
will
download
all
data
that
was
collected
and
stored
in
cloud-based
systems
and
set
up
crosswalks
for
each
of
the
downloaded
datasets.
We
will
do
the
same
for
any
local
ﬁles
used
in
the
process
of
participant
management,
such
as
tracking
spreadsheets.
The
crosswalks
will
utilize
a
unique
and
anonymous
‘Study
ID’
variable
and
identiﬁable
variable
ﬁelds
depending
on
the
data
source.
We
will
set
up
a
master
key
ﬁle
that
will
include
only
Study
ID
and
all
identiﬁable
variable
ﬁelds.
This
key
ﬁle
will
be
used
for
all
data
crosswalks.
The
master
key
ﬁle
will
be
stored
separately
to
the
other
study
data
in
the
secure
SharePoint
cloud
system
as
well
as
on
one
or
more
encrypted
and
password-protected
external
hard
drives.
Remaining
deidentiﬁed
datasets
will
include
the
Study
ID
variable,
which
will
be
the
only
link
between
them
and
the
identiﬁable
study
data.
The
only
exception
to
this
de-identiﬁcation
and
crosswalk
process
is
the
video
and
audio
recordings
of
webinar
intervention
sessions,
as
these
will
be
needed
for
process
evaluation
analyses
which
will
continue
past
data
collection
completion.
It
is
not
possible
to
create
crosswalks
and
remove
identifying
information
from
participant
data
prior
to
data
collection
completion,
as
many
of
our
cloud-based
systems
and
participant
management
processes
require
the
identifying
information
for
our
study
to
function
correctly
(e.g.,
Salesforce
for
participant
communication;
study
website
to
manage
user
registrations
and
notiﬁcations;
question
responses
cannot
be
deleted
from
active
Qualtrics
survey
datasets,
Zoom
video/audio
recordings
for
process
evaluation).
We
will
also
need
to
create
weekly
back-ups
of
all
data
contained
in
Salesforce
(including
identiﬁers)
to
ensure
we
are
protected
in
the
event
of
any
data
loss.
At
the
completion
of
data
collection
and
following
the
downloading
of
data

P l a n
A
Data
and
Safety
Monitoring
Board
(DSMB)
will
be
appointed
to
provide
additional
oversight
in
the
trial.
The
attached
DSMB
Charter
describes
the
DSMB’s
scope
and
procedures
in
detail.
To
summarize,
the
DSMB
will
meet
and
review
data
annually
throughout
the
project
(data
review
in
meetings
2
and
3
only
-
see
Charter
previously
submitted
to
PCORI
for
details),
with
three
planned
meetings
held
in
total.
The
DSMB
will
include
a
Chair
who
has
no
direct
involvement
in
the
trial
(
see
DSMB
Charter).
The
DSMB
will
also
include
the
following
individuals
who
have
not
had
prior
involvement
in
the
trial:
1.
Board
member
with
expertise
in
data
safety
monitoring
of
clinical
trials
2.
Board
member
with
expertise
in
biostatistics
and
clinical
trials
methodology
3.
Executive
Secretary
with
experience
in
SDM
research
The
DSMB
will
operate
independently
from
the
study
sponsor
and
funder.
Independence
is
essential
to
ensure
that
the
DSMB
members
are
objective
and
capable
of
an
unbiased
assessment
of
the
study's
safety
and
eﬃcacy
of
data.
No
members
of
the
DSMB
should
have
ﬁnancial,
proprietary,
professional
or
other
interests
that
may
aﬀect
impartial
decision
making
by
the
DSMB.
The
following
will
ensure
the
independence
of
the
DSMB:
●
Members
of
the
DSMB
will
not
participate
as
investigators
in
the
study
under
review.
●
Members
of
the
DSMB
must
not
have
a
direct
interest
in
knowing
or
inﬂuencing
trial
outcomes
or
have
a
ﬁnancial,
proprietary,
or
intellectual
interest
in
the
outcomes
of
the
study
under
review.
●
DSMB
members
must
disclose
all
potential
new
conﬂicts
of
interests
(COIs).
The
DSMB
will
review
the
protocol,
data
collected,
and
advise
the
PIs
on
any
potential
risks
and
risk
mitigation
plans.
The
DSMB
recommendations
will
be
discussed
with
the
PIs
as
well
43
as
the
Trial
Steering
Group,
which
meets
quarterly.
The
Trial
Steering
Group
will
consider
all
DSMB
recommendations
and
revise
relevant
aspects
of
the
trial
accordingly.
Those
recommendations
will
also
be
fed
back
to
PCORI
annually
as
part
of
the
progress
reports.
The
PIs
will
also
be
responsible
for
sending
a
summary
of
DSMB
recommendations
to
the
Dartmouth
CPHS
(IRB)
after
each
DSMB
meeting.
If
there
are
adverse
or
unanticipated
events/problems
that
require
reporting,
PCORI
and
the
CPHS
will
be
notiﬁed
within
a
day
of
the
DSMB
meeting.
If
there
are
no
adverse
or
unanticipated
events/problems
that
require
reporting,
DSMB
meeting
minutes
and
recommendations
will
be
communicated
to
PCORI
in
the
interim
progress
report
.
Trial
activity
will
also
be
monitored
by
members
of
the
study
team
on
an
ongoing
basis,
outside
of
annual
DSMB
meetings.
We
believe
the
likelihood
of
Serious
Adverse
Events
(SAEs)
in
the
trial
that
would
require
immediate
reporting
to
be
extremely
low,
as
there
are
no
invasive
procedures
related
to
the
interventions.
However,
it
is
possible
that
a
participant
may
experience
psychological
discomfort
or
distress
as
a
result
of
answering
certain
survey
questions
or
through
engagement
in
either
of
the
two
study
interventions.
All
potential
adverse
events
or
unanticipated
events/problems,
regardless
of
their
severity,
will
be
reported
to
the
PIs.
All
events
will
be
discussed
by
the
PIs
and
relevant
members
of
the
study
team,
and
a
determination
will
be
made
as
to
whether
they
constitute
Reportable
New
Information
(e.g.,
it
increases
the
risk
to
subjects;
a
subject
experienced
unexpected
harm).
Any
event
deemed
to
be
Reportable
New
Information
will
be
reported
to
Dartmouth
CPHS
(IRB)
and
the
DSMB
will
convene
urgently
and
review
the
event
in
question.

Appr oval
The
randomized
controlled
trial
was
initially
approved
by
the
Dartmouth
CPHS
on
January
11th,
2022.
The
initial
approval
for
Aim

activities
was
granted
on
September
10th,
2021.
5.2
P r ot ocol
Amendments
Throughout
the
course
of
the
study,
protocol
modiﬁcations
will
be
reported
to
the
relevant
parties
and
groups
(e.g.,
project
investigators,
PCORI,
Dartmouth
CPHS),
where
required.
This
may
include
changes
to
trial
procedures,
materials,
and
planned
analyses.
5.3
Dissemination
and
Implementation
in
Other
Settings
The
proposed
research
ﬁndings
are
highly
relevant
to
public
health
as
we
seek
to
address
vaccine
conﬁdence
among
LTCWs.
Because
the
interventions
are
scalable,
study
outputs
will
interest
a
wide
variety
of
target
audiences
ranging
from
large
public
health
organizations
like
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control,
IHI,
and
the
Agency
for
Healthcare
Research
and
Quality,
and
organizations
dedicated
to
long-term
care
like
NAHCA,
American
Medical
Directors
Association
(AMDA),
and
to
LTCWs.
We
will
work
with
each
target
audience
to
create
dissemination
and
implementation
strategies
that
are
tailored
to
their
needs
and
interests
and
are
understandable
to
them.
Evidence
generated
from
this
study
is
also
likely
to
be
applicable
and
generalizable
to
future
COVID-19
vaccines
and
to
other
vaccination
programs.
5 . 3 . 1
A c a d e m i c
C h a n n e l s
Although
peer-reviewed
scientiﬁc
journals
are
not
commonly
accessed
by
LTCWs,
they
remain
the
primary
source
of
knowledge
and
dissemination
of
research
ﬁndings
to
inﬂuence
health
professionals,
policy
makers,
and
healthcare
systems.
Open-access
journals
will
systematically
be
used
to
ensure
that
LTCWs,
their
employers
and
other
non-academic
stakeholders
have
free
and
easy
access
to
our
ﬁndings
and
are
able
to
rapidly
and
successfully
implement
the
intervention(s)
and/or
enhanced
usual
practice
in
long-term
care
facilities.
We
will
also
present
the
ﬁndings
at
up
to
four
domestic
and
international
scientiﬁc
conferences
and
professional
meetings.
5 . 3 . 2
P r o f e s s i o n a l
o r g a n i z a t i o n s
a n d
h e a l t h c a r e
d e l i v e r y
s y s t e m s
We
will
prioritize
working
with
national
organizations,
such
as
NAHCA,
and
IHI,
and
utilizing
their
well-established
dissemination
channels
to
distribute
our
ﬁndings
to
LTCWs
and
other
community
stakeholders.
Speciﬁcally,
IHI
has
a
dissemination
engine,
and
we
will
collaborate
with
Alice
Bonner
from
IHI
in
our
communications,
who
has
worked
extensively
with
the
Age
Friendly
initiative,
which
has
gained
substantial
traction
recently.
We
will
also
create
newsletters
45
and
press
releases
using
lay
language.
All
documents
will
be
written
in
partnership
with
our
stakeholder
partners
and
SAG,
and
will
be
freely
available
on
the
study
website.
5 . 3 . 3
S o c i a l
M e d i a
a n d
L a y
P r e s s
We
will
also
use
social
media
and
partner
with
NAHCA,
which
consistently
engages
their
members
through
social
media,
to
disseminate
key
study
messages.
We
will
work
with
our
SAG
to
plan
an
eﬀective
social
media
campaign
using
regular
Twitter
feeds,
blogs
on
the
study
website,
and
planned
“tweet
chats”.
We
will
also
reach
the
lay
public
who
may
not
have
access
to
social
media
by
using
newspaper
editorials,
lay
press,
and
magazine
print.
We
have
successfully
used
this
approach
in
PCORI-funded
studies
before.
5.4
P ossible
Barriers
t o
Dissemination
and
Implementation
We
understand
that
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
to
implementing
results
in
routine
settings
is
engagement
from
LTCWs
and
the
organizations
that
represent
them.
To
ensure
that
we
have
sustainable
partnerships,
we
have
reached
out
to
recognized
organization
leaders
in
the
ﬁeld
of
public
health
and
long-term
care
facilities
(IHI,
NAHCA).
We
have
also
collaborated
with
multiple
stakeholder
partners
who
will
be
involved
in
all
aspects
of
the
project,
including
its
dissemination
and
implementation.
We
will
also
work
with
inﬂuencers
on
social
media
to
try
and
reach
a
broader
group.
We
also
recognize
that
language
may
be
a
barrier
to
implementation.
Not
all
LTCWs
will
feel
comfortable
using
an
intervention
written
and
delivered
in
English.
We
will
thus
plan
to
translate
the
successful
intervention(s)
in
the
most
commonly
spoken
languages
for
this
target
group.
5.5
Making
Results
A vailable
t o
P ar ticipants
In
the
ﬁnal
study
survey,
we
will
ascertain
participants’
preferences
for
receiving
(via
email
or
mail)
information
on
the
study’s
ﬁndings.
Once
all
study
data
are
collected
and
analyzed,
we
will
begin
developing
a
pictorial
lay
summary
of
the
research
aims,
methods,
and
key
ﬁndings.
Information
on
study
results
in
the
ﬁnal
lay
summary
will
be
emailed
via
the
email
address
participants
provided
at
the
outset
of
the
study
or
directly
mailed
to
the
study
participants
if
that
is
their
preference.
The
email
will
also
contain
a
link
to
the
full
results
publication
online
as
well
as
the
study
website,
which
will
contain
additional
information
about
the
study
and
its
dissemination
eﬀorts.
For
participants
who
chose
to
receive
the
summary
in
the
mail,
we
will
send
a
copy
of
the
published
manuscript
to
them
as
well.
In
addition
to
direct
communication
of
aggregate
study
results
via
email
or
mail,
participants
may
also
become
aware
of
study
results
via
the
broader
dissemination
eﬀorts
described
earlier,
targeting
community
stakeholder
organizations
(e.g.,
press
releases,
newsletters,
social
media
outreach).

questions
Statistical
principles
Confidence
intervals
and
p-values
P-values
≥0.0001
will
be
reported
to
4
decimal
places;
p-values
less
than
0.0001
will
be
reported
as
“<0.0001”.
The

Adherence
to
interventions
Analysis
of
both
intention-to-treat
(ITT)
and
as-treated
populations
will
be
performed.
All
participants
who
are
randomized
to
a
trial
arm
will
be
included
in
the
ITT
analyses.
Participants
who
adhere
to
major

criteria
for
their
primary
intervention
will
be
included
in
the
as-treated

Analysis
methodology
Aim
1
To
compare
the
impact
of
two
interventions
delivered
online:
1)
a
dialogue-based
webinar
(webinar)
using
the
existing
COVID-19
Option
Grid
conversation
aid
and,
2)
an
interactive
and,
dynamic,
and
multi-component
social
media
web
application
(social
media
website),
compared
to
enhanced
usual
practice
(link
to
Centers
for
Disease
Control
(CDC)
vaccine
website),
on
COVID-19
vaccine
confidence
(primary
outcome),
and
other
secondary
outcomes
among
LTCWs.
We
hypothesize
that
each
intervention
will
be
superior
to
enhanced
usual
practice
at
increasing
vaccine
confidence
(
Hypothesis
1.1
)
and
that
the
dialogue-based
webinar
intervention
will
be
superior
to
the
social
media
arm
at
increasing
vaccine
confidence
(
Hypothesis
1.2
).
Corresponding
analyses
Primary
outcome
The
primary
outcome
is
the
binary
classifier
of
vaccine
confidence
derived
from
the
three-item
Vaccine
Confidence
Index
(VCI),
evaluated
at
3
weeks
post-randomization,
which
will
be
analyzed
by
randomization
arm.
The
determined
binary
predictors
of
intervention
outcomes
will
be
compared
using
two-proportion
z-tests
to
identify
significant
differences
between
each
intervention
and
enhanced
usual
practice
(Arm
1
vs
Arm
3
&
Arm
2
vs
Arm
3
-
superiority
analyses)
and
between
the
intervention
arms
(Arm
1
vs
Arm
2
-
two-tailed
equivalency
analysis).
Secondary
outcomes
●
Change
from
baseline
in
COVID-19
Vaccine
Confidence.
Analysis
of
change
from
60
baseline
will
be
based
on
a
binary
classifier
whether
the
average
score
increases
(1)
or
does
not
increase
(2)
at
T1,
T2,
and
T3
versus
baseline.
●
Likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
vaccination
(others
not
vaccinated).
This
question
will
be
evaluated
using
a
Net
Promoter
Score
(NPS)
approach,
adding
one
for
each
positive
response,
zero
for
neutral,
and
subtracting
one
for
each
negative
response,
then
dividing
by
the
number
of
non-missing
responses
for
each
trial
arm.
NPS
values
will
be
compared
using
Wald
intervals
[1].
●
Likelihood
of
recommending
COVID-19
booster
vaccination
(coworker).
This
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
approach,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(any
dose).
This
will
be
evaluated
as
a
binary
classifier
compared
across
trial
arms
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(initial
series
completion).
For
participants
who
have
received
any
dose
of
a
COVID-19
vaccine,
this
will
be
evaluated
as
a
binary
classifier
compared
across
trial
arms
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
uptake
(booster
completion).
For
participants
who
have
completed
their
initial
vaccine
series,
this
will
be
evaluated
as
a
three
category
variable
(No,
Not
sure,
Yes)
compared
across
trial
arms
using
chi-squared
tests.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(initial
series)
.
For
participants
who
are
unvaccinated,
we
will
assess
their
intentions
of
getting
a
COVID-19
vaccine,
this
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(booster)
.
For
participants
who
have
completed
an
initial
vaccine
series,
this
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
COVID-19
vaccine
intent
(future
vaccine
recommendations).
Participants’
intent
to
get
COVID-19
vaccines
regularly
in
the
future
if
they
are
recommended
will
be
evaluated
using
the
Net
Promoter
Score
approach,
where
the
three
responses
–
Yes,
Not
Sure,
No
–
will
be
evaluated
as
analogous
to
promoter,
neutral,
and
detractor,
respectively.
The
question
will
be
evaluated
using
the
NPS
analysis,
described
above.
●
Feeling
informed
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
The
degree
to
which
participants’
feel
informed
about
the
COVID-19
vaccines
(have
enough
information
and
understand
that
information)
will
be
evaluated
using
a
continuous
variable,
calculated
as
the
mean
scale
61
score
across
two
items
((1)
having
enough
information,
(2)
understanding
the
information)
for
each
participant.
The
mean
of
all
mean
scores
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two-sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Identification
of
COVID-19
vaccine
information
and
misinformation.
Subjects’
identification
of
COVID-19
vaccine
information
and
misinformation
will
be
scored
on
a
scale
of
zero
to
four
and
treated
as
a
continuous
linear
variable.
Results
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two
sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Trust
in
COVID-19
information
from
different
sources.
Subjects’
trust
in
COVID-19
information
from
different
sources
will
be
evaluated
using
a
continuous
variable,
calculated
as
the
mean
scale
score
across
three
items
for
each
participant.
The
mean
of
all
mean
scores
will
be
compared
across
trial
arms
with
two-sample
unpaired
t-tests.
●
Change
from
baseline
in
secondary
outcomes.
Change
from
baseline
will
be
scored
as
a
binary
variable
with
an
increased
value
scored
as
one
and
a
no
change
or
decreased
value
scored
as
zero.
For
each
evaluation
after
baseline,
each
arm
will
be
compared
using
two-proportion
z-tests.
For
vaccine
and
booster
intent
questions,
where
the
intent
question
is
not
repeated
if
the
participant
indicates
an
increase
in
vaccination
status,
intent
will
be
imputed
from
uptake.
To
be
clear,
an
individual
who
is
unvaccinated
at
T0,
then
returns
at
T1
and
indicates
that
he
or
she
is
now
vaccinated,
will
be
presented
with
the
vaccine
intent
question
at
T0
but
not
at
T1.
Because
the
individual
is
now
vaccinated,
asking
about
vaccine
intent
at
T1
would
be
confusing.
For
analyzing
change
in
vaccine
intent,
the
individual
whose
vaccine
status
increases
would
be
considered
to
have
positive
intent
at
T1.
A
similar
approach
will
be
used
for
booster
intent.
●
As
treated
analysis
of
primary
and
secondary
outcomes.
Primary
and
secondary
outcome
analyses
will
be
repeated,
limited
to
the
as
treated
samples.
Aim
2
To
determine
if
LTCWs’
characteristics
and
other
factors
mediate
and
moderate
the
interventions’
impact
on
vaccine
confidence
and
other
secondary
outcomes.
We
hypothesize
that
increased
perceptions
of
feeling
informed
about
the
vaccines,
identification
of
vaccine
information
and
misinformation,
and
trust
in
vaccine
information
provided
by
different
sources
will
explain
(mediate)
the
relationship
between
the
interventions
and
vaccine
confidence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes
(
Hypothesis
2.1)
.
We
will
also
conduct
exploratory
heterogeneity
of
treatment
effects
(HTE)
analyses
to
identify
whether
certain
participant
characteristics
and
beliefs
moderate
the
relationships
among
each
of
the
interventions
and
vaccine
confidence,
as
well
as
other
secondary
outcomes.
Variables
to
be
explored
will
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
baseline
vaccination
status,
religious
beliefs,
perceived
influence
of
others,
age,
race,
ethnicity
and
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19.
62
Corresponding
analyses
Mediation
analysis
We
hypothesize
that
the
relationship
between
participants’
assigned
trial
arm
and
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
will
be
mediated
by
the
effects
of
feeling
informed,
trust
in
vaccine
information,
and
beliefs
about
vaccines
(measured
through
questions
to
determine
each
participant’s
ability
to
correctly
classify
vaccine
information
and
misinformation).
Responses
for
these
three
variables
will
be
evaluated
at
each
time
point
versus
outcomes
by
randomization
arm
to
identify
differences
by
arm
using
the
Kruskal-Wallis
test.
Significant
relationships
will
be
explored
for
mediation
effects
in
the
primary
and
secondary
outcome
analyses
using
the
method
of
Barron
and
Kenny
[2].
If
this
results
in
a
significant
improvement
in
model
prediction,
hypothesis
2.1
will
be
supported.
Heterogeneity
of
treatment
effects/Moderation
analysis
To
understand
how
the
relationship
between
study
interventions
and
outcomes
are
moderated
by
participant
characteristics
including
age,
gender,
location
(level
of
regional
analysis
selected
for
appropriate
granularity),
educational
attainment,
race
and
ethnicity,
health
insurance
status,
health
literacy,
religiosity,
LTCW
role,
duration
of
experience
in
long-term
care,
extent
influenced
by
others
regarding
COVID-19
vaccination,
personal
experiences
with
COVID-19
and
the
vaccines,
and
baseline
vaccination
status,
we
will
evaluate
the
primary
and
secondary
outcomes
using
linear
and
logistic
regression
in
a
mixed-effects
model.
Exploratory
analyses
Change
from
baseline
in
COVID-19
Vaccine
Confidence.
Looking
deeper
at
the
change
in
vaccine
confidence,
analyses
will
consider
(a)
the
proportion
of
positive
(agree
and
strongly
agree)
responses
in
the
VCI,
(b)
positive
responses
in
each
of
the
three
VCI
questions.
Significant
correlates
with
demographic,
contextual,
and
study
variables
will
be
evaluated.
External
contextual
factors
.
Outside
of
the
study
surveys
and
throughout
the
trial,
we
will
monitor
external
factors
that
may
impact
participants’
views
and
actions
towards
the
COVID-19
vaccines.
This
may
include
monitoring
policy
and
mandate
changes
for
LTCWs
and
changes
in
the
nature
of
the
pandemic,
among
other
things.
Additional
analyses
.
Any
unvalidated
thresholds
utilized
in
the
primary
or
secondary
analyses
will
be
evaluated
for
sensitivity
to
the
choice
of
threshold
in
ROC
analyses.
Nonlinear
higher-dimensional
effects
and
interactions
among
variables
will
be
identified
by
identifying
positive
or
negative
outcomes
grouped
around
specific
baseline
characteristics
that
are
highly
unlikely
to
result
from
random
chance.
Duplicate
and
missing
data
Participants
must
complete
a
baseline
(T0)
survey
to
be
considered
enrolled
in
the
study.
In
the
event
of
duplicate
complete
T0
submissions,
the
first
complete
survey
will
be
used.
For
participants
who
complete
duplicate
follow-up
surveys
(T1,
T2
or
T3),
the
first
complete
survey
63
will
also
be
used.
In
order
to
be
included
in
primary
and
secondary
outcome
analyses,
participants
must
have
valid
primary
outcome
data
at
both
T0
and
T1.
The
study
team
will
endeavor
to
minimize
missing
data;
however,
it
is
possible
that
efforts
to
ensure
complete
data
collection
within
the
response
windows
will
be
unsuccessful
or
because
participants
may
choose
not
to
respond
to
one
or
more
questions.
Should
any
primary
and/or
secondary
outcome
variables
have
>5%
missing
data,
the
reasons
for
any
missing
data
will
be
considered
through
an
analysis
for
common
baseline
characteristics
of
individuals
with
specific
responses
missing,
those
who
were
lost
to
follow-up,
and
those
who
did
not
respond
to
one
or
more
evaluations
but
were
not
lost
to
follow-up.
Specific
questions
with
significantly
higher
rates
of
missing
data
will
be
reviewed
for
wording
bias
or
missing
response
options.
Based
on
these
considerations,
a
stochastic
outcome
set
model
will
be
created
using
multiple
imputation
and
Bayesian
methods,
as
appropriate,
to
provide
a
high
confidence
range
for
imputed
values.
Using
this
approach,
an
expected
result
and
confidence
intervals
will
be
produced
for
the
missing
data
and
the
resulting
analysis
of
the
full
data
set,
taking
into
account
the
statistical
uncertainty
attributed
to
the
missing
data.
If
available,
data
from
both
baseline
and
subsequent
follow-up
evaluations
will
be
used
in
imputing
missing
results
(e.g.,
responses
from
T0
and
T2
evaluations
could
be
used
to
impute
T1
responses)
through
multiple
imputation
regression
modeling
[ 3].
Response
rates
and
the
frequency
of
missing

the

and
as-treated
populations
will
be
reported
with
the
results.
Fraudulent
enrollment
Identity
verification
of
some
participants
will
occur
after
they
have
completed
their
journey
in
the
study
(using
TransUnion’s
TLOxp
veriﬁcation
service
).
We
will
also
conduct
a
rigorous
review
of
survey
metadata
(e.g.,
IP
addresses)
and
other
responses
to
identify
duplicate
survey
completions
or
other
suspicious
survey
activity
[4,5].
Upon
discovery
of
compelling
evidence
of
fraudulent
or
illegitimate
enrollment,
such
subjects
will
be
excluded
from
the
study
prior
to
any
outcome
analyses.
Methods
to
minimize
bias
A
naïve
analysis
will
be
conducted
at
the
end
of
the
study
based
only
on
the
unmodified
data
reflecting
ITT
assignments
of
eligible
subjects
to
establish
an
initial
estimator.
All
primary
and
secondary
analyses
will
be
conducted
based
on
the
statistical
analysis
plan.
The
statistician
member
of
the
DSMB
will
also
independently
replicate
primary
study
analyses
to
confirm
their
validity.
Multiple
testing
The
primary
outcome
involves
three
separate
tests,
one
a
two-tailed
equivalence
test
and
two
one-tailed
superiority
tests.
In
order
to
achieve
a
family-wise
error
rate
less
than
0.050,
the
Bonferroni
method
was
employed
to
set
a
p-value
threshold
at
0.016
for
each
of
the
three
primary
outcome
analyses.
For
each
comparison,
mean-value
separation
will
be
considered
significant
based
on
a
98.4%
confidence
interval,
which
translates
to
+/-
2.45
times
the
standard
64
error
for
the
sample
mean
for
the
equivalence
test
and
greater
than
2.15
times
the
standard
error
for
the
superiority
analyses.
Based
on
the
high
number
of
secondary
outcome
analyses
(cross-sectional
T1;
change
from
baseline;
ITT;
as-treated),
results
data
for
these
outcomes
will
be
viewed
in
more
aggregate
form
as
trending
in
one
direction
or
not,
rather
than
adopting
a
specific
Bonferroni-corrected
p-value
threshold.

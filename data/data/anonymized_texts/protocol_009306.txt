Abstract:     
Worldwide, 96 million indwelling urethral catheters sold annually; 24 million of which are sold 
in USA.
1  25% of hospitalized patients have a urinary catheter placed at some point during their 
stay2.  Additionally, catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) is the 2nd leading cause of 
nosocomial infections with 20% of hospital acquired bacteremia arising from urinary tract infection 
(UTI)3.  The incidence of bacteriuria is estimated to be 3 to 10%2, 4 per day of catheterization. 
 
Adverse consequences of CAUTI include local and systemic morbidity, secondary bacteriuria, 
death, increased antimicrobial -resistance, and increased health care costs.  Bacteremia complicating 
bacteriuria has been reported in up to 4% of patients.5, 6 Given the significant prevalence and 
morbidity of CAUTI, many strategies have been suggested to reduce CAUTI.  These have included 
irrigation of the bladder, instilling antimicrobial agents in the drainage bag and rigorously cleaning the meatus.  None of these strategies have proven to be effective. 
7 
 
Other attempts to red uce CAUTI include the development of different types of catheters. 
Standard indwelling catheters are made from a variety of materials including polyvinyl chlorine, plastic, plain latex, polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone elastomer, pure silicone hydrogel an d polymer 
hydromer
8.  More recently, specialized catheters have been developed which involve coating the 
inner, outer or both surfaces of the catheter with antimicrobial materials9. These materials can be 
antibiotic or antiseptic with the most common antiseptic material used being silver. Silver ions are bactericidal, are used safely when appl ied topically to humans and used in controlling infections
10.  
 
Previous studies of latex- based catheters have demonstrated that use of silver alloy impregnated 
catheters reduced the incidence of CAUTI.11.  The magnitude of this reduction has been reported to 
range from 27% to 73%12-15 in prospective randomized trials.  These numbers are strengthened by a 
recent meta- analysis which concluded that silver alloy catheters significantly reduced bacteriuria by 
3-fold compared with standard catheters16.  Although the previous work demonstrates encouraging 
results in decreasing CAUTI, the studies have varied in patient population, clinical indication and definition of outcomes.  Moreover, there are no previous studies evaluating the effectiveness of silver alloy impregnated catheters for suprapubic use.

Urogynecology patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery require bladder drainage in 
the immediate post-operative period.  This can be achi eved by placement of either a transurethral or 
suprapubic catheter (SPC).  Although the SPC is more invasive compared to a transurethral 
catheter, the SPC is used routinely in many gynecologic surgical practices because of its’ many advantages.  These incl ude prevention of urethral trauma and stricture formation, decreased UTI
17, 
18,  increased patient satisfaction compared to chronic indwelling urethral catheters, less 
discomfort19, avoidance of urethritis20, maintained ability to void spontaneously, easier nursing 
care21, and shorter hospital stay18 .  Review of literature does not demonstrate any benefit with any 
particular type of SPC22. 
 We hypothesize that this study will show a statistically significant decrease in UTI rate among the urogynecology patients undergoing suprapubic catheterization with a silver -alloy catheter 
compa red to the standard catheter.  
 
Schematic Design of the Study: randomized control trial        
Aims:    
1) To compare the UTI rate among women undergoing urogynecological procedures  with a silver -
alloy suprapubic catheter compared to the standard  supra-pubic catheter.  
2) To identify risk factors predisposing patients to suprapubi c CAUTI .  
Methods   
Description of Recruitment Methods:    
How will subjects be identified?   
Individuals who are being scheduled for a surgery which  routinely requires 
placement of suprapubic catheter intraoperatively (i.e. abdominal sacrocolpopexy, anterior 
vaginal colporrhaphy, Burch colposuspension with and without mid -urethral sling) , will be 
approached about participating in the study in the pre-operative urogynecology c linic.   
How will subjects  be contacted?     
Subjects will be contacted in the Urogynecology clinic during the pre-operative 
visit.  They will also be contacted during their routine 6- week follow -up post- operative visit 
in Urogynecology clinic.  Additionall y, if a patient has symptoms of a UTI or seeks medical 
treatment for a UTI during the 6 week post-operative period, we will ask the patient to 
contact the study team.

 Step-by-Step Schedule  (include all procedures, therapies – attach a table or flow chart if there are 
multiple procedures or visits and indicate the window of number of days in which the participant may return for follow -up visits ): 
1. Informed consent obtained pre-operatively to participate in study

24 hours, lack of gross hematuria, able to void voluntarily) 
5. If a patient has symptoms of a UTI or seeks medical treatment for a UTI during the 6 week post- operative period, we will ask the patient to contact the study team.  
6. Review of patient and medical records at 6 w eek follow -up visit for UTI and laboratory 
evidence, if available.  
7. If suprapubic catheter still in place, sending urine sample obtained by catheter for urinalysis, bacterial gram stain and culture.

 Statistical Considerations 
 Endpoints  
  Primary:  UTI rate  
UTI is defined  as: 
(1) any symptoms  (fever > 38°C, suprapubi c tenderness, costovertebral angle tenderness, or 
otherwise unexplained systemic symptoms such as altered mental status, hypotension, or evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome) requiring antibiotic  treatment  
(2) urine culture with > 10
5 cfu / m L 
(3) urine culture with > 103 cfu/ mL and evidence of pyuria (dipstick positive for leukocyte 
esterase and/or nitrite, microscopic pyuria, or presence of microbes seen on Gram stain of unspun urine)

Previous studies of transurethral latex catheters have demonstrated a reduction in CAUTI 
incidence of ranging  from 27% to 73%12-15 with use of silver- impregnated catheters compared to 
standard latex foley catheters.  Additionally, a previously published data from our center reported a 
CAUTI rate of 19%23 with use of standard foley catheters used for SPC in a postoperative 
urogynecology population.  Therefore, since there are no previous studies evaluating the CAUTI rate of silver -impregnated SPC use, a conservative estimate of 10% reduction will be used in our 
sample size calculation.
   
To obtain 80% power, with a difference in UTI rate of 10 %, then the sample size per group 
that we hope to recruit i s 400.  However, we anticipate 10% drop-out so we will plan to recruit 222 
per group, summing 444 total participants.      
Data Analysis: 
Continuous variables will be compared using a two sided t- test with alpha ≤0.05 considered 
statistically significant.  Binary outcomes (UTI vs. no UTI) will be compared using Fisher’s exact 
test.  Descriptive statistics will be used to describe continuous variables for the two types of catheters.  Multiple logistic regression will be used to adjust for confounders such as prior UTI, duration of catheterization , type of surgery performed, age, BMI, and comorbid conditions. 
Strength of a ssociation between UTI rate and confounders will be assessed by calculating odds 
ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
      
 
Human Safety Aspects  
Risks :    The literature review does not reveal any added adverse effects o f using silver-
alloy catheters, above standard non- silver -alloy coated catheters .  Since all patients, regardless of 
study participation, will have SPCs  placed post- operatively as part of routine care, we do not 
anticipate any additional risks to participants.

Analysis Plan: Pharmacokinetics of Advantage Arrest  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Document Date: 0 7/30/2020 
For the pharmacokinetic analysis, baseline serum fluoride and silver concentrations will be 
assessed and when appropriate, subtracted from other timed serum concentrations to adjust for 
baseline levels.   
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using Phoenix WinNonlin (Certara).  
• The time to peak concentration (T max), observed and baseline- corrected peak 
concentrations (C max), and observed 24- h concentration (C 24 h) will be reported.  
• The elimination rate constant (k elim) will be determined by nonlinear regression with a 
minimum of 3 time points with decreasing concentrations over time observed after the 
peak concentration. 
• Half-life (t 1/2) will be calculated as ln(2)/k elim. 
• Area under the curve (AUC): The 24- hour AUC (AUC 0-24 hr) will be calculated using a log-
linear trapezoidal rule of baseline- corrected serum concentrat ions from time = 0 to 24 h. 
The AUC 0-∞ will be calculated using a log- linear trapezoidal rule of baseline- corrected 
serum concentrations and extrapolated to infinite time by C 24hour/kelim, where C 24hour is the 
24 hour concentration.  
• The percent extrapolat ed AUC will be calculated as (AUC 0−∞ − AUC 0–24 hr)/AUC 0−∞ x 100.  
• The total urinary recovery of fluoride  and silver  will be determined by multiplying the 
concentration measured in the urine collected over 24 hours by the total volume of urine 
collected over  24 hours.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using Excel to calculate the mean ± standard deviation for 
the pharmacokinetic parameters .  No statistical comparisons will be made  as it is a single arm 
study.

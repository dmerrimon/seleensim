    SYNOPSIS 
  Sponsor:  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  Name of Finished Product:  AR-1105 (dexamethasone) implant for intravitreal administration  
  Name of Active Ingredients:  Dexamethasone  
  Study Title:  
A multicenter, open-label, safety and proof-of-concept study to  assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of 
AR-1105 in sub jects with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 
  Study Number: AR-1105-CS201 
  Study Phase: Phase 2a 
  Primary Objective: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 formulations of AR -1105 in subjects with macular edema due 
to branch RVO (BRVO) or central RVO (CRVO) 
  Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the effect of AR-1105  on Best Corrected Visual Acui ty (BCVA) by ETDRS methodology 
• To evaluate the effect of AR-1 105 on central retinal/foveal thi ckness (CRT/CFT) and subretinal fluid by 
spectral-domain ocu lar coherence tomo graphy (SD-OCT)  
  Study Design:  
This will be a 6-month (with fo llow-up, if nece ssary, to monito r residual implant), open-label, multicenter, 
adaptive study evaluating the sa fety, tolerability, and efficac y of 2 formulations of dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant, AR-1105, in a single eye of up-to 45 subjects between 18 and 80 years of age with 
macular edema (ME) sec ondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).  Since this study represents the first-in-
human experience with AR-1105, th e study will begin with an ini tial phase, during which time, up to a 
maximum of 5 subjects will be t reated with AR-1105 clinical for mulation 1 (AR-1105-CF1) and followed 
during weekly visits for up to 2 weeks post-treatment to assess  tolerability and safety.  Providing none of the 
subjects experience any clinica lly-meaningful ocular adverse re actions (possibly) relat ed to treatment with 
AR-1105 during the initial phase , the study will continue into the randomized phase.  During the randomized 
phase of the study, subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to  either AR-1105-CF1 or AR-1105 clinical 
formulation 2 (AR-1105-CF2).  Data collected from the subjects enrolled into the randomized phase of the 
study will be primarily summarized separately from subjects enrolled during the initial phase.  
Treatment will consist of a singl e intravitreal administration with AR-1105-CF1  or -CF2, each of which has a 
target dose of 340 μg dexamethasone (2 implants, single injecti on).  During the randomized phase, each 
treatment group will enroll approximately 20 subjects (i.e. in addition to the enrolled subjects who will 
participate in the initial phase on AR-1105-CF1).  An interim a nalysis of the first 20 subjects randomized to 
CF1 or CF2 may be conducted when they have completed 6 months p ost-treatment to assist in planning 
future studies.  When all subjects in each treatment group have completed their Month  6 visit, the primary 
safety and efficacy analyses will be conducted.  Data collected  through Month 6 on the safety and tolerability 
of each formulation, as well as e fficacy signals for each subject randomized, will be use d to determine which 
formulation will be selected for  further clinical development.  Any subject who presents at Month 6 with 
visible residual implant will be followed until they require re treatment (following the criteria provided for 
rescue therapy), or until 1 month after the implant is no longe r visible or to Month 9, whichever occurs first. 
 
Rescue therapy in the form of standard of care, will be offered  to any subject who, in the opinion of the 
investigator, requires additional therapy for their RVO due to lack of efficacy after Month 3/Week 12.  
Minimum guideline criteria for considering rescue are an increa se in CRT of 50 μm a nd decrease in BCVA 
of ≥7 letters at any time compared to baseline.    
In the case of elevated intraocu lar pressure (IOP) or cataract,  investigators should tr eat the subject according 
to standard practice. In the ca se of a cataract, removal should  be performed as soon as possible since BCVA 
could be impacted b
y the catarac t.

  Study  Population:  
A total o f approximately 45 subjects will be enrolled into the study at approximately 20 investigational sites 
within the United States, comprising a total of approximately 25 subjects treated with A R-1105- CF1 (up-to 5 
in the initial  phase and 20 in the randomized phase), and 20 subjects treated with AR- 1105 -CF2 (randomized 
phase only).  Subjects will be at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of ME secondary to RVO, each of 
whom meets all the inclu sion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
 Investigational  Product,  Dos e, and Mode  of Administration:  
•AR-1105 -CF1, 340 μg (target dose) administered intravitreally  (2 implants, single injection)
•AR-1105 -CF2,  340 μg (target dose)  administered intravitreally  (2 implants, single injection)
  Study Duration : 
Overall duration of the study is approximately up -to 18  months.  This includes up to a 1 -month screening 
period, followed by an enrollment  period  of up-to 6 months.  Each subject in both Cohorts  will complete a 
6-month primary evaluation period.  Residual implant assessment will be performed at Day 8 and at
Months  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and if necessary at monthly visits thereafter until they require retreatment,
following the c riteria provided for escape to rescue therapy, or until 1 month after the implant is no longer
visible, or to Month 9, whichever comes first.

  Efficacy  Assessments (se e Table  1): 
Assessed by evaluating the following (see SAP and MoP  for details):  
• BCVA by ETDRS method  
• Central Retinal /Foveal  Thickness (CRT /CFT ) as assessed by SD -OCT

• Percentage of subjects requiring rescue therapy  overall and by visit 
Other se condary efficacy analyses may be carried out as described in th e study SAP . 
Statistical  Methods:  
 
 
Sample Size 
This study  is not powered to detect a pre- stated efficacy signal, but rather will be used to inform the design 
and power for future studies.  With a sample size of 20 evaluable subjects per treatment group , the study will 
have 9 5% confidence of ruling out adverse events with true incidence rates of 13.9% or higher within each 
treatment group .  That is, with 20 subjects in a treatment group, if an adverse event of a specific type is not 
observed, then with 95 % confidence, the true incidence rate of that adverse event is less than 13.9%.   
Safety Analysis: 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non- ocular treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by system organ class and preferred term for each 
treatment grou p.  Ocular TEAEs will be summarized separately for all study and fellow eyes.  A TEAE will 
be de fined as occurring after the first dose of study medication.  Serious adverse events and treatment- related 
ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will be summarized simila rly. Ocular and non -ocular TEAEs will also be 
summarized by severity.  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each visit using discrete summary statistics.  
Intraocular pressure  (IOP) will be summarized at  each visit, using continuous and discrete summary 
statistics, including change from baseline and the proportion of study eyes with an increase from baseline in 
IOP of 10 mmHg or more and the proportion of study eyes with IOP of 30 mmHg or more.  
Vital sign s and safety laboratory data will be summarized at each visit, using continuous summary statistics, 
including change from baseline.  
 
 
Additionally, a subset of the safety analyses may also be performed combining the initial  phase subjects with 
the randomization phase subjects.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The percentage of study eyes gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline will be summarized using discrete summary statistics, including exact 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by treatment group.  
Treatment group  comparisons will be compl eted using Fisher’s exact statistic and exact 90% and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using the Farrington -Manning score statistic.  Additionally, exact logistic 
regression will be utilized to determine treatment effect on the percentage of  study eyes gaining at least 
15 letters in BCVA from baseline after adjusting for baseline BCVA.  These analyses will be used to

Confidential  Page 13 of 59 determine differences in formulations  and to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between 
subjects’ data pre - and post- interim, to d etermine whether the data may be pooled .  
The efficacy summaries will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF), imputing missing as failure, and using observed data only.  Subjects who receive 
rescu e medication prior to the summarized visit will be imputed as failure for the summarized visits.  No 
additional imputation methodologies will be performed in this early phase study, unless otherwise specified 
in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).   
The p ercentage of subjects gaining or losing at least 15 letters at other study visits and the percentage of 
subjects gaining or losing at least 10 letters at each study visit will be analyzed similarly.  
Change from baseline in BCVA letters to each on treatment  visit will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics, including 90% and 95% CIs by treatment group .  
A linear model with change from baseline BCVA letters as the response, baseline BCVA letters as a covariate, and treatment group as a main effect factor will be fit to determine treatment group effect with 
separate models completed for each on treatment visit.  These analyses will be used to determine differences 
in formulations
 and may be used to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data 
pre- and post- interim to determine whether the data may be pooled .  Subjects who receive rescue medication 
prior to the summarized visit will have their measure replaced with their last observation prior to receiving rescue medication.  The least squares mean, standard error, and CI for each treatment group, and the 
difference between treatment groups, will be presented.  Additionally, analyses will be completed using 
individual two- sample t -tests and 90% and 95% CIs around the differenc e between treatment groups in mean 
BCVA and mean change from baseline BCVA.  
Median  time to achieve a treatment response of ≥ 15 letters improvement from baseline in BCVA and median 
time to rescue therapy will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methods with 90 % and 95% CI calculated using 
the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) .  The logrank statistic will be used to determine differences 
in time to achieve response between the two treatment group s to determine differences in formulations
 and 
may be used to  assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre - and post- interim 
to determine whether the data may be pooled.   Subjects receiving rescue medication will be considered 
censored on the day of rescue medication receipt.  Addition ally, the number and proportion of subjects who 
achieve a treatment response at each visit will be summarized.   
In all analyses, data from subject visits after receipt of rescue medication will be imputed using last 
observation prior to receiving rescue medication for continuous endpoints and will be imputed as failures for 
success/failure variables.

    1. INTRODUCTION  
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second -most common sight- threatening vascular 
disorder of the retina after diabetic retinopathy (DR) (RCO 2015 , Klein 2000).  C urrent 
estimates put global prevalenc e at approximately 16 million p eople affected wi th the disease 
in one or both eyes and around 520 new cases per million are reported each year 
(Rogers 2010, Klein 2000). 
RVO is the result of thrombus formation in the central (CRVO), hemi- central (HRVO) or 
branch (BRVO) retinal vein, often due to compres sion by adjacent atherosclerotic retinal 
arteries or vasculitis (RCO 2015).  The two main complications resulting from RVO are macular edema (ME) and retinal ischemia leading to retinal or iris neovascularization.  ME is 
a non- specific response of the reti na to a variety of insults and involves the breakdown of the 
blood- retina barrier at the capillary endothelium, which results in increased vascular 
permeability and subsequent leakage of fluids into the adjacent retinal tissues and significant visual distu rbances.  This reduction in vision may be reversible in the short-term, but chronic 
ME causes irreversible damage to the retina and permanent vision loss.  
Within the last 10 years, intravitreal pharmacotherapy has revolutionized the therapeutic options for ME-associated retinal vascular diseases, and particularly for RVO.  Current 
options for treating ME depend upon the cause and severity of the condition.  In the case of RVO, the goal is to reduce the amount of fluid leakage and decrease the edema, thus leading to improved visual acuity (VA).  Argon laser photocoagulation was used for many years to treat ME associated with BRVO, but was less effective in the treatment of CRVO, and was not successful in all patients ( Fekrat 1997).  Currently, two classes of medication are 
approved to treat ME following RVO – corticosteroids (such as OZURDEX
® dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant), and more recently,  anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
therapies such as ranibizumab (LUCENTIS®) and aflibercept (EYLEA®).  The anti- VEGFs , 
while effective at modulating vascular permeability,  do not address the inflammatory 
component of RVO however.  Corticos teroids have the advantage of targeting the three 
components of the pathophysiology of RVO;  reducing ME through inhibi tion of multiple 
inflammatory mediators, stabilizing  the blood brain barrier and decreasing vascular 
permeability (Zas 2017, OZURDEX PI).  Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 
(OZURDEX ) and triamcinolone (KENALOG®) have demonstrated ME reduction and 
impro vement in  VA when dosed intravitreally ( Cekic 2005, Ip 2003, OZURDEX PI ).  
OZURDEX (0.7 mg dexamethasone) intravitreal implant has been  evaluated in RVO  and 
demonstrated efficacy up to 6 months ( Haller 2010 ), although the peak efficacy is generally 
achieved by Month 3 ( Joshi 2013, Bandello 2015 ). 
While both classes of medication have demonstrated efficacy in RVO patients, the treatment 
burden is high, with the anti -VEGFs  typically requiring  monthly ( LUCENTIS  PI, 
EYLEA  PI) intravitreal injections, and the de xamethasone intravitreal implant typically 
requiring re-injection every 3 months ( Bezatis 2013 , Augustin 2014).  A corticosteroid 
implant that offered a longer duration of effect would provide the benefit of reducing the

    treatment burden on patients while treating the inflammatory components of ME that are not 
addressed by inhibition of VEGF.   
AR-1105 (dexamethasone intravitreal implant) is being developed at Aerie Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of ME following RVO.  AR- 1105 has been designed to provide  a longer 
duration of efficacy than the currently available dexamethasone intravitreal implant with a lower dosage of dexamethasone.  The proposed initial clinical trial would evaluate these AR-1105 formulations for safety, tolerability, durability, and al so collect data on efficacy 
signals including best -corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and anatomical markers of ME such 
as sub retinal fluid and central retinal thickness (CRT) in order to select the optimal implant 
to continue in clinical development.  The objective of developing a longer-duration (>3months) lower- dose steroid implant, is based on the hypothesis that such a product may 
afford some safety benefits (e.g. potential reduction in the incidence of steroid- related 
adverse events and a lower treatmen t burden with respect to the number and frequency of 
intravitreal injections required) without compromising efficacy. 
The potential risks to subjects receiving AR -1105 are: 1) the risks associated with the use of 
dexamethasone in general; 2) the risks asso ciated with the intra vitreal injection procedure; 
3) the risk associated with the use of a solid, biodegradable implant in the vitreous; and 4) the 
risks associated with the use of the biodegradable polymers used for the sustained -release 
delivery system. 
Risks to human subjects participating in this study are based on the findings from pre- clinical 
studies, and on extensive safety, tolerability and efficacy data extrapolated from published 
studies and the FDA approval of OZURDEX.  Currently, there has been no exposure to 
AR-1105 in humans.   
Any intravitreal injection can be associated with the risk of endophthalmitis, ocular 
inflammation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal detachments.  While 
investigators and study staff will be instructed t hat aseptic technique must be used at all times 
when handling the implant and applicator components, when loading the applicator, and when dosing the subject, there is an inherent risk of infection including endophthalmitis.  Similarly, as with other ocula r surgeries, there is a risk of cataract development.  Increased 
IOP is a risk due to both the addition of an implant into the vitreous cavity, and because the implant contains dexamethasone.  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, have been associated with increased IOP and the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. 
AR-1105 is formulated as a solid, biodegradable, rectangular prism-shaped implant of 
dimensions of approximately   The implant is designed to undergo 
slow erosi on of the biodegradable matrix of different poly D, L- lactic -co-glycolic acid 
(PLGA) polymers to provide delivery of dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone, like other corticosteroids, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that works by suppressing multiple genes which encode pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and enzymes 
and other proteins that are activated during the inflammatory process (Barnes 2006, OZURDEX PI).  Steroid molecules readily diffuse across cell membranes and bind to 
glucocor ticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm.  Thus activated, steroids control

    inflammation both directly, by suppressing transcription of pro- inflammatory genes thereby 
reducing the expression of inflammatory proteins, or indirectly (i.e. a non-genomic 
mechani sm) by inhibiting the effects of other transcription factors that regulate expression of 
genes which encode proinflammatory proteins.   
In pre- clinical studies, Aerie has evaluated multiple formulations containing various  
 
 
The duration of dexamethasone exposure in  ocular tissues following intravitreal (IVT ) 
injection in rabbits was evaluated for 2 different clinical formulations of AR-1105 implants 
and for  OZURDEX implants.  Both AR-1105 implant formulations, AR-1105-CF1 and 
AR-1105- CF2, were  well -tolerated and there were no mortalities or significant adverse 
clinical observations in the study. Isolated findings, including retinal damage from implant contact during IVT injection, were 
noted in both AR-1105- treated and OZURDEX- treated animals.   
 
 
  This study demonstrate d that the AR -1105-CF1 and AR-1105- CF2 
implants were well -tolerated in  the pigmented rabbit and provided a longer duration of 
sustained release of dexamethasone compared to OZURDEX. 
The 2 clinical formulations of AR -1105 were also evaluated in Sinclair™ miniature-pigs to 
determine the ocular and systemic distribution and duration of dexamethasone tissue exposure following IVT injection.  Half -length (350 µg) OZURDEX was used as a positive 
control.   The dexamethasone IVT implants AR -1105-CF1 and AR-1105- CF2 were well -
tolerated .  Isolated ocular observations were noted from the  IVT injection procedure, 
including incidences of subconjunctival bleeding, blood on the end of an implant, and the presence of blood in the vitreous chamber after the dosing procedure.  The ocular observations were  attributed to the IVT injection procedur e and did not appear to be test 
article related , or pose any risk affecting the pharmacokinetic ( PK) or ocular distribution 
results.  Compared to the OZURDEX implant, the AR-1105 implants degraded at a slower rate and provided a longer duration of dexamethasone exposure in ocular tissues.  Fundus imaging showed that both AR-1105-CF1 and AR-1105- CF2 implants were visible and 
partially -degraded at Week 10.  In contrast, the OZURDEX implant was  either not visible or 
highly degraded by Week 6.

    2. STUDY O BJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  Objective (s) 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 formulations of AR-1105 in subjects with macular 
edema due to BRVO or CRVO  
2.2 Secondary  Objective (s) 
• To evaluate the effect of AR -1105 on BCVA by early treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy study ( ETDRS ) methodology 
• To evaluate the effect of AR -1105 on CRT /CFT and subretinal fluid by spectral -
domain ocular coherence tomography (SD- OCT)  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a 6 -month (with follow-up, if necessary, to monitor residual implant), open-
label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 formulations of dexamethasone intravitreal implant, AR-1105, in a single eye of up-to 45 subjects between 18 and 80 years of age with ME  secondary to RVO .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Data collected through Month 6 on the safety and tolerability of each for mulation, as well as 
efficacy signals for each subject randomized, will be used to determine which formulation will be selected for further clinical development.   Any  subject who presents at Month 6 with

    visible residual implant will be followed until they  require retreatment (following the criteria 
provided for rescue therapy), or until 1 month after the implant is no longer visible or to 
Month 9, whichever occurs first. 
Rescue therapy in the form of standard of care will be offered to any subject who, in the 
opinion of the investigator, requires additional therapy for their RVO due to lack of efficacy after Month 3/Week 12.  Minimum guideline criteria for consideration of rescue are an increase in CRT  of 50 μm and decrease in BCVA of ≥7 letters at any time compared to 
baseline.  
In the case of elevated IOP or cataract, investigators should treat the subject according to 
standard practice . In the case of a cataract, removal should be performed as soon as possible 
since BCVA could be impacted by the cataract.   
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
While current treatment options for RVO are effective for many patients, the treatment burden  is high .  This study is designed to enable selection of the optimal AR -1105 
formulation to continue with further cl inical development.  The optimal formulation will 
provide strong efficacy and a long duration of effect.  The hypothesis is that a longer (>3 months) sustained release should necessitate less frequent intravitreal injections, and a 
lower steroid dose would potentially result in fewer, or less -frequent steroid -associated AEs 
without compromising effectiveness.  Taken together these attributes would reduce the 
burden of treatment.  The study is design ed to inform decisions on further development of 
AR-1105 as safely and efficiently  as possible.   
 
 
 
 
3.3 Study Duration and Dates  
Overall duration of the study is approximately 18 months.  This includes up to a 1-month screening period, followed by an enrollment period of up-to 6 months.  Each subject in both 
treatment groups will complete a 6 -month primary evaluation period.  Residual implant 
assessment will be performed on Day 8 and at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and if necessary at 
monthly visits thereafter until the subject requires retreatment, or to 1 month after the implant 
is no longer visible, or to Month 9, whichever comes first.

childbearing potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or 3 months post-surgical sterilization.  Male subjects with a female partner of child -bearing potential 
must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an effective method of birth control during the treatment period and for thr ee months after the subject has completed the 
study. All females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must not intend to become pregnant during the study.

    5.1 Description of Treatments 
5.1.1 Study Drug  
AR-1105 dexamethasone intravitreal implant.   Two different formulations will be evaluated 
in this study, AR-1105-CF1 and AR-1105-CF2. 
 
   
 
  Prior to dosing, the applicator, consisting of a handle and a 25-gauge needle 
hub, will be assembled and b oth implants will be loaded into the lumen of the needle under 
aseptic conditions.   The applicator will then be used to  deliver the 2 implants by a single 
intravitreal injection.  The procedure for assembling the applicator and loading the implants 
is described in the separate Manual of Procedures (MoP).  
5.1.2 Placebo or Control Drug 
 
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Two implants each containing a target dose of 170 μg dexamethasone (for a total target dose 
of 340 μ g) will be injected intravitreally in to the study eye.  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
A single intravitreal injection (with 2 implants) will be given on Day 1.  
5.3.1 Instructions for Administra tion of AR -1105 
 
 Following loading of the applicator with the 2 AR-1105 
implants, the procedure for administration of the implants is similar to that used for other intravitreal injections and should follow the guidelines on technique provided online by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO, www.aao.org).   
Precautions to minimize the risk of infection should be taken, and these include using appropriate barrier methods (sterile fields, drapes, gloves etc) and aseptic technique.  Preparation of the applicator is described in a separate Manual of Procedures.  Figure 1 i s an 
image of the fully -assembled applicator (comprising 25- gauge needle,  needle -hub assembly 
and handle assembly) as it appears prior to dosing.

Open -label.  
5.6 Permissible  Concomitant Therapy  
Other than medications specified as prohibited in this Protocol ( Sectio n 5.7.1 and Exclusion 
Criteria, [Section  4.3]), medications that are considered necessary to the welfare of the 
subject should be given at the discretion of the Investigator.  If there is any question whether a specific medication is allowed during the study, please contact Aerie.  
If required, the contralateral eye may be treated with standard of care to maintain vision.  
5.7 Restrictions  
5.7.1 Prior and Concomitant  Therapies 
The subject will not be eligible to enroll in the study if they have received an  ocular steroid 
injection or implant or any other peri-ocular steroid depot within 6 months prior to Screening.  Prior tre atment with fluocinolone acetonide ( e.g. ILUVIEN
®) or pan- retinal 
photocoagulation ( PRP) will exclude the subject.  Additionally, if a subject has a history of 
corticosteroid -induced glaucoma (or increased IOP associa ted with steroid therapy of 
>10 mmHg) t hey will be ineligible to enroll in this study.  Subjects who have had an anti-
VEGF injection within 2 months  prior to Screening will be ineligible.   
Topical steroid eye drops and the use of topical steroid creams on the face are prohibited during the study.  Systemic steroid  treatment (except via inhalation, intranasal or topical 
transdermal administration , providing the dose has remained stable for the 1 month prior to

    The study treatments should be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C/ 36°F to 46°F).  Temperature 
of the study treatment storage location at the site is to be monitored using a calibrated monitoring device and documented. 
5.11 Investigational Product Retention at Study Site  
Following dosing, the entire applicator assembly should be disposed- of in a sharps container .  
All other components of each patient kit should be retained at the site and available for 
reconciliation by the Sponsor/Sponsor representatives. 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures in the treatment period the study will be discussed with each 
subject and subjects wishing to participate must give written informed consent.  The verbal explanation of the study will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, may ask for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject should be given time to reflect.  Subjects and/or legally authorized representative then will be required to sign and date the informed consent form. 
The informed consent form must have received approval/favorable review by a properly 
constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC) prior to 
use.  A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to each subject.  The original signed and dated informed consent document must be maintained in the study files at 
the Investigator’s site.   
The Investigator or staff is responsible for ensuring that no subject undergoes any study 
related examination or activity before the subject has given written informed consent.  It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, and should be notified that discontinuation from the study will not impact on their subsequent care.   
6.2 Medical History  
Demographic data and details of any ongoing medication use will be collected and recorded.  
In addition, the number of prior treatments for RVO (anti- VEGF or corticosteroid) and the 
frequency of historical retreatment should be recorded.  Any medications the subject took but 
discontinued within the 30 days prior to screening also will be recorded.  Significant , relevant  
(to the condition under investigation) medical history will be collected and any current

Confidential  Page 33 of 59  
    underlying medical conditions, including those that began within the last 30 days and which 
may have resolved before screening, additionally must be recorded.   
6.3 Vital Signs  
Subject heart rate will be measured at screening, and during each subsequent study visit 
attended by the subject.  Heart rate will be determined only once during each study visit by 
the method described in the M oP. 
Blood pressure will be measured once for each subject after the subject heart rate has been determined , with the subject in a sitting position.  A mechanical or digital 
sphygmomanometer may be used, but effort should be made to use the same instrument and the same arm of the subject for each reading.  Blood pressure will be determined only once during each study visit by the method described the M oP. 
6.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.4.1 Laboratory Parameters 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted at any time prior to randomization for females of child-bearing potential. A female of child -bearing potential is defined as a n adult woman unless 
she is 1-year post -menopausal or 3 months post-surgical sterilization. Any female who is 
pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of birth control will be excluded from the study.  All females o f childbearing potential must have a 
negative pregnancy test result at the screening examination or at any time prior to Visit 2  
(randomization, Day 1, baseline) and must not intend to become pregnant during the study. 
Chemistry  and hematology laboratory a nalyses will be performed  according to those 
described in the separate Laboratory Manual.  
The clinical laboratory results must be reviewed by the Investigator prior to subject 
enrollment, and the tests CANNOT be indicative of any clinically significant di sease in the 
opinion of the Investigator. 
6.4.2 Sample Collection, Storage and Shipping  
Details for the preparation and shipment of samples and reference ranges will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.5 Dispensing Investigational Product  
Investigational product will be administered only by trained personnel , under aseptic 
conditions in an operating room, surgical suite or office using sterile technique as described 
briefly in Section 5.3.1, and in detail in the MoP .

    6.6 Efficacy Assessments  
Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) will be assessed by the ETDRS  method.  Subjects will 
have their visual acuity measured in a 4 -meter lane under standard illumination by a certified 
examiner reading a standard ETDRS chart.  Subjects will undergo m anifest  refract ion for 
each BCVA evaluation at each visit.  The visual acuity lane will be certified , as will the 
visual acuity examiner prior to study initiation.  Exact specifications for the visual acuity 
lane, illumination, charts, light box and refraction lens are detailed in the MoP.  
Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating the following (see Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP] 
and MoP for det ails): 
• BCVA by ETDRS method  
• Central Retinal/Foveal Thickness (CRT/CFT) as assessed by SD -OCT (Heidelberg or 
Zeiss instruments – see Section  4.2 and MoP) 
• Fluorescein Angiography and Fundus exam 
• Percentage of subjects requiring rescue therapy overall and by visit 
Other secondary efficacy analyses may be carried out as described in the study SAP . 
6.7 Safety  Assessments  
Assessed by evaluating changes from baseline in the following (for specific details on 
instrumentation and Imaging assessments, refer to the MoP): 
• IOP by Goldmann applanation tonometry 
• BCVA by ETDRS method  
• 3 field Fundus Photography (FP) 
• Gonioscopy 
• Slit-lamp biomicroscopy 
• Dilated fundus examination • Retinal thickness by SD -OCT  (Cirrus (Zeiss), or Spectralis (Heidelberg) instrument)  
• Fluorescein Angiography (FA)  
• Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) • Non- fasting clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and hematology) 
• Serum or urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential  
• Adverse Events (AEs)

    6.8 Performing Adverse Event (AE) Assessments  
This includes assessment of AE severity and rel ationship to investigational product.  AE 
information may be volunteered by the subject or solicited by study personnel through non-
leading questions. 
All AEs occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective case report form ( CRF ).  Adverse events should be 
documented from the time the subject signs the informed consent until 30 days after the 
subject’s last study visit .  
If a subject has an ongoing AE at the time of study completion, the ongoing AE must be followed-up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
Documentation of AE s/adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, action(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome.  The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event  (AE) . Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) . Any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable 
possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE . Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certa inty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR. An AE or SAR is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places 
the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) . An AE or 
SAR is considered ‘‘serious’’ if,  in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE , patient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disrup tion of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, 
based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Confidential  Page 36 of 59  
    Note:  In the present study, Investigators are asked to report any loss in BCVA of ≥3 lines as 
a SAE.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR. An AE or SAR is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it 
is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB)  ‘Reference Safety Inf ormation’ or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the IB  referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Si milarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB  listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs  that ar e mentioned in t he IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Note: If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the administration  of study medication), it should be recorded as an AE .  
Note: Any medical condition present prior to administration of the  study medication which 
remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE  at subsequent visits. 
6.8.1 Timing  
The AEs occurring during the study must be documented, regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship.  AEs should be documented from the time the subject signs and dates the patient consent form until subject participation in the study has been completed.  If a subject has one or more ongoing AEs at the time of study completion, the subject must be followed 
and provided appropriate medical care until the sign(s) and/or symptoms(s) of the AE have 
remitted or stabilized in  the opinion of the Investigator. 
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE eCRF:  
1. Action Taken with Study Drug:  
• None 
• Investigational Product Discontinued 
2. Other Action Taken:  
• None • Non-Drug Therapy 
• New OTC or Rx Drug Added  
• Hospitalized less than 24 hours

Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 37 of 59  
    • Hospitalized greater than or equal to 24 hours 
3. Outcome of an adverse event is coded as:  
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
6.8.2 Severity  
Severity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the 
subject.  The assessment o f severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 1 = Mild:  present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
2 = Moderate:  bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe:  incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In both cases, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   
Please note: a severe AE is not the same as a serious AE.  Seriousness of an AE (NOT 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section  6.8.7.1 
for further information on serious AEs [SAEs]). 
6.8.3 Relationship  
The study medication r elationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by the 
Investigator using these explanations:  
• Not Related:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease o r therapy administered to 
the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product. 
  
AR-1105  (dexamethasone) implant for intravitreal administration   
Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 38 of 59  
    • Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by other etiologies such as 
participant’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study medication. 
• Possibly Related:  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject. 
• Related:   The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be reasonably explained  by other factors such as subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
6.8.4 Expectedness 
Since there is currently no human experience with AR-1105, expectedness of AEs that may 
be associated with AR -1105 are based on pre- clinical data with this prod uct, and published 
data on OZURDEX. 
Intravitreal injections have been associated with the risk of infection, inflammation, 
increased IOP and ret inal detachment.  It is required  that AR -1105 will be administered using 
good sterile technique  and that the sub ject will be adequately anesthetized, but there will still 
be inherent risk associated with the procedure, including endophthalmitis and injection- site 
reactions (pain, inflammation).  
The most-common events noted in studies with rabbits and monkeys were conjunctival 
changes and vitreous hemorrhage associated with the procedure.  Additionally, ocular discharge and eye discoloration were observed but were not deemed to be AEs.  No post-
injection changes were observed in the retina, or in IOP.  Other  findings during follow-up 
were consistent with known class-effects of corticosteroids, including decreased white blood cell counts, decreased blood concentrations of urea, creatinine and phosphorus, and adrenal cortical atrophy.  
In the PI  and SmPC  for OZURDEX the most commonly- reported AEs during clinical trials 
are listed as increased IOP and conjunctival hemorrhage.  Other AEs reported included eye 
pain, conjunctival hyperemia, ocular hypertension, cataract, vitreous detachment, visual 
disturbance and vitreous fl oaters and headache.  Adverse events reported during the studies 
that were associated with the procedure, rather than the implant or dexamethasone treatment

Confidential  Page 39 of 59  
    included vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous opacity, eye pain, photopsia, conjunctival edema, 
anterior c hamber cells and conjunctival hyperemia. 
6.8.5 Clinical Significance  
Determination of the significance of any AE  for a particular subject, and in the context of the 
entire study, is the responsibility of the Investigator.  The Sponsor additionally has overall responsibility for the safety of all subjects, and timely documentation and reporting of any 
safety concerns.  
6.8.6 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Screening values will be documented as AEs.   
6.8.7 Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected Adverse Events, Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Events  
6.8.7.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions 
(SSARs)  
An Investigator must immediately report any SAE or SSAR (see  Section  6.8 for definitions) 
to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative using the SAE report form , whether or not 
considered drug- related, including those listed in the protocol or IB and must include an 
assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  The 
Investigator must report any SAE or SSAR that occurs during the course of the study or  
within 4 weeks of last study visit.  In case of incomplete information, the Investigator must 
provide follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.   
In addition, in the case of immediately life- threatening AEs or AEs with fatal outcome, or 
AEs that are serious, unexpected (i.e., not in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure) and judged 
related to the investigational product, or a loss in BCVA ≥3 lines, the Investigator must 
inform the Sponsor or Sponsor representative by phone within 24 hours of  observation or 
occurrence of the SAE.  
Pregnancies occurring in subjects enrolled in the study or in their partners, occurring up to 30 days after the subject’s last study visit,  must be reported and followed to outcome.  While 
pregnancy itself is not cons idered to be an AE or SAE, pregnancy reports are tracked by the 
study Medical Monitors .  Premature terminations  including miscarriage, spontaneous 
abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an SAE.  Other pregnancy complications should be reported as SAEs, if they meet serious 
criteria.  Should a pregnancy result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, a separate SAE 
report must be submitted  for the baby .  Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within 
30 days of the birth should be reported as SAEs, without regard to causality.

    The Investigator must complete the pregnancy report form and fax or email the form to the 
study Medical Monitors within 1 business day of knowledge of the pregnancy.  Following 
deliv ery or termination of pregnancy, the pregnancy report form is to be completed and 
submitted by fax or email to the Medical Monitors for the study. 
SAEs must be reported to the IRB/I EC according to the IRB/ IEC requirements.  
The contact information of the st udy Medical Monitors is as follows:  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
6.8.7.2 Reporting Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
The Investigator must immediately report SUSARs  that occur or are observed during the 
course of the study or within 30 days of the subject’s last study visit.  In the event of a 
SUSAR, the site must notify the Medical Monitors for the study (contact information in 
Section  6.8.7.1) using the SAE report form within 24 hours of notification, observation, or 
occurrence of the SUSAR, whether or not complete information is available.  In the case of incomplete information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible using the SAE report form.  If the event is reported outside of re gular business hours 
and collected by Trial Runners, their Medical Monitor will  notify the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor within 24 hours of knowledge of the e vent (contact information in Section 6.7.8.1).  
Reports will be evaluated by the Medical Monitor.  The IR B/IEC and Investigators at other 
study sites will be informed as required. 
6.9 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Use of any medication – prescription or over- the-counter (OTC) should be recorded at the 
screening visit, and captured on the appropriate CRF, and the indication noted as part of the 
medical history.  Treatments that are permitted to continue throughout the duration of the study will be recorded as concomitant medications at all subsequent visits.  Judgment of 
continued study participation by the subject, and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by the Investigator.  
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and during the study will be recorded in the CRF.  The name of the drug, dose, route of administration,

Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 41 of 59  
    duration of treatment and indication will be recorded for each medication.  For combination 
products (e.g., CONTAC®), the brand name is required.  For non-combination products, the 
generic name is preferr ed.  The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents 
(e.g., fluorescein) will be allowed, and individual documentation not required.  However, medications used as part of the intravitreal injection process other than topical or subconjunctival anesthetic and povidone iodine swabs (e.g. pre-or post- injection antibiotics 
or IOP -lowering medications) should be recorded on the CRF.  Any change in dosing 
parameters should also be recorded in the CRF.  
6.10 Removal of Subjects from the Study or Investiga tional Product  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time for any reason.  Removal of the investigational product should not be necessary, but if it is, it will be performed by vitrectomy, and the subject will be informed of this during the Consent process.   Participation 
is entirely voluntary, and only possible if the subject has signed informed consent.  Consent may be withdrawn at any time.  
6.10.1 Completed Subject  
A completed subject is defined as one who completes all visits planned through the 
completion of the Month 6 visit procedures. 
6.10.2 Non-Completing Subject

    review it  and discuss as needed with site staff, family or friends and return to the site to sign 
the form.  Once informed consent has been obtained, the Screening visit can continue. 
The subject’s demographic and medical history will be collected, and a record made of their 
current and recent medication use.  Vital signs will be collected and documented.  Blood samples will be collected and if the subject is a female deemed to be of child -bearing 
potential, a urine pregnancy test will be administered .  Male  subjects with female partners of 
child -bearing potential should agree to comply with the guidelines on accepta ble birth control 
described in Exclusion criterion # 23. 
Ocular assessments will be performed on both eyes (OU) unless otherwise noted.  The following ocular assessments will be performed  prior to pupil dilation  (mydriasis) : 
• BCVA using the ETDRS method and following manifest refraction  
• Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination  
• Gonioscopy 
• IOP measured  using a Goldmann applanation tonometer.   
Following mydriasis, the following procedures will be performed OU unless otherwise noted:

    If necessary, a second follow -up visit will be scheduled.  The format of this follow-up visi t 
should continue until either the subject requires re-treatment (i.e. standard of care rescue 
treatment), or until 1 month after no residual implant is observed, or to Month 9, whichever 
comes first, at which point the subject will exit the study.   
8. QUALITY CONTROL  AND A SSURANCE  
The progress of the study will be monitored by on-site, written, and telephone communications between personnel at the Investigator’s site and the Study Monitor.  The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or designee to inspect all CRFs; subject records (source documents); signed consent forms; records of study medication receipt, storage, preparation, and disposition; and regulatory files related to this study. 
9. PLANNED S TATISTICAL M ETHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment [and phase ( initial vs. 
randomized) for CF1] and visit (as applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum ).  All categorical study assessments will be 
summarized by treatment and visit (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.   All study data will be listed by treatment [and phase ( initial vs randomized) for CF1], patient 
and visit  (as applicable).  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye. Statistical methods will be more fully described in separate document(s) (i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This study is not powered to detect a pre-stated efficacy signal, but rather will be used to inform the design and power for future studies.  With a sample size of 20 evaluable subjects per treatment group, the study will have 95% confidence of ruling out AEs  with true 
incidence rates of 13.9% or higher within each treatment group.  That is, with 20 subjects in a treatment group , if an AE  of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the 
true incidence rate of that adverse event is less than 13.9%.    
9.3 Anal ysis Populations  
9.3.1 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received study medication.  This population will be used to summarize safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.

Confidential  Page 47 of 59  
    9.3.2 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT p opulation will include all subjects who received study medication .  This population 
will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all 
efficacy variables and will summarize subjects as treated . 
9.3.3 Per Protocol (PP) Populati on 
The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include those subjects who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the efficacy  outcomes of the 
study.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP and ITT populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treate d. 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be 
summarized and listed.  Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures, and RVO 
history will also be summarize d and listed. 
9.5 Primary Safety Assessments and Analyses 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non -ocular treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by system organ class and preferred term for each  treatment group.  Ocular TEAEs will be summarized separately 
for all study and fellow eyes.  A TEAE will be defined as occurring after the first dose of study medication.  Serious adverse events and treatment-related ocular and non-ocular TEAEs will be su mmarized similarly.  Ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will also be 
summarized by severity.  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each visit using discrete summary statistics.  
Intraocular pressure will be sum marized at each visit, using continuous and discrete summary 
statistics, including change from baseline and the proportion of study eyes with an increase from baseline in IOP of 10 mmHg or more and the proportion of study eyes with IOP of 30 mmHg or more. 
Vital signs and safety laboratory data will be summarized at each visit, using continuous 
summary statistics, including change from baseline.

9.6 Eff
icacy  
9.6.1 Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
• Percentage of subjects with ≥15-letter improvement (ETDRS) compared to baseline 
BCVA at Month 6 . 
Additional efficacy evaluations will include: 
• Change from baseline in Central Retinal/Foveal Thickness (CRT /CFT ) as assessed 
by SD-OCT at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6  
• Change from baseline BCVA in ETDRS letter score at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,  
• Percentage of subjects with a >10 letter improvement (ETDRS) compared to 
baseline BCVA at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 
• Percentage of subjects with a >10 letter worsening (ETDRS) compared to baseli ne 
BCVA at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 
• Percentage of subjects with a >15 letter improvement (ETDRS) compared to 
baseline BCVA at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5  
• Percentage of subjects with a >15 letter worsening (ETDRS) compared to Baseline BCVA at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
• Percentage of subjects requiring rescue therapy overall and by visit 
9.6.2 Efficacy Analyses  
The percentage of study eyes gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline will be summarized using discrete summary statistics, including exact 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by treatment group.  Treatment group comparisons will  be completed using 
Fisher’s exact statistic and exact 90% and 95% CIs using the Farrington -Manning score 
statistic.  Additionally, exact logistic regression will be uti lized to determine treatment effect 
on the percentage of study eyes gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline after adjusting for baseline BCVA.  These analyses will be used to determine differences in 
formulations and to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre- and post- interim to determine whether the data may be pooled . 
The efficacy summaries will be performed on the ITT population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF), imputing missing as failure, and using observed data only.  Subjects who receive rescue medication prior to the summarized visit will be imputed as failure for the summarized visits. No additional imputation methodologies will be performed in this early phase study, unless otherwise speci fied in the SAP .

    The percentage of subjects gaining or losing at least 15 letters at other study visits and the 
percentage of subjects gaining or losing at least 10 letters at each study visit will be analyzed 
similarly.  
The percentage of subjects requir ing rescue therapy overall as well as at each study visit will 
be summarized using discrete summary statistics, including exact 90% and 95% CIs by 
treatment group.  Treatment group comparisons will be completed using Fisher’s exact 
statistic and exact 90% and 95% CIs  using the Farrington- Manning score statistic.  
Change from baseline in BCVA letters to each on treatment visit will be summarized using continuous summary statistics, including 90% and 95% CIs by treatment group.  
A linear model with change from  baseline BCVA letters as the response, baseline BCVA 
letters as a covariate, and treatment group as a main effect factor will be fit to determine 
treatment group effect with separate models completed for each on treatment visit.  
 
.  Subjects who receive rescue medication prior to 
the summarized visit will have their measure replaced with their last observation prior to 
receiving rescue medication.  The least squares mean, standard error, and CI for each 
treatment group, and the difference between treatment groups, will be presented.  Additionally, analyses will be completed using individual two -sample t -tests and 90% and 
95% CIs around the difference between treatment groups in mean BCVA and mean change from baseline BCVA.  
Median time to achieve a treatment response of ≥ 15 letters improvement from baseline in 
BCVA and median time to rescue therapy will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methods 
with 90% and 95% CI  calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) .  The 
logrank statis tic will be used to determine differences in time to achieve response between 
the two treatment groups to determine differences in formulations and may be used to assess 
whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre- and post- interim  to 
determine whether the data may be pooled .  Subjects receiving rescue medication will be 
considered censored on the day of rescue medication receipt.  Additionally, the number and proportion of subjects who achieve a treatment response at each visit wil l be summarized.  
Cox proportional hazards may also be used to analyze time to response, including baseline BCVA as a covariate.  
In all analyses, data from subject visits after receipt of rescue medication will be imputed using last observation prior to receiving rescue medication for continuous endpoints and will be imputed as failures for success/failure variables.

    Additionally, a subset of the efficacy analyses may also be performed combining the initial 
phase subjects with the randomization phase subjects.  
9.7 Interim Analysis  
An interi m analysis may be conducted when the first 20 subjects enrolled in the randomized 
phase complete their Month 6 visit or discontinued the study.  Safety, tolerability and efficacy data will be reviewed during this interim analysis  to assist in planning of f uture 
studies.  A final analysis will be performed when all randomized subjects in each treatment 
group have completed  the Month 6 visit.

procedures are initiated. A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to each subject. The original sig ned and dated informed consent document must be maintained 
in the study files at the Investigator’s site.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject is subject to any study- related 
examination or activity before that subject has given inf ormed consent. The subject must give 
written consent after the receipt of detailed information.  The verbal explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or 
continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to c larify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask 
for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject may be given time to reflect if this is required, or if the subject requests more time.  Subjects and/or legal guardian will be 
required to sign and date the informed consent form. 
Signed informed consent must be attained prior to the conductance of any study procedures. 10.7 Subject Confidentiality

    direct access to the study subject’s original medical and study records for verification of the 
data or clinical study procedures.  Access to this information will be permitte d to 
representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law. 
A report of this study’s results may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities 
in any country in which the study drug may ultimately be marketed, but subject identities will 
not be disclosed in these documents.  
10.8 Study Monitoring  
Clinical research associates hired or contracted by the Sponsor will be responsible for 
monitoring the study sites and study activities.  Clinical research associates will conta ct and 
visit the Investigator regularly.  The actual frequency of monitoring visits depends on subject enrollment and on study site performance.  Among others, the following items will be reviewed:  
• Study progress 
• Compliance with the protocol • Completion of CRFs  
• Dispensing, storage, and accountability of investigational product 
• Source data verification  
• AE and SAE reporting • Essential documents contained within the Investigator’s site file  
For source data verification (i.e., comparison of CRF entr ies with subject records), data will 
be 100% source verified and will include as a minimum:  
• Subject identification  
• Informed consent (procedure, signature, and date)  • Selection criteria  
• Primary efficacy and safety parameters (i.e., AEs)  
Member(s) of the Sponsor or their designee will meet with the Investigator prior to the 
initiation of the study in order to assess the adequacy of the Investigator's subject population, 
facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize the Investigator with the protocol. 
A member of the Sponsor or their designee in the role of Study Monitor will subsequently 
meet with the Investigator after several of the subjects have initiated the study in order to

Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 54 of 59  
    ensure that the subjects are being properly selected, that adequate sup plies for the study have 
been provided and that the assignment of medication is properly recorded. In addition, the 
Study Monitor will verify that the Investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendments, if any, by reviewing the Investigator’s regulatory documents, source documents, ICFs , and CRFs  of study subjects. 
The Study Monitor will meet with the Investigator when all subjects have completed the Final Visit of the study, in order to collect unused study medications and unused suppli es and 
materials.  
Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will be done by the Study Monitor as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and documentation of the study. 
10.9 Case Report Forms and Study Records 
The initial point of entry of study data should be the subject source documentation.  The 
location and nature of the source documentation for all data collected in the study will be identified in the study files at the investigator’s site. In cases where no source documents will be used (i. e., data will be recorded directly onto the CRF without first being recorded on 
another document, such as a flowsheet, laboratory report, or other typical form of data reporting for later transcription to the CRF), the original data will be included in the  CRF.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data.  The person who has made the correction should place his or her initials as well as the date of the correction next to the correction.  Data may not be obliterated by erasure, redaction, or with correction fluid.  
Study data will be transcribed and recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system as electroni c CRFs (eCRFs). Security and authorization procedures consistent with the EDC 
system must be used. At each subject visit, the appropriate eCRFs must be completed.  Whenever an eCRF is used, be sure to provide all information requested including subject identification number and initials, name or number of Investigator, date(s), etc.  All applicable questions should be answered, and all data requested should be provided.  Those areas that require a response but are not filled in correctly are considered inco mplete or 
erroneous entries and will have to be corrected.   
Each authorized study staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the EDC system. Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will make entries and/or changes to eCRFs via a secure internet access. Each completed set of eCRFs will be reviewed by the Investigator who will then electronically sign and date the eCRF confirming that data for the subjects are complete and accurate.  
The study records must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license, and statement of Investigator qualifications. The name of each sub -investigator working under 
the supervision of the investigator is also required to be filed in the study records. In addition,

    each eCRF, subject charts/source documents, Investigator’s Brochure, protocol, protocol 
amendments, correspondence with the Sponsor/designee and the IRB/IEC , investigational 
product storage, receipts, returns and dispensing records, Delegation of Responsibilities Log, site training records, records of site monitoring, any unmasking documentation, AE and SAE reporting, IRB/IEC approvals, advertisements, written information provided to subjects, and subject completed ICFs will be included in the study records.  
If the Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer,  including written 
acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by the Sponsor.  
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
Per ICH E6 (GCP) R2 Section 4.5.1 the investigator/institution should conduct the trial in 
compliance with the protocol agreed with the sponsor and, if required, by the Regulatory Authority  and which was given approval/favorable opinion by IRB/I EC  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory 
acceptability or subject safety.  Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the 
protocol is essential.  
The site will contact the Sponsor for clarification of inclusion /exclusion criteria as needed prior to enrollment of  the study subject.  The Sponsor will document clarification requests 
and responses or their representative.  If a subject does not meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria during screening, that subject may not be enrolled into the study. 
If a protocol deviation is identified by the investigator or through site monitoring activities an 
immediate submission to the IRB/IEC may be required e.g. 24 or 48 hours.  The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these non- compliances should be 
reported to the relevant competent authority as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant competent authorities’ requirements, the protocol deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still re quired to be noti fied to the IRB/IEC, the specific 
protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress report.   
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the 
database lock. 
10.11 Access to Source Documentation  
The Investigator will permit study- relate d monitoring visits, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source data and documents.

    The monitor and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to monitor to discuss findings and any issues. 
Sponsor/designee will monitor the study to ensure: • Data are authentic, accurate and complete.  
• Safety and rights of t he subjects are being protected.  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other 
study agreements, ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.12 Data Generation and Analysis 
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database.  Query reports pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the clinical Investigator and the Sponsor for resolution.  The study database will be updated by the clinical investigator or their staff, in accordance with the resolved query reports.  All changes to the study database will be documented. 
10.13 Retention of Data  
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all records related to the study in 
compliance with ICH Good Clinical Practices Guidelines E6 (R2) section 4.9.4. 
Archived versions of the database will be saved by the Sponsor consistent with ICH Good 
Clinical Practices Guidelines E6 (R2) section 5.5.1 1, complying with whichever of the 
requirements is longer.  The Sponsor will notify the investigator when study records should be destroyed .  
10.14 Financial Disclosure  
The Principal Investigator and Sub-Investigators (as listed on Form FDA 1572) will provide financial disclosure information prior to participation in the study. The Principal Investigator 
and any Sub-Investigators will notify the Sponsor promptly of any required revision to their financial disclosure status during the term of this study, annually, or at the end of the study (if applicable) and 1-year post- study completion.  The Principal Investigator and Sub-
Investigators will provide updated financial disclosure information upon the Sponsor’s written request following completion of the study. 
10.15 Publ ication and Disclosure Policy  
Study information for this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers 
before enrollment of Subjects begins.  Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be identified for the approval of the clinical study report.  The

    investigator will be provided reasonable access to statistical tables, figures and relevant 
reports and will have the opportunity to review the complete study results at a mutually agreeable location.  Aerie will also provide the investigator with the full summary of the study results.  The investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate.  
The results summary will be posted no later than 8 months aft er the final primary completion 
date, the date the final subject examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome.  In addition, a manuscript will be submitted to a peer reviewed journal for publicat ion no later than 18 months after the last subject’s last visit 
when manuscript publication in a peer reviewed journal is not feasible, a statement will be added to the register for not publishing.

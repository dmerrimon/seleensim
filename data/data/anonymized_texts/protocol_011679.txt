Study design overview  Synopsis 
 
Title  Exploratory study assessing the response of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients to 
Non-invasive Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (NPNS) during opioid medication reduction. 
Study Device NTX Neuromodulation System, an investigational NPNS device developed by Noctrix 
Health, Inc. 
Study Objective  Assess  the response of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients to Non -invasive 
Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (NPNS) during opioid medication reduction 
Study Design 
 
An iterative opioid dose reduction is performed in conjunction with open-label NPNS 
administration. For each of the two step-downs in opioid dose  (Phase 1 and Phase 2), 
a 1-2-wk run-in period is followed by a 1-wk assessment period. The run -in period is to 
ensure that any opioid withdrawal symptoms unrelated to RLS have resolved and to 
confirm the appropriate instructions for NPNS usage (e.g. timing and intensity). Study 
participation is terminated at the first phase that leads to a clinically significant

increase in RLS severity or is otherwise not tolerated. Participants who tolerate both 
phases may have the option of an extension phase involving a third reduction in opioid 
dose . 
Study Population  Adults with moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) who are 
taking a stable dose of prescription opioids to treat RLS. 
Study Participation  
Duration Study participation duration in the main study period will typically be 4-6 weeks:  
Phase 1: 
  1-2 wk run-in    1-wk  assessment Phase 2:   1-2 wk run-in    1-wk assessment Study duration may be somewhat shorter, such as if Phase 1 is not tolerated. Study duration may be longer, such as if run-in period is extended or depending on 
scheduling constraints.

1. Background  
A clinical need has been identified of improved treatment for those suffering with primary idiopathic 
restless legs syndrome (RLS). Patients with RLS have a strong urge with sensations of tingling/pain, 
usually in their legs, and often present with a primary complaint of not being able to fall asleep 
regularly.  This leads to significant quality of life degradation, depression, daytime sleepiness, lack of 
productivity and a host of downstream effects associated with lack of quality sleep. 
1.1. Restless leg syndrome: Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that is characterized by a distressing urge to 
move the legs and in some cases, other parts of the body such as arms [1].  The diagnosis is made by 
a response to five hallmark identifying criteria instituted by the International Restless Legs Syndrome 
Society (IRLSS) [2], as quoted below: 
“1. An urge to move the legs usually but not always accompanied by or felt to be caused by 
uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs. 
2. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations begin or worsen 
during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying down or sitting. 
3. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations are partially or totally 
relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues.  
4. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations during rest or 
inactivity only occur or are worse in the evening or night than during the day. 
5. The occurrence of the above features are not solely accounted for as symptoms primary to 
another medical or a behavioral condition (e.g., myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, leg 
cramps, positional discomfort, habitual foot tapping).” 
Diagnostically, RLS is considered either primary, often occurring within families, or secondary, 
developing in association with other conditions (such as iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy or end-
stage renal disease).

In the United States, RLS is believed to affect more than 10 million adults and an estimated 1.5 million 
children and adolescents [3].  About one-third of those with RLS symptoms are bothered sufficiently 
enough to seek medical attention. Epidemiologic studies also show that women are at least 50% more susceptible to RLS than men and RLS is more common in older adults, although it can occur in some 
as early as the pre-school years.  
1.3. Clinical treatments available  
The current standard of care involves initial prescription of dopaminergic medications – such as 
Requip, Mirapex, and Neupro – which initially provide symptomatic relief but often become ineffective over continued usage [4].  Tolerance to these medications is rapid and well-documented 
[5]; approximately 10% of patients per year become refractory to these medications, and fewer than 20% patients have sustained benefits lasting 10 year s or longer [6]. It is also now understood that 
dopaminergic medications cause what is known as “augmentation”, or paradoxical progressive worsening of RLS symptoms that is much faster than the natural progression of the condition.  Due to 
augmentation, patients on dopaminergic medications require increasingly higher doses [7]. Maximal 
dosage is limited by an increasing risk of side-effects at higher doses, which include compulsive 
behaviors including substance abuse, hypersexuality, and gambling [8].  As a result of these downsides 
of dopaminergic agents, a minority of clinicians are starting to prescribe gabapentinioids (e.g. 
Horizant) as an alternative first-line of treatment; these medications do not typically lead to 
augmentation but confer risks such as respiratory depression [9], dizziness, and somnolence during 
the day. For the large subpopulation of patients who become refractory to dopaminergic medications – 
typically due to augmentation – there are no FDA approved treatment options and no safe treatment 
options.  As a result of tolerance, augmentation, and dosage limitations, RLS patients often continue 
to suffer from moderate-severe RLS symptoms while continuing to be reliant on high doses of 
dopaminergic medications to provide a small degree of relief.  To address the massive unmet need, 
the leading clinicians involved with RLS advocate prescribing off-label opioids [10].  The leading 
options – oxycodone and methadone, have well documented risks, which include addiction,

dependence, overdose, and occasionally death.  This situation is especially concerning because 
primary RLS typically starts in middle age or earlier and persists throughout life, thus patients may end 
up reliant on opioids for the final decades of their lives.   
 
1.4. Investigational Procedure  
The investigational device – the NTX Neuromodulation System – is a non-invasive nerve peripheral 
stimulation (NPNS) device developed by the Sponsor, Noctrix Health, Inc. and designed to stimulate 
the common peroneal nerve. Stimulation electrodes are positioned superficially and bilaterally on the lower legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is closest to the skin.  
This nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS 
symptoms. If successful, the trial will pave the way for a device-based therapeutic alternative that 
may be used to reduce opioid dosage .  
1.5 Rationale 
The NTX Neuromodulation System is a NPNS device designed to mimic the symptomatic relief that 
RLS patients experience during voluntary movement of their lower extremities.  One of the fundamental diagnostic criteria for RLS is the fact that patients report short-lived symptomatic relief 
during voluntary movement of their legs and feet [2].  This is conceptually similar to the gate-control 
theory mechanism of pain relief, wherein activation of large sensory fibers suppresses pain signals.  However, for RLS, it appears that muscle activation is especially effective – activating sensory fibers of the affected region of the body (e.g. via rubbing or touching) does not typically result in similar 
relief.  
Non-invasive electrical stimulation is known to elicit muscle activation – this feature is used by two 
types of approved medical devices – powered muscle stimulators (21 CFR 890.5850) and external 
functional neuromuscular stimulators (21 CFR 882.5810).  However, these devices tend to have 
distracting side-effects including paresthesias and phasic muscle twitches, and thus are incompatible 
with sleep and inappropriate for use in treating a sleep condition such as RLS.  In contrast, the NPNS 
investigational device tested here produces waveforms that are engineered to generate muscle

activation without these paresthesias and phasic muscle twitches.  Therefore, this technology may be 
compatible with sleep. 
The NTX Neuromodulation System stimulates the peroneal nerve at its most superficial position over 
to the head of the fibula bone to activate muscles of the lower leg including the tibialis anterior at intensity levels that are comfortable and non-distracting.  Such comfortable tonic muscle activation is 
designed to suppress RLS symptoms in a manner similar to voluntary movement – but unlike voluntary movement, may be compatible with sleep.  Moreover, the output waveforms and intensities of the 
NTX Neuromodulation System are similar to Functional Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulators and 
Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for treatment of pain, two classes of devices 
designated nonsignificant risk per 21 CFR 812.3.  Therefore, there is a reasonable expectation that the 
NTX Neuromodulation System will lack significant risks. This study evaluates the effects of NPNS  on the symptoms of RLS during in-home participant-
administered stimulation.  This approach is useful for evaluating safety, usability, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy in a realistic environment - thus identifying any and all barriers to effective and 
tolerable use. 
2. Regulatory Status  
Noctrix Health has determined that the investigational device in this study – the NTX 
Neuromodulation System – is a non-significant risk device under 21 CFR §812.2(b); this assessment was confirmed by Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) in a prior investigational protocol 
(20170487).  Therefore, an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from FDA is not required 
to legally perform the study described herein in the US. 
3. Objective  
The study objective is to assess the response of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients to NPNS  during 
opioid medication reduction.  Specifically, we are investigating whether the magnitude of patient 
response to NPNS is sufficient to enable a clinically significant reduction in opioid medication dosage.

a. Device capability: dependent on waveform parameters (see above), nominally 
30min-120min 
b. Protocol range: up to 60 minutes per session, up to 120 minutes per day 
5.2.  Instructions for Use and Administration 
5.2.1.  Route of administration 
The NTX Neuromodulation System is designed to stimulate the common peroneal nerve; 
stimulation electrodes within the device are positioned superficially and bilaterally on the lower 
legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is closest to the skin.  
This nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS symptoms. 
5.2.2.  Dosage and dosage regimen  
The dosage depends on the intensity and duration of stimulation: 1. Setpoint stimulation intensity.  The setpoint stimulation intensity will be the lesser of (a) the 
maximal intensity that the subject  reports is non-distracting and comfortable, as determined in 
the calibration session described in the instructions for device use and (b) the maximal intensity 
for each set of stimulation parameters, as determined based on device output capabilities. 
2. Participants will be allowed to adjust stimulation intensity from the setpoint, but only within a 
limited pre-programmed range.  For example, participant may increase intensity if symptoms are 
severe or reduce intensity if symptoms are mild. 
3. Participants may be instructed to administer stimulation each night or only administer 
stimulation when RLS symptoms are present. 
4. Stimulation may be activated for up to 120 minutes per day, depending on the timing, duration, 
and severity of RLS symptoms for the specific subject.   
5.3.  Contraindications  
The following are contraindications to device usage: 
• Diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder,  
• Active medical device implant anywhere in the body, including but not limited to pacemakers, 
spinal cord stimulators, deep brain stimulators

• Metal implant at the site of study device electrode application  
• Known allergy to device materials (or severe previous reaction to medical adhesives or 
bandages) 
• Cellulitis, open sores, or acute injury at or near the location of device electrode application 
6. Risks 
6.1. Investigational device risks 
NPNS devices such as NTX Neuromodulation System result in a known potential for the following anticipated observations, which are typically mild to moderate, transient in nature, and resolve over 
time. 
o Mild skin irritation from use of adhesive electrodes and/or secondary attachment mechanism. 
o Discomfort, paresthesia, or otherwise irritating or uncomfortable sensations during active electrical stimulation.   
§ This risk is reduced by calibrating the stimulation intensity. 
o Temporary interference with sleep while wearing the device: 
§ For some individuals, device may be uncomfortable, thus interfering with sleep while wearing the device. 
§ For some individuals, this device may interfere with preferred sleep positions, 
thus interfering with sleep during usage. 
o Temporary increase in RLS symptoms while wearing the de vice: 
§ For some individuals, this device may interfere with voluntary leg movements 
used to relieve RLS symptoms, thus leading to a temporary increase in RLS 
symptoms. 
§ In some cases, this device may otherwise lead to a temporary increase in RLS symptoms during active stimulation for other reasons. 
• This risk may be reduced by calibrating the stimulation intensity and/or 
adjusting the schedule of stimulation.

6.2. Risks associated with study procedures 
6.2.1.  Opioid withdrawal procedure  
Opioid withdrawal symptoms can occur during dosage reduction, specifically for rapid dosage 
reduction of short-acting, high-dose opioids.  In contrast, the protocol here involves gradual 
dosage reduction (approximately 25% per week) of primarily long-acting (e.g. methadone, 
oxycodone), and exclusively low-dose (below 60 MME) opioids.  Therefore, we expect a low risk 
of opioid withdrawal symptoms.  However, it is possible that one or more symptoms that are 
associated with opioid withdrawal [11] may occur, such as the following: agitation, restlessness, 
and anxiety, depression, insomnia, yawning, increased tearing or watery eyes, runny nose, 
sweating, shivering, trembling, or goosebumps, muscle aches or joint pain, nausea or vomiting, 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea.  Subjects will undergo a weekly investigator assessment and subjects 
with clinically significant withdrawal symptoms will be excluded from further participation.  Moreover, subjects with intolerable withdrawal symptoms will have the option to discontinue 
participation at any time and revert to their original opioid dosage. 
7. Adverse Events 
Anticipated observations (e.g. common treatment effects) and adverse events occurring during the study will be recorded. Descriptions of anticipated observations and AEs will include the date of onset, 
the date it ended, the severity, the relationship to study device, and the outcome.  All reported AEs 
will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting AEs, system organ class (where applicable), 
severity, seriousness, and relationship to study device.  
The study Investigator and Coordinator will evaluate, characterize and record in the Case Report Form 
(CRF) all adverse events (AEs) occurring in all subjects from the time of enrollment to study exit (or 
premature withdrawal).  Adverse events unresolved at study exit will be followed by the Investigator 
until resolution occurs or at least 60 days after the subject’s participation in the study is complete. 
AEs may be reported spontaneously by the subject or detected by the Investigator or Coordinator.  
AEs should be evaluated for diagnoses not just symptoms (i.e., “angina”, not “chest pain”).

In addition to verbatim terms, the Sponsor may categorize all AEs using MedDRA preferred terms (PT) 
and system organ classes (SOC).  Analysis may report both verbatim and MedDRA terms. 
7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, independent of its association with the 
investigational device.  AEs also include any adverse laboratory signs or physical exam findings.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE1) is any AE that: 
• led to a death, 
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that: 
• resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, 
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, 
• required in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or a body function 
• or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
A device-related SAE is an event meeting the SAE definition above that is also rated as probably or 
definitely related the investigational device. No device-related SAEs have been reported in prior studies. 
Note that an elective or pre-planned hospitalization for a condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not an AE. 
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect  (USADE) is any SAE that is caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application).

4 Probable An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study device; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness 
or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
3 Possible  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study device; but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, drugs, procedure, or other causes. 
2 Unlikely  An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study device; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the study device, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying illness, drugs, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects. 
1 Not related An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying 
illness, drug s, procedure, or other causes. 
* AEs occurring before treatment with the study device will be categorized as unrelated to the study 
device. 
7.3.  Adverse Event Reporting 
Investigators must report all SAEs to the study Sponsor and governing IRB within 3 business days or according to local IRB guidelines.  Investigators should call the study sponsor immediately upon 
becoming aware of the occurrence of an SAE.  The sponsor will contact the independent medical 
reviewer, to assist in assessing any safety concerns, if needed. The Investigator should be able and willing to provide further information on the specific event when requested by the study Sponsor.  If 
the Investigator learns of an SAE that occurs within 1 month after the subject completes the study, 
he/she should notify the Sponsor.  Investigators must also report all AEs to the governing IRB as 
determined by that IRB. 
 
Prompt AE evaluation: 
• protects the safety of study subjects;  
• aids in understanding the overall safety profile of the device;

possession of used device(s). All devices will b e returned to the Sponsor after the study is complete. 
9.  Device Deficiencies and Malfunctions Throughout the study, the Investigator and study staff will report and document all device deficiencies 
and malfunctions related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of the 
device.  This includes reporting of device deficiencies/malfunctions that did not lead to an AE but 
could have if: 1) suitable action had not been taken, 2) intervention had not been made, or 3) 
circumstances had been less fortunate.  If possible, the Investigator should return devices suspected of deficiency or malfunction to the Sponsor for analysis. 
10.  Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

and transmittal procedures.  Alternatively, a meeting may be conducted for several sites at a 
common location. 
• Interim monitoring site visit: on-site and/or remote monitoring visits will be conducted at all 
sites to assess the progress of the study and identify any concerns that result from review of the study records, study management documents, or subject informed consent documents.  To assure the integrity of the data, a representative number of individual subject records and 
other supporting documents will be compared to CRFs completed at the site to determine 
that: 
o The study protocol is being followed, and only eligible subjects are being enrolled; variances, 
if they occur, are recorded and reported as appropriate. 
o Informed consent is properly documented.  
o Adverse events are being reported appropriately. 
o Information recorded on CRFs is complete, accurate and legible. 
o Subjects failing to complete the clinical study and the reason for failure are properly recorded. 
• Final monitoring/Close-out site visit: a final visit to participating sites may be made by the study 
monitor, if necessary. Any ongoing responsibilities will be discussed with the investigator 
and/or site personnel as appropriate. 
At the close of the study at an investigational site, appropriately trained personnel appointed by the Sponsor will perform a close-out process via the telephone or on-site.  The purpose of this visit 
is to collect all outstanding study data documents, ensure that the investigator's files are accurate 
and complete, review record retention requirements, ensure final accounting of all investigational 
devices shipped to the investigator, provide for appropriate disposition of any remaining supplies, and ensure that all applicable requirements are met for the study.  The observations and actions 
made during the intervention will be documented and communicated to the investigator.

The Investigator should immediately notify the Sponsor of any audits of this study by any 
regulatory agency, and must promptly provide copies of any audit reports. 
10.7. Safety Reporting 
The Sponsor is responsible for ongoing safety evaluation in this study protocol.  Sponsor activities regarding safety include: 
• classification of all AEs 
• review of all AEs reported in the study 
• confirm site’s classification of AEs in terms of severity and relatedness to the study device 
• review of severity and relatedness with the study Investigator, especially when there is disagreement between the Investigator and the sponsor 
• review of device deficiencies and malfunctions, including determination and documentation of whether deficiencies/malfunctions could have led to an SAE 
• ensuring the reporting of all SAEs and device deficiencies/malfunctions that could have led to an SAE to the IRB and, if required, regulatory authorities in a timely fashion 
• informing all site Investigators in writing of all SAEs at all sites in a timely fashion 
• updating the risk analysis and assessment of corrective or preventive actions potentially required as a result of new information obtained in the investigation 
 
The Sponsor will evaluate all serious adverse events against US reporting requirements (Medical 
Device Reporting, 21 CFR 812) and Medical Device Directive (vigilance incident reporting) as per 
its standard operating procedures.  The Sponsor will investigate each SAE to determine whether the event represents an unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE, see Section 7).  The 
Sponsor will report any event to regulatory authorities, Investigators and reviewing IRBs/ECs as 
necessary. If an investigation shows that a USADE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the 
Sponsor will terminate all investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as 
possible. The Sponsor will only resume a terminated investigation after corrective actions have

taken place, site Investigators are informed and IRBs/ECs have been notified and given approval 
to resume the study. 
10.8. Case Report Forms 
Study data will be collected using standardized paper Case Report Forms. CRFs will be printed on 2-part NCR paper (or equivalent) so that both the site and Sponsor will have copies of the CRFs. 
Each CRF will be designed to accommodate the specific features of the trial design.  Modification of a CRF will only be made if deemed necessary by the study sponsor.  ACRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the 
collection and reporting of all data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms 
(source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, 
complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. 
The eCRFs must be signed by the investigator to attest that the data contained therein are true.  
The site will be provided with general CRF Completion Guidelines that can be located in the Study 
Operations Manual, which will assist in data entry and data issues/questions. All persons allowed 
to enter or change CRF data must appear on the Delegation of Responsibilities Log.  
The Sponsor will monitor CRFs to identify possible data errors. Data queries that arise on CRFs that 
have been retrieved from the site, will be resolved using a Data Clarification Form (DCF). All data 
discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock.  
10.9. Quality Assurance Audits 
Sponsor representatives or designees may conduct site quality assurance (QA) audits during the study.  The Investigator must agree to provide the auditor with direct access to all relevant 
documents and discuss any findings with the auditor.

12. Duration 
The study will be completed a maximum of 18 months after the study opens to enrollment. 
13.  Study design 
The study design consists of iterative opioid dose reduction relative to baseline opioid dose (the week prior to study entry).  Each Phase of the study includes NPNS usage and an opioid dosage reduction as 
shown in Table 3 below.  As discussed in Section 13.1, the baseline opioid dose will partly determine 
whether a subject is eligible to continue to Phases 2 and 3. 
• Phase 1 involves a total reduction in opioid dose of >=20% relative to the starting dose. 
• Phase 2 involves a total reduction in opioid dose of >=1/3 relative to the starting dose. 
• Optional phase 3 involves a further reduction in opioid dose.

13.1 Accounting for between-subjects variation in starting opioid dose  
 
The study has been designed to account for between-subjects variation in the starting dose and quantal 
dose of opioid medication, while also allowing calculation of standardized efficacy endpoints.  The opioid 
dose reduction process is complicated by that fact that that there are quantal doses of opioid medication.  For example, for methadone, which is commonly prescribed for RLS, the minimum pill size is 5mg and the 
quantal size is 2.5mg because pills can be broken in half.  
All subjects initially participate in Phase 1, which involves the smallest reduction in opioid dose of greater 
than or equal to 20% of the starting dose.  Subjects who tolerate Phase 1 without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms will advance to Phase 2, which involves the smallest additional reduction in 
opioid dose that also represents a total reduction of greater than or equal to 1/3 of the starting dose.  
Subjects who tolerate Phase 2 without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms will have the 
option to complete Phase 3, which involves an additional reduction in opioid dose.  Once the subject 
completes a Phase where no further reduction is possible (e.g. a subject reaches 0mg in Phase 1 or 2), 
they will complete the study at the end of that Phase.  
For example, in the case of methadone, the minimal quantal dose reduction is 2.5mg.  Therefore, for 
methadone (Table 4 ): 
• a subject on a 10mg starting dose would reduce to 7.5mg (25% reduction) in Phase 1 and 5.0mg 
(50% total reduction) in Phase 2.  The endpoints related to >=20% reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1 and the endpoints related to >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 2. 
• a subject on a 7.5mg starting dose would reduce to 5.0mg (1/3 reduction) in Phase 1 and 2.5mg (2/3 total reduction) in Phase 2.    The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1. 
• a subject on a 5.0mg starting dose would reduce to 2.5mg (50% reduction) in Phase 1 and 0mg (100% total reduction) in Phase 2.    The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1. 
• a subject on a 2.5mg starting dose would reduce to 0mg (100% reduction) in Phase 1 and complete the study at the end of Phase 1.  The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1.

Subjects who tolerate Phases 1 and 2 without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms and are at 
a non-zero dose of opioids will have the option to complete Phase 3, which involves an additional 
reduction in opioid dose. Table 4. Example of reductions during Phases  1 and 2 for methadone  
 
13.2 Run-in and Assessment periods 
 Each Phase involves a 1-2 week run-in period followed by a 1-week assessment period.  Assessment 
periods are primarily designed for endpoint  evaluation.  Run-in periods are designed for two reasons: (i) 
to provide a run-in phase to optimize instructions for NPNS dev ice self-administration (e.g. timing and 
intensity) and (ii) so that any opioid withdrawal symptoms unrelated to the RLS condition resolve prior to 
the assessment period.  Each run-in period will last a minimum of 1-week and a maximum of 2-weeks.   
The investigator is permitted to adjust the instructed schedule of opioid medication and/or NPNS usage 
during a Step-Down based on clinical evaluation of response to opioid treatment and NPNS.

Additionally: 
• If clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms unrelated to RLS become intolerable during 
the run-in period for a given Phase, participation will be discontinued and data from the 
subject will not count towards the efficacy endpoints for that Phase.   
• If opioid withdrawal symptoms related to RLS become intolerable at any point during a run-in 
period, participation will be discontinued and the subject will count  towards the efficacy 
endpoints for that Phase. 
• The investigator may decide that participation should be discontinued at any time if there are 
excessive opioid withdrawal symptoms, even if those symptoms are tolerable. 
• If opioid withdrawal symptoms become intolerable mid-week during a run-in period, 
participation will be discontinued.   
• In all cases, efficacy outcome measures CGI -I and IRLS will be assessed at study exit but will 
not be included in analysis of the efficacy endpoints unless opioid withdrawal symptoms 
related to RLS was the primary reason for discontinuation. 
• The Extension Phase is optional and requires approval by both the investigator and the 
participant.  The structure of this phase is similar phases 1 and 2.

15. Investigator Qualifications 
Investigators must have experience in the administration of opioids, as documented on their 
Curriculum Vit ae and/or in a statement of the investigator’s relevant experience, including dates, 
location, extent, and type of experience . Each Investigator must undergo training conducted by 
Noctrix Health, on the study device prior to study initiation. 
16. Study Procedures  
16.1. Recruitment 
Recruitment will initially focus on patients whose opioid medications are managed by a Study 
Investigator at the time of study entry.  Recruitment may be expanded if additional subjects are 
needed to meet the enrollment target.  Subject eligibility will be determined based on the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria detailed above.  Eligible applicants who chose to participate and sign the informed consent form will be enrolled in the study.  A pre-screening call may be completed prior to 
the first in-person visit (and thus prior to consent) to exclude ineligible applicants prior to the in-
person visit.  Patients not referred by the investigator may be contacted by the investigator to 
establish whether they meet criteria for clinical RLS; applicants who do not meet clinical criteria for a 
diagnosis will be excluded from remaining parts of the study.  Eligibility is contingent on scheduling 
constraints, such as research facility and research staff availability. 16.2. Informed consent  Process  
All participants must be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information for participants to make an informed decision regarding their participation. Participants must sign the IRB 
approved informed consent prior to participation in any study specific procedure, with the exception 
of pre -screening . The participant must receive a paper or electronic copy of the signed and dated 
consent document. The signed copy of the consent document must be retained in the study binder in paper or electronic format. The schedule of visits and procedures is provided in Table 2.   
16.3. Screening  
Potential participants will be screened for eligibility based on the criteria in Section 4 above.  A subject  
who is eligible and signs the study consent will be considered a study subject, and will be assigned a

study ID number, will be considered enrolled  and will count towards the study’s sample size.  A subject 
who withdraws or is removed from the study prior to receiving any study treatment will not count 
towards the study’s sample size.   
16.4. Pilot phase  
Up to 10 subjects may be enrolled in a pilot phase.  For each site, subjects enrolled in the pilot phase will precede subjects enrolled in the primary study.  Subjects enrolled in the pilot phase will be 
specified at the time of enrollment such that their data will not be included in the analysis.   
16.5. Baseline Assessments  
The participant completes an IRLS questionnaire describing their symptoms and experiences over the 
past week and a demographic/characterization assessment including questions about their history of 
RLS symptoms and medication(s).   
16.6. Device calibration and t raining 
During the baseline (Eval #1) visit, the devices are calibrated for the subject  and the thresholds are 
programmed into the devices.  The calibration process is designed to identify the maximally effective 
settings that are comfortable for each subject.  The calibration process is also used to evaluate 
Exclusion Criterion #10.  Therefore, subjects may be excluded immediately following calibration and 
prior to training and study enrollme nt.  The sponsor may administer the calibration and/or assist in 
administering the calibration. 
Following calibration, subjects are trained on proper usage of the device, including positioning of the 
electrodes on their legs.  Instrument(s) designed for marking the human skin (body-marking pen or 
temporary tattoo) may be employed to mark the locations of electrode placement. 
16.7. Study Treatment Description  
Study subjects are instructed to self-administer treatment for at least 30 minutes on each night that 
they experience RLS symptoms.  Study subjects may self-administer up to four 30-min sessions  per 
day, as needed based on RLS symptoms.  The instructions for timing of these “as needed” doses will be determined at the discretion of the investigator and research staff, based on the RLS symptoms experienced by the subject.

• Evaluation 16 (Assessment period): (7-days after last Eval. (13, 14 or 15)). Office follow-up to 
assess RLS severity (including CGI -I), NPNS usage, and opioid withdrawal tolerability. C omplete 
study exit assessments and close-out participation for the subject. 
Evaluations 1, 6, 11 and 16 are intended to be in-person and all other Evaluations are designed to be 
remote interactions (calls or video calls).  Evaluations 1, 6, 11 and 16 may be replaced by remote 
interactions to the extent needed to reduce risk to participants and to the extent that technology 
allows for remote interactions. The proposed follow-up timelines are estimates, and they can be 
flexible as needed, within a +/- window of two days for each evaluation.   The schedule of each subjective study-related assessment, including endpoints, are shown in Table 
5A below.  Participants in the Extension Phase will complete an additional schedule of assessments as 
illustrated in Table 5B, which follow a similar structure to the assessments in Phase 2. 
In addition to these assessments, the devices automatically log quantitative compliance, usage data, 
and leg movement data throughout the duration of the study. 
The following are completed by subject: IRLS, Daily questionnaire, Medication use assessment, Step-down assessment questionnaire. 
The following are administered and completed by the investigator or designee: Screen for inclusion/exclusion, Informed consent, Study entry questionnaire, CGI-I, Opioid -related symptom 
assessment, AE assessment.

Both IRLS and CGI-I will be administered at study exit. 
16.11.  Extension Phase   
Subjects who tolerate Phases  1 and 2 without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms and are at a non-zero dose of opioids will have the option to complete an extension phase consisting of 
an additional reduction in opioid dose. 16.12.  Subject Disconti nuation 
A subject may be removed  from the study prior to completion for any of the following reasons: 
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent 
• Adverse event preventing further study participation 
• Investigator believes risk of further subject participation outweighs benefit 
• Persistent non-compliance or lost to follow-up 
• Pregnancy 
• Subject no longer meets inclusion criteria 
• Reduced opioid dosage is not tolerable, as evaluated by the subject or the investigator 
• Subject fails to comply with reduced opioid dosage 
• Subject changes dosage of non-opioid medications known to interfere with sleep or RLS symptoms, including sleep medications, antidepressants, sedative antihistamines. 
The Investigator or research staff will complete a study exit form in the CRF for any subject who prematurely discontinues from the study.  If discontinuation was the result of an AE, the AE will also be recorded in the CRF. 
Upon discontinuation, subjects will receive partial compensation commensurate with their completed 
Phases. 
16.13.  Study Termination  
The Sponsor may terminate the study as a whole or at individual study sites under the following 
circumstances: 
• Suspicion of risk to subjects, including occurrence of high rate of known AEs or unexpectedly 
high rate of unexpected AEs

• Poor site compliance with the study protocol 
• Inadequate site enrollment 
• Obtaining new scientific knowledge that shows that the study is no longer valid or necessary 
• Persistent non-compliance with IRB or regulatory requirements 
• Persistent failure to comply with obligations arising from the clinical trial agreement 
• Other business reasons (e.g., insolvencies or business entity liquidation) 
The sponsor will document reasons for study suspension and notify relevant site Investigators and 
governing  IRBs.  If suspension occurred because of a safety issue, all Investigators will be notified. 
When terminating the study, the sponsor and Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is 
given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.   
17.  Study Endpoints  
17.1.  Efficacy  
In the absence of an adjunctive treatment, a reduction in opioid dose will cause an increase in RLS symptoms.  The efficacy of NPNS will be assessed by its capacity to prevent this increase in RLS 
symptoms.  Subjects who discontinue due to nonspecific opioid withdrawal symptoms will not be 
included in the efficacy analysis but will be considered in the safety analysis.  Efficacy endpoints will be calculated during the Assessment period except in cases of dropout during the run-in period(s); 
Section 13.2 describes how efficacy endpoints will be calculated in cases of dropout during the run-in 
period(s). 
17.1.1.  Efficacy Endpoints  
Endpoint 1 (Primary Endpoint): Percentage of subjects without a clinically significant increase in 
RLS symptoms (i.e. CGI-I score of 5 or less relative to baseline) during the first Phase involving an 
opioid dose reduction of >= 20% relative to baseline. 
Endpoint 2: Percentage of subjects without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms (i.e. 
CGI-I score of 5 or less relative to baseline) during the first Phase involving an opioid dose 
reduction of >= 1/3 relative to baseline. Endpoint 3: IRLS during the first Phase with an opioid dose reduction of >= 20% relative to baseline. 
Endpoint 4: IRLS during the first Phase with an opioid dose reduction of >=1/3 relative to baseline.

Endpoint 5: Maximal percentage reduction in opioid dose relative to baseline associated with a 
CGI-I score of 5 or less, averaged across subjects.   
Of the 5 efficacy endpoints, only Endpoint 5 considers data during the Extension phase. 
17.1.2.  Definition  of Opioid Dose 
Baseline opioid dose will be defined as the total weekly opioid dose that the subject reports taking 
during the week prior to study entry (7 days ending in EVAL 1).  This value will be used to calculate 
the opioid doses for each Phase.  If a subject reports taking a different opioid dose than instructed during an Assessment Period, the actual subject-reported opioid dose will be used to calculate the 
efficacy endpoints.  In cases where a subject is taking multiple opioids concurrently, the morphine 
milligram equivalent (MME) will be used to standardize the baseline opioid dose, to calculate the 
opioid dose for each Phase, and to calculate opioid dose for the efficacy endpoints.   
17.1.3.  Efficacy Analysis 
Endpoints 1 and 2 are calculated with the following formula, respectively for Phases 1 and 2:  
100%*( (X-Y)/(N -M)), where  
• N = Number of subjects who entered the Run-in period for the Phase. 
• M = Number of subjects excluded during Run-in period due to non-RLS opioid 
withdrawal symptoms. 
• Y = Number of subjects excluded during Run-in period primarily due to intolerable 
RLS symptoms. 
• X = Number of subjects who complete Assessment period with no clinically significant worsening in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) relative to Baseline, where a clinically significant worsening is defined by a score 
of 6 (Much worse) or 7 (Very much worse). 
 17.1.4.  Planned subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analysis will be planned based on the location of RLS symptoms in the body, for the 
following subgroups:

o subjects who experience RLS symptoms that are most significant below the knees (lower 
legs and/or feet) 
o subjects who experience RLS symptoms that are most significant above the knees (upper legs) or equally significant above and below the knees 
17.1.5.  Criterion for Success  
If Endpoint 1 is greater than 50 percent, then the study will pass the Primary Efficacy endpoint. 
17.2.  Safety  
Safety will be assessed primarily based on response to NPNS.  However, the proportion of subjects excluded due to non-RLS opioid withdrawal symptoms will also be considered in the safety analysis. 
17.2.1.   Safety Endpoints 
Endpoint 1: Frequency of Grade 2 of higher NPNS -related adverse events, as indicated by a 
relatedness assessment of Probable or Definite. Endpoint 2: Frequency of Grade 3 or higher NPNS -related adverse events.  
Endpoint 3: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study during Phase 1 or Phase 2 citing lack 
of tolerability of NPNS  as the primary reason for withdrawal. 
Endpoint 4: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opioid 
withdrawal symptoms during Phases 1 or 2. Endpoint 5: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study citing lack of tolerability of NPNS as 
the primary reason for withdrawal during Phase 1 
Endpoint 6: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study citing lack of tolerability of NPNS as 
the primary reason for withdrawal during Phase 2. 
Endpoint 7: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opioid 
withdrawal symptoms during Phase 1. Endpoint 8: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opioid 
withdrawal symptoms during Phase 2. Additional exploratory endpoints:

Endpoint 9: Reduction in severity of side-effects related to opioid use (not withdrawal) that were 
present at baseline during Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessment periods. 
* Note that data from the Extension Phase is included in analysis of Endpoints 1 and 2 but not 
analysis of Endpoints 3-9. 
17.2.2.   Safety Analysis 
AEs occurring at any time during the study will be described and the investigator or designee will grade its severity, its relationship to device usage, and its relationship to opioid withdrawal. 
The frequency of the following categories of AEs will be determined: device-related AEs, AEs related to opioid withdrawal, AEs unrelated to opioid withdrawal, SAEs.  Additionally, side-effects 
related to baseline opioid usage , which were present at study entry, will be tracked weekly to 
detect potential improvement during opioid reduction and thus evaluate Endpoint 5. Device-related will be defined as a relatedness grade of 3, 4, or 5. 
17.2.3.   Criterion for Success  
No Grade 3 or higher device-related adverse events and fewer than 20% of subjects with Grade 2 
device-related adverse events. 
17.3.  NPNS Tolerability  
NPNS t olerability will be quantified based on the percentage of participants who voluntarily withdraw 
from the study prior to the Extension Phase citing lack of tolerability of NPNS treatment as the primary 
reason for withdrawal, as quantified by selection of response #3 on a questionnaire similar to the one 
below.  
Primary reason for withdrawal: 
• I want to return to my original opioid dosage because: o (1) my RLS symptoms have gone up after I reduced my opioid dosage 
o (2) I experienced other opioid withdrawal symptoms after I reduced my opioid dosage 
• (3) Use of the NPNS devices was uncomfortable or otherwise intolerable 
• (4) Other

The criterion for success will be fewer than 20% of subjec ts who begin NPNS treatment withdrawing 
for this reason.  
17.4.  Compliance  
Compliance will be measured based on digital tracking of the timing and duration of each NPNS device 
usage during the Assessment weeks of Phase 1 and Phase 2.  A “ night of compliant use” will be defined 
as a minimum of 25 minutes of active NPNS stimulation between 5pm and 8am during an Assessment 
week.  “Total assessment nights” will be defined as the total nights spent by all subjects in Assessment 
weeks.  “Total assessment nights with RLS symptoms” will be defined as the total nights spent by all 
subjects in Assessment weeks when the subject reports RLS symptoms on the Daily questionnaire .  If 
a subject is removed from the study before the end of an Assessment week, such as due to an adverse event or for personal reasons, data from that Assessment week will not be included in the compliance 
analysis.  In cases where digital tracking logs are incomplete or unavailable, the data will not be included in the compliance analysis. 
• For participants who are instructed to administer stimulation each night, percentage compliance 
will be calculated using the following formula:  
o 100%*(nights of compliant use)/(total assessment nights) 
• For participants who are instructed to administer stimulation only on nights with RLS symptoms, 
percentage compliance will be calculated using the following formula:  
o 100%*(nights of compliant use)/(total assessment nights with RLS symptoms) 
The global criterion for success will be percentage compliance of ≥ 70%, based on the weighted 
average of individual compliances (i.e. weighting nights equally instead of weighting participants 
equally). 
 17.5. Exploratory Analysis 
Additional statistical analysis that is exploratory in nature may be performed , which may include but 
is not limited to analysis of data from the Extension Phase.

During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, replacing some in-person visits with remote interactions may 
be necessary, for example to reduce risk to subjects and/or to comply with local, state, or federal 
regulations.  In such cases, the study records will indicate which in-person visits were replaced with 
remote interactions.   The allowable study duration may be expanded as needed to allow delay intervals 
for mailing and receiving programmed devices. 
In such cases, one of more of the following approaches may be taken: 
1. Remote calibration and training.  Remote calibration and training, where possible, will be coordinated by mailing a calibration/training device to the subject, conducting calibration and training via a video call using the calibration/training device, and then mailing programmed 
devices to the subject using the settings determined during the calibration.  Alternatively, the 
same devices used in the study may be used for calibration/training. 
2. Remote follow-up visits.  Remote follow-up visits, where possible, will be completed via call or video call, during which the required study assessments will be administered.   
3. Devices may be returned using a pre-paid mailing label, as needed. 
4. Remote consent.  Remote consent procedures will follow the recommendations set forth in the 
“FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Public Health 
Emergency” [12].   For example, or more of the following procedures listed in the guidance will be used to confirm consent: 
a. eConsent via a compliant digital platform; 
b. confirmation of consent by an impartial witness via three-way call or video conference; 
c. remote explanation of consent followed by in-person signature of informed consent document (to minimize duration of in-person interaction).

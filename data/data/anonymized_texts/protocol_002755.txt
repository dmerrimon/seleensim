2.1 Chronic Hepatitis C 
Approximately 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), including approximately 4 million in the United States. The majority of individuals 
infected progress to chronic hepatitis, which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV is the leading indication for liver transplantation in 
most countries and a major cause of HCC. 
 
There are 6 major HCV genotypes with many subtypes based on sequence heterogeneity of the 
genome [1]. Genotypes (GT) 1 - 3 have a worldwide distribution (with genotype 1 being the 
major genotype in the United States, Europe, Japan, and South America, genotypes 4 and 5 are 
found principally in Africa, and genotype 6 is distributed primarily in Asia. Although genotype 
does not predict the outcome of infection, different genotypes are associated with differential 
responses to treatment, and allow dosage of current pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-based 
treatment to be tailored to the genotype being treated  [2-4]. 
  
Over 20-30 years of chronic HCV infection, 20% of the patients develop end stage liver 
disease and cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in patients with cirrhosis at a rate of 1% 
to 4% per year.  Progression to cirrhosis is often silent, until patien ts present with 
complications of End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) or HCC. HCV imposes burdens on both 
society and individuals. A major economic burden on the society is the hospital outpatient 
costs, which have reached $11 billion in the US in direct medical  costs alone.  
 Two first generation direct acting antivirals (DAAs), the HCV protease inhibitors, telaprevir 
(TVR) and boceprevir (BOC), were approved in the US and EU in 2011 for the treatment of 
GT-1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC). These regimens are now con sidered the standard of care 
(SOC) for treating GT-1 CHC in countries where they are available.  
 
The ability of daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) combination is uniquely related to the 
limited and/or manageable drug-drug interaction potential with the concurrent medications in 
addition to its potent antiviral activity and safety in patients with hepatic impairment. The 
ability of DCV and SOF to be used in HIV/HCV coinfected population is uniquely related to 
the limited and/or manageable drug -drug interaction potential of these drugs in addition to this 
combination’s potent antiviral activity and safety in patients with hepatic impairment.  
 
Finally, the ability of DCV and SOF to treat GT -3 has the potential to improve on the currently 
limited all-oral options for this particular group of patients. This study will evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of DCV and SOF in subjects infected with HCV Genotype 3. 
 
Epidemiological surveys have shown a geographical variation in the prevalence and 
distribution of hepatitis C genotypes throughout the world. HCV genotypes 1 –3 (GT1–3) have 
a worldwide distribution. Although GT1a and GT1b account for 60% of global HCV infections, GT3 is endemic in Southeast Asia and is variably distributed in different countries.  
 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 9 of 42 2.2 Sofosbuvir 
SOF is a potent and selective inhibitor of the HCV nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) 
polymerase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is responsible for viral RNA synthesis 
and is essential for viral replication. In vitro, SOF demonstrates nanomolar potency against HCV GT-1 through-6. 
 
In the SOF Phase 3 clinical program, the SOF + RBV treatment regimen for 12 or 16 weeks 
was evaluated in subjects with GT-2 or -3 HCV infection and the SOF + pegIFN/RBV 
treatment regimen for 12 weeks was evaluated in subjects with GT -1, -4,-5, or 6 HCV 
infection. Across all relevant HCV genotypes and multiple patient populations, SOF, in 
combination with RBV with or without pegIFN demonstrated similar or superior efficacy to 
currently available treatment. A 90% rate of SVR was reported in the single -arm NEUTRINO 
study that treated 327 GT-1, -4, -5 or-6 HCV-infected subjects (98% were either GT-1 or GT-
4) following 12 weeks of SOF plus pegIFN/RBV [7] SOF and RBV combination regimen was 
investigated in GT-2 or GT-3 HCV infected patients in three phase 3 studies, FISSION, 
POSITRON and FUSION. The efficacy data from these studies are summarized below.

Interim data from the Phase 3 VALENCE study demonstrate that extending the length of 
SOF+RBV combination therapy to 24 weeks vs. 12 weeks for GT3 subjects can provide much improved SVR rates (overall SVR12- 85%) with no additional safety signal  [6, 9]. SVR for 
GT2 subjects in this study was 93% after 12 weeks of combination therapy. Collectively, the Phase 3 SOF program has demonstrated that high rates of efficacy are attainable with an all -
oral regimen across HCV genotypes (1-6) without compromising the enhanced safety profile 
that has become the expectation of interferon -free alternatives. These data also provide great 
promise for the potential benefit associated with regimens that combine potent but well tolerated DAA agents, such as DCV+SOF. 
 
2.3 Daclatasvir 
DCV is a first-in-class, highly selective NS5A replication complex inhibitor (RCI) with 
picomolar potency and broad genotypic coverage in vitro. As a RCI, DCV inhibits HCV 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 10 of 42 replication with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of 9 and 50 pM against genotype s 
GT-1b and GT-1a, respectively, in replicon assays and EC50 values ranging from pM to low 
nM for replicons with NS5A coding sequences derived from GT-2a, -3a, -4a, -5a and -6a.  
 
Data from the DCV non-clinical studies can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) as 
included in IND 79,599.  
A thorough review of clinical efficacy studies including DCV is available in the IB. Briefly, 
DCV has been studied as part of several IFN containing and IFN-free treatment combinations 
in treatment-naive and treatment experience patients infected with different HCV GTs. Selected results are presented below. 
 
• DCV 60 mg once daily (QD) combined with pegIFNα/RBV has demonstrated high virologic response rates across all GTs tested (GT-1, -2/-3, and -4) in treatment-naive 
subjects. Sustained virologic response rates at follow -up Weeks 12 and 24 (SVR12/24) 
were 64% - 100%. Fifty GT-3 treatment naive subjects received DCV and pegIFN α/RBV 
combination therapy in BMS study AI444031. 83% (44/53) of them met the criteria of 
protocol defined response (PDR+, defined as HCV RNA at Week 4 < LLOQ, target 
detected or target not detected) and were eligible for shortening treatment duration to 12 
weeks or 16 weeks. Among these PDR+ subjects, 80% (35/44) achieved SVR12 with 
shortened treatment duration. The SVRs for non-PDR subjects and subjects receiving 
placebo and pegIFNα/RBV combination are not available yet.  
• Quad therapies including DCV (DCV + ASV + pegIFNα/RBV) have demonstrated efficacy in several hard-to-treat GT-1/-4 populations, including null responders to prior 
pegIFNα/RBV treatment. In the expansion of study AI447011, QUAD therapy including 60mg of DCV and ASV achieved SVR12 rates of 95%. 
• DCV has been extensively studied as part of the IFN -free “DUAL” therapy in combination 
with ASV in patients infected with HCV GT-1b. In the expansion of BMS Study AI447011, GT-1b infected prior null responders were treated with DCV (60 mg QD) plus 
twice-daily ASV (200 mg) (N=18) and 89% (16/18) achieved SVR24 (based upon HCV 
RNA < LLOQ TD or TND). A larger group of GT-1b infected patients who were prior 
non-responders to IFN-based therapy were treated with DCV (60mg QD) plus twice daily ASV (200mg) in BMS Study AI447026. The SVR24 was 80.5% (70/87) and it was 
similarly effective among subgroups regardless of baseline characteristic including gender, 
age, HCV RNA and cirrhosis. 
• In an ongoing study of the IFN-free regimen of DCV/ASV/BMS-791325 (75 mg twice daily [BID]) triple therapy in treatment -naive subjects infected with HCV GT-1a, -1b 
produced SVR12 rates of 94% after 12 weeks of treatment. 
• As was seen in Study AI444040, 12 or 24 weeks of combination treatment of DCV and SOF with or without RBV led to an SVR12 of 98.4% in treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients; an SVR12 of 97.6% (40/41) in GT-1 infected patients who had previously 
failed protease inhibitor; and an SVR12 of 90.9% (40/44, 2 missing patients and 2 with 
virologic failure) in treatment-naive patients infected with HCV GT-2 and -3.  
 2.4 Daclatasvir / Sofosbuvir Combination 
Daclatasvir (DCV, BMS-790052) is an NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide NS5B (polymerase) inhibitor. Together, this IFN and RBV free combination is an important 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 11 of 42 potential addition to the future anti -HCV armamentarium whose initial clinical data (study 
AI444040) demonstrates a well tolerated combination with potent in vivo anti -viral activity 
delivering > 90% sustained viral responses in HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 3. 
 
DCV is an inhibitor of NS5A, a multifunctional protein necessary for HCV replication that is 
an essential component of the HCV replication complex. NS5A has three structural domains (I, 
II, and III). Domain I (N-terminus of the protein) contains a zinc binding motif and potential 
RNA binding pocket, and is required for NS5A dimer fo rmation. Inhibitor-binding, resistance 
mapping and computer modeling indicate that DCV inhibits NS5A function(s) by interacting with the N terminus of the protein (domain I). In vitro 50% effective concentration (EC50) 
values of DCV ranged from pM to low nM in replicons with NS5A coding sequences derived 
from GT-1b, GT-1a, GT-2a, -3a, -4a, -5a and 6a. Among all tested genotypes, DCV 
demonstrates potent inhibitory activity towards GT-3 HCV with EC50 of 146pM [5].

SOF is a potent inhibitor of NS5B (polymerase) and therefore inhibits RNA replication. It is a 
nucleotide analogue that is phosphorylated within the host hepatocyte to the active triphosphate and competes with natural nucleotides leading to chain termination of RNA replication of the 
viral genome. The active triphosphate of SOF has been shown to have activity in vitro against 
HCV genotypes 1-6. Potent activities were observed across all genotypes with EC50 values ranging from 14 nM to 181 nM. EC50 of SOF against GT -3 HCV replicon is only 81 nM. .In 
vitro and in vivo studies showed that the CYP450 system was not involved in the metabolism of SOF, that there was no significant inhibition or induction of CYP450 enzymes by these 
compounds, and that clinically significant drug interactions mediated by CYP450 were 
unlikely [6].  
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir demonstrates activity as treating genotype 1 -3 HCV infection 
(Study AI444040): 
 
The combination of DCV and SOF was first shown to be safe and highly effective in the Phase 
2 Study AI444040. This is an open-label study that treated 211 GT-1, GT-2 and GT-3-infected 
subjects with this once-daily combination with or without RBV for either 12 or 24 weeks. The 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 12 of 42 overall SVR12 in GT-2/3 infected subjects (n = 44) following 24 weeks of treatment was 
90.9% (40/44). The combination of DCV and SOF was well tolerated. Most adverse events 
were mild or moderate and did not lead to treatment discontinu ation. 
 Therefore, this once-daily combination of DCV plus SOF was well tolerated and achieved high 
rates of SVR12 in both treatment-naïve HCV genotypes 1-3-infected subjects, as well as in 
subjects who failed PI-based therapy with no other treatment optio ns [7-8].

In summary, treatment with the DCV and SOF combination regimen shows promise as a 
therapeutic option as demonstrated by very high SVR and favorable AE profile.  
 
2.5 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The choice of 60 mg DCV as the dose to be used in this study was based on the following data:  
• AI444014 is a Phase 2a study that evaluated DCV (3 mg, 10 mg, and 60 mg once daily vs. 
placebo) plus pegIFNα/RBV for 48 weeks of triple therapy for subjects infected with HCV 
GT-1. The analysis on the clinical results demonstrated similar efficacy at the Week 12 
analysis and remained similar through SVR12. However, exposures in the 10 mg group 
overlapped with those of the sub-therapeutic 3 mg group. This suggests that the 10 mg dose 
may provide subtherapeutic exposures in some subjects, an observation that could prove 
deleterious in the context o f a direct-acting antiviral only regimen. No meaningful 
relationships between exposure and safety events were identified in AI444014, for any DCV dose, based on safety data from 48 weeks of triple therapy. The safety and tolerability 
of DCV plus pegIFNα/RBV was undistinguishable from control for any DCV treatment 
group. Specifically, there was no evidence of hepatic or hematologic safety signals 
observed. 
• In study AI447011, DCV 60 mg QD was delivered for 24 weeks in combination with a protease inhibitor, ASV, and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Although a clinically 
relevant trend in elevated hepatic transaminases was identified in this study it was attributed to the 600 mg BID ASV dose of the protease inhibitor administered in the study 
as indicated by similar findings in the ASV program without DCV in regimen. There were 
no serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and no other clinically 
significant safety signals.  
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 13 of 42 • As discussed previously, DCV 60 mg QD has been examined in combination with SOF in 
study AI444040 in subjects infected with HCV GT-1, -2, and -3 (N = 211) and has 
demonstrated high efficacy and favorable tolerability.  
 
Therefore, based on the safety and efficacy of the 60 mg DCV observed in these studies, this 
dose will be used for this study. 
 
2.6 Rationale for treatment duration  
Available data suggests that 12 weeks of therapy with a potent treatment regimen is adequate to achieve SVR in many HCV patient types. This data includes the following observations.  
 
Data from 3 Phase 3 studies, FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION also demonstrated GT-2 and 
GT-3 treatment naive subjects can be cured with 12 weeks of SOF and RBV combination therapy, achieving 86% - 97% SVR in GT-2 patients and 30%-56% SVR in GT-3 patients. 
Relatively lower SVR observed in GT-3 subjects treated with SOF is mainly due to the higher relapse rate compared to that of GT-2, which may be due to slower viral clearance. Thus, the 
higher rate of relapse in HCV GT3 infected subjects treated with SOF may reflect a reduced rate of virologic clearance possibly due to the underlying fibrosis or steatosis characteristic of 
HCV GT3. The addition of RBV with the potent antiviral DCV would be predicted to provide 
more rapid and intensive viral suppression and enhanced viral clearance. 
 In summary, we conclude that the combination of DCV and SOF/RBV is likely to have a high 
rate of SVR following 12 weeks of treatment in non-cirrhotic patients infected with GT-3 
HCV. However, emerging data from clinical trials indicates t hat 24 weeks of treatment in 
cirrhotics is needed. Accordingly, a conservative approach will be taken and cirrhotic GT -3 
subjects will be randomized to either 16 weeks or 24 weeks of DCV and SOF/RBV.  
2.7 Rationale for study  
Given the higher risk of disease progression compared to other genotypes, patients with 
chronic GT-3 HCV infection and cirrhosis represent a population with high unmet medical 
need. However, the efficacy and safety profile with the current standard of care (SOF/RBV), are still suboptimal with disappointing SVR rates at best comparable to pegIFNα/RBV. 
Therefore, new treatment options with better efficacy, safety, treatment duration and minimal drug-drug interaction potential are needed for treating HCV  GT-3 infection in patients with 
cirrhosis . 
 
The regimen of SOF plus RBV has been investigated in GT-2 or GT-3 HCV infected patients 
in three Phase 3 studies, FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION. The data demonstrated the 
patients with chronic GT-2 or GT-3 HCV infections can be cured with 12 weeks of SOF in 
combination with the weak antiviral RBV. Consistently high SVRs were observed in GT -2 
subjects, including HCV treatment naive (SVR12 86% - 97%). Relatively lower SVRs were 
observed in GT-3 patients (SVR12 30% - 56%). The reason for the lower rates o f sustained 
virologic response among patients with HCV GT-3 infection, as compared with those who had 
HCV GT-2 infection, a difference that has also been observed among patients treated with 
pegIFN/RBV, remains unclear. Although virologic declines during treatment are similar with 
the two genotypes, the higher rates of relapse among patients with HCV GT-3 infection 
indicate that virologic clearance is likely to be slower in some patients with HCV GT -3

Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 14 of 42 infection, which may due to the underlying fibrosis and steatosis, adding a potent DAA is 
anticipated to eliminate the impact of these negative factors.  
 
Treatment-experienced GT-3 infected patients also represent a population of high unmet 
medical need, especially patients with cirrhosis. These patients face f urther disease progression 
and limited treatment options. Results from the VALENCE study demonstrated an SVR12 rate of 85% in non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced GT-3 subjects following 24 weeks of 
SOF+RBV. Unfortunately, the response was considerably lower in cirrhotic treatment-
experienced GT3 subjects (60%) despite the 24-week treatment duration [6, 9]. These results 
suggest that the optimal treatment duration with a SOF/RBV regimen is 24 weeks for GT -3 
infected patients, similar to the currently approve d pegIFNα-based regimen. Thus, there 
remains a need to improve treatment response in GT -3 cirrhotic patients who have advanced 
disease. 
 
DCV demonstrates consistent SVR in non-cirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic subjects  
Responses of cirrhotic subjects treated with DCV are similar to subjects without cirrhosis. DCV has been investigated within different combination regimens as an add -on antiviral to 
PegIFNα/RBV and as part of dual combination of DCV and asunaprevir (ASV). 
 
Therefore, available efficacy data across DCV programs, including data from IFN -free 
combinations suggests consistent SVR in non-cirrhotic subjects and compensated cirrhotic subjects treated with DCV based regimens. 
 
DCV has been approved by the U.S. FDA on July 24, 2015.

that took 24 weeks of SOF/RBV. 
 
4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 
4.1 Study Design Overview  
This is a randomized, open label, single center safety and efficacy study. At least 40 cirrhotic 
subjects with HCV genotype 3 will receive standard of care treatment of SOF/RBV as well as 
60 mg daily of Daclatasvir (investigational product).  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 to 
receive either: 
• Group A: 16 weeks of DCV/SOF/RBV 
• Group B: 24 weeks of DCV/SOF/RBV 
 
Subjects will return to the study center at various time points throughout the 16 or 24 weeks of 
treatment in addition to 12 weeks post taking last dose of study drug to monitor safety and 
efficacy. These visits will be according to standard of care.   
The total planned duration of subject participation in Group A is up to 36 weeks (a maximum 
of 8 weeks of screening, 16 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of post last dose of study drugs 
follow-up). The total planned duration of subject participation in Group B is up to 44 weeks (a 
maximum of 8 weeks of screening, 24 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of post last dose of study drugs follow-up). 
 
 
4.2 Study Population 
Approximately 40 subjects aged 18-75 years (all sexes, races and ethnic backgrounds) with 
chronic hepatitis C infection based on history of positive anti-HCV antibody and/or HCV RNA 
in serum will complete the study. Only genotype 3 subjects with cirrhosis will be considered 
for enrollment. Of note, treatment-naïve subjects with no previous exposure to an interferon 
formulation (i.e., IFNa, pegIFNa), RBV, or HCV DAA (protease, polymerase inhibitor, etc.) as 
well as treatment-experienced subjects who failed previous treatment with interferon 
formulation (i.e., IFNa, pegIFNa), RBV, or HCV DAA (excluding NS5A inhibitors) will be considered.  
 
All subjects must meet the following eligibility criteria: 
 
4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria 
1. Signed, written, informed consent must be available from the subject before any study-
specific procedures are performed; 
2. Male or female 18-75 years of age; 
3. All of the following at least 6 months prior to screening visit: 
• Documented HCV infection based on history of a positive serum anti-HCV 
antibody test and/or detectable levels of HCV RNA  >= 10,000 IU/mL, and 
• Documented HCV genotype 3. 
4. Subjects with evidence of cirrhosis defined by either a liver biopsy <= 3 years from 
screening demonstrating a Metavir F ibrosis Score of F4 (or equivalent); OR 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 16 of 42 Fibroscan® <= 1 year from screening > 12.5 kPa. If a subject is evaluated by more than 
one testing method, then the liver biopsy results take precedence; 
5. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  must: 
• have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or 
equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. 
• WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for 7 
months post-treatment completion.   
• Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for 
method(s) of contraception for the following duration for 7 months post-treatment 
completion.   
• Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with 
WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an 
unexpected pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who 
are sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of 
contraception. Highly effective method s of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% 
per year when used consistently and correctly.  
6. At minimum the subject agrees to the use of two methods of contraception, with at least 
one method being highly effective as listed below: 
Highly Effective Methods of Contraception 
• Male condoms with spermicide 
• Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by male subject’s WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects 
participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the 
acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug. WOCBP cannot use hormonal contraception as one of the two methods of 
contraception because there are no data on the effectiveness of systemic hormonal 
contraceptives in women taking SOF. However, WOCBP can continue to use 
hormonal contraceptives, if necessary, in addition to 2 other non -hormonal methods 
of contraception 
•  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard® 
• Tubal Ligation 
• Vasectomy 
• Complete Abstinence – defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse 
and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to  use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the 
subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
 
Less Effective Methods of Contraception 
• Diaphragm with spermicide 
• Cervical cap with spermicide 
• Vaginal sponge 
• Male condom without spermicide 
• Progestin only pills 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 17 of 42 • Female condom; A male and female condom must not be used together  
 
Azoospermic males, women who are not of childbearing potential and WOCBP who 
abstain from heterosexual activity on a continuous basis, are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP who abstain from heterosexual activity 
on a continuous basis must still undergo pregnancy testing.

Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 19 of 42 • Virologic Breakthrough:  
 
If discontinuation of therapy is required, this must occur no later than the next study visit.  
 It is expected that all subjects who are on study will complete the protocol-defined 
durations for treatment and follow -up. Subjects who discontinue all study drugs prior to 
completing the assigned dosing regimen should complete 12 weeks of follow -up. However, 
if alternative HCV therapy is initiated  in the post-treatment period for any reason, subject 
must withdraw from the study once the post-treatment Week 4 visit has occurred.  
 
All subjects who discontinue investigational product should comply with protocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws 
consent for all study procedures including post-treatment study follow -up or loses the 
ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a psychiatric or physical illness). 
 
4.2.4 Subject Withdrawal 
In accordance with the regulations governing human subject protection, a subject has the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without jeopardy to his/her 
future of their medical care at the institution. Furthermore, reasons for terminating subjects 
from the study include but are not limited to the following : 
• Any of the stopping rules included under “Expected Adverse Events and Management”. 
• Subject non-compliance. 
• Pregnancy occurring on study. 
• Intolerable adverse event (decision to be removed from study made by either the investigator or subject). 
• Unrelated medical illness or complication.  
• Evidence of hepatic decompensation.  
• Decision by the investigator that it is in the subject’s best medical interest. 
• Lost to follow-up. 
• Death  
• Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) 
 If the subject is going to be withdrawn from the study, all efforts will be made to complete 
the early termination/discontinuation visit .

5.1 Safety Variables and Assessments 
Safety will be assessed through vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, concomitant 
medication assessments as well as laboratory test. Subjects will return to clinic visits per the 
standard of care schedule at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and16 for all subjects as well as weeks 20 
and 24 for subjects in Group B. All subjects will return for treatment-free follow-up 4, 12 and 
24 weeks post discontinuation of study drug or early termination visit (if applicable). Also, an 
ECG will be conducted at screening, end of treatment (week 16 or week  24) and follow-up 
weeks 12 and 24 for safety. For women of child-bearing potential, serum or urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed at every visit. Refer to appendix Error! Reference source not found.  for 
schedule of assessments.    
The safety data will be tabulated and, the proportion of subjects with the following will be 
summarized for each arm of the study and cumulatively:  
• Adverse events using the grading system outlined in section 
6. 
• Abnormal laboratory safety tests (liver injury tests as measured by AST, ALT, GGT, 
Total Bilirubin and Albumin as well as blood picture tests as measured by WBC, RBC, 
Hgb, Hct, Plts) and those requiring dose reduction, interruptions or discontinuations.  
 All blood sample collection will be part of the standard of care schedule , with the exception of 
any additional blood collection, outside standard of care, that are required to monitor the subject’s safety. 
 
5.2 Efficacy Variables and Assessments 
Efficacy will be assessed through HCV RNA assessments that will be conducted at various 
time points during study drug period and follow-up. Refer to appendix

used for the primary antiviral assessment in this study.  
 Secondary Efficacy Assessments: HCV RNA collected at each of the following Weeks: 2, 4, 6, 
8, 10, 12, 16 as well as weeks 20 and 24 for subjects in Group B; post-treatment Weeks 4, 12 
and 24 will be used for the secondary antiviral assessment in this study.  
 5.3 Study Assessments 
The results of all procedures listed below will be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. Refer to appendix 
Error! Reference source not fo und. for an overview of the 
schedule of assessments.

6. ADVERSE EVENTS 
The investigator is responsible for monitoring subject’s safety, as well as detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, according to the 
following guidelines. In addition, the investigator is responsible for p roviding appropriate medical 
care. Frequency of follow-up of any particular adverse event is left to the discretion of the investigator.  
 6.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
6.1.1 Definition 
An AE is any unfavorable, harmful or pathologic change or unintended sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) that occurs in a 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 25 of 42 subject throughout the duration of the study regardless of relationship to study drug. This 
definition includes surgery for a condition that was present prior to informed consent 
signature and unexpectedly worsens during the study . Lack of drug effect is not considered 
an AE. 
 
6.1.2 Reporting Requirement 
AEs will be collected and reported after the subject signs the informed consent until the 
subject’s last visit for the study. 
 
Study staff will instruct subjects to report any physical changes or new symptoms they may 
notice during the course of the study. In addition, AEs should be elicited with minimal 
connotations. Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be given for AE signs and symptoms 
of a common pathology.  
As for laboratory assessments, all Grade 3 and 4 laboratory toxicities will be reported as 
adverse events. If a subject’s dose is reduced or discontinued as a result of an AE, study 
site will clearly document this into the reason leading to any such dose reduction or 
discontinuation of study drug. AEs and SAEs will be reported according the guidelines 
outlined in this document regardless of  less stringent regulatory requirements that might 
apply. 
 
6.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
6.2.1 Definition 
An expected or unexpected adverse event is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if it meets any of the following: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening: at the occurrence of the event, the subject was at immediate risk of 
death. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had the 
event been more severe nor is likely to cause death in the distant future if left untreated. 
• Requires hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization: when in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization”  occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity that does not allow the 
subject to perform activities of daily living. 
• Requires medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes li sted above. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is medically significant. 
• A grade 4 laboratory toxicity requiring medical or surgical intervention, hospitalization, 
dose reduction or interruption, as well as  toxicities that are symptomatic and considered 
clinically significant by the investigator. 
 6.2.2 Reporting Requirement 
AEs will be collected and reported after the subject signs the informed consent until the subject’s last visit for the study.  
 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 26 of 42 Regardless of the SAEs  relationship to the study drug, the event must be described in the 
source documentation. 
 
All SAE ’s will be reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
respective governing regulatory agencies as required by  local regulations and guidelines. In 
addition, SAEs will be reported to the site’s IRB/IEC as required by local regulations and 
guidelines.  
In addition, SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be 
reported to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:  
SAE Email Address:  Worldwide.Safety@BMS.com SAE Facsimile Number:  609-818-3804. 
 
The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.  
 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to 
the BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
 
6.3 Severity 
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). If the AEs are not covered by 
these criteria, then s everity of AEs are to be graded as follows: 
 
• Grade 1: Mild; Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Grade 2: Moderate; Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/ therapy required . 
• Grade 3: Severe; Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/ therapy required, hospitalization possible.  
• Grade 4: Life threatening or disabling; Extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/ therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care 
probable. 
• Grade 5: Death. 
 
6.4 Relationship 
The relationship of study drug to the AE will be determined by the investigator based on the 
following definitions: 
 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 27 of 42 • Not Related: Another cause of the event is most plausible; or clinically plausible temporal 
sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event a nd the study drug administration; or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
• Possibly Related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or a known or expected response pattern to the s uspected 
drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
• Probably Related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, and there is a biologically plausible mechanism for study 
drug causing or contributing to the AE and the event could not be reasonably explained by 
the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. In addition, the relationship may be 
confirmed by improvement on stopping and reappearance of the event on r epeated 
exposure. 
 6.5 Recording Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
If possible, AEs and SAEs medical terminology will be recorded acc ording to the CTCAE. 
Moreover, if known, the diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms will be recorded. 
AEs/SAEs occurring as secondary to other events (sequelae) should be identified by primary cause. The action taken, relationship to study drug and outcome of AE/SAE will also be 
recorded.  
6.6 Follow -up of Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event and Outcome 
Non-serious adverse events will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes or until the last study visit, whichever comes first, and must be recorded. If the adverse event is serious and 
is assessed as possibly or probably related to study drug, it must be followed until either the 
event is considered stable or resolved. Any SAE assessed as not related to study drug will be followed as clinically indicated until its resolution or, if non -resolving, until considered stable 
or until the final study visit, whichever comes first.  
 
By the last study visit, each reported AE/SAE must have one of the following outcomes:  
• Resolved without sequelae. 
• Resolved with sequelae. 
• Unresolved. 
• Death . 
 
6.7 Pregnancy 
Pregnancies should be reported from the time of informed consent until 24 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug, depending on which occurs first. Pregnancies must be followed until 
termination of the pregnancy or for a minimum of six months following the birth of the child. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant while participating in this study, study drug will be 
immediately discontinued. Any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy 
for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
 Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study. Refer to appendix 
Error! Reference source not found.  for the schedule of assessments. 
  
In addition, if, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered 
that a study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study drug exposure, 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 28 of 42 including during at least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must 
immediately notify the BMS of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours and in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures. In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate 
manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).  
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug, after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject. Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner 
of a male study participant should be reported to BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be 
collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. 
 
6.8 Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the consumption of a single dose that is greater than the scheduled 
dose of study drug. For the purposes of this study, a n overdose is considered a total daily dose 
of >200 mg of DCV.  
7. EXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS AND MANAGEMENT 
All complications, which occur or are exacerbated during the course of the subject’s involvement 
in the study, will be recorded. All subjects will be given a 24-hour number where the principal 
investigator or a qualif ied member of the research team can be reached. Management of adverse 
events will be in accordance with standard of care guidelines as well as  the following; however in 
the case of life-threatening adverse events, the drug may be discontinued permanently.  
 
7.1 DCV 
Thus far, more than 6000 subjects have exposed to DCV in clinical trial setting. In general, DCV has a favorable safety profile. No DCV specific safety signal has been identified.  
 
The safety profile of DCV (60 mg QD)/pegIFNα/RBV therapy in the Phase 2 studies was 
consistent with the established safety profile of pegIFN α/RBV when these drugs were part of 
the background therapy. Few subjects treated with DCV/ASV DUAL, DCV/ASV/pegIFNα/RBV QUAD or DCV/ASV/BMS-791325 Triple therapy reported serious 
adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation of study drugs. As 
expected, Grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities (decreased neutrophils and lymphocytes) were 
more common with DCV/ASV/pegIFNα/RBV QUAD therapy (up to 16%) compared with 
DCV/ASV DUAL therapy (up to 4%) and DCV/ASV/BMS-791325 Triple therapy (up to 3%). 
No cases of potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) were reported with DCV/pegIFN αRBV, 
DCV/ASV Dual, DCV/ASV/pegIFNαRBV Quad, or DCV/ASV/BMS-791325 Triple therapy 
(with ASV 200 mg BID, tablet). 
 
In Study AI444040, 167 GT-1 HCV infected subjects and 44 GT-2, -3 HCV infected 
non-cirrhotic subjects received either 12 weeks or 24 weeks combination treatment of DCV and SOF. An interim analysis was performed when all subjects had rea ched at least SVR12. 
The data showed the combination of DCV plus SOF was well tolerated. Overdose was the only SAE “related” to treatment. No other SAEs or discontinuations of study treatment were 
reported by investigators to be related to therapy. Most AE s were mild or moderate and did not 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 29 of 42 lead to treatment discontinuation. No Grade 3/4 events of elevated ALT, AST or total or direct 
bilirubin were observed. 
 
Overall, 4 subjects have died while participating in DCV studies. This includes 3 subjects 
treated with DCV 20 mg QD/pegIFNαRBV [sudden death due to unknown causes, death due 
to an intraventricular hemorrhage (in the post -treatment period), death due to cardiopulmonary 
failure exacerbated by asthma [in the post-treatment period]; all 3 deaths were considered not 
to be related to study drugs by the investigator]. One subject treated with 60 mg QD + BMS-
986094 200 mg QD died due to cardiogenic shock with multisystem organ failure, including 
biventricular heart failure and renal failure; the investigator co nsidered the death to be possibly 
related to BMS-986094, a nucleotide polymerase (NS5B) inhibitor no longer in clinical development. 
 
In Japanese subjects treated with the DUAL combination of DCV and ASV, a constellation of 
clinical symptoms (pyrexia, eosinophilia, and liver test abnormalities) was identified in 
1 Japanese subject (sentinel case) treated with DCV/ASV Dual therapy in the Phase 3 
AI447026 study. A total of 6 serious adverse reactions (SAR) of pyrexia were identified 
including the sentinel cas e; 4 of the 6 subjects experienced eosinophilia (> 0.6 x 10
3 cells/ µL) 
and 2/6 subjects had elevated ALT/AST > 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). All cases were 
reported from studies conducted in the Japanese population with DCV/ASV Dual therapy. No 
SAR of pyrexia was identified in the non-Japanese population. At this time, it is not known 
conclusively if these findings are directly related to study medication or other factors but the 
constellation appears limited to Japanese subjects treated with ASV.  
 The lack of similar liver toxicity or concurrent pyrexia/eosinophilia in DCV studies not 
including ASV indicates that these events are less likely to be related to DCV. Otherwise, DCV 
was well tolerated at durations up to 12, 24, or 48 weeks, depending on the s tudy. 
 Bristol-Myers Squibb has received 5 adverse event (AE) reports describing clinical significant  
arrhythmias, most involving severe bradycardia, when patients receiving amiodarone were  
administered daclatasvir (DCV) in combination with sofosbuvir (SOF) for treatment of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. These reports were received from the DCV Expanded 
Access Program (EAP) or from spontaneous post-marketing reports initiated by a local 
provider, in subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidity. None of these events 
occurred in the context of BMS sponsored clinical trials, where amiodarone was seldom, if 
ever, used by subjects in the trials. At this time, BMS is unable to determine if this potential 
drug-drug interaction with amiodarone results from interaction of amiodarone with DCV, SOF 
or both. However, to remain conservative regarding patient safety while this potential 
interaction is further investigated, BMS has decided  to exclude amiodarone from use in clinical 
studies at this time.  
Overall exposure to DCV includes approximately 7900 patients in clinical trials, 5500 patients 
in the EAP, and reportedly >10,000 patients in Japan; exposure to DCV/SOF has been 
approximately 707 patients in BMS clinical trials and 4111 patients in EAP progr ams. 
 
Amiodarone was excluded from use in most DCV clinical trials (amiodarone was permitted to 
be “used with caution” in UNITY trials of DCV/ASV/beclabuvir [BCV]). Approximately 30 of 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 30 of 42 4111 patients enrolled in the French cohort Autorisation Temporaire d'U tilisation (ATU; 
compassionate use program) were receiving amiodarone upon initiation of hepatitis antiviral  
therapy. To date, no reports of potential amiodarone Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) have been 
received for the Dual regimen (DCV/ASV) in either clinical trials or the post-marketing 
setting; all reports have involved DCV/SOF. 
 
In DCV-TRIO protocols with active dosing, including AI443123 and AI443131, amiodarone 
was categorized as “use with caution” due to its strong inhibition of P -glycoprotein. These 
protocols will be amended to prohibit amiodarone use during treatment with DCV -TRIO, with 
or without SOF. 
 
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI): 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  Potential drug induced liver injury is 
defined as:  
• ALT ≥  5 times baseline or nadir value, whichever is lower, AND ≥  10 x ULN (upper limit 
of normal, AND 
• Total bilirubin ≥ 2.5 x ULN, AND 
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, acute viral hepatitis, cholestasis, pre -existing hepatic disease 
excluding HCV or the administration of other drug(s), herbal medications or substances 
known to be hepatotoxic. 
 Most common AEs with DCV: 
No AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities directly attributable to DCV are identified. The most common AEs reported with DCV treatment include headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, 
fatigue, back pain, insomnia, abdominal pain and flatulence. The AE profiles of combined therapy are consistent with placebo or backbone of therapy when DCV was administrated in 
combination with other DAAs or pegIFNαRBV. 
 
Dose reductions: 
Dose modifications of DCV are not permitted.  
Dose interruptions: 
If an AE including a laboratory abnormality leads to dose interruption then c lose monitoring of 
the laboratory abnormality or AE that led to interruption of study drug(s) should occur at least 
until the interrupted drug can be restarted or until AE is resolved. When AEs occur that are 
considered by investigators to be unsafe, the necessity of dose interruption of DCV should be 
discussed with the principal investigator. If interruption is required for more than 7 days, 
treatment with DCV must be permanently discontinued.  
 Missed doses 
• If the missed dose is remembered within 12 hours of the scheduled dose time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible.  
• If the missed dose is remembered later than 12 hours after the scheduled dose time, the dose should be skipped and the next dose taken at the appropriate time.

Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 31 of 42  
7.2 Standard of care treatment and DCV  
 Dose adjustments and interruptions of SOF/RBV (NIMP – standard of care treatment) will be 
according to standard of care.   
Data demonstrates no clinically meaningful PK interaction between DCV and SOF. 
  In Study AI444040, Population PK sampling occurred in all subjects while serial PK sampling 
occurred on Days 7 and 14 in a subgroup of subjects (N = 31). Plasma concentrations of DCV, 
SOF, and the SOF predominant circulating metabolite GS -331007 were determined by 
validated LC/MS/MS methods. Noncompartmental PK parameters were derived. Pooled data of DCV exposures across all arms (N = 87) were compared to historical data from study 
AI447011 (DCV 60 mg once-daily in combination with the NS3 protease inhibitor 
asunaprevir). The results showed the PK of GS-331007 was unchanged by the presence of 
DCV. No apparent effect of SOF on DCV PK was observed. 
SOF is a substrate of Pgp. As such, SOF may be susceptible to Pgp transporter-based drug 
interactions. Potent intestinal inducers (rifampin and St John’s wort) of Pgp may decrease SOF 
plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of SOF; as such, rifampin or St John’s 
wort should not be used with SOF. Coadministration of SOF with drugs that inhibit Pgp may 
increase SOF plasma concentration. Based on these results, SOF may be administered with 
inhibitors of Pgp. SOF is not an inhibitor of Pgp and thus is not expected to increase exposures 
of drugs that are substrates of these transporters. 
 
Development of Resistance: 
Development of drug resistance has been observed with HCV replication inhibitors. Early emergence of resistant variants occurred in HCV -infected subjects dosed with DCV 
monotherapy (Study AI444004). However, such DCV resistant variants can be partially or fully suppressed when DCV is administrated as part of a potent DAA combination, in 
particular SOF. Viral breakthrough (VBT), in particular, is rare in subjects taking SOF and not 
expected in this study. In the SOF Phase 2 and 3 program results reported to date, only a single 
case of viral breakthrough occurred in a subject taking SOF. This particular subject was found 
to have undetectable SOF levels in PK analysis and clearly non -adherent to therapy.  
 In study AI444040, only one GT-3 subject receiving the combination DCV and SOF met a 
protocol definition of VBT. This subject demonstrated undetectable levels prior to 
administration of rescue therapy (addition of pegIFN αRBV) and thus does not appear to 
represent a true virologic failure . One additional GT-3 subject experienced virologic relapse at 
post treatment week 4. This subject demonstrated an A30K polymorphism at baseline and 
relapse. No emergent resistance variants were identified in the relapse virus.  
 Relapse has occurred in many patients who have been treated with SOF; however, the precise 
reason for relapse remains unclear. SOF resistant variants have been rare. There was a single 
case of the signature S282T mutation conferring resistance to SOF , which was reported in a 
GT-2 patient who relapsed post-treatment. The detection was transient and viral sequences reverted to wild-type during follow-up. An additional GT1 infected patient experienced viral relapse following 12 weeks of treatment with SOF and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir. The 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 32 of 42 S282T variant was detectable at low levels using next generation sequencing methods in the 
relapse virus in addition to NS5A resistance substitutions. Both of these patients were 
successfully retreated with longer durations of SOF containing therap y. 
   In summary, the risk of viral resistance is low and mitigated by the following:  
• The high clinical efficacy rates cited previously suggest that the risk of developing two drug resistance as result of study participation is low during or after treatment.  
• Subjects participating in this study will be closely monitored for viral breakthro ugh or 
relapse. 
• In addition, as there is no cross resistance between DCV/SOF and other classes of DAAs, 
in particular telaprevir or boceprevir.  
• Finally, since the SOF S282T mutation appears rare with rapid reversion to wild-type when detected, successful retreatment with a SOF-based regimen may be possible. 
 
Resistance analysis is planned to take place after all subjects have completed the study drug 
period. The following will be analyzed (refer to appendix A): 
• Nucleotide sequencing of the NS5A gene at baseline for all subjects and at the end of 
treatment for all subjects with evaluable viral loads;  
• NS5B gene in the resistance analysis for subjects with previous sofosbuvir experience at 
baseline and at the end of treatment. 
 
Potential Benefits of Treatment with DCV in Combination with SOF: 
Based on data from the AI444040 study, the key potential benefits of a treatment regimen consisting of DCV/SOF in HCV GT-3 infected patients include: 
• Improved rates of SVR compared to currently available therapies  
• Better tolerability without interferon/RBV associated AEs  
• The potential for shortened duration of treatment compared to pegIFN αRBV 
• Convenient once daily dosing schedule and low pill burden  
 
In summary, the overall Risk/Benefit for patients who may participate  in this study is highly 
favorable. The currently available treatments for GT -3 patients are unsatisfactory due to 
suboptimal efficacy and tolerability issues related to pegIFN αRBV side effects. Thus, this 
pegIFNαRBV sparing combination regimen, shown to b e well tolerated and highly potent in a 
study of > 200 patients is expected to provide significant benefit to participating subjects.  
 
7.3 Other expected adverse events 
• Drawing Blood: This is will be according to standard of care. Taking blood samples for 
tests can create certain discomfort and occasionally cause a small hemorrhage (bleeding), swelling, or bruising at the point of insertion of the needle, and in rare occasions, fainting 
or infection. The risk of blood draws will be managed according to standard of care and 
local regulations. 
• Giving urine samples can cause discomfort. 
• There are generally no risks associated with ECG. Because this procedure merely monitors the electrical impulses and does not give or send out electricity, there is no risk of s hock. 
ECG will be performed according to the center’s standard operating procedures. 
T. Hassanein – Daclatasvir (AI444284)  
Version 7 – September 5, 2015 Page 33 of 42 • Another possible risk is loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep the study 
participant’s identity confidential. The risk of loss of confidentiality will  be minimized by 
keeping records in a secure location and on password-protected computers. Data collection forms and blood samples will be marked only with the initials of the subject and a code 
number.  
 7.4 Pregnancy  
A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In 
addition, women under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.  
 
*Women treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration 
of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.  
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels) 
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products  
 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.  
 It is unknown if the study drug may cause harm to an unborn child. A serum or urine  
pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential before study drug is initiated and throughout the study. Refer to appendix 
Error! Reference source not found.  for the 
schedule of assessments. It is essential for both fertile women and men to use two reliable 
forms of effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while participating in this study.  
  If a pregnancy occurs at any time during the study, demonstrated by a positive serum or urine 
pregnancy test, study drug will be discontinued immediately..  
 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DCV and 
standard of care therapy of SOF/RBV for 16 weeks versus 24 weeks in HCV-infected genotype 
3 subjects. 
 
8.1 Sample Size  
This is a randomized, open label, single center safety and efficacy study. This is a small study 
of at least 40 cirrhotic subjects with HCV genotype 3 will receive standard of care treatment of 
SOF/RBV as well as 60 mg daily of Daclatasvir (investigational product).  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 to one of the following groups:

8.2 Statistical Methods and Analysis Populations 
Analyses of safety and efficacy data will use the intent-to-treat (ITT) subject population. The 
ITT subject population will include all subjects who are randomized. 
 
In all hypotheses tests for treatment effects, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference 
between triple therapy with DCV/SOF/RBV versus standard of care therapy of SOF/RBV 
(based on historical). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a diff erence between the two 
groups, regardless of direction (two-sided alternative).  
Missing values will not be imputed for any variables, meaning all missing values will be 
treated as missing data. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample. C orrelational 
analyses will be used to explore relationships. The distribution of the variables will be conducted first to determine whether parametric or non -parametric measures should be used. In 
case parametric measures are used, paired t-tests will be employed for interval variables and chi-square for ordinal/nominal variables. In case the data is non -parametric, Wilcoxon Mann-
Whitney tests will be used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression may be used to evaluate factors associated with impro vement.  
 8.3 Interim Analysis 
Interim analysis will not be conducted.  
9. STUDY ADMINISTRATION: ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS 
This study will be conducted in compliance with GCP as  described in FDA regulations  and ICH. 
These practices are consistent with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study 
will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements for a US IND 
application and in keeping with local legal and  regulatory requirements. 
 
9.1 Human Subjects and Informed Consent 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from each individual participating in this study after adequate explanation . The investigator must utilize 
an IRB or IEC approved consent form for documenting written informed consent. Each 
informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject or the subject’s legal ly 
authorized representative, the person obtaining consent and the investigator.  
Information about study subjects will be kep t confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization. 
 
9.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
This protocol, any amendments and any accompanying material to be provided to the subject 
(such as a consent form, diary, advertisements) will be submitted to a properly constituted IRB 
or IEC, in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB/IEC concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writin g to the

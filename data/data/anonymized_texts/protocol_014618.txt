LY22288202.Synopsis
Study Rationale
p38 mitogen -activated protein kinase ( MAPK )is a signaling protein act ivated by  cancer cells to 
enable survival after exposure to either radiat ion or chemotherapy .  p38 MAPK phosphorylates a 
number of substrates, including MAPK -activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP -K2), and also 
regul ates the tum or microenvironment ’s production of such key cytokines as tum ornecrosis 
factor -α (TNFα), interleukin -1β (IL -1β), interl eukin -6 (IL -6), and interleukin -8 (IL -8).  These 
cytokines are upregulated in many  human malignancies ,including ovarian cancer.  In addition to 
prom oting survival, these cy tokines also enhance growth, invasio n, angiogenesis, and metastasis.  
Thus, pharmaco logic inhibit ion of p38 MAPK in both the cancer cell and its supportive 
microenvironment represents a novel therapeut ic strategy  for improving outcomes for patients 
with ovarian cancer.
Study  I1D-MC-JIAE will evaluate efficacy o f the p38 MAPK inhibitor, LY2228820, in 
combinat ion with gemci tabine and carbopl atin for pati ents wi th platinum -sensi tive ovari an 
cancer.

LY2228820Clinical Protocol Synopsis:  Study I1D-MC-JIAE (c)
Name of Investigational Product:  LY2228820
Title of Study:   A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Phase 1b/2Study of LY2228820, a p38 MAPK 
Inhibitor, plus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin versus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin for Women with Platinum -
Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
Number of Planned Patients:
   Entered: ~130
   Enrolled/Randomized: ~120/110
   Completed : ~11 0Phase of Development:  1b/2
Length of Study:   40 months
Planned first patient visit: April2012
Planned last patient visit: August 2015
Planned interim analyses: 
1.All patients in Phase 1b have received at least 1 cycle: safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
2.Approximately 30 patients in Phase 2 have received at least 1 cycle: safety and PK
3.Approximately 60 patients in Phase 2 have received at least 2 cy cles: safety , and PK
For the purposes of database lock and completion o f the study report, t his study  will be considered complete 
following the analysis of PFS (primary Phase 2 objective).  After the study is considered complete, patients and 
investigators will remain blinded and survival data will continue to be collected. The analysis of overall survival 
(OS) will be performed after all patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study have been followed for at least 2 years .
Objectives:   
The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of 
LY2228820 that can be safely administered in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
The primary objective of the Phase 2portion of this study is to compare progression -free survival in patients 
treated with LY2228820 plusgemcitabine and carboplatin versus placebo plus gemcitabine and carboplatin.
The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate :
Change in tumor size, CA125 (serum biomarker for ovarian cancer ), overall response rate, and overall 
survival
Safety and tolerability of the combination : LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY2228820 and evaluation for effect of LY2228820 on the PK of gemcitabine, 
its metabolite (dFdU), and carboplatin
Biomarkers related to p
38 MAPK pathway a ctivity  and the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer
Patient -reported outcomes for patients enrolled in the Phase 2portion of the study
Study Design:  
This trial is a Phase 1 b dose escalation followed by a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study 
of LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus gemcitabine and carboplatin for women with platinum -
sensitive ovarian cancer. 
In the Phase 1b portion of the trial, approximately 2cohorts will be needed to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose o f LY2228820 in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
Once the maximum tolerated dose for LY2228820 in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin is defined, 
approximately 110 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the LY2228820 orplacebo arm.  All patients will receive 
gemcitabine andcarboplatin. After completion of 6 cycles of combination therapy, patients with stable disease or
evidence of biomarker and/or tumor response will receive maintenance therapy with LY2228820 or placebo until 
disease progression .  Maintenance therapy will be administered based on original 1:1 randomization.

I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 5
LY2228820Reference Therapy, Dose ,and Mode of Administration:   
Study drugs are administered on a 21 -day cycle during induction therapy (Cycles 1 -6) and o n a 28 -day cycle 
during maintenance therapy (Cycle 7 and beyond).  Placebo is administered orally every 12 hours on D ays 1 
through 10 of a 21 -day cycle during induction therapy and on Days 1 through 14 of a 28 -day cycle during 
maintenance therapy.  Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) is adm inistered IV over 30 (+15) minutes on Days 3 and 10 of 
inductio n therapy  only .  Carboplatin (AUC4 with maximum dose of 600 mg) is administered IV over 30 (+15) 
minutes on Day 3 of induction therapy only.
Criteria for Evaluation:   
Efficacy:  Progression -free survival, change in tumor size, CA-125, overall response rate, and overall survival 
Safety:  Adverse events, safety lab oratories , and electrocardiograms
Health outcomes:  F ACT -Ovarian (FACT -O) instrument
Pharmacokinetic:   PK parameters ,such as Cmax, tmax ,AUC, V d/F, CL/F, and t ½,and other relevant parameters 
forLY2228820 , gemcitabine andits metabolite (dFdU) ,and carboplatin ; population PK parameters for 
LY2228820  
Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy:   Although an efficacy analysis is not appropriate for the Phase Ib portion of this trial, any tumor 
response data will be tabulated.  In the Phase 2 portion of the study , PFS is the primary endpoint; the hazard ratio
will be estimated from survival data on all randomized patients using a Cox proportional hazard model with 
appropriate covariates.  The Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be used to estimate the survival 
curve as well as survival rates at various time points for each treatment group. The following secondary 
endpoints will be summarized for each treatment group:
 Change in tumor size
 CA-125
 Overall response rate
 Overall survival
Safety:   During the study, interim analyses will be performed to evaluate safety, PK, futility , and efficacy . 
Interim analyses for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be performed under the guida nce of an internal 
assessment committee .
Health outcomes: Patient -reported outcomes will be evaluated only during the Phase 2 portion of the study .  
Time to worsening of symptoms and changes in symptoms from baseline will be measured using the FACT -O 
instrument .
Pharmacokinetic:  For all patients in Phase 1 b and a subset of patients (10 patients /arm)in Phase 2, the 90% 
confidence interval for the difference of means will be used to estimate potential for drug interactions among 
patients who are treated with LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin compared with those treated with 
placebo plus gemcitabine and carboplatin. Log-transformed PK parameters will be used to assess such 
interactions with back transformation to theoriginal scale.

Study  of LY2228820, a p38 MA PK Inhibitor, plus Gemcitabine 
and Carboplatin versus Gemcitabine and Carboplatin for 
Women with Platinum -Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
5.Introduction
5.1. Rationale and Justification for the Study 
p38 mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK ) is a si gnaling protein act ivated by cancer cells to 
enable survival after exposure to either radiation orchemotherapy.  p38 MAPK phosphorylates a 
number of substrates, including MAPK -activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP -K2), and also 
regul ates the tumor microenvironment ’s production ofsuch key cytokines as tum ornecrosis 
factor -α (TNFα), interleukin -1β (IL -1β), interl eukin -6 (IL -6), and interleukin -8 (IL -8).  These 
cytokines are upregulated in many  human malignan cies,including ovarian cancer.  In addition to 
prom oting survival , these cytokines also enhance growth, invasio n, angiogenesis, and metastasis 
(Balkwill  and Mantovani 2001; Lewis et al. 2006).  Thus, pharmaco logic inhibit ion of p38 
MAPK in both the cancer cell and i ts supportive microenvironment represents a novel 
therapeuti c strategy  for improving outcomes for patients wi th ovari an cancer .  
Study  I1D-MC-JIAE will evaluate efficacy o f the p38 MAPK inhibitor, LY2228820 ,in 
combinat ion with gemci tabine and carbopl atin for patients wi th platinum -sensi tive ovari an 
cancer.
5.2. Ovarian Cancer
Epithelial carcino ma of the ovary  is one of the m ost comm on gynecol ogic malignancies.  It is the 
fifth most frequent cause of cancer death in women after cancers of the lung, b reast, 
colon/rectum ,and pancreas ( Howl ader 2011 ).  Sevent y percent of patients present with advanced 
disease (Fleming et al, 2009).  In 2010 ,an estimated 21,900 new cases were diagnosed ,and an 
estimated 13,900 deaths were due to thi s cancer in the Unite d States al one (Jemal 2010).  The 5 -
year survival rate of wo men with diagnosed ovari an cancer is approximately 40% (Jemal  2009).   
However, for women wit h platinum -sensi tive recurrent ovarian cancer, the median progression
-
free survival (PFS) is only  8.6 m onths (Pfisterer et al. 2006 ),indicat ing the importance of 
improving therapeut ic outcomes for these women.
5.3. General Introduction to LY2228820 
LY2228820 dimesylate (hereafter referred to as LY2228820) is a potent and select ive inhibitor 
of p38 MAPK that binds co mpet itively to the ATP binding site of the kinase to impair 
phosphorylat ion of its substrates.  In multiple ovarian cancer xenograft studi es, LY2228820 has 
demonstrate din vivo ant ineoplastic act ivity.  LY2228820 has been evaluated previously for 
safet y and tolerabilit y in a Phase 1study  (I1D -MC-JIAD , hereafter referred to as Study  JIAD)
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 19
LY2228820for pati ents wi th advanced cancer.  Detailed informat ion about LY2228820 is provided in the 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
5.4. Mechanism of Action and In Vitro/In Vivo Activity 
LY2228820 inhibits phosphorylat ion of p38 MAPK substrates and abrogates signaling events 
critical not only  to cancer cell survival but also t o production of keycytokines by the tum or 
microenvironment .  LY2228820 exhibits inhibitory act ivity agains t p38 MAPK wi th more than 
1000- fold selectivit y towards the alpha iso form of p38 MAPK (IC 50= 5.3 nM) compared witha 
panel of 179 representative kinases .  Furtherm ore, LY2228820 strongly  inhibits the p38 MAPK 
pathway  as indicated by  reduct ion in phosphorylat ion of MAPKAP -K2 and TNFα producti on.  
Specifically, LY2228820 inhibits aniso mycin -induced MAPKAP -K2 phosphor ylation in mouse 
RAW264.7 cells (IC 50= 35.3 nM) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced TNFα secret ion by 
mouse macrophages (IC 50= 6.3 nM). Finally, a single 10
-mg/kg oral dose of LY2228820
achieves more than 40% inhibit ion of phosphoryla ted MAPKAP -K2 in mur ine B16 -F10 
melano ma xenografts for approximately  4 to 8 hours after the dose .  Most importantly ,
LY2228820 demonstrates in vivo ant ineoplast ic activit y in xenograft models of human 
glioblastoma, multiple myelo ma, l ungcancer, and ovari ancancer.   
5.5. Biomarkers
In thi s study , a number of biomarkers related to p38 MAPK pathway activit y and the 
pathogenesis of ovarian cancer will be assayed in eit her blood or archived tumor samples for 
correl ation with safet y and efficacy  outcomes associ ated wi th LY2228820 therapy .  These 
evaluat ions will he lp to determine the potential usefulness of the selected bio markers for patient 
tailoring in future clinical studi es.
Circulat ing plasma proteins regulated by p38 MAPK (such as TNF , IL-1, IL-6, and IL -8)will 
be measured.  The tumor suppressor p53 will b e eval uated for gene expressio n and m utation as 
well as for protein expression in archived tumors.  The tumor suppressor PTEN will be evaluated 
for gene mutati on and protein expression in archived tumors.  For p53 and PTEN, a whole blood 
sample will also b e obtained for the iso lation and mutational analysis o f germline 
deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) fro m peripheral  blood m ononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Addit ional 
biomarkers related to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and to the p38 MAPK pathway (such as 
p-MAPKAP -K2) m ay be assessed in ei ther bl ood or archived samples.
5.6. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
Plasma pharmacokinet ics of [14C]LY2228820 were evaluated after a single dose in male Fischer 
344 rats and cyno molgus monkeys.  Based on AUC, LY2228820 accounted for 56% and 3% of 
the plasma radioact ivity in rats and monkeys, respectively.  The half -life of LY2228820 was 
similar in both species (approximately 10 hours), whereas the half -life of radioactivit y was 
longer (104 hours in monkeys and 32 hours in rats ),indicat ing that some metabo lite(s) are 
cleared m ore sl owly than parent .
In multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies in Fischer 344 rats for 7cycles (14 consecut ive dosing 
days fo llowed by 14 days of a washout period between each cy cle), exposure to LY2228820
, as 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 20
LY2228820determined by AUC and C max, increased over the dose range fro m 25 m g/kg to 150 mg/kg , but 
the increase was not consistent ly dose proportional .  The exposures were slight ly higher in 
female sthan in males, but the differences in general were not over 2 -fold.  Noaccumulation o f 
LY2228820 was observed in rat plasma after mult iple dosing.  In similar studies in mo nkeys, 
systemic exposure to LY2228820, although highly variable, increased wit h increasing dose from 
15 m g/kg to 60 m g/kg. Exposures generally  appeared to be l ower af ter m ultiple dosing when 
compared to a single dose and the toxicokinet ics of LY2228820 were similar in both male and 
female monkeys.
The nonclinical tumor growth delay models fro m 2 studi es in mice indicated efficacy  in the 10 -
mg/kg groups corresponding to an AUC (0-24hr ) of 13.4 g*hr/mL. The preclinical 
pharmacokinet ic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model in mouse was developed to characterize the 
relationship between drug concentrations and phosphorylated MAPKAP -K2levels.  This PK/PD 
model integrated the time course of the pharmacokinet ics of the com pound and the inhibit ion of 
phosphorylated MAPKAP -K2in PBMCs.  Allometricscaling was performed using data fro m 4 
preclinical species:  mouse, rat, dog, and monkey .  The ini tial (pre -FHD) human PK predictions 
assumed linear pharmacokinet ics at therapeutic doses and emplo yed a 2 -compartment PK m odel.  
The human PK/PD simulat ions(based on allo metric prediction o f PK and the m urine xenograft 
model) predi cted that a range of 40 to 120 mg administered orally every 12 hours would achieve 
the required 80% maximal inhibit ion of phosphorylated MAPKAP -K2associated with tumor 
growth dela y in preclinical efficacy  studies. However, interim human PK data fro m the first 7 
cohorts in Study JIAD indicate dthat the predicted efficacious dose range required to achieve this 
thresho ld may be higher than the initial preclinical PK/PD m odel predicti ons.  
5.7. Nonclinical Toxicology
The toxi city of LY2228820 has been characteri zed in a broad range of nonclinical safet y studi es.  
In monkeys, repeat -dose studies o f 1 month
’sdurati on wi th daily  dosing, and of 3and 6 months’
durati on using an intermittent d osing schedule of 2weeks on treatment and 2weeks off 
treatm ent have been conducted.  In rats, repeat- dose studies of 1 month’sdurati on (daily  dosing) 
and 6 mont
hs’durati on (intermi ttent dosing schedul e) have been conducted. Other nonclinical 
studi es include a single -dose study  in rat; a battery  of safet y pharmaco logy studi es (assessing the 
central  nervous, cardi ovascular, respiratory  and gastrointestinal systems), a battery  of genetic 
toxicity studies , an embry o-fetal devel opment study  in rats ,and a p hototoxicit y assessment . 
Collect ively, these studies have adequately characterized the toxico logy profile to support 
clinical testing with LY2228820.
Gastrointestinal tract, liverand skin have been ident ified as the primary target organs toxi city in
nonclinical species. In addition, hypercellular bone marrow and peripheral leukocy tosishave 
been observed in both rat and monkey .  Intermittent dosing generally ameli orate dthe toxicit ies 
observed wit h daily dosing , or resul ted in similar toxi city despi te longer durati ons of  dosing 
(three to six months) .  Wit h daily dosing for 1month in mo nkeys, the no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was not identified (<3 mg/kg) ,and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 15 
mg/kg; however, in a 6-month intermitten t dosing study , the NOAEL was 15 mg/kg and the 
MTD was 30 mg/kg.  In rats, a NOAEL for daily dosing for 
1month was not ident ified (<25 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 21
LY2228820mg/kg) ,and the MTD was 150 mg/kg.  When the duration was extended to 6months wit h 
intermittent dosing, the NOAEL and t he MTD were 25 mg/kg due to a small number of deaths at 
75 m g/kg; however, m ost rats tol erated 75 m g/kg,and most male rats tolerated 150 m g/kg for the 
durati on of  the study .Decreased fetal weight, increased skeletal developmental variat ions, 
increased p ostim plantati on loss, malformed fetuses ,and decreased numbers o f viable fetuses 
were observed in pregnant rats treated with LY22288200 during the period of organogenesis.  In 
safet y pharmaco logy studi es, m onitorable and manageable increases in blood press ure, decreases 
in tidal vo lume,and central nervous system effects were observed.
5.8. Interaction with C ytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzy mes and Enzy mes 
Responsible for the Metabolism of LY2228820
The effect of LY2228820 on drug- metabo lizing enzymes has been studied i n vitro using human 
liver microsomes.  LY2228820 was found to competit ively inhibit the biotransformat ion of 
midazo lam to 1 ′-hydroxy -midazo la
m with an est imated Ki o f 1.2µM (0.5 µg/mL).  LY2228820 
was also shown to inhibit CYP3A in a time -dependent manner with a kinactof 0.069 min -1and 
KIof 9.5 µM (3.99 µg/m L).  These data suggest edthe possibilit y that LY2228820 m ight
modulate cl earance of drugs that are metabolized b y CYP 3Ain vivo.
The abilit y of LY2228820 to induce cataly tic act ivities associated wi th CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A was examined in primary  cultures of fresh human hepatocy tes.  LY2228820 was found 
unlikely  to cause in vivo induct ion of the above CYP isoforms wit hin the concentration range 
examined (0.01 to 10 µM).
The effect of LY2228820 on the activit y of CYP3A in vivo has been evaluated in the dose 
confirmat ion phase of Study  JIAD (Part B) in which patients were administered a 2 -mg oral dose 
of midazo lam in the absence or presence o f 420 mg LY2228820 administered every  12 hours 
(after fourteen doses).  Resultsshowed that mean PK parameters (C maxand AUC) of midazo lam 
administered with LY2228820 were no higher than those of midazo lamadministered al one,
indicat ingthat LY2228820 may not inhibit the CYP3A act ivity up to the dose level investigated 
(18 patients at 420 mg given every 12 hours).
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the metabo lic clearance of 
LY2228820 is primarily mediated by  the UDP -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) pathway  (87%), 
with CYP -mediated pathway  contribut ing to only 13%.  Further CYP phenoty ping studi es using 
recombinant human CYPs indicated that CYP3A contribute dto 72% of the CYP -mediated 
metabo lic clearance of LY2228820.  Taken together, the contribut ion of CYP3A to the total 
metabo lic clearance of LY2228820 is estimated to be less than 10%.  The regulatory  guidance 
suggests that any  enzyme contributing <25% to th e systemic clearance of the drug is not 
clinically significant (FDA 2012).
Collect ively, the above in vitro a nd in vivo data suggest that clinical interact ions are unlikely 
when LY2228820 is coadministered with substrates, inhibitors and or inducers of CYP3A.   
When coadministered, inhibitors of UGT may increase the plasma concentrations of LY2228820 
and inducers of UGT m ay decrease the plasma concentrations of LY2228820.

inducers of UGT .
5.9. Rationale for Selection of Dose Range
The dose ra nge of LY2228820 for the Phase 1 b component of this study consists of doses 
previously explored in the first -in-human Phase 1 Study JIAD, wherein the single -agent MTD 
was i dentified at a dose level o f420 m gadministered every  12 hours on Days 1 through 14 of a 
28-day cycle.  However, arelatively high frequency  of Grade 1/Grade 2 dizziness and tremor
andGrade 3 rash were observed in a subsequent dose-confirmat ion cohort
, and led to a dec ision 
to further explore the 300-mg every 12 hours ( Q12H )dose.  O f the 11 pati ents in Study JIAD
who received LY2228820 at 300 mg Q12H, 2 patients (18%) experienced a possibly  related 
Grade 3 rash dose-limit ing toxicit y (DLT )
-equivalent event and only 1 p atient (9.1%) each 
experienced a possibly related Grade 1 dizziness event and possibly related Grade 1 tremor 
event.  Therefore, t he 300 -mg Q12H dose was recommended as the Phase 2 dose for 
monotherapy , and will be the maximum  dose of LY2228820 administere d for this Phase 1b/2 
study  (JIAE).  
The Pha se 1b porti on of JIAE will inclu de 2 cohorts at LY2228820 doses of 200 mg and 300 mg 
every 12 hours and the Phase 2 porti on of JIAE will be conducted at a single reco mmended 
LY2228820 dose not exceeding 300 mg every  12 hours .  In JIAE , LY2228820 (or placebo) is 
administered on a 2 1-day cycle (every  12 h ours on Days 1through 10) in co mbinat ion with 
gemcitabine (Days 3 and 10) and carbopl atin(Day 3) during induct ion therapy  (Cycles 1 through 
6) and on a 28 -day c ycle (every 12 h ours on Days 1 through 14) as a single agent during 
maintenance therapy  (Cycle 7 and bey ond).
The do se of LY2228820 for the Phase 2 component of this study  will be a single -dose l evel 
ident ified during the Phase 1 b porti on of  the study  as the MTD when LY2228820 is administered 
in combinat ion with gem citabine and carbopl atin.  
Throughout induction therapy (Cycles 1 through 6), the dose for gemcitabine will start at 1000
mg/m2on 
Days 3 and 10 and the dose for carboplatin will start at AUC 4 (with a maximum dose 
of 600 mg) on Day 3 of a 2 1-day cycle.
5.10. Rationale for Amendment (a)
In April 2012, Study  JIAE was am ended to address a number of protocol  issues noted since the 
start of enrollment. The m ost si gnificant changes included the following:  revisio ns to allow
measurement of serum creat inine by the Isotope Dilut ion Mass Spectrometry  (IDMS )method
; 
changes to a secondary  object ive to clarify rationale for measuring plasma concentrations of 
gemcitabine, i ts metabo lite (dFdU), and carbopl atin; inclusio n of a 600- mg maximum dose for 
carbopl atin; decreas ein the fast ing period around the LY2228820 dose; and addition of  a Day  10 
electrocardi ogram  (ECG )during Cycles 1 and 2.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 23
LY22288205.11. Rationale for Amendment (b)
After 2 reported DLTs of Grade 4 thrombocy topenia occurred in patients enrolled in the 
Phase 1b porti on of  Study  JIAE, the Phase 2 portion of the study  was opened on 21 May  2013, 
utilizing a dose of 200 mg o f LY2228820 in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine and carbopl atin as 
the recommended Ph ase 2 dose for induct ion therapy .
Lilly then conducted a thorough review of the Phase 1b data and blinded adverse event data from 
patients enrolling concurrent ly in the Phase 2 portion, noting the fo llowing:
1.Thirty-three percent of Phase 1b patients (2/6) experienced Grade 4 transient 
thrombocy topenia (l asting 1 and 4 days or less ).  The expected incidence of Grade 3/4 
thrombocy topenia for the gemcitabine/carbopl atin combinat ion is approximately 35% 
(Pfisterer et al. 2006).  Lilly, in co llaboration with study invest igators, concluded that the 
protocol  hematol ogic DLT cri teria did not take into account the known toxicit ies of the 
gemcitabine/carbopl atin co mbination, and thus limited the use of those criteria (alone) for 
the identificat ion of maximum tolerated dose of LY2228820 to be administered with the 
standard -of-care combinat ion.
2.Drug -related adverse events that characterized the DLTs of LY2228820 administered as a 
single agent (Study  JIAD), such as ataxia, di zziness, and rash ,were infrequent and low 
grade in Study  JIAE to that point (no dermatological toxicit ies were reported; 2 of 6 
patients experienced Grade 3 syncope judged by  the invest igators to be unrelated t
o study 
therapy ).  
3. P K analyses from Studies JIAD and JIAE and preclinical modeli ng studi es suggest that a 
300-mg dose of LY2228820 administered every 12 hours provide sa greater chance to 
achieve potentially efficacious exposures.
4.Blinded adverse event data fro m 9patients in the Phase 2 portion of Study  JIAE (200 -mg 
dose LY2228820) showed a relat ively low rate of DLT -level toxicit y.  Neurol ogical  and 
derm atological toxicities included Grade 1 dizziness, Grade 1 rash, Grade 2 rash, and 
Grade 3 rash ( 1patient each).  Hematological toxicit ies reported were Grade 2 
neutropeni a (2 pati ents) and Grade 3 neutropenia (2 patients), with no Grade 3/4 
thrombocy topenia reported. These findings supported further exploration o f the 300 -mg 
dose of LY2228820.
Therefore, as of 25 September 2013, enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of Study  JIAE was 
temporarily halte
d.  The protocol is amended here to reflect revised DLT criteria to better 
account for expected toxicit ies from the gem citabine/carbopl atin co mbination and to resume the 
Phase 1b invest igation of the 300- mg LY2228820 dose in co mbination wi th gemci tabine and 
carbopl atin in an addit ional cohort of 3 patients.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 24
LY22288205.12. Rationale for Amendment (c)
Metabo lic clearance analysis has recent ly been completed which revealed that CYP3A mediated 
metabo lism is not the primary clearance pathway  of LY2228820 . This allows f or the restri ction 
of the CYP3A inhibitors, inducers, or substrates to be removed and for the use of dexamethasone 
and other anti -emet icsduring treatm ent wi th LY2228820 . 
Based on the available preclinical data, there is a possibl e risk of clinical drug –drug interaction 
when LY2228820 is administered with inhibitors or inducers of UGT enzymes.  In the absence 
of clinical data to refine the risk of interaction, caution is warranted in the conco mitant use of 
UGT enzyme inhibitors suc h as valproic acid and probenecid and inducers such as 
carbamazepine, phenyto in and rifampin.  When, in the clinical invest igator's opinion, 
concomitant use of valproic acid or probenecid is indicated, LY2228820 -related DLTs of ataxia, 
dizziness and rash s hould be carefully mo nitored.
The ovari an cancer landscape has changed during the course of this study .  Maintenance therapy  
as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen has beco me more prevalent . Several studi es are 
examining the effect of maintenance after patients achieve a CR with the first line platinum 
regimen. In order to balance these patients between the placebo and LY 2228820 arms, prior
maintenance therapy  has been added as arando mization factor . 
Theoriginal  sample size calculat ion for the Phase 2 portion of the study  included a censoring 
rate assumpt ionof6%with103PFS events needed from110 pati ents.  
Upon reflect ion,Lilly 
considers that this assumed censoring rate is too low.  If just 8 or more patients are lost to follow 
up,the actual censoring rate would be higher .  Wit h this protocol amendment , the censoring rate 
estimate has been increased to 28% resul ting in a reduction in the number of PFS events needed 
to 79 .  Thehazard rati o of 0.7hasbeen m aintained but the power has been reduced to 77% from 
83%.  These assumpt ions are consistent with enro llment and censoring experience in this phase 
of devel opment. 
In addit ion, the interim analyses for the study have been updated as fo llows:
The th ird interim  analysis will be perform ed when approximately  60 pat ientsin the 
Phase 2 porti on of  the study  have co mpleted 2 cycles of treatment , and will examine 
safet yand PKonly.  Fut ility has been eliminated as Lilly does not expect that enough 
PFS even tswill have been observed to allow a fut ility analysis tooccur at that time. 
The fo urth interim analysis has been removed as all patients will have been enrolled and 
the PFS data will be immature .  This interim would not be informat ive for futilit y or 
efficacy .  Tri al level safet y will cont inue to be monitored throughout the study.

LY22288207.2.1. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
Exclusio n Cri terion [10] eliminates drugs that cannot be mapped to a standard drug dict ionary, or 
for which litt le data are known to analyze the potent ial relationship o f adverse events (AEs) or 
drug interactions.   Exclusio n Cri teria [11], [12], [13], [17], [20], [21],[23], and [ 24] exclude 
patients wi th confounding therapy , condi tions, or circumstances.  Ex clusion Cri teria [14], [15], 
and [16] exclude patients receiving medicat ions that m ay alter absorpti on or metabolism of 
LY2228820 .  Exclusio n Cri teria[18], [19], and [22] exclude patients with condit ions that have a 
distinct prognosis .
7.3. Discontinuations
7.3.1. Discontinuation of Patients
The cri teria for enrollment m ust be fo llowed explici tly.  If a pati ent who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertent ly enro lled, Lilly or its designee must be contacted.  In these 
cases, the investigator must obtain documen ted approval  from Lilly to allow the patient to 
continue to receive study  drug.
In addition,patients will be discont inued fro m the study treatm entand/or study  in the following 
circumstances.
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigati onal product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpat ible 
with this study .
Invest igator/
physician decisio n
oThe invest igator/physician decides that the patient should be withdrawn fro m the 
study  treatm ent and/ or study .  If this decisio n is made because of toxicit y, a 
serious AE, or a clinically  significant l aboratory  value, the study  drug (s)shoul d
be discont inued and appropri ate measures taken.
oIf the patient, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agent 
that has been demo nstrated to be effect ive for treatment of the study  indicat ion, 
discontinuat ion from the study  treatm entoccurs prior to introducti on of  the new 
agent.
Patientdecision 
oThe patient, or the patient’s designated representative, requests that the patient be 
withdrawn from  the study  treatm ent and/ or study.
Sponsor decision
oThe invest igator or Lilly stops the study or stops the patient’s parti cipat ion in the 
study  for m edical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practice.
The patient is nonco mpliant with study  treatm entand/or procedures .
Evidence of progressive disease as defined by  RECIST 1.1.
Unacceptable toxicit y.
It is necessary  todelay a patient’s treatm ent m ore than 21 days due to toxicit y.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 29
LY2228820Apatient’s calculated creatinine clearance has not returned to 50mL/min at the 
beginning of a n induct ioncycle (see Section 9.1.1.1 ).
The patient beco mes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control (for those patients 
who are able to conceive).
Exceptions may be granted in rare circumstances in which the pati ent has a serious or life -
threatening condit ion for which there is no effect ive alternative therapy and, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, is receiving benefit from study treatm ent.  In these rare cases, the investigator 
must obtain documented approval fro m Lilly to allow the patient to continue to receive study  
treatm ent.
The reason and date for discont inuat ion will be collected for all patients.  Al l patients who
discontinue but receive at least one dose of study  treatm entwill have p rocedures perform ed as 
shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
For Phase 1b, any pat ient who experiences a dose -limit ing toxicit y or receives at l east 75% of 
planned doses of LY2228820 in Cycle 1 will be deemed evaluable for safet y assessment at that
dose l evel.  Non -evaluable pat ients may be replaced to ensure at least 3 evaluable patients at 
each dose level, unless accrual to that cohort has stopped because 2 or more patients at that dose 
level have experienced a DLT.  In no case should patients be replaced if they  were discont inued 
from the study  due to toxi city.  Pati ents who are evaluable for safet y assessment at a dose level
but have insufficient PK sampling may be replaced upon consultation wit h the invest igator(s) 
and the Lilly Clinical Research Physician (CRP) to ensure adequate PK data, unless accrual to 
that cohort has stopped because 2 o r more patients at that dose level have experienced a DLT.
7.3.2. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly, the invest igator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) of the study  site judges i t necessary for m edical, safet y, regulatory , ethi cal, or other 
reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and good clinical pract ice(GCP ).
7.3.3. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly judges it necessary for medical, safet y, regul atory , ethical , 
or othe r reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.

Throughout the study, LY2228820 (or placebo )will be administered orally on an intermittent 
schedule (every 12 hours on Days 1 through 10 of a 21-day cycle during induct ion therapy and 
every 12 hours on Days 1 through 14 of a 28-day cycle during maintenance therapy ).
During induct ion therapy , gemci tabine will  be administered IV over approximately 30 (+15)
minutes on Day s 3and 10of the 2 1-day cycle and c arbopl atin will be administered IV 30 
minutes after gemcitabine over approximately 30 (+15)minutes on Day  3of the 2 1-day cycle.
8.1.1. Phase 1b
An unblinded, Phase 1b dose escalat ion of LY2228820 in co mbinat ion with standard doses of 
gemcitabine and carboplatin will be com pleted prior to opening the randomi zed, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled Phase 2 porti on
of this study .  Using a “3+3” dose escala tion m ethod, cohorts 
of 3patients will be treated with induction therapy atescalating doses of LY2228820, orally  
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 31
LY2228820administered every 12hours on D ays 1 through 10 of a 21 -day cycle , in combinati on wi th 
gemcitabine (1000 m g/m2on Days 3 and 10) and carbopl atin(AUC 4 on Day  3).  Patients will 
receive 6 cycles of induct ion therapy unless the discontinuat ion criteria are fulfilled .  All pat ients 
in the Phase 1b porti on of  the study  thatachieve stable disease or better will also receive 
maintenance therapy  consisting of LY2228820 as a single agent at a dose of 300 mg every 
12hours on Days1 through 14 of a 28 -day cycle.   Pati ents will  cont inue maintenance therapy 
until the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled.
8.1.2. Phase 2
After the optimal dose of LY2228820 in co mbination with gemci tabine and carbopl atinhas been 
determined fro m the Phase 1b portion and discussed with study  invest igators , the Phase 2porti on 
of the study  will open to enrollment.  The recommended Phase 2dose of LY2228820 in 
combinat ion with gemci tabine and carbopl atinwill not exceed the single -agent LY2228820 dose 
of 300 mg every 12 hours .  In the Phase 2porti on, approximately  110 pati ents will be 
rando mized 1:1 to receive either LY2228820 plus gem citabine and carboplatin (Arm A) or 
placebo pl us gemcitabine and carboplat in (Arm B).  Patients will receive 6 cy cles of induct ion 
therapy  unless the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled.  All pat ients in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study  that ac hieve stable disease or better will also receive maintenance therapy  consist ing of 
LY2228820 as a single agent at a dose of 300 mg every 12 hours on Days 1 throu gh 14 of a 
28-day cycle.  Patients will  continue maintenance therapy until the discont inuat ion criteria are 
fulfilled.
Approximately  110 pati ents will be rando mized 1:1 to provide 83% power for identifying a 
hazard ratio of 0.7 (LY2228820 arm to placebo arm) with a false -positive rate of 0.2 (one -sided) 
(refer to Section 12for addi tional details regarding the sample size descript ion). Patientswill be 
rando mized with a minimizat ion method (Pocock and Simo n 1975) using the fo llowing factors: 
time fro m completion of first line plat inum -
based therapy to relapse (6 to 12 months versus over 
12 m onths) and ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2).
Starti ng fro m protocol  (c), randomizat ion scheme is updated by  adding another randomizat ion 
factor . Patients who consent to protocol (c) will be randomized using fo llowing factors: time 
from completion of first line plat inum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 to 1 2 months versus over 12 
months), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2) and m aintenance therap y as a part of or 
after a first line pl atinum regimen ( yes versus no).
8.1.3. Maintenance Therapy
After complet ion of 6 cy cles of combination therapy , pati ents wi th stable disease or better will 
receive maintenance therapy with either LY2228820 or pl acebo according to the original 
rando mizat ion unt il thediscontinuat ion criteria are fulfilled (refer to Section 7.3.1 ).  After 
discontinuat ion from study  treatm ent, p atients will have a short -term follow-up peri od of  
approximately  30 days with a long-term follow-up peri od until death or until the patient is lost to 
follow
-up.  Pati ents who benefit may cont inue to receive study treatm ent for long-term durati ons 
even after the study  has met i ts primary objective.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 32
LY2228820This study  will be considered com plete f ollowing the analysis of PFS. The database will be 
locked ,and the Clinical Study  Report will be co mpleted after at l east 103 PFS events have been 
observed .  After the study  is considered complete, patients and invest igators will remain blinded 
and survival data will  cont inue to be collected .  The analysis o f OS will  beperformed after all 
patientsin the Phase 2 portion of the study  have been fo llowedfor at least 2 y ears.  After the 
analysis of OS, both patients and invest igators will be unblinded; patients receiving maintenance 
therapy  with placebo will discontinue study  treatm ent,whereas patients receiving maintenance 
therapy  with LY22 28820 may continue study  treatment on the extensio n phase o f the study  until 
the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled.
8.1.4. Interim Analyses
Thefirst interim analysis will be conducted to assess safet yand PK; it will be performed when 
all evaluable patients in the Phase 1b portion of the study  have received at least 1 cycle of study  
treatment.
Thesecond interim analysis will be conducted to assess safet yand PK ; it will be performed
when approximately  30 patients in the Phase 2 porti on of  the study have received at least 1 cy cle 
of study  treatm ent.
The thirdinterim analysis will be conducted to assess safet y,andPK; it will be perf ormed when 
approximately  60 pat ients in the Phase 2 porti on of the study  have received at least 2 cycles of 
study  treatm ent.
Interim analyses for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be performed under the guidance o f an 
internal  assessment committee. SeeSection 12.2.11 for further details regarding interim 
analyses.
8.1.5. Study Period Definitions
Terms used to describe the study  periods are defined below:
Baseline:   from the time of screening to first study treatment (or discont inuat ion, if no 
treatm ent is given)
Study Trea tment Period:   time from treatment start to discont inuat ion from study  
treatm ent
Post-discontinuation Follow -Up:  begins the day  after the pati ent discontinues study  
treatm ent. 
oThe short -term follow -up period begins 1day after the pati ent discont inues study 
treatm ent and l asts approximately 30days.
oThe long-term follow -up period begins 1day after the short -term follow-up 
period is com pleted and continues until death or un tilthe pat ient is lost to foll ow-
up. D uring the long-term follow-up peri od, pati ents shoul d be assessed for 
survival every 84 ±14 days .
Patients will  receive study  treatment until the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled (refer to 
Secti on7.3.1 ).
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 33
LY2228820All patients in the Phase Ib portion of the study  will have intens ivePK sampling .  Approximately 
20 pati ents ( 10patients /arm)in the Phase 2 porti on of  the study will also have intensive PK 
sampling ; all other patients in the Phase 2 porti on will have standard PK sampling at regularly 
scheduled clinic visit s as outlined in the study  schedul e.
8.1.6. Baseline and Study T reatment Period Assessments
The Study  Schedule (Attachm ent 1 ) describes the timing of baseline and study  treatm ent peri od 
assessments for both phases .  All patients who receive at least one dose of st udy treatm entwill 
have p rocedures perform ed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Written inform ed consent m ust be obtained pri or to any  study -specific pretreatment evaluations.   
At baseline and /orduring the study treatment period , the following assessments will be 
completed:  m edical history ,physical examinat ion, tumor assessment , radio logic imaging , 
clinical laboratory  tests , ECG, store d sam ple for pharmacogeno mics (where local regulat ions 
allow), samples f or PK, ci rculat ing plasma proteins, Funct ional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
-
Ovarian Cancer (FACT -O)instrument, and archived tumor sample.
Tumor measurements will be performed by  radiologic imaging every 2 cycles according to the
study  schedule unt ilevidence of progressive disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 is observed (refer 
toSection 10.1).  Tumor responses will be confirmed. Imaging methods used at baseline must 
be consistent ly used during study .  For patients cont inuing on study treatm ent after the analysis 
of PFS and secondary  object ive are complete (see Secti on8.1.3 ), efficacy assessments will be 
done at the invest igator’s discret ionbased on the standard of care.
All enrolled patients will be assessed fo r toxi city using Co mmo n Termino logy Criteria f or 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  Adverse event report ing will be done as specified in
Table JIAE. 10.1 (Section 10.3).
8.1.7. Post -discontinuation Follow -
Up Period Assessments
All patients shou ld be followed and AEs reported for a minimum of 30 days after the pati ent 
discontinues study  treatm ent.  Other follow -up assessments will be conducted according to the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
8.1.8. Study Extension
The analysis of OS will be performed after all patient sin the Phase 2 portion of the study  have 
been fo llowedfor at least 2 y ears.  After the final analysis o f OS, both pa tients and invest igators 
will be unblinded; patients receiving maintenance therapy with placebo will discontinue study  
treatm ent,whereas patients receiving maintenance therapy with LY2228820 may continue study 
treatm ent on the extensio n phase of the study until the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled.
Serious AEs will be collected and reported to Lilly Global Pat ient Safet y (see Sect ion 10.3.1 ).  In 
the event that an SAE occurs, addit ional information (such as local laboratory  resul ts, 
concomitant medicat ions, and hospitalizat ions) m ay be requested by  Lilly  in order to eval uate the 
reported SAE.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 34
LY2228820Adverse events leading to discont inuat ion and dose re ducti on of  treatm ent will also be collected . 
Invest igators may perform other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, the results of all these assessments may  not be routinely  collected by  the 
sponsor.
The patient’s pa rticipat ion in the study extension will be co mpleted after di scont inuat ion of study  
treatm ent.  There will be no post -discont inuat ion follow -up peri od in the extensio n phase of the 
study .
8.2. Discussion of Design and Control
The Phase 1 b porti on of this study  utilizes a standard 3+3 design invo lving 2 sequent ial cohorts 
of at least 3 pati ents treated during induct ion therapy  with gemci tabine and carbopl atinplus 
escalat ing LY2228820 doses (200 mg and 300 mg every 12 hours on Days 1 through 10 of a 21-
day cycle , respect ively) .
The Phase 2 portion of this study  utilizes a rando mized, controlled design.  Rando mizat ion 
minimizes systemat ic bias in the select ion and assignment of pat ients to study  treatm ent and 
provi des just ification for inferent ial statistical methods applied to data from this study.  Using an 
appropriate concurrent con trol arm enables di rect stati stical estimat ion of benefits and harms due 
to study  treatm ent and minimizes bias in the assessment and interpretation of observed treatment 
effects.
Invest igational treatment administration in this study  is doubl e-blind .  Patients, study  personnel 
at 
invest igational sites, and study  personnel at the sponsor do not have immediate access to 
treatm ent assi gnments for any  patients.  This design fe ature minimizes potential bias due to 
knowl edge of treatm ent assignments during the study .

LY2228820Any measurements used to determine dos e shoul d be taken at each cy cle, and d ose shoul d be re -
calculated for each cy cle.  Patientsmust meet the criteria to receive all 3drugs o n Day 1 in order 
to start the next cy cle.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the following:
Explaining the correct use of the drug(s) and planned duration of each individual’s 
treatm ent to the patient and site personnel
Verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly 
Maintaining accurate records of study  drug dispensing and collect ion 
Returning all unused medicat ion to Lilly or its designee at the end of the study
Note :In some cases, sites may destroy  the m aterial if, during the invest igator site select ion, the 
evaluator hasverified and docum ented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and wri tten 
procedures to dispose clinical trial materials.
Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as poss ible if theyhavea com plaint 
or probl em with the study  drug (s)so that the situatio n can be assessed.
9.1.1. Carboplatin Dosing
Carbopl atin dosing, using the Calvert formula, is often based upon a calculated creatinine 
clearance using serum creat inine as a surrogate for renal funct ion.  Several assays are available to 
measure serum creat inine.  In the United States and many parts of the world, most laboratories 
use m ethods that are standardized against reference material in which the creat inine value has 
been assigned by  IDMS.  After 31 December 2010, all clinical laboratories in the United States, 
and so me laboratories in countries outside the US (OUS), will use creatinine methods 
standardized relat ive to the IDMS reference material.
The recalibrat ion of ser um creat inine measurements against the IDMS reference material may 
resul t in slight differences in reported serum creatinine levels in the low range of normal.  
Consequent ly, measurement of serum creat inine relat ive to the IDMS standard could result in an 
overestimat ion of glo merular filtration rate (GFR) in so me patients with normal renal funct ion.  
If the total carboplat in dose is calculated based on an est imated GFR using an IDMS -
standardized serum creatinine and the Calvert formula, carboplat in dosing c ould be higher than if 
the GFR had been direct ly measured, and could result in increased toxicit y.
At sites where creatinine is determined by a method standardized to the IDMS reference 
materi al, the est imated GFR used in the Calvert formula to calculate A UC-based dosing should 
not exceed 125 mL/min for patients who have not begun therapy.  After 31 December 2010, all 
US si tes and any  other OUS si te where the IDMS method is available should calculate 
carbopl atin doses based upon serum creatinine values that were measured by the IDMS method.  
At sites where the IDMS method is not available, for the estimated GFR used to calculate the 
Calvert formula, all sites will follow the dosing guidelines outlined below and cap the GFR at 
125 mL/min.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 38
LY2228820The site is responsi ble to consul t the l ocal lab to determine what method of serum creat inine 
measurement is used by that laboratory .
For thi s study , the carboplatin dose must be calculated using the Calvert formula ( Attachment 7 ).
9.1.1.1. Calculated Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine clearance will be calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula ( Attachm ent 6 ).  
This form ula shoul d be used to calculate a patient’s creatinine clearance at baseline and for all 
subsequent cy cles of induct ion therapy .  If a patient’s calculated creatinine clearance has not 
returned to 50mL/min at the beginning of a cycle during induction therapy , the pati ent m ust 
not receive further carboplat in unless approved by the Lilly  CRP .Alternat ive formulas, such as 
Modificat ion of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study  Group form ula, may not be used to 
calculate the creatinine clearance.
9.2. Materials and Supplies
LY2228820 will be provided by Lilly.  Gemci tabine , carbopl atin,and other standard of care 
drugs will be provided according to local requirements. Clinical trial materials will be labeled 
according to the country’s regulatory  requi rements.  All study  drugs shoul d be stored within the 
temperature range stated on the label.
9.2.1. LY2228820
LY2228820 will be supplied as tablets for oral administration .  LY2228820 tablets should be 
stored wi thin the temperature range stated on the label.  Invest igators should instruct patients to 
store the tablets at home in the original package and to keep out of the reach of children.  Tablets 
shoul d not be split, crushed,or dissolved.
9.2.2. Gemcitabine
Gem citabine is supplied as a ly ophilized powder in sterile vials containing eit her 200 mg or 1 g 
of gem citabine as the hydrochl oride sal twith mannito l and sodium acetate. Thelyophilized 
product should be stored at room te mperature. Drug will be reconst itutedwith norm al saline 
added to the vial to make a solut ion ideally containing 10 mg/mL (not to exceed 40 mg/mL) .  
Once the drug has been reconst ituted it should be stored at room temperature and used within 
24hours. Any unuse d porti on of  a vial  must not be stored for future use and m ust be discarded.
9.2.3. Carboplatin
Carbopl atin is supplied as a sterile, py rogen -free solut ion available in 10 mg/mL mult iple-dose 
vials containing 50 mg, 150 mg, 450 mg , or 600 mg of carbopl atinfor administration by 
intravenous infusio n.
Note :Aluminum reacts with carbopl atin,causing precipitate format ion and loss of potency;
therefore, needles or IVsets containing aluminum parts that may co me in contact with the drug 
must not be used for the preparation or administratio n of carboplatin .
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 39
LY22288209.2.4. Placebo
Placebo will be supplied as tablets (consist ing of inact ive ingredients ) for oral  administrati on.
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
In the Phase 1b porti on of  the study , pati ents will be assigned to a specific dose level in cohorts 
of 3 pati ents as described in Sect ion 9.5.
In the Phase 2 porti on of  the study , appro ximately 110 patients will be rando mized 1:1 in a 
doubl e-blind manner by an interactive vo ice-response system (IVRS) to ei ther Arm  A 
(LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplat in) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and 
carbopl atin).Randomization will minim ize imbalance between treatment arms according to the 
following factors:   time from completion of first line platinum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 to 12 
months versus over 12 m onths) andECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2). 
Starti ng fro m protocol  (c), the randomization scheme is updated by  adding another 
rando mizat ion factor .  Patients who consent to protocol (c) will be rando mized using fo llowing 
the factors: time fro m completion of first line plat inum -based therapy to relapse (6 to 12 m onths 
versus over 12 m onths), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2) and m aintenance therapy  
as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen ( yes versus no).
This procedure is based on a well -defined al gorithm (Pocock and Sim on 1975) .  The 
rando mizat ion probabilit y factor will be set at 0.75.
The IVRS will be used to assign blisterpacks containing double -blind study  drug to each patient.  
Site personnel will confirm that they  have l ocated the correct blisterpacks by entering a 
confirmat ion number found on the blisterpacks into the IVRS.
9.4. Selection and Timing of Doses
As described in Table JIAE .
9.1, Phase 1b is the dose escalat ion phase of the study  and P hase 2is 
the randomized phase of the study .
Patients will  receive LY 2228820 (or pl acebo) in combinat ion with gemci tabine and carbopl atin 
for 6 cycles as induct ion therapy . LY2228820 (or placebo) will be administered every  12 hours 
onDays 1to 10 of a 21 -day cycle .  Gemci tabine 1000 mg will be administered on Days 3 and 10 
and carbopl atin AUC 4 will be administered on Day  3. After the completion o f induct ion 
therapy , LY2228820 (or pl acebo) will be taken on Days 1 to 14 of a 28- day cycle for 
maintenance therapy .  
.
LY2228820 is administered prior to chemotherapy to allow LY2228820 to reach steady state and
achieve maximal p38 MAPK inhibit ion, blocking a potenti al survival mechanism by which
tumor cells evade gemcitabine -and carb oplatin-induced DNA damag e.The study  drug 
administration schedule is intended to mimic the 50% on/off schedule of single -agent usage of 
LY2228820 within the 21- day schedule requi red for the gem citabine /carbopl atin combinat ion.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY22288209.4.1. Phase 1b
9.4.1.1. Induction Therapy
LY2228820 will be administered orally every 12 hours (±3 hours) on Days 1through 10of a 21-
day cycle .  Pati ents shoul d not consum e food beginning 1 hour before and ending 1 hour after 
taking the study  drug.  LY2228820 should be taken at the same t ime of the day  (for exam ple, 
0800 hours and 2000 hours) with a full glass o f water.   If a patient misses or vomits a dose, that 
dose should be o mitted.  Patients must record the time and amount of each dose taken (or 
alternat ively, the time and amount of the do se missed or vomited) in a daily diary.
Gem citabine, 1000 mg/m2, will  be administered IV over approximately  30 (+15) minutes on 
Days 3 and 10 of a
21-day cycle.  The gem citabine infusi on will be started following the 
morning dose of LY2228820.
Carbopl atin,AUC 4 (maximum dose , 600 mg), will be administered IV over approximately 
30(+15) minutes on Day 3 of 
a 21- day cycle.  The carboplatin infusio n will fo llow the 
gemcitabine infusi on.  Ant iemetics shoul d be administered according to institutional standard 
procedures.
9.4.1.2. Maintenance Therapy
After complet ion of 6 cy cles of induction therapy , pati ents wi th stable disease or better will 
receive maintenance therapy with LY2228820 unt il the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled 
(refer to Section 7.3.1 ).  After discont inuat ion from study  treatm ent, pati ents will  have a short
-
term follow-up period of approximately  30 days wi th a long-term follow-up peri od until death or 
until the pat ient is lost to foll ow-up.  Pati ents who benefit may cont inue to receive study 
treatm ent even after the study  has met i ts primary and secondary  object ives
.
9.4.2. Phase 2
9.4.2.1. Induction Therapy
LY2228820 or placebo will be administered orally every 12 hours (±3 hours) on Days 1through 
10of a 21-day cycle .  Patients should not consume food beginning 1 hour before and ending 
1hour after taking the study  drug.  LY2228820 or placebo should be taken at the same time o f 
the day  (for exam ple, 0800 hours and 2000 hours ) with a full glass of water.  If a patient misses 
or vomits a dose, that dose should be omitted
.  Patients must record the time and amount of each 
dose taken (or alternatively , the t ime and amount of the dose missed or vomited) in a daily diary.
Gem citabine, 1000 mg/m2, will  be administered IV over approximately  30 (+15) minutes on 
Days 3 and 10 of a 21- day cycle.  The gem citabine infusi on will be started following the 
morning dose of LY2228820.
Carbopl atin, AUC 4 (maximum dose , 600 mg), will be administered IV over approximately 30 
(+15) minutes on Day  3 of a 21 -day cycle.  The carboplatin infusio n will fo llow the gem citabine 
infusio n.  
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY22288209.4.2.2. Maintenance Therapy
After complet ion of 6 cy cles of induction therapy , pati ents wi th stable disease or better will 
receive maintenance therapy with LY2228820 or placebo according to the iroriginal  treatm ent 
assignment until the discontinuation criteria are fulfilled (refer to Section 7.3.1 ).  After 
discontinuat ion from study  treatm ent, pati ents will  have a short- term follow-up peri od of  
approximately  30 days followed by a long-term follow-up peri od until death or until the patient 
is lost to follow -up.  Patients who benefit may continue to receive study  treatm ent even after the 
study  has met i ts primary  object ive.
9.4.3. Dose Adjustments
9.4.3.1. Treatment Delays between Cycles
A cycle may be delayed to allow a patient sufficient time for recovery  from toxici ty related to 
study treatm ent.  Before the start of each cycle, hematologic toxicit iesmust resolve according to 
the guidelines in Table JIAE. 9.
3.  Nonh ematol ogic toxi cities must resolve to the patient’s 
baseline CTCAE grade or lower .  If a delay in the start of treatment is necessary, all 3 study 
drugs (LY2228828 or placebo, gemci tabine ,and carbopl atin) should be held. A cycle may  be 
delayed by  7 days to accomm odate a pati ent’s schedul e or f or other unforeseen circumstances.  
Treatment delays between cycles that fulfill these criteria do not constitute a protocol vio lation.   
Patients who requi re a del ay in treatm ent of  more than 21 days for toxi city will be requi red to 
discontinue study  treatm ent and enter the Post -Discontinuat ion Follow
-up Peri od (Attachment 
1).
9.4.3.1.1. LY2228820 Dose Adjustments
Dose adjust ments for LY2228820/placebo should be managed according to Table JIAE.2.

vomiting.
Gem citabine therapy shoul d be permanent ly discont inued for any o f the following:
Unexplained dyspnea deemed rel ated to study  drug, or other evidence of 
severe pulmo nary toxicity
Severe hepat ic toxicit y
Hem olyticUremic Syndrome
Capillary Leak Syndrome
9.4.3.1.3. Carboplati nDose Adjustments
There will be no dose adjust ment for carboplat in inthis study .  For patients with a c alculated 
creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, refer to Secti on9.1.1.1 for addi tional guidance.
9.4.3.1.4. Clinically Significant Effusions
For pati ents who have a clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusio n (on the basis of 
symptoms or clinical examinat ion), considerat ion shoul d be given to draining the effusion prior 
to study  treatm ent.
9.5. Dose Escalation (Phase Ib)
The dose will be escalated fo llowing asse ssment of toxicit y using the standard scoring system, 
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0),established by the 
National Cancer Inst itute (NCI). 
During Phase 1b, dose escalat ion of LY2228820 will occur in cohorts of 3 patients treated at the 
dose l evels outlined in Table JIAE .9.1. The LY2228820 starti ng dose of 200 mg every 12 hours
in Study  JIAEhasbeen explored previously in Study  JIAD and is1dose level lower than the 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY2228820single- agent recommended Phase 2 dose of 300 mg every 12 hours .  All patients in Study  JIAE
will receive gemci tabine and carboplatin during inducti on therapy ,as outlined inSection 9.4.
Dose escalat ion will proceed cohort bycohort until 1 patient at a given dose level experiences a 
DLT, as defined in Sect ion9.5.1 . In the event a DLT occurs in 1 of 3 patients at a given dose 
level, the cohort will be expan ded up to a total of 6 patients .  If no further DLTs are observed at 
that dose level, thedose escalation can resume .  
If a DLT occurs in 2 or more of 6 patients or 
33.3% of patientsat a given dose level, then the combinat ion MTD has been ident ified or 
exceeded and dose escalat ion will cease. However, fo llowing discussio ns between the 
investigators and the sponsor, addit ional pat ients may be treated at intermediate doses to defin e 
the combination MTD more precisely.   During Phase 1b , intrapati ent dose escalation is not 
permitted ,and dose escalat ion to the next cohort cannot occur without prior discussio n and 
agreem ent between the invest igator and the responsible Lilly CRP.
9.5.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated 
Dose Definition
A DLT is defined as an AE likely related toLY2228820 that occurs duri ng Cycle 1 in Phase 1b
and fulfills any one of the following criteria:
Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicit y exc ept for nausea/vo miting, diarrhea, or electrolyte 
disturbances
Grade 3 or 4 nausea/vo miting or diarrhea that persists 2 days despite the use of adequate 
or maximal medical intervent ion
Grade 3 or 4 electroly te disturbances that persist 5 day s despite ma ximal supportive 
treatm ent
Grade 4 hematologic toxicit y that persi sts m ore than 5 days
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocy topeni a with bleeding
Febrile neutropenia
All toxicit ies should be graded accor ding to CTCAE Version 4.0.
Invest igators, in consultat ion with the L illy CRP, can declare a DLT if a pat ient has increasing 
toxicity and therapy cannot be continued without exposing the patient to excessive risk.
The MTD i s defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 33% of patients experience 
a DLT during Cycle 1 that does not exceed the single -agent MTD for LY2228820 (300 mg 
Q12H).
9.6. Continued Access to Study Drug
Study  drug m ay be made available after conclusio n of the study  to patients who are still 
receiving and benefitt ing from study treatment in countries where the drug cannot be lawfully 
prescribed. 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY22288209.7. Blinding
The Phase 1b portion of this study  is open -labelwhereas the Phase 2 porti on of  this study  is 
doubl e-blind.
To preserve blinding o f the study , a minimum number of sponsor personnel will see the 
rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before PFS and OS analyses are complete d.
Emergency  unblinding for AEs may be perform ed through an IVRS, whi ch m ay supplement or 
take the place of emergency  codes generated by  a com puter drug -labeling system.  This option 
may be used only if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge o fthe pati ent’s treatm ent
assignment .  All calls result ing in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by  the IVRS.
The invest igator should make every effort to contact the Lilly CRP prior to unblinding a pati ent’s 
treatm ent assi gnment.  If a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified 
immediately  by tel ephone.
Every  effort will be m ade to blind both the patient and the invest igator to the treatment
assignment , but the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur.  A double -blind study  design 
is known to be imper fect because the potential for individual unb linding exists due to treatment -
related si gns and symptom s.  If apatient or invest igator is unblinded, the unblinding will not 
alone be sufficient cause for that patient to be discontinued fro m study  treatm ent or excluded 
from any safety  or efficacy analyses.
Addit ionally , there m ay be ethical reasons to have the patient remain on study  treatm ent.  For 
patients to con tinue on study  treatm ent in the event of unblinding, the invest igator must obtain 
specific appro val from a Lilly  CRP for the pati ent to conti nue in the study .  
Patients and invest igators will remain blinded to study treatment with no sharing of efficacy 
inform ation amo ng sites unt il both PFS and OS analyses are completed .  Treatm ent assignment 
will be blinded in the reporting database except for a minimum number of sponsor personnel 
requi red to perform the interim and final analyses.  Thi s will  ensure unblinded aggregate efficacy 
resul ts are not available outside of the A ssessment Committee until the time of final data 
analysis.   Patients and invest igators may be unblinded after both PFS and OSanalyses are 
completed.
For thi s study ,there are 4planned interim analyses (1for Phase 1b and 3for Phase 2).  During 
Phase 2, blinding of the study  requi res that interim analyses be conducted under the guidance of 
an Assessment Committee . See Section 12.2.11 for further details.
9.8. Concomitant Th erapy
With the exceptions listed in the following sections, no other chemotherapy , experimental  
medicat ions, other anticancer therapy , immunotherapy , horm onal cancer therapy , radi ation, 
surgery  for cancer, or experimental medications will be permitted whil e pat ients are on study  
treatm ent.  The need for any form of radiotherapy (including palliat ive) will be cause for early 
discontinuat ion from study treatm ent.  In addi tion any di sease progressi on requi ring other forms 
of specific ant itumor therapy  will als o necessi tate early  discontinuat ion from study treatment .  
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 46
LY2228820Appropriate documentation of all forms of prem edicat ion’s, supportive care, and concomitant 
medicat ions m ust be captured at each visit in the case report form (CRF).  Conco mitant 
medicat ions and su pportive care therapies must be documented at the time of discont inuat ion and 
also at the 30-day follow-up visit.
Based on the available preclinical data, there i s a possible risk of clinical drug
–drug interaction 
when LY2228820 is administered with inhibitors or inducers of UGT enzyme s. In the absence 
of clinical data to refine the risk of interaction, caution is warranted in the conco mitant use of 
UGT enzyme inhibitors such as valproi c acid and probenecid and inducers such as 
carba mazepine, pheny toin and rifampin .  When, in the clinical invest igator's opinion, 
concomitant use of valproic acid orprobenecid is indicated, LY2228820 -related DLTs of ataxia, 
dizziness and rash shoul d be carefully mo nitored.
It is recommended that patients minimize alcohol use during the study  and, if clinically  feasible, 
avoid medicat ions act ing as depressants of the central nervous system.
9.8.1. Supportive Care
Patients shoul d receive full supportive care if necessary .  Supporti ve care i s defined as a 
treatm ent that l acks ant ineoplastic activit y and is given specifically  with the intent to m aximize 
qualit y of life.  Those therapies considered acceptable include, but are not limited to, transfusio ns 
of red bl ood cells and platel ets as well as medicat ions that arenotexcluded as “
conco mitant 
therapy .”  Patients will receive supportive care as judged by their treating physician.   If it is 
unclear whether a therapy  shoul d be regarded as supporti ve care, the invest igator should consult
the Lilly CRP .  Use of any  supportive care therapy shoul d be reported on the case report forms.
9.8.2. Carboplatin Infusion Reactions
Patients who experience a hypersensit ivity react ion to carboplat in should receive epinephrine, 
corticosteroi d, and antihistamine therapy  according to inst itutional standards .  If the inst itutional 
standards differ fro m this regimen, the Lilly  CRP shoul d be consul ted.
9.8.3. Colony -Stimulating Factors
The protocol permit sthe routine use of granul ocytecolony-stimulating factors and 
erythropoi esis-stimulat ing agents (ESAs) as supportive care agents according to ASCO 
guidelines (Rizzo et al . 2010) .  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing factors should not be used 
prophylact ically unless previ ously  discussed wi th the Lilly  CRP . The protocol does not allow 
the use of products that stimulate throm bopoi esis.
Erythropoi etic therapy may be considered for treatment of chemotherapy -induced anemia for 
patients wi th hem oglobin 10g/dL after the patients has been counseled about the risks and 
benefits of ESA use (Rizzo et al. 2008; Smit h et al . 2006).  Be cause recommendat ions on the use 
of ESAs are rapi dly evolving, investi gators shoul d refer to the Nati onal Com prehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN), American Societ y of Clinical Oncol ogy (ASCO), and/or Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services web sites for the latest gui delines.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 47
LY22288209.9. Treatment Compliance
Patient com pliance with LY2228820 will be assessed at each visit.  Compliance will be assessed 
bypatient di ary entri es, di rect questi oning, and count ing returned tablets.   Patients must take 
75% of  the scheduled doses of LY2228820 in a cycle to be judged compliant wi th oral study  
drug administration.   Similarly, a patientwill be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if judged 
by the investigator to have intent ionally  or repeatedly  taken ≥125% of the scheduled do ses of 
LY2228820 .  Any missed doses will be omitted and not replaced during the treatment period.  In 
the event of a missed dose, patients should resume and cont inue the dosing schedule beginning 
with the next scheduled dose.
Discontinuati on of  a pati ent d ue to oral study  drug nonco mpliance will be discussed between the 
investigator and the Lilly CRP before making the final determinat ion for discont inuat ion.  If a 
patient is discont inued due to noncompliance, the patient may be replaced.
Gemci tabine and car boplatin will be administered only at the invest igational sites by  the 
authori zed study  personnel.  As a result, treatment compliance is ensured.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 48
LY222882010.Efficacy , Health Outcome/Quality  of Life Measures, Safety  
Evaluations, Sample Collection and Testing, and 
Appropriateness of Measurements
Study  procedures and their timing are described in the sections below and shown in the Study  
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
10.1. Efficacy Measures
Each patient will be assessed by  one or m ore of the fo llowing radiologic tests for tum or 
measurement at the time specified in the Study Schedule :
Com puteri zedtomography  (CT) scan
Magnet icresonance imaging (MRI)
Each patient’s extent of disease will also be assessed with the fo llowing procedures:
Tumormeasurement of palpable or visible lesio ns (refer to Modified Response 
Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Guidelines Versi on 1.1, Attachment 8 )
CA125
Evaluat ionof performance status (refer to the ECOG Scale, Attachm ent 5 )
10.1.1. Efficacy Assessments at Baseline and during Study
Within 28 days before the first dose of study  drug, baseline tumor measurement(s) will be 
perform ed on each pati ent.  Com puted tom ography, including spiral CT scans ,and MRI are the 
preferred m ethods of measurement.
The m ethod of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly for tum or assessment and 
will be repeated every  other cy cle.
10.1.2. Efficacy Assessments during the Post -discontinuation Period
For those patients who discont inue study  treatm ent wi thout progressive disease, the invest igative 
sites will cont inue to monitor patients and periodically evaluate tumor response according to the 
institutional standard of care frequency  by the same m ethod used at baseline and throughout the 
study  until  the discont inuat ion criteria are fulfilled .  After the pati ent has confirmed progressive 
disease, radi ologic tests are no l onger requi red and the patient will be fo llowed every  84days 
(14 day s) unt il death or until the patient is lost to fo llow up .
After patients have discont inued study  treatment, they may  receive addi tional anticancer therapy  
at the discretion of the invest igator.  The addit ional treatments should be documented on the 
CRF.
10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measur e
In the Phase 2 porti on of  the study , the primary efficacy measure is PFS .  This m easure is 
calculated from the date of rando mizat ion to the da te of objective progression or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first.  Section 12.1 describes the method used for censoring PFS.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY222882010.1.4. Secondary Efficacy Measures
The fo llowing secondary  efficacy measures will be collected at the times shown in the Study  
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
10.1.4.1. Overall Response Rate
Overall response rate is the percentage of patients who achieved a best res ponse of either 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by RECIST 1.1.
Best response is determined from a sequence of responses assessed. For CR or PR, best
response must be confirmed wit h a second assessment that is performed ≥28 days after the first 
evidence of response .  Two obj ective status determinat ions of CR before progressi on are 
requi red for a best response of CR. Two determinations o f PR or better before pr ogressi on, but 
not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of PR.   Best response of stable disease 
(SD)is defined as disease that does not mee t the cri teria f or CR, PR, or progressive disease and 
has been evaluated at least 1 time, at least 6 weeks after the start of study  treatm ent. All lesio ns 
must be assessed by the same method as at baseline to qualify for response confirmat ion.The 
date of first documented object ive disease progressio n will be recorded on the CRF.
10.1.4.2. Change in Tumor Size
Change in tumor size will be assessed in each patient using radiographic imaging.  This endpo int 
will be based on tumor measurements collected by the centers according to RECIST 
(version1.1).  Tumor size is the sum o f the tum or measurements for target tum ors at each tum or 
evaluat ion.  Change in tumor size is defined as the ratio of tumor size fro m the evaluat ion at the 
end of Cycle 2 to the baseline evaluat ion.
10.1.4.3. Overall Survival
Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomizat ion to the date ofdeath due to any  
cause.  For pati ents who are not known to have died as of the data inclusion cut -off date, OS will 
be censored at the date that the patient was last known to be alive.
10.2. Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures
The m ultiple burdens of canc er and the effects of ant icancer treatment can have a profound 
impact on patients’ healt h-related quali ty of life (HRQoL).  A diminished HRQoL can have 
detrimental  effects on the efficacy  of cancer treatment and may affect treatment outcomes.  The 
FACT -O will be used in this study  to assess and compare changes in HRQoL between the 
2treatm ent arms.  Health outcome measures will only be collected during the Phase 2part of this 
study .
10.2.1. Patient -Reported Outcomes
The FACT -Oinstrument (refer to Attachment 10 )is a reliable and valid instrument to measure 
HRQo L in pat ients with ovari an cancer (Basen -Engqui st 2001 ).  The instrument consists of 
38items wi th5-point rating scales in which 0 equals “not at all” and 4 equals “very much.”  The 
questionnaire is organized into 5 sections with physical , soci al/family , emotional, functional
well-being and ovarian subscales.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 50
LY2228820Thevalidated FACT -O instrument will be used in the Phase 2 porti on of  the study  to hel p better 
understand the properties of the instrument in thisspecific pat ient population and to generate 
hypotheses for subsequent studies. Patient -reported outcom edata will be analyzed fo r 
statist ically significant, clinically important, and favorable differences in assessments associated 
with abdominal pain and gastrointest inalsymptoms as measured by the FACT -Oitems O3 
(cram ps in stom ach), GP2 (nausea), O2 (vomit ing), and C6 (good appet ite), as well as by 
assessments associated with treatment -related AEs/intolerance as measured by  the FACT i tem 
GP5 (bothered by  side effects of treatm ent).  The FACT -O scores will be calculated using
scoring criteria proposed by  the devel oper (Cella 2004).   Results of the FACT -O can be reported 
as the scores for 5 individual subscales, a FACT -General total score (sum of physical, 
social/family , emotional, and f unctional well -being subscales), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) 
(sum  of physical well -being, funct ional well -being, and ovarian subscale), and a FACT -O total 
score (sum of the FACT -General total score and the ovarian subscale) .  For all reports, a higher 
score represents a better qualit y of life.
Both ,time to worsening (TTW) and changes fro m baseline in dimensio ns of HRQoL using 
FACT -O will be co mpared between treatment arms.  Minimally important difference (MID) for 
change in scores will be used to determine meaningful differences in pat ients’ FACT -O scores 
(Yost and Eton 2005).
The TOI i s considered to be a valuable summary measure of physical well -being, funct ional 
well-being, and disease -specific symptom s (Yost and Eton 2005) .  In pati ents wi th ovari an 
cancer, the patients’ well -being (including functional/physical abilit ies and disease -specific 
sympto ms) will generally continue to worsen as disease progresses.  T he TTW is defined as a 
decrease in the TOI score that is considered at least a MID, as compared with the pati ent’s 
baseline score.  The upper range of MID points (Yost and Eton 2005) will be used as a guide to 
determine the meaningful decrease for individual patient’s score.  The TTW is measured fro m 
the date of rando mizat ion to the first date of a worsening in the TOI (as defined by a decrease 
from baseline in TOI that is at least t he MID) or of death from any cause.  For patients who 
receive any subsequent sy stemic ant icancer therapy prior to an observation o f worsening, TTW 
will be censored at the date of the last worsening -free assessment prior to the subsequent 
systemic anticance r therapy .  For pati ents not known to have died or with an observat ion of 
worsening as o f the data cut-off date, TTW will be censored at the date of the last worsening -free 
assessment.  Time to worsening in other dimensio ns of FACT -O will be m easured in a similar 
fashio n. The l ooser range of MID (Yost and Eton 2005) will be used for interpreting the group 
mean change ,and the upper limit will be used for interpreting the change in an individual 
patient’s score.
The FACT -O is to be completed at baseline ,onDay 3of Cycles 1 through 6 (induct ion therapy ), 
and at the 30
-day post -study follow-up visi t as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).
The F ACT -O shoul d be co mpleted at the beginning of office visits, before extensive contact and 
consultation wit h the clinician/study  invest igator.  Consultat ion with the clinician may  bias 
percepti ons about HRQoL and symptoms and thus affect assessments.  Patie nts will complete the 
questionnaire prior to administration of s ubsequent cy cles o f study  drug.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 51
LY2228820The FACT -O will be completed by  the pat ient.  Only  patients wi th adequate li teracy  and f or 
whom there is a validated translat ion in the language in which the pa tient is fluent will be asked 
to com plete any  self-administered quest ionnaires.
10.2.2. Resource Utilization
Invest igators will be asked to document the use of best supportive care measures, conco mitant 
medicat ions, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalizat ion days.  Such assessments are to be 
taken throughout the study  through the 30-day post -discont inuat ion visit and will largely be 
derived fro m clinical data routinely co llected through the CRFs.  Medical resource utilization 
data will be analyzed for expl oratory  purposes.
10.3. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt
h care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before complet ing the study .  The 
patient shoul d be f ollowed unt il the event is reso lved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up 
evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the investigator.
The timing of all safet y evaluat ionsis shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).  
Table JIAE. 10.1 describes AE and SAE collect ion with regard to the ty pe of  events t o be 
collected in each study  period.

Subsequent post -discontinuation 
follow -up visits, if necessary SAEs are required to be reported only if the investigator feels the 
events were related to either study drug or a protocol procedure
Abbreviations:  AEs = adverse events; SAEs = serious adverse events.
10.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical event 
associ ated wi th the use of a drug or drug delivery system in humans, whether or not it is 
considered related to that drug or drug delivery system.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY2228820Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs, laboratory  assessment s, vital sign measurement s, 
other procedures, and so on that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal exposures to study  drug or drug delivery  system  
shoul d be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast- feedi ng are collected for regulatory  
reporting and drug safet y evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s pre -exist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment i n 
the study .
After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, site personnel will record any change in the 
condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  All AEs related to protocol procedures 
are reported to Lilly or designee.
In addit ion, all AE s occurring after the patient receives the first dose of study drug must be 
reported to Lilly  or its designee via CRF/electronic data entry .
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness o f each AE to protocol procedure , study drug, and/or drug delivery  system  via 
CRF/electronic data entry .
The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as related to disease, 
to the study  medicat ion, study  procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.  To 
assess the relat ionship of the AE to the study  drug or procedure , the fo llowing termino logies are 
defined:
Probably related :  a di rect caus e and effect relat ionship between the study  treatm ent and 
the AE i s likely
Possibly related :  a cause -and-effect relationship between the study  treatm ent and the 
AE has not been demo nstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not impossible
Does not know:   the investigator cannot determine
Not related :  without questi on, the AE is definitely  not associ ated wi th the study  
treatm ent
The invest igator should classify a ll “probably related,” “possibly related,” or “does not know” 
AEs and SAEs as relat ed to study  drug /study  procedure .
Patients will  be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any  AEs between visit s.
The National Cancer Inst itute (NCI) -CTCAE v ersion 4.0 will serve as the reference document 
for choosing appropri ate termino logy for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other 
symptoms.  For AEs without matching termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE v ersion4.0 cri teria, 
the invest igator will be responsible for select ing the appropriate system org an class and assessing 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 53
LY2228820severit y grade based on the intensit y of the event.  Note that both CTCAE term (actual or coded) 
and severit y grade m ust be selected by  study  site personnel and collected on the CRF.  This 
collect ion is in addit ion to verbatim text u sed to describe the AE.
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im, the CTCAE term, and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE 
verbat im text will also be mapped by the sponsor or designee to corresponding termino logy 
within the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) dict ionary.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly  or its desi gnee via CRF/electronic data entry  the 
circumstances and data leading to any  such do sage reduction or discont inuat ion of treatm ent.
10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has 
received study  drug.  If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent but pr ior to 
receiving study  drug, the event will notbe collected unless the invest igator feels the event may 
have been caused by a protocol procedure.
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any seriousadverse event (SAE) within 
24hours of invest igator awareness of the event via a sponsor -approved method.  Alerts issued 
via tel ephone are to be immediately  followed wi th official notification on study -specific SAE 
forms.  Thi s 24- hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all 
follow-up SAE informat ion.  An SAE is any adverse event from this study  that resul ts in one of 
the following outcom es:
death
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason .
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be co nsidered serious adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Previously  planned (pri or to si gning the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
Serious adverse events due to disease progression, including death, should not be reported unless 
the invest igator de ems them to be possibly related to study drug.
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient has taken the last dose of study  drug will be 
collected in the pharmacovigilance system and clinical data collect ion database for 30 days after 
discontinuat ion from study  treatm ent, regardl ess of the investigator’s opinion o f causat ion.  
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 54
LY2228820Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the investigator feels the events were 
related to ei ther study  drug, drug delivery  system , or a protocol  procedure.
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may  be 
found in the IB.  Adverse events reasonably ant icipated in the ovar iancancer popul ationinclude
fatigue, anorexia, constipat ion, anemia, venous thrombosis/embo lism, pain, confusio n, liver 
dysfunct ion, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, major cardiovascular events (such as myocardial 
infarction and stroke), and infect ions.
10.3.1.2. Suspected U nexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are serious events that are not listed in the 
Development Core Safet yInformati on (DCSI) in the IB and that the invest igator ident ifies as 
related to the study  drug or proc edure.  Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the 
recording and expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions that are 
consistent with glo bal regulat ions and associ ated detailed guidances.
10.3.2. Other Safety Measures
10.3.2.1. Collection of Electrocardiograms
For each subject, 12-lead ECGs will be co llected according to the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 )as a single ECG .  Pati ents m ust be supine for approximately  5 to 10 minutes 
before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collection.
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times , 
when deemed clinically necessary .  
Collect ion of more ECGs than expected at a p articular time point is allowed when needed to 
ensure high -qualit y records.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideal ly while the 
subject is st ill present, to determine whether the subject meets entry criteria and for immediate 
subject management, should any  clinically rel evant findings be i dentified.
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corre cted QT (QTc) interval fro m 
baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline, is 
present, the invest igator will assess the subject for symptoms (for example, palpitat ions, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine if the subject can cont inue in the study .  The invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in pat ient management i s needed 
and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation.
The investigator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the 
time of evaluat ion.
10.3.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 55
LY2228820Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany proce dures.  The Lilly CRP
will, as appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeuti c 
area physician or clinical scient ist, and review:
trends in safety  data
laboratory  analy tes 
AEs
In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at 
the group l evel, only  members of the data monitoring board (an advisory  group for thi s study  
formed to protect the integrity  of data; refer to the Interim Ana lysis Sect ion that follows) can 
conduct addit ional analyses of the safet y data.
For the purpose of this study , in which survival is a primary  endpoint, all deaths and SAEreports 
will be reviewed in a blinded manner by  Lilly during the clinical trial.  The se reports will be 
reviewed to ensure com pleteness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the 
clinical trial.  If a death or clinical AEis deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to 
study  drug, only Lilly Glo bal Pat ient Safet y will be unblinded for regulatory  reporting and safet y 
monitoring purposes.  These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this 
trial and minimize any potenti al for bias while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring.
10.3.4. Complaint Han dling
Lilly co llects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical trials 
in order to ensure the safet y of study  parti cipants, mo nitor qualit y, and to facilitate process and 
product improvements.
Com plaint s related to unblinded com parator drugs or concomitant drugs are reported direct ly to 
the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by Lilly  or del egate will be reported.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its designee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for inve stigation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.4. Sample Collection and Testing
Attachm ent 1 lists the schedule for sam ple collect ions in this study.
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that wi ll be performed for this study .
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY2228820Attachm ent 9 provides a summary of the maximum  number and vo lume ofinvasive samples, for
all sampling, during the study .  Alt hough f ewer invasive sampl esmay actually  occur, thi s will 
not require a protocol amendment .
10.4.1. Samples for Standard Efficacy, Safety Laboratory Testing
Blood sam ples will be collected at the times specified in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).  
Standard laboratory  tests, including chemistry and hematology panels will be performed.  A 
pregnancy test will be performed (if applicable).  Other clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed 
by a central  and/or l ocal laboratory .  Attachment 2 lists the specific tests that will be performed 
for this study .
Enrollment and treatment decisio ns may be based upon re sults of tests performed locally .  If 
local lab tests are used for this purpose, then a duplicate specimen must be sent to the central 
laboratory  for use in the safet y analysis.  Discrepancies between local and central laboratory  
resul ts that may  have an i mpact on eligibilit y or treatment decisio ns will not be considered 
protocol  violations.  When both a local and a central laboratory  resul t are ob tained and there is a 
discrepancy  in the l aboratory  values, the local laboratory  values will be use dfor determining 
patient eligibilit y and thi s data will be recorded in the study  case report forms.
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant ;however, it i s acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
10.4.2. Archival Tumor Tissue Sample
A small amount of preserved t issue previously taken to diagnose the pati ent’s disease will be 
obtained for biomarker research related to the p38 MAPK pathway in ovary cancer .The tum or 
suppressor p53 will be evaluated for gene expression, mutation, and pr otein expressio n in 
archived tumors.  Addit ionally ,the tum or suppressor PTEN will be evaluated for mutation and 
protein expressio n in archived tumors.
Pretreatment formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor ti ssue obtained at the time of original 
diagnosis s hould be in a who le block, partial block, or unstained slides.  Stored samples will 
retain the patient ident ifier and therefore, will not be stored indefin itely.  Any blocks or slides 
submitted will eit her be returned to the site or discarded within 15years after l ast pati ent visi t for 
the trial.If archival t issue is not available for a specific patient, it will not constitute a protocol 
violation.
For p53 and PTEN mutation analyses co mpar ing tum or to germline DNA, a single whole -blood 
sample will be col lected one time to iso late DNA from  PBMCs.   Sam ples will  be ident ified by 
the pati ent number (coded) and stored for up to 15 years after the last patient visit for the study  at

LY2228820a facilit y selected by  the sponsor.  The sample and any data generated from it can only  be linked 
back to the patient by  invest igator site personnel.
Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the pat ients stored samples will be supplied 
by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory  will occur according to 
instructi ons given to the study  sites.
10.4.3. Pharmacogenetic Samples
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absor ption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, excret ion, the mechanism o f action of the drug, the disease et iology 
and/or the mo lecular subtype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local regulat ions 
allow, a blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis.  It is a one -time collection, 
as noted in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
Samples will  be stored ,and analysis may be performed on ge netic variants though t to pl ay a rol e 
in metabolism o f LY2228820 and gemcitabine and carboplatin, including but not limited to 
CYP3A, correlat ions amo ng genoty pe, and pharmacokinet ics to eval uate thei r associ ation with 
observed clinical outcomes to LY22288 20.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the samples may be 
genoty ped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic association wit h response to 
LY2228820.  These invest igations m ay be limited to a focused candidat e gene study  or, if 
appropriate, genome wide associat ion studi es may be perform ed to i dentify regions of the 
geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response.  Samples will only be used for 
investigat ions rel ated to di sease and drug or clas s of drugs under study  in the context of this 
clinical program.  They will not be used for broad exploratory  unspecified disease or populat ion 
genet ic analysis .
Samples will  be ident ified by the patient number (coded) and stored for up to 15 years after the 
last patient visit for the study  at a f acilit y selected by the sponsor.  The sample and any data 
generated fro m 
it can only be linked back to the patient by invest igator site personnel.
10.4.4. Samples for Dru g Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacoki netics /Pharmacodynamics
Drug concentration informat ion that mayunblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative 
sites or blinded personnel.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will be retained 
for a maximum of 2yearsfollowing the last patient visit for the study .
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling in Phase 1b will  be intens ive, with samples collected to measure 
LY2228820 at the times and visits indicat ed in the Pharmacokinet ic Sampling Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 and Attachment 3 ). Another intens ivePK sampling s chedule will also be used for 
approximately  20 pati ents ( 10patients /arm)in the Phase 2 portion of  the study .  The remainder 
of the pati ents in the Phase 2 porti on of the study  will have PK samples drawn during regularly 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 58
LY2228820scheduled clinic visit s.  On these days, the dose of LY (or place bo) shoul d be held until after the 
pre-dose PK sample has been taken .  The actual date/time of dosing on the day  of sampling and 
the actual  date/time of collect ion for each of the samples must be recorded. In the Phase 2 
porti on of  the study , dose inform ation (date, tim e,and dosing amount for LY2228820/ placebo, 
gemcitabine ,and carbopl atin) must be collected for the last and next -to-last dose taken prior to 
the sam pling.
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 ) and PK/PD Sampling 
Schedule ( Attachment 3 ),venous blood samples will be collected .  Blood samples will  be used to 
determine the plasma concentrations of LY2228820, gemcitabine and its metabolite (dFdU ), and 
carbopl atin.  Forcarboplat in,both total and free platinum  drug concentrati ons will be measured.  
The actual  date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded.
For m easurement of LY2228820 and carboplat in, approximately 4 m Lof whol e blood will be 
collected in a sodium heparin tubes.  For measur ement of gemcitabine and its deaminated 
metabo lite deoxydifluorouridine (dFdU), approximately 4 m Lof who le blood will be collected 
in a sodi um heparin tube containing tetr ahydrouridine (THU).  Sites will be supplied by the 
central  laboratory  with THU and instructi ons for the addit ion of THU to collect ion tubes.
A maximum of 5 samples may be drawn at addit ional time po ints during the study  if warranted 
and agreed upon between both the invest igator and sponsor.  Instructions for the collect ion and 
handling o f blood samples will be provided by the sponsor.
Pharmacodynamic samples will be collected as specified in the PK and PD Sam pling Schedule 
(Attachm ent 3 ).  Circulating plasma proteins regulated by  p38 MAPK (such as such as TNF, 
IL-1, IL -6, and IL -8)will be measured.  Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the 
patients stored sam ples will  be supplied by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the 
central  laboratory  will occur per i nstructi ons given to the study  sites.  Pharmacodyn amic samples 
collected to measure circulat ing plasma proteins will be retained for a maximum o f 15 years after 
the last pati ent vi sit for the study .
10.5. Appropriateness of Measurements
Progression -free survival, change in tumor size, overall response rate, OS,and patient -reported 
outcom es areacceptable endpo ints thatare clinically relevant for pati ents wi th platinum -
sensit ive ovarian cancer.  The FACT -O is a reliable and valid instrum ent used to assess qualit y 
of life in pat ients with cancer (Basen -Engquist 2001).

LY222882012.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of the Phase 1 b porti on of thisstudy  is to determine the recommended 
Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 that can be safely administered in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
and carbopl atin.  The sam ple size for this part of the study  is custom ary and not subje ct to 
statist ical calculat ions.
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 porti on of  thisstudy  is to com pare the progression- free 
survival in pat ients treated with LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus placebo 
plus gemcitabine and carboplat in.  A group sequential design will be used to control ty pe 1 error 
across the interim analyses and the final PFS analysis in Phase 2 (see Secti on 12.2.11 for details) .  
The primary  analysis will be performed a fter 79PFS events have occurred .  Assuming a hazard 
ratio (HR) of 0.7, this sample size yield at least 77% power wi thafalse-positive rate of 0.2 
(1-sided) using a log-rank test .  This assumes exponent ially distributed PFS times, m edian PFS 
of 8.6months for the controlarm, enrollment duratio n of 12months, and fo llow
-up time of 18 
months after the last pati entisenrolled .  Assuming 28% censoring rate of the PFS, a total of 
110patients will be rando mized (55 patients in each arm) to achieve 79 PFS events at the 
primary  analysis.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y of Eli Lilly and Com pany  or its 
designated TPO.
No formal stati stical analysis will be performed on thePhase 1b porti on
of the study  in which the
primary  object ive is to assess safet y and tol erabilit yof LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and 
carbopl atin.  Efficacy  analyses forthe Phase 2 portionof the study  will be conducted on the full 
analysis set.  This set includes all data from all patients receiving at least 1dose of 
LY2228820/placebo .  All pat ients who receive at least 1dose of the LY2228820/placebo will be 
subject to safet y evaluation.
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 1 -sided al pha level of 0.2 unless otherwise 
stated.  All CIs will be given at a 2 -sided 90% level unless otherwise stated .
Starti ng fro m protocol  (c), an addi tional factor is included during pat ient enrollment as 
rando mizat ion factor (see Section 8.1.2) .  For pati ents who randomized to phase 2 before the 
approval  of protocol (c) ,the value of m aintenance therapy  as a part of or after a first line 
platinum regimen for these patients wil l be imputed as “not collected”.
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a prin cipal feature of the protocol.
Before unblinding of the aggregate database, mino r modificat ions or clarifi cations to the data 
analysis methods may  be described and just ified in the statist ical analysis plan .  Any other 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 61
LY2228820change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making 
the change, will be described in the clinical study report.
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.
This study  will be considered com plete f ollowing final validation and authorization to “lock” the 
database after the protocol -specified prim ary objective ha sbeen met.  The Lilly CRP will notify  
investigators in the event of study  closure.
12.2.1. Patient Disposition
A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded.  It will  include a summary  of the 
number and percentage of patients ente red into the study , enrolled in the study , and treated as 
well as number and percentage of patients completing the study , or discont inuing (overall and by 
reason for discont inuat ion).  A summary  of all important protocol vio lations will be provided.
12.2.2. Patien t Characteristics
Patient dem ographics including age, gender, screening height and weight will be summarized 
using descript ive statist ics.  Otherbaseline disease characterist ics that need to be summarized 
include:
Time fro m completion of first-line pl atinum-based therapy  to rel apse
Pathol ogic diagnosis
Disease stage at the time of init ial diagnosis
Pre-exist ing condit ions
Prior cancer therapi es
Concomitant drugs
ECOG p erform ance status
12.2.3. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medicat ions will be listed and summariz ed for the safet y popul ation. 
12.2.4. Treatment Compliance
The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, del ays, cy cles received, and dose intensit y will be 
summarized for all treated patients bytreatm ent arm.
12.2.5. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  object ive of the Phase 1 b porti on of thisstudy  is to determine the recommended 
Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 that can be safely administered in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
and carbopl atin.
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 porti on of  thisstudy  is to com pare the prog ression -free 
survival in pat ients treated with LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus placebo 
plus gemcitabine and carboplat in.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 62
LY2228820The PFS time is measured fro m the date of rando mizat ion to the date of objective progression or 
the date of death du e to any  cause, whichever i s earlier.  The censoring is taken in the fo llowing 
order:
If a patient does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time will 
be censored at the enro llment date, regardless of whether or not object ively determined 
disease progressi on or death has been observed for the patient; otherwise,
If a patient i s not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data 
inclusio n cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time will be censored at the last comp lete 
objective progression -free disease assessment date
For the primary  endpoint of PFS, the HR will be estimated fro m survival data on all rando mized 
patients using a Cox proportional hazards model withassigned study  treatm ent arm as fixed 
effect along with cofactors for time from completion of first line platinum -based therapy  to 
relapse (6 to 12 m onths v ersus over 12 m onths ),ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2)
and m aintenance therapy  as a part of or after a first line plat inum regimen ( yes versusnoversus 
not collected ). 
The Kaplan -Meier m ethod (Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be used to estimate the survival curve 
as well as survival rates at various time po ints for each treatment group.   The log-rank test will 
be used to compar ePFS distribut ions between treatment groups in phase 2.
12.2.6. Efficacy Analyses
The primary  object ive of the Phase 1 b porti on of thisstudy  is to determine the recommended 
Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 that can be safely administered in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
and carbopl atin.  Thus, no formal efficacy analysis is planned f or thi s part of the trial .  
Any 
antitumor activit y observed will be reported.
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 porti on of  thisstudy  is to com pare the progression- free 
survival in pat ients treated with L Y2228820 plus gem citabine and carboplatin versus placebo 
plus gemcitabine and carboplat in.  To support the primary  efficacy  analysis, addi tional efficacy  
analysis will be performed on change in tumor size, CA125 (serum bio marker for ovari an 
cancer ), overal l response rate, and OS .
CA125 data will be log -transform ed first and analyzed using a mixed -effect m odel repeated 
measures analysis with treatm ent, time, and treatm ent by time interacti on as fixed effect, along 
with cofactors for time from completion of f irst line platinum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 to 
12months versus over 12 months), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2)and 
maintenance therapy  as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen ( yes versus noversus not 
collected).
The l og rati o of tumor size at the end of Cycle 2 to tum or size at baseline will be calculated for 
each patient .  This measure follows a normal distribut ion and will be co mpared between 
treatm ent groups using a t -test. Analysis o f variance will  be used to assess the effect of baseline 
factors on the change in tumor size .
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 63
LY2228820The overall response rate is estimated as the total number of CRs and PRs, based on RECIST 
versio n 1.1, divided by  the total  number of rando mized patients.  The efficacy endpoint of 
overal l response rate and i ts exact 90% confidence interval will be est imated for each treatment 
arm.  The proporti on in each treatment arm will be compared using the Chi-square test.
The efficacy analys is on OS will be conducted after all the patient shave been followedfor at 
least 2 y ears.  The HR will be est imated fro m survival data on all rando mized pat ients using a 
Cox proportional hazards model using assigned study  treatm ent arm as fixed effect withtime 
from completion of first line platinum -based therapy to rel apse (6 to 12 m onths v ersus over 
12months),ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2)and m aintenance therapy  as a part of or 
after a first line pl atinum regimen ( yes versus noversus not collected ).
Addit ional exploratory  analyses m ay be performe d as deem ed appropri ate.
12.2.7. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
12.2.7.1. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Pharmacokinet ic analyses will be conducted on data fro m patients who have received at least 
1dose of the study  drug and have had sufficient post -dose samples collected to allow es timation 
of the PK parameters.
The PK parameters for LY2228820 will be computed by stand ard nonco mpart mental methods.  
The C max, AUC, half -life, apparent volume of distribution (V d/F), apparent clearance (CL/F), 
and other relevant para meters (such as intercy cle accum ulation) that can be calculated fro m the 
data will be reported.  Parameters will be calcul ated fo llowing administration o n Day  1and on 
Day 10 of Cycle 1 a s well as on Day  10of Cycle 2 for the Phase 1bporti on; on Day  3andon 
Day 10of Cycle 1 for the induct ion part of the Phase 2 portion,and on Day 3of Cycle 7 for the 
maintenance part of the Phase 2 portion.
The version o f any so ftware used for the analysis will be documented and the program will meet 
the Lilly  requireme nts of software validation.  It is possible that other validated equivalent PK 
software programs may be used if appropriate, warranted, and approved by Glo bal 
Pharmacokinet ic management.
Provi ding that data allow in the Phase 1b porti on, the pharmacokinet ic param eter estimates 
(Cmaxand AUC) for LY2228820 will be evaluated statist ically to delineate the effects of dose 
proporti onali ty using the m ethods described previously (Smit h et al . 2000).  Least -square 
estimates of geo metric m eans and their correspondi ng 90% confidence intervals will be provided 
by dose and with the dose -norm alized rat io of geometric means and confidence interval.
The primary  PK param eters f or gemcitabine, its metabolite (dFdU), and carboplatin that will be 
used to detect potential drug–drug interaction are the maximum plasma concentration (C max), 
area under the plasma concentration- time curve from zero to the last measurable t ime [AUC (0
-
tlast)], area under the plasma concentration -time curve fro m 0to 24 hours [AUC (0-24hr) ], and area 
under the plasma concentration -time curve fro m time 0to infinit y [AUC(0 -)].  The AUC 
values will be calculated by  the linear/log trapezoidal method, in which the linear trapezoi dal 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 64
LY2228820method will be emplo yed up to the t max, and the l og trapezoi dal rule will be used for 
concentrations beyo nd t max.  Descript ive statist ics willbe reported for other secondary  PK
param eters (for example, tmax, CL/F , Vd/F, andterminal eliminat ion half-life).
The 90% confidence interval for the AUC and C maxratios wil l be co mputed to assess the 
potenti al effect of  LY2228820 on gemcitabine and carboplatin .  The rati os will be calculated for 
the Phase 2porti on for gem citabine, its metabo lite (dFdU ),and carboplat in on Day 
3of Cycle 1 
in the LY2228820 arm versus the pla cebo arm s.
The 90% confidence interval for the AUC and C maxratios will be co mputed to assess the 
potenti al effect of  gemci tabine and carbopl atin on LY2228820. The ratios will be calculated for 
the Phase 2porti on for LY2228820 on Day 3 of Cycle 1 versus Day 3 of 
Cycle 7 .
In addit ion to a standard noncompartmental assessment, the plasma LY2228820 data will also be 
analyzed using nonlinear mixed effect modeli ng (as implemented in NONMEM).
All available plasma data from all pat ients may be analy zed to determ ine the co mpartmental 
pharmacokinet ics param eters and between and within patient variabilit y.  The drug–drug
interact ion may also be assess edusing thi s approach using t he ty pical  covariates approach.
12.2.7.2. Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Pharmacodynamic data from  all patients undergoing PD assessments will be analyzed.  
Pharmacodynamic data will be documented in the study  report by  dose.  Abso luteand
percentage change from baseline for PD markers may be summarized by providing the mean, 
standard deviat ion, m edian, minimum, and maximum for each cohort.  Data may be log-
transformed prior to summarizing if necessary.  The interpatient variabilit y in human PD 
response mayalso be assessed where appropriate.
12.2.8. Health Outcome/Quality of Life Analyses :  FACT -
O
Findings of the FACT -O and co mpliance with complet ing the questionnaire will be summarized 
for all treated pati ents for the given time po ints: baseline, each treatment cycle, and 
discontinuat ion visit.  Frequency distributions, including measures o f central  tendency  and 
variabilit y, will be calculated for individual items and for the total scale. The time -to-worsening 
variables, including TTW in TOI, will be analyzed using the same methods utilized for other 
time- to-event variables.  All rando mized pat ients with a baseline assessment will be included in 
the TTW analysis.  Clinically important difference thresho lds will be used to define the 
proporti on of  patients that improve, remain stable, or worsen .  The FACT -O scores will be 
summed at baseline and for each visit in order to calculate changes fro m baseline mean scores .  
These data will be co mpared between the 2 treatment arms .  The scores will include the FACT -O 
total and subscale scores and TOI -O. Allrandomized pati ents wi th baseline and at least 1 post-
baseline measure will be included in the change from baseline analysis.  Other exploratory  
analyses may be performed, including longitudinal modeling (for example, repeated measures 
models and the impa ct of covari ates) and subgroup analysis (for example, age ≤70 versus >70
years , and subgroups based on ECOG performance status, tumor response status, PFS, and OS) .  
Individual responses, using an a priori responder definit ion (that is, the individual pati ent PRO 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 65
LY2228820score change over a predetermined time period that should be interpreted as a treatment benefit) 
will be displayed using the cumulative distribut ion funct ion of responses between treatment 
groups.
Exploratory  analysis may  be performedto assess pot ential relat ionships between patient reported 
symptoms and endpo ints of interest such as OS and PFS.  Compliance withcompletingthe 
FACT -O will be summarized.
12.2.9. Safety Analyses
Overall exposure to study  drug, the numbers of patients complet ing each cycle, a nd the dose 
intensity will be summarized using descriptive statist ics.  The number of patients with any dose 
adjustm ent will  be presented for enti re treatm ent peri od as well  as for each cy cle.  The number of 
patients wi th dose reducti ons, dose del ays, or d ose omissio ns will also be summarized, as will 
the reasons for dose adjust ments.
An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for AEs deemed by the invest igator to be possibly 
related to study  medicat ion, and repeated for events regardless of study  drug caus ality.  Incidence 
rates of these events will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher’s exact test.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an event that first occurred or 
worsen ed in severit y after baseline.
The number of pat ients who experienced a TEAE, SAE, or AE related to study drug, as well as 
those who died or discont inued from the study due to an AE will be summarized by treatment.
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events version4.0 will be used to report AEs by 
CTCAE t erms.
Laboratory  and nonlaboratory  CTCAEs will be summarized by CTCAE term and maximum 
CTCAE grade, including the total for maximum Grade 3 and 4.  These summaries will be 
provi ded for events regardless of study  drug causalit y, and repeated for events deem ed by the 
investigator to be possibly related to study  medicatio n.
Reasons for death will be summarized separately for on -therapy  and wi thin 30 days of last dose 
of study  drug/last visi t.  All SAEs will be summarized by  preferred term .
Hospitalizations and transfusio ns during the study  treatm ent peri od or during the 30- day post-
discontinuat ion follow-up peri od will be summarized by  treatm ent group.
12.2.10. Subgroup Analyses
There are no planned subgroup analyses.  However, exploratory  analyses may  be perform ed to 
generate hypotheses about the efficacy  of study  therapy  in certain subgroups for evaluat ion in 
future clinical studi es.

The invest igator is responsible for ensuring that the patient understands the potential risks and 
benefits of part icipating in the study, including answering any questions the patientmay have 
throughout the study  and sharing in a timely manner any  new inf ormation that m ay be rel evant to 
the patient’s willingness to continue his or her participat ion in the trial.
The IC Fwill be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study  parti cipat ion to the 
patientin simple terms before the patientis entered into the study , and to docum ent that the 
patientis sat isfied with his or her understanding o f the risks and benefits of participat ing in the 
study  and desires to parti cipate in the study .
The invest igator is responsible for ensuring that infor med consent is given by each patient or 
legal representative.  This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the IC F
prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study  drug.
As used in this protoc ol, the term  “informed consent” includes all consent and assent given by 
patients or thei r legal representatives.
13.2. Ethical Review
Lilly must agree with all IC Fs before they  are submitted to the ERB and are used at invest igative 
sites(s).  All ICFs must be c ompliant wi th the Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion (ICH) 
guideline on GCP .
Docum entati on of  ERB approval  of the protocol and the IC Fmust be provided to Lilly before the 
study  may begin at the investi gative si te(s).
Any member of the ERB who is di rectly affiliated wi th this study  as an invest igator or as site 
personnel must abstain fro m the ERB’s vote on the approval o f the protocol.
The study  site’s ERB(s) shoul d be provided wi th the f ollowing:
The current IB or package labeling and updates during the course of the study
ICF
Relevant curri cula vitae
13.3. Regulatory Considerations
This study  will be conducted in accordance wit h:
Consensus ethics principles derived fro m internat ional ethics guidelines, including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council forInternational Organizat ionsofMedical Sciences
(CIOMS ) Internati onal Ethical  Guidelines 
The Internat ionalConference onHarmoni zationGood Clinical Pract ices Guideline [E6]
Applicable laws and regulations.

All or some of the obligat ions of the sponsor will be assigned to a TPO.
An identificat ion code assigned to each patient will be used in lieu of the patient’s name to 
protect the patient’s identit y when reporting AEs and/or other tri al-related data.
13.3.1. Investigator Information
Licensed p hysicians with a specialt y inonco logywill part icipate as invest igators in this clinical 
trial.
13.3.2. Protocol Signatures
After reading the protocol, each principal invest igator will sign the protocol signature page and 
send a copy  of the signed page to a Lilly representative.
13.3.3. Final Report Signature
The clinical study  report coordinat ing invest igator will sign the final clinical study report for this 
study , indicat ing agreement that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report accurately 
describes the co nduct and results of the study .
The invest igator with the most enrolled pat ientswill serve as the clinical study  report 
coordinat ing investigator.  If this invest igator is unable to fulfill this funct ion, another 
investigator will be chosen by  Lilly to serve as the clinical study  report coordinat ing invest igator.
The sponsor’s respons ible medical o fficer and responsible statistician will approve the final 
clinical study  report for thi s study , confirming that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the report 
accurately describes the conduct and results of the study .

LY2228820Attachment 8. RECIST Criteria 1.1
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the international criteria proposed 
by the New Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Revised RECIST 
Guideline (versi on 1.1; Eisenhauer et al. 2009).  
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline
Tumor lesi ons/lymph nodes will be categorized at baseline as measurable or nonmeasurable.  
Measurable disease is defined by  the presence of at l east 1 m easurable l esion.
Measurable 
Tumor lesi ons:  Measured in at lea st 1 dimensio n (longest di ameter in the plane o f measurement 
is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by  com puted tom ography  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan (slice thickness 5 mm) 
10 mm caliper measurement by  clinical  exam (non-measurable lesio ns if cannot 
be accurately measured with calipers)
20 mm by  chest X -ray.
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node m ust be 15 mm  in short axis when assessed by  CT scan (CT scan thick ness recommended 
to be 5 mm ).
Nonmeasurable 
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly nonmeasurable lesio ns.  Lesio ns considered truly  
non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio ns, 
lymphangitis cut is/pulmo nis,  inflammatory  breast di sease, lymphangit is involvement of skin or 
lung, abdo minal masses/abdo minal organo megaly ident ified by physical exam that is not 
measureable by reproducible imaging techniques.
Special Considerations for Lesion Measurability
Bone l esions:  
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not consi dered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blastic l esions, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by  cross sect ional imaging techniques such as 
CTor MRI, can be considered measurable lesio nsif the so ft tissue com ponent 
meets the definit ion of measurabilit y.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 95
LY2228820Blastic bone l esions are non-measurable .
Cystic lesions:  
Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesio ns (neither m easurable 
nor nonm easurable) 
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesio ns, if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y.  If noncyst ic 
lesions are presented in the same patients, these are preferred for select ion as 
target lesio ns.
Lesio ns wi th Prior Local Treatm ent:
Tumor lesi ons situated at a previ ously i rradiated area, or i n an area subjected 
to other loco -regional therapy, are non -measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesio n.  
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesion
Target Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesio n is present at baseline ,all lesions up to a m aximum  of 5 
lesions total  (and a m aximum  of 2 lesio ns per organ) representative o f all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline .Non-nodal Target 
lesions shoul d be selected on the basis o f their size (l esions with the l ongest di ameter), be 
representative of all invo lved organs, and can be reproduced in repeated measurements.  
Measurable lymph nodes are target lesio ns if they meet the criteria of a sho rt axi s of 15 mm by  
CT scan.  All measurements are to be recorded in the case record form (CRF) in millimeters (or 
decimal fract ions of centimeters [cm]).
Nontarget Lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) are ident ified as nontarget lesio ns(chosen based on their 
representativeness o f involved organs and the ability to be reproduced in repeated measurements) 
and should be recorded at baseline.  Measurement of these l esions are not required but  should be 
followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression ’.  In addit ion, it is 
possible to record mult iple nontarget lesio ns involving the same organ as a single item on the 
CRF (for example, mult iple liver m etastases recorded as one liver lesio n).
Lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm  but <15 mm shoul d be considered nontarget lesio ns.  
Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered nonpathological and are not recorded or 
followed.
Specifications by Methods of Measurement
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation , using a rul er or calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatm ent and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 96
LY2228820The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported lesio n at baseline and during fo llow-up.  Im aging- based evaluat ion is 
shoul d always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesio n(s) being fo llowed 
cannot be imaged but are assessed by clinical exam.  
An adequate vo lume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are 
demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions forany 
given pat ient.  If prior to enrollment it is known a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV 
contrast due to allergy  or renal  insufficiency , the decisi on as to whether a non -contrast CT or 
MRI (wi th or wi thout IV contrast) should be used to eva luate the patientat baseline and fo llow-
up shoul d be guided by  the tum our ty pe under investigat ion and the anatomic locat ion of the 
disease.
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they  are superficial  
and 10 mm diame ter as assessed using calipers (for example, skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesio ns, docum entati on by co lor photography , incl uding a rul er to estimate the size of the 
lesion is recommended.  When lesio ns can be evaluated by  both clinical exam and ima ging, 
imaging evaluat ion should be undertaken since it is more object ive and may be reviewed at the 
end of the study .
Chest X -ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray when progressi on is an important endpoint.  
Lesio ns on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded 
by aerated l ung.
CT and MRI :  CT scan is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesio ns 
selected for response assessment.  Measurabilit y of lesio ns on CT scan is based on the 
assumpt ion that CT slice thickness is 5 mm.  When CT scan have slice thickness >5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.  MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (for example, for body  scans).  If there is con cern about radi ation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.   
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound should not be used to measure lesion size.  Ultrasound examinat ions 
cannot be reproduced in their ent irety for independent review at a later date and, because they  are 
operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken fro m one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by  ultrasound in the course 
of the study , confi rmation by CT or M RI is advised.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumor evaluat ion is 
not advised.  However, such techniques can be useful to confirm co mplete pathol ogical response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence fo llowing com plete 
response or surgical resect ion is an endpo int.
Tumor Markers :  Tum or markers al one cannot be used to assess tumor response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they  must norm alize for a pati ent to be consi dered in 
complete response (CR).  Specific guidelines for both prostate -specific ant igen (PSA) response 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 97
LY2228820(in recurrent prostate cancer) and CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been 
published .  
Cytology, Histology :  These techn iques can be used to different iate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete response (CR) in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual 
lesions in tum or types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).  When effusi ons are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment ( for example, 
with certain taxane co mpounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmat ion of the 
neopl astic ori gin o f any effusio n that appears or worsens during treatment can b e considered if 
the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease (SD) in order to different iate 
between response (or SD) and progressive disease.
Pet Scan (FDG -PET, PET CT) :  PET is not recommended for lesio n assessment. If a new lesio n 
is found by  PET, another assessment must be done by  CT, unless the PET CT i s of diagnostic 
qualit y.  If CT is done to confirm the results of the earlier PET scan, the date of progression must 
be reported as the earlier date of the PET scan. 
Bone Scan :  If lesions measured by bone scan are reported at baseline, it is necessary to repeat 
the bone scan when trying to ident ify a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Com plete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesio ns.  Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.   Tum or marker 
resul ts must have norm alized.
Parti al Respons e (PR):  At l east a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease:  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study  (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest).  In 
addition to the rel ative increase o f 20%, the sum  must also demonstrate an abso lute increase of at 
least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression .
For eq uivocal findings of p
rogressi on (for example, very  small  and uncertain new l esions; cyst ic 
changes or necrosis in exist ing lesions), treatment may co ntinue unt il the next scheduled 
assessment. If at the next sc heduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progressio n was suspected.
Stabl e Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for progressive disease , taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Not Eva luable:  When an incomplete radiologic assessment of target lesio ns is performed or 
there is a change in the method of measurement from baseline. 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 98
LY2228820Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
Com plete Response:  Disappearance of all non target l esions and norm alizat ion of tum or marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathol ogicalor norm alin size (<10mm short axis ).
Non-CR/ non -progressive disease :  Persi stence of 1 or more nontarget lesio ns and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level ab ove the normal limits.
Progressive Disease:  Unequivocal progression of exist ing nontarget lesio ns.  The appearance o f 
1 or more new l esions i s also consi dered progression .
Not Evaluable : When a change in method of measurement from baseline occurs.
Evaluat ion of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded fro m the start of the study  treatment until 
the earliest of object ive progression or start of new anticancer therapy, taking into accoun t any  
requi rement for confirmat ion.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the 
findings of both target and nontarget disease and will also take into considerat ion the appearance 
of new lesio ns.  The Best Overall Re sponse will be cal culated via an algorithm using the 
assessment responses provided by  the invest igator over the course of the trial.   
Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified t ime point, a response assessment occurs.  ( When no 
imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at 
that time po int.)Table 1 provides a summary o f the overall response status calculat ion at each 
time point for patients who have measurable disease at baseli ne.

anon-CR/non -progr essive disease is preferred over SD for nontarget disease. 
Frequency of Tumor Re -Evaluation
A baseline tumor -evaluat ion must be performed within 4 weeks before patient begins study  
treatm ent. Frequency  of tumor re -evaluat ion while on and adapted to treatment should be 
protocol -specific and adapted to the ty pe and schedul e of treatm ent.  In the co ntext of Phase 2 
studi es where the beneficial effect therapy  is not known, fo llow-up every  6-8 weeks is 
reasonable.  Normally , all target and non -target si tes are evaluated at each assessment using the 
same m ethod.  However, bone scans may need to be repea ted only when CR is ident ified in 
target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.  
Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response
Confirmation :
The m ain goal  of confirmat ion of object ive response in clinical trials is to avoid overest imating 
the response rate observed. The confirmat ion of response is particularly  important in 
nonrandomized trials where response (CR/PR) is the primary  end point.  In this setting, to be 
assigned a status of PR/CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by re peat 
assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first 
met.  To confirm a response of CR, a full assessment of all target and nontarget lesio ns that were 
present at baseline must occur, including those meas ured by  bone scan.  To confirm a PR or SD, 
a full assessment of target lesio ns that were present at baseline must occur;  assessment of 
nontargets is not required.  
However, in randomized trial (Phase 2 or 3) or studies where SD or progression is the prim ary 
endpo ints, confirmat ion of response is not required.  But, eliminat ion of the requirement may  
increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular of studies which 
are not blinded.
In the case of SD, fo llow-up m easurements m ust have met the SD criteria at least once after start 
of treatm ent at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks measured from first dose.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 100
LY2228820Duration of Overall Response
The durati on of  overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are fir st met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that disease is recurrent or objective 
progression is observed (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest m easurements 
recorded on study ).
The durati on of  overall CR is measured fro m the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is object ively documented.
Duration of Stable Disease
Stabl e disease is m easured from  the start of the treatment (in rando mized trials, from date o f 
rando mizat ion) unt il the criteria for objective progressio n are m et, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, that is the reference for calculat ion of 
progressive disease ).  
Independent Review of Response and P rogression
When object ive response (CR + PR) is the primary end point, and when key drug development 
decisio ns are based on the observat ion of a minimum number of responders, it is recommended 
that all claimed responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independ ent of the study .  If the study  is a 
rando mized trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded to treatment assignment.

LY2228820Attachment 11. Protocol JIA E Amendment (c) Summary
Overview
Protocol  I1D-MC-JIAE, A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Phase 1b/2 Study  of 
LY2228820, a p38 MAPK Inhibitor, plus Gemcitabine and Carboplat in versus Gemcitabine and 
Carbopl atin for Women with Plat inum -Sensi tive Ovarian Cancer, has been amended.  The new 
protocol  is indicated by  amendment (c) and will be used to conduct the study  in place of any  
preceding versio n of the protocol.
The rati onale for the amendment was as follows: 
Metabo lic clearance analysis has recent ly been completed which revealed that CYP3A mediated 
metabo lism is not the primary clearance pathway of LY2228820.  This allows for the restrict ion 
of the CYP3A inhibitors, inducers, or substrates to be removed and fo r the use of dexamethasone 
and other anti -emet ics during treatment with LY2228820. 
Based on the available preclinical data, there is a possible risk of clinical drug –drug interaction 
when LY2228820 is administered with inhibitors or inducers of UGT enzyme s.  In the absence 
of clinical data to refine the risk of interaction, caution is warranted in the conco mitant use of 
UGT enzyme inhibitors such as valproic acid and probenecid and inducers such as 
carbamazepine, phenyto in and rifampin.  When, in the clini cal invest igator's opinion, 
concomitant use of valproic acid or probenecid is indicated, LY2228820 -related DLTs of ataxia, 
dizziness and rash should be carefully mo nitored.
The ovari an cancer landscape has changed during the course of this study .  Maintena nce therapy  
as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen has beco me more prevalent.  Several studies are 
examining the effect of maintenance after patients achieve a CR with the first line platinum 
regimen.  In order to balance these patients betwee n the pl acebo and LY2228820 arms, prior 
maintenance therapy  has been added as a rando mization factor. 
The ori ginal  sample size calculat ion for the Phase 2 portion of the study  included a censoring 
rate assumpt ion of 6% wi th 103 PFS events needed fro m 110 patients.  Upon reflect ion, Lilly 
considers that this assumed censoring rate is too low.  If just 8 or more patients are lost to follow 
up, the actual censoring rate would be higher.  With this protocol amendment, the censoring rate 
estimate has been incre ased to 28% resul ting in a reduction in the number of PFS events needed 
to 79.  The hazard ratio of 0.7 has been maintained but the power has been reduced to 77% from 
83%.  These assumpt ions are consistent with enrollment and censoring experience in this p hase 
of devel opment.  
In addit ion, the interim analyses for the study  have been updated as follows:
The thi
rd interim  analysis will be perform ed when approximately  60 pati ents in the Phase 
2 porti on of  the study  have co mpleted 2 cy cles of treatm ent, and w ill examine safet y and 
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 107
LY2228820PK only.  Futilit y has been eliminated as Lilly does not expect that enough PFS events 
will have been observed to allow a fut ility analysis to occur at that time.  
The fourth interim analysis has been removed as all patients will ha ve been enrolled and 
the PFS data will be immature.  This interim would not be informat ive for futilit y or 
efficacy .  Tri al level safet y will cont inue to be monitored throughout the study.

5. Introduction
5.8. Interaction with Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes and Enzymes Responsible for 
the Metabolism of LY2228820
The effect of LY2228820 on drug- metabo lizing enzymes has been studied in vitro using human 
liver mic rosom es.  LY2228820 was found to competit ively inhibit the biotransformat ion of 
midazo lam to 1 ′-hydroxy -midazo la
m with an est imated Ki o f 1.2µM (0.5 µg/mL).  LY2228820 
was also shown to inhibit CYP3A in a time -dependent manner wi th a kinactof 0.069 min -1and 
KIof 9.5 µM (3.99 µg/m L).  These data suggested the possibilit y that LY2228820 might 
modulate cl earance of drugs that are metabolized by  CYP3A in vivo .
The abilit y of LY2228820 to induce cataly tic act ivities associated with CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A was examined in primary  cultures of fresh human hepatocy tes.prepared fro m three 
separate donors.   LY2228820 was found unlikely to cause in vivo induct ion of the above CYP 
isoforms within the concentration range examined (0.01 to 10 µM).
The effect of LY2228820 on the activit y of CYP3A in vivo has been is being evaluated in the 
dose confirmation phase of Study  JIAD (Part B) in which patients were areadministered a 2 -mg 
oral dose of midazol am in the absence or presence of 420 mg LY2228820 administered every  12 
hours (after fourteen doses).  Results showed Preliminary result s from 9 pati ents indicate that 
mean PK parameters (C maxand AUC) of midazo lam administered with LY2228820 were no 
higher than those of midazo lam administered alone , indicating .  These data indicate that 
LY2228820 may not inhibit the CYP3A act ivity up to the dose level invest igated ( 18 patients at 
420 m g given every  12 hours).
In vitr o studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the metabolic clearance of 
LY2228820 is primarily mediated by the UDP -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) pathway 
(87%), with CYP -mediated pathway contributing to only 13%.  Further CYP phenotyping 
studies us ing recombinant human CYPs indicated that CYP3A contributed to 72% of the 
CYP -mediated metabolic clearance of LY2228820.  Taken together, the contribution of 
CYP3A to the total metabolic clearance of LY2228820 is estimated to be less than 10%.  
The regulat ory guidance suggests that any enzyme contributing <25% to the systemic 
clearance of the drug is not clinically significant (FDA 2012).
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 111
LY2228820Collectively, the above in vitro and in vivo data suggest that clinical interactions are 
unlikely when LY2228820 is coadministered with substrates, inhibitors and or inducers of 
CYP3A.  When coadministered, inhibitors of UGT may increase the plasma concentrations 
of LY2228820 and inducers of UGT may decrease the plasma concentrations of 
LY2228820.
Refer to Section 9.8, Concomitant Therapy , for more informati on regarding inducers and 
moderate/strong inhibitors and inducers of UGT CYP3A4 .
5.12. Rationale for Amendmen t (c)
Metabolic clearance analysis has recently been completed which revealed that CYP3A 
mediated metabolism is not the primary clearance pathway of LY2228820.  This allows for 
the restriction of the CYP3A inhibitors, inducers, or substrates to be removed and for the 
use of dexamethasone and other anti -emetics during treatment with LY2228820. 
Based on the available preclinical data, there is a possible risk of clinical drug –drug 
interaction when LY2228820 is administered with inhibitors or inducers of UGT enzymes.  
In the absence of clinical data to refine the risk of interaction, caution is warranted in the 
concomitant use of UGT enzyme inhibitors such as valproic acid and p robenecid and 
inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and rifampin.  When, in the clinical 
investigator's opinion, concomitant use of valproic acid or probenecid is indicated, 
LY2228820 -related DLTs of ataxia, dizziness and rash should be carefully monit ored.
The ovarian cancer landscape has changed during the course of this study. Maintenance 
therapy as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen has become more prevalent.  
Several studies are examining the effect of maintenance after patients achie ve a CR with 
the first line platinum regimen.  In order to balance these patients between the placebo and 
LY2228820 arms, prior maintenance therapy has been added as a randomization factor. 
The original sample size calculation for the Phase 2 portion of t he study included a 
censoring rate assumption of 6% with 103 PFS events needed from 110 patients. Upon 
reflection, Lilly considers that this assumed censoring rate is too low. If just 8 or more 
patients are lost to follow up, the actual censoring rate woul d be higher. With this protocol 
amendment, the censoring rate estimate has been increased to 28% resulting in a reduction 
in the number of PFS events needed to 79. The hazard ratio of 0.7 has been maintained but 
the power has been reduced to 77% from 83%. These assumptions are consistent with 
enrollment and censoring experience in this phase of development.  
In addition, the interim analyses for the study have been updated as follows:
The third interim analysis will be performed when approximately 60 patie nts in the 
Phase 2 portion of the study have completed 2 cycles of treatment, and will examine 
safety and PK only. Futility has been eliminated as Lilly does not expect that enough 
PFS events will have been observed to allow a futility analysis to occur at that time.  
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 112
LY2228820The fourth interim analysis has been removed as all patients will have been enrolled 
and the PFS data will be immature. This interim would not be informative for 
futility or efficacy. Trial level safety will continue to be monitored throughout the 
study.

7.3.1. Discontinuation of Patients
The reason and date for discont inuat ion will be collected for all pat ients.  All patients who 
discontinue but receive at least one dose of study  treatm ent will have procedures performed as 
shown in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1).
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 113
LY2228820Patients who wi thdraw from  the study  before receiving study  treatm entwill be replaced and will 
not be included in th e safet y or efficacy  assessments.
For Phase 1b, any pat ient who experiences a dose -limit ing toxicit y or receives at l east 75% of 
planned doses of LY2228820 in Cycle 1 will be deemed evaluable for safet y assessment at that 
dose l evel.  Non-evaluable Noneval uable patients may be repl aced to ensure at least 3 evaluable 
patients at each dose l evel, unless accrual  to that cohort has stopped because 2 or more patients at 
that dose level have experienced a DLT.  In no case should patients be replaced if the y were 
discontinued fro m the study  due to toxi city. Pati ents who are evaluable for safet y assessment at a 
dose l evel but have insufficient PK sampling may be replaced upon consultation wit h the 
investigator(s) and the Lilly  Clinical  Research Physician (CRP ) to ensure adequate PK data, 
unless accrual to that cohort has stopped because 2 or more patients at that dose level have 
experienced a DLT.
For Phase 2, any  randomized pati ent who receives at l east one dose of study  treatm ent will  be 
deem ed evaluable for efficacy  assessment.  Noneval uable pat ients may be repl aced. Pati ents who 
are evaluable for efficacy assessment but have insufficient PK sampling may be replaced upon 
consultation wit h the invest igator(s) and the Lilly CRP to ensure adequate PK data.
8. Investigational Plan
8.1.2. Phase 2
Approximately  110 pati ents will be rando mized 1:1 to provide 83% power for identifying a 
hazard ratio of 0.7 (LY2228820 arm to placebo arm) with a false -positive rate of 0.2 (one -sided) 
(refer to Section 12for addi tional details regarding the sample size descript ion).  Pati ents will be 
rando mized with a minimizat ion method (Pocock and Simo n 1975) using the fo llowing f actors:  
time fro m completion of first line plat inum -based therapy to relapse (6 to 12 months versus over 
12 m onths) and ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2).
Starting from protocol (c), randomization scheme is updated by adding another 
randomizat ion factor. Patients who consent to protocol (c) will be randomized using 
following factors: time from completion of first line platinum- based therapy to relapse (6 to 
12 months versus over 12 months), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2) and 
mainten ance therapy as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen (yes versus no).
8.1.4. Interim Analyses
The first interim analysis will be conducted to assess safet y and PK; i t will be performed when 
all evaluable patients in the Phase 1b portion of the study  have received at least 1 cycle of study  
treatm ent.
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 114
LY2228820The second interim analysis will be conducted to assess safet y and PK; i t will be perform ed 
when approximately  30 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study  have received at least 1 cy cle 
of study treatm ent.
The third interim  analysis will be conducted to assess safet y, PK, and PKfutilit y; it will be 
perform ed when approximately 60 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study  have received at 
least 2 cy cles of study  treatm ent.
The fourth interim analysis will be conducted to assess safety , PK, fut ility, and efficacy; it will 
be perform ed when enro llment in the study  is complete and all evaluable pat ients in the Phase 2 
porti on of  the study  have received at l east 2 cycles of study  treatm ent.
9. Treatment
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
In the Phase 2 portion of the study , approximately 110 pati ents will be rando mized 1:1 in a 
doubl e-blind manner by an interactive vo ice-response system (IVRS) to either Arm A 
(LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and ca rbopl atin) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and 
carbopl atin).Randomization will minimize imbalance between treatment arms according to the 
following factors:  time from co mpletion of first line plat inum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 to 12 
months versus o ver 12 m onths) and ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2).
Starting from protocol (c), the randomization scheme is updated by adding another 
randomization factor. Patients who consent to protocol (c) will be randomized using 
following the factors: tim e from completion of first line platinum- based therapy to relapse 
(6 to 12 months versus over 12 months), ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2) and 
maintenance therapy as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen (yes versus no).
This procedu re is based on a well -defined algori thm (Pocock and Sim on 1975). The 
rando mizat ion probabilit y factor will be set at 0.75.
9.4.2.1. Induction Therapy
Gem citabine, 1000 m g/m2, will  be administered IV over approximately  30 (+15) minutes on 
Days 3 and 10 of a 21-day cycle.  The gem citabine infusi on will be started following the 
morning dose of LY2228820.
Carbopl atin, AUC 4 (maximum dose, 600 mg), will be administered IV over approximately 30 
(+15) minutes on Day  3 of a 21 -day cycle.  The carboplatin infusio n will fo llow the gem citabine 
infusio n.  Antiemetics shoul d be administered according to inst itutional standard procedures.  
Patients m ay receive a single dose of dexamethasone as part of the ant iemetic regimen prior to 
administration of intravenous chemothe rapy (refer to Secti on 9.8).

Table JIAE.9.2. Intercycle Intracy cleDose Adjustments for LY2228820 or Placebo
9.5.1. Dose- Limiting Toxicity Determination and Maximum Tolerated Dose Definition
All toxicit ies should be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.0.
Nausea/vo miting should be treated promptly wit h ant iemetics (for example, prochlorperazine, 
and metocl opramide). Di arrhea shoul d be treated with antidiarrheals (for example, loperamide). 
Supportive interventions shoul d not involve treatment with medicat ions that are inducers or 
moderate/strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (refer to Attachment 10).
9.8. Concomitant Therapy
With the exceptions listed in the fo llowing sect ions, no other chemotherapy , experimental  
medicat ions, ot her anticancer therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal cancer therapy, radiat ion, 
surgery  for cancer, or experimental medications will be permitted while pat ients are on study  
treatm ent.  The need for any  form of radiotherapy  (including palliat ive) will be cause for early 
discontinuat ion from study  treatm ent.  In addi tion any disease progression requiring other forms 
of specific ant itumor therapy  will also necessitate early  discontinuat ion from study treatment.  
Appropriate documentation of all forms of premedicat ion’s, supportive care, and conco mitant 
medicat ions m ust be captured at each visit in the case report form (CRF).  Conco mitant 
medicat ions and supportive care therapies must be documented at the time of discont inuat ion and 
also at the 30 -day follow-up visi t.
Based on the available preclinical data, there is a possible risk of clinical drug –drug 
interaction when LY2228820 is administered with inhibitors or inducers of UGT enzymes.  
In the absence of clinical data to refine the risk of interaction, caution is warranted in the 
concomitant use of UGT enzyme inhibitors such as valproic acid and probenecid and 
inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and rifampin.  When, in the clinical 
investigator's opinion, concomitant use of valproic acid or probenecid is ind icated, 
LY2228820 -related DLTs of ataxia, dizziness and rash should be carefully monitored.
Patients are not allowed to consume grapefruit juice and/or drugs that are inducers or 
moderate/strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see Attachment 10 ).  Patients will have to discont inue 
these m edicati ons or will be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent if unwilling to stop drugs that are 
inducers or moderate/strong inhibitors of CYP3A4.  The only  excepti on to this requi rement i s 
that pati ents may  receive a single dose of dexam ethasone (an inducer of CYP3A4) as part of the 
antiemetic regimen prior to administration of intravenous chemotherapy.
To avoi d potential  drug -drug interactions with LY2228820, antiemet ics that are not CYP3A4 -
inducers or inhibitors should be used, such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.

Collection and Testing, and Appropriateness of Measurements
10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
Previously  planned (pri or to si gning the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
Serious adverse events Death due to disease progressio n, including death, should not be 
reported as an SAE unless the invest igator also deems them thereto be possibly a possible 
contribution related to the study  drug.
10.4.2. Archival Tumor Tissue Sample
Pretreatment formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor ti ssue obtained at the time of original 
diagnosis shoul d be in a who le block, parti al block, or unstained slides.  Stored samples will 
retain the patient ident ifier and therefore, will not be stored indefinitely.  Any blocks or 
slides whole block submi tted will either be returned to the site or discarded within 15 years 
after las t patient visit for the trial .  If archival t issue is not available for a specific pat ient, it 
will not constitute a protocol vio lation.
For p53 and PTEN mutation analyses co mpar ing tum or to germline DNA, a single whole -blood 
sample will be collected one t ime to iso late DNA from  PBMCs.   Samples will be identified by 
the patient number (coded) and stored for up to 15 years after the last patient visit for the 
study at a facility selected by the sponsor.  The sample and any data generated from it can 
only be linked back to the patient by investigator site personnel.
Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the pat ients stored samples will be supplied 
by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory  will occur according to 
instructi ons given to the study  sites.
10.4.4. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamic samples will be collected as specified in the PK and PD Sampling Schedule 
(Attachm ent 3).  Ci rculating plasma protein s regulated by  p38 MAPK (such as such as TNF, 
IL-1, IL -6, and IL -8) will be measured.  Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the 
patients stored sam ples will  be supplied by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the 
central  laboratory will occur per i nstructi ons given to the study  sites.  Pharmacodynamic 
samples collected to measure circulating plasma proteins will be retained for a maximum 
of 15 years after the last patient visit for the study.
12. Sample Size and Statistical Methods
I1D-MC-JIAE(c) Clinical Protocol Page 117
LY222882012.1. Determination of Sample Size
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 portion of this study is to compare the progression -free 
survival in pat ients treated with LY2228820 plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus placebo 
plus gemcitabine and carboplat in.  A group sequential design will be u sed to control type 1 
error across the interim analyses and the final PFS analysis in Phase 2 (see Section 12.2.11
for details). The primary analysis will be performed after 79total of 103 PFS events have 
occurred. Assumingprovi de 83% power for ident ifying a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 , this sample 
size yiel d at least 77% power with a false-positive rate of 0.2 (1 -sided) using a log -rank test.
This assumes exponent ially distributed PFS times, median PFS of 8.6 months for the control 
arm, enrollment durati on of  12 m onths, and follow -up time of 18 months afte r the last patient is 
enrolled.  Assuming 286% censoring rate of the PFS, a total of 110 patients will be rando mized 
(55patients in each arm) to achieve 79103PFS events at the primary  analysis.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
All tests of treatme nt effects will be conducted at a 1 -sided al pha level of 0.2 unless otherwise 
stated.  All CIs will be given at a 2 -sided 90% level unless otherwise stated .
Starting from protocol (c), an additional factor is included during patient enrollment as 
randomization factor (see Section 8.1.2). For patients who randomized to phase 2 before 
the approval of protocol (c), the value of maintenance therapy as a part of or after a first 
line platinum regimen for these patients will be imputed as “not collected”.
12.2.5. Primary Outcome and Methodology
For the primary  endpoint of PFS, the HR will be estimated fro m survival data on all rando mized 
patients using a Cox proport ional hazards model with assigned study  treatm ent arm  as fixed 
effect along with cofactors for and time fro m complet ion of first line plat inum -based therapy  to 
relapse (6 to 12 m onths versus over 12 months ),) and ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 
2) and maintenance therapy as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen (yes versus 
no versus not collected). as covariates.
The Kaplan -Meier m ethod (Kaplan and Meier 1958) will be used to estimate the survival curve 
as well as survival rates at various time po ints for each treatment group.   The log -rank test will 
be used to compare PFS distributions between treatment groups in phase 2.
12.2.6. Efficacy Analyses
CA125 data will be log -transform ed first and analyzed using a mixed -effect m odel repeated 
measures analysis with treatm ent, tim e, and treatment byandtime interaction as fixed effect, 
along withcofactors for time fro m completion of first line platinum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 
to 12 m onths versus over 12 months),) and ECOG performance status ( 0 and 1 versus 2) and

LY2228820maintenance therapy as a part of or after a first line platinum regimen (yes versus no 
versus not collected). as covariates.
The l og rati o of tumor size at the end of Cycle 2 to tumor size at baseline will be calculated for 
each patien t. Thi s measure fo llows a norm al distribut ion and will be co mpared between 
treatm ent groups using a t -test.  Analysis o f variance will  be used to assess the effect of baseline 
factors on the change in tumor size.
The overall response rate is est imated as t he total number of CRs and PRs, based on RECIST 
versio n 1.1, divided by  the total  number of randomized patients.  The efficacy endpoint of 
overall response rate and its exact 90% confidence interval will be est imated for each treatment 
arm.  The proporti onin each treatment arm will be compared using the Chi -square test.
The efficacy analysis on OS will be conducted after all the patients have been fo llowed f or at 
least 2 y ears. The HR will be est imated from survival data on all rando mized pat ients using a 
Cox proportional hazards model using assigned study  treatm ent arm  as fixed effect wi th time 
from completion of first line plat inum -based therapy  to rel apse (6 to 12 m onths versus over 
12months),) and ECOG performance status (0 and 1 versus 2) and maintenance therapy as a 
part of or after a first line platinum regimen (yes versus no versus not collected). as 
covari ates.
Addit ional exploratory  analyses m ay be performed as deemed appropriate.
12.2.11.2. Interim Analyses for Phase 2
Two Three interim an alyses are pl anned for the Phase 2 portion of the study .  The first analysis 
will be conducted for safet y and pharmacokinet ics when approximately  30 patients in Phase 2 
have co mpleted at least 1 cy cle of study  treatment.  The second interim analysis will b e 
conducted for safet yand PK when approximately 60, PK, and futilit y when approximately 60 
patients in Phase 2 have co mpleted at least 2 cy cles of study  treatm ent.  The third interim 
analysis will be conducted for safet y, PK, fut ility, and efficacy  when a llpatients in Phase 2 have 
completed at l east 2 cy cles of study  treatm ent.  Patient enrollment will cont inue alo ng with the 
interim analyses. The Phase 2 interim analyses will be conducted using unblinded data under the 
guidance o f an internal  assessment committee.
Futility analyses using PFS will be performed at interim analyses 2 and 3 in the Phase 2 portion 
of the study.  The study  coul d be terminated if the posterior probabilit y of the HR l ess than 0.7 i s 
less than 15%.
Unblinding procedures are specif ied in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

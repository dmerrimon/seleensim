azoospermia  
Study 
Phase  II 
Sponsor  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  
Study  
Drug  13-cis retinoic acid  
Objective  Primary Objective :  To d etermine the effect of 13-cis 
retino ic acid administration  on the appearance of s perm in the 
ejaculate among men presenting with azoospermia  
 
Approach: Twenty  men with infertility , aged 21 -60, due to 
azoospermia (no apparent sperm in the ejaculate on two 
separate occasions) will be enrolled in a single -arm pilot  trial 
of daily oral the rapy of 20 mg twice  daily of 13 -cis retinoic 
acid for 32 weeks. The impact of treatment on the appearance 
of sperm in the ejaculate  will be determined by monthly 
semen analyses.  
 
Secondary Objectives : 
 To determine the side effects associated with treatmen t 
with 13 -cis retinoic acid  
 
PI Dr. John K. Amory MD, MPH  
Rationale  Men with infertility from azoospermia and normal 
gonadotropins have few options for treatment.  Recent 
research has demonstrated that lower intratesticular 
concentrations of 13 -cis retin oic acid are associated with 
abnormal sperm production.  Older studies of 13 -cis retinoic 
acid administration to normal men demonstrated increases in 
sperm concentrations. Our recent pilot study in men with 
oligoasthenozoospermia demonstrated increased spe rm 
production in roughly ½ of men with treatment, including 
several who started with sperm counts very close to zero.  
However, the effect of 13 -cis retinoic acid on sperm 
concentrations in men with azoospermia has never been 
studied.  If 13 -cis retinoic a cid allowed men with azoospermia 
to produce ejaculated sperm, it could help men with 
azoospermia father pregnancies using ICSI without the need 
for testicular biopsy or testicular sperm extraction (TESE).

Study  
Design   
We will conduct an unblinded, pilo t study to determine the 
impact of therapy with 13 -cis retinoic acid on sperm indices 
in azoospermic men. Twenty azoospermic  men, ages 21 -60 
will be enrolled in a 32-week study of 20 mg twice daily  of 
13-cis retinoic acid.  The subjects will be closely fol lowed 
for side effects related to treatment. The impact of treatment 
on the appearance of sperm in the ejaculate  will be 
determined by monthly seminal fluid analyses . 
 
All aspects of this study will be performed in compliance 
with Good Clinical Practice (G CP) regulations, ICH 
guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and under an FDA 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  
Number of 
Subjects  Twenty men.  
Duration of 
Trial  Enrol lment  should be completed in about 18 months, 
resulting in total study durati on of about 36 months 
including screening, treatment phase, end of study visit 
procedures, close out and data analysis.  
Duration of 
Treatment  The active treatment phase will be 32 weeks.  
Dosage and 
Regimen  13-cis retinoic acid at 20 mg twice daily with m eals for 32 
weeks.

1.0  Introduction and Background  
 
Infertility affects 10 -15% of all couples, with 1.5 million couples seeking medical 
assistance for infertility yearly (1). Infertility attributable to the male partner 
accounts for 30 -40% of all cases of infertility. The most common form of male 
infertility involves some type of impairment in spermatogenesis (2).  Unfortunately, 
over 80% of men with infertility from impaired s permatogenesis do not have a 
medically treatable cause, such as a gonadotropin deficiency (3).  In men with 
idiopathic infertility, surgical sperm extraction from the testes coupled with in vitro  
fertilization or intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection offers so me hope of fertility; 
however, these procedures are invasive, expensive, unsuccessful in 30 -40% of cases, 
and don’t address the underlying cause of infertility (4).   Therefore, new approaches 
to the treatment of male infertility are sorely needed.  
 
 The es sential role of vitamin A (retinol) in spermatogenesis has been long 
appreciated.  Vitamin A deficient male mice are sterile due to impaired 
spermatogenesis and supplementation of deficient mice with vitamin A restores 
fertility (5, 6).  Vitamin A is requi red for spermatogenesis as it is converted to 
retinoic acid in the seminiferous tubules via the activity of testes -specific retinol and 
retinal dehydrogenases. Retinoic acid is known to mediate most of the effects of 
vitamin A in tissues.  In the testes, t wo retinoic acid receptors,  and , are present 
in both Sertoli cells and developing germ cells (7 -10), and targeted deletion of these 
receptors in mice results in male infertility (11 -13).  From this work, it is clear that 
retinoic acid plays several essential roles in spermatogene sis, including necessary 
functions in spermatogonial differentiation, spermatid adhesion to Sertoli cells and 
spermiation (14). Given the crucial role of retinoic acid in spermatogenesis, it seems 
quite possible that some men with “idiopathic” infertility have intratesticular 
concentrations of retinoic acid below those necessary to initiate and/or maintain 
optimal spermatogenesis . In theory, poor dietary intake of vitamin A could lead to 
infertility; however, a nutritional cause of infertility seems improba ble in the U .S.  
   
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 10 of 31 More likely, low intratesticular concentrations of retinoic acid could occur in 
infertile men either due to impaired retinoic acid biosynthesis from vitamin A or 
increased metabolism of retinoic acid to inactive metabolites within the test es.  
 Despite the known importance of retinoic acid for spermatogenesis in 
animals, there has been relatively little work examining the role of retinoic acid on 
spermatogenesis in humans.  Intriguingly, there is a suggestion that the 
administration of ret inoic acid to men may improve sperm production. During the 
development of 13 -cis retinoic acid (Accutane) for acne, three human studies 
examining the effect of oral administration of 13 -cis-retinoic acid on sperm 
production in men were performed to determi ne if 13 -cis retinoic acid was harmful 
to male fertility. Interestingly, men in these studies had increased sperm 
concentrations during treatment (see below), suggesting that 13 -cis retinoic acid 
administration enhanced spermatogenesis in these normal men with acne (15 -17).  
We recently completed a pilot study in 20 men with infertility from 
oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.  In this study, roughly ½ of the men experienced 
significant improvements in their sperm production, suggesting this treatment is 
useful f or men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.  In this proposal, we will 
perform a clinical trial of retinoic acid administration to infertility patients with 
azoospermia to determine whether retinoic acid therapy  can initiate sperm 
production in men with azoo spermia.    If the administration of retinoic acid were 
shown to improve spermatogenesis in some infertile men with azoospermia, it 
would have tremendous significance for our current a pproach to the treatment of 
men with  infertility who could avoid the nee d for testicular biopsy and/or testicular 
sperm extraction.   Because of its widespread use in humans for over 25 years, 13 -
cis retinoic acid is widely available in a generic formulation and could be quickly 
incorporated into male infertility treatment algo rithms.  Ideall y, retinoic acid 
therapy would allow a man to make sufficient sperm for ICSI, dramatically 
increasing his  chances  of fathering a pregnancy.

2.1 Primary Objective :   
To determine the effect of 13 -cis retinoic acid administration o n the appearance of sperm 
in the ejaculation in men wi th azoospermia.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
o To determine the side effects and tolerability of  treatment with 13 -cis retinoic acid 
in men with azoospermia  
 
3. Rationale, Benefits and Risks  
Male infertility is  common and difficult to treat unless men have an easily identified 
gonadotropin deficiency.  Many men have idiopathic infertility.  We have shown that men 
with abnormal spermatogenesis have lower than normal levels of intratesticular retinoic 
acid, sugges ting that intratesticular retinoic acid deficiency is associated with infertility, 
and have performed a pilot study in men with idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia 
demonstrating that half of these men increase their sperm production on treatment.  In this 
study, we aim to determin e if retinoic acid therapy can convert men with azoospermia into 
men with oligozoospermia.  The medication, 13 -cis retinoic acid, is widely available and 
prescribed for the treatment of acne, suggesting that serious adverse events ar e unlikely, 
especially at the low doses to be tested.   
 
4. Compliance  
All aspects of this study will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice GCP 
regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH guidelines, under an active FDA 
Investigational New Dru g (IND)  (#120703) .

duration of about 36 months including screening, treatment phase, end of study visit 
procedures, close out and data analysis.  
 
7. Number of Subjects  
20 me n will participate in the study. We may need to screen up to 50 men to find 20 men 
eligible to participate.  
 
8. Dosage and Administration  
 
  13-cis retinoic acid at 20 mg twice  daily  (purchased commercially)  with meals  
 
  
We will conduct an open -label pilot trial to determine the impact of therapy with 13 -cis retinoic 
acid on sperm indices in infertile men. Twenty i nfertile men with azoospermia will be enrolled in 
a 32-week study of 20 mg t wice daily  of 13 -cis retinoic acid. The subjects will be closely 
followed for side effects related to treatment. The impact of treatment on indices of 
spermatogenesis  will be determined by monthly seminal fluid analyses .

Concomitant medications that are exclusionary include:  
 Use of sex hormones for treatment  
 Use of androgens or other compounds for body building  
 Use of retin -A or Accutane for the  treatment of acne  
Concomitant medications are discouraged except as prescribed for the treatment of co-exising  
medical conditions. All concomitant treatments will be recorded on the subject’s case record form 
(CRF), including the generic name of the drug,  start and stop dates, and reason for use.   
 
11. Study  Materials  
11.1 Study Medication  
Each subject will receive the study drug Isotretinoin 20 mg twice daily for 32 weeks. The first 
dose will be administered at the clinic under the observation of the study staff.  The day and time 
of the start of treatment will be recorded on the CRF in the appropriate space provided. The 
subjects will be given enough supply of medication until their next visit.  
 
A Study drug log (diary) will be provided to the subjects for record ing the times of taking study 
medication. These drug logs will be reviewed at each visit. The investigator will retain the copies 
of these logs as source documents.  
 
The prescriber Dr. Amory, is registered in iPLEDGE.  All subjects will be registered in i PLEDGE 
and undergo the extensive counselling recommended by this program.  
 
11.2 Storage  
Study drug will be stored at a temperature not to exceed 25oC in a locked storage area at the study 
site. The study drug will be accessible only to study personnel designate d to handle study drug.  
 
11.3 Disposal  
Empty used pill bottles will be returned to the clinic and retained at the site in a locked storage 
area.   All unused study drug will be returned to the University of Washington investigational 
pharmacy for destruction on ce final drug accountability has been performed.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 15 of 31 12. Study  Procedures  
12.1 General  
 The study will consist of 3 periods:  
1. Pre-treatment period (including screening) for up to 60 days.  
2. Treatment period for 32 weeks  
3. Recovery period of 24 weeks  
 
The treatment period wi ll begin with Day 1 of treatment, twice  daily for 32  weeks . The recovery 
period will last for 24 weeks.  
 
12.2 Laboratory Samples  
Blood samples for laboratory analyses will be collected at the first screening visit, and at the 
treatment visits on weeks 8, 16, 24 , 32 and 56  with the subject in a fasting state (no food or drink 
other than 4 to 6 ounces of water or non -sweetened clear liquids for a minimum of 8 hours). A 
snack will be provided after the blood is drawn.  If the subject is in a non -fasting state, the 
investigator will reschedule the visit within two days. The investigator will review all laboratory 
reports and file a copy with each subject’s chart and CRFs. The CBC and blood chemistry samples 
will be analysed at the local hospital laboratory at the Uni versity of Washington.    
 
The serum samples for measurements of retinoic acid will be frozen for analysis at the end of 
study. In terms of processing, the blood samples will be collected into vacutainers (containing 
serum separating tube gel and clot acti vator) wrapped aluminum foil to prevent light exposure that 
can degrade retinoic acid,, and gently mixed. The samples will be allowed to clot for 30 minutes at 
room temperature before centrifugation at 1000 -2000g for 15 minutes. Following centrifugation, 
the serum samples will be frozen in (light protection?) tubes at –80 C.   
 
Semen Analysis: Semen will be collected after at least 48 hours of abstinence from ejaculation at  
the two screening visits, treatment visits 2 -9, and all follow up visits.  The semen will be  assessed 
for the presence of sperm, and, if present, for  count and motility.  In addition, a known volume of 
semen will be diluted and washed for making smears for morphology assessments.  These 
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 16 of 31 procedures allow for accurate total sperm count and m otility assessments following the WHO 
protocol ( 18). 
 
12.3 Visits in Pre -treatment period  
 
All visits will be scheduled between 7:00am and 3:00pm.   
 
12.3.1  Screening Visit 1  
The following screening procedures will be performed at the first screening visit:  
 Each parti cipant must sign an IRB -approved informed consent form before any of the study -
related procedures can be performed. The original signed informed consent form will be kept on 
file by the investigator with the subject’s record and a copy will be given to the  subject.  
 Subjects will also complete an Isotretinoin -specific consent form as provided by the iPLEDGE 
program  
 A general medical history will be taken and will include information on current and previous 
diseases and treatment.  
 Vital  signs (pulse, blood pr essure) will be taken and recorded.  
 Complete physical exam, including measurement of testicular volume, will be performed.  
 Fasting  blood samples will be obtained for the following measurements: Complete blood count 
(CBC), clinical chemistry including gluco se, liver and renal function tests (urea, creatinine, 
albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamine transferase, 
alkaline phosphatase), creatine kinase (CK),  bilirubin, albumin, full lipid panel including total 
cholesterol , HDL, and LDL, triglycerides, hematology (hematocrit, hemoglobin), and hormones 
(LH, FSH, T)  
 Semen analysis will be done to determine if sperm are present  
 Height and weight will be collected  
 Participants will be questioned regarding past? And concomitant medications and adverse 
events.  
 Once lab results are obtained and considered consistent with idiopathic infertility from 
azoospermia by the investigator as per the inclusion/ exclusion criteria for enrollment, the 
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 17 of 31 participant is informed by telephone of hi s lab results. If conformance to the inclusion/exclusion is 
confirmed, he is scheduled to return to the clinic for the 2nd sperm collection one week later.

13. Study With drawals  
Subjects withdrawn from the study can be replaced only if the withdrawal occurs before the start 
of the treatment. Subjects who have had study drug will not be replaced, regardless of the reason 
for discontinuation. All efforts will be made to con tact any subject who decides to discontinue 
study participation before the end of study safety procedures (Visit 11). The necessary clinical and 
laboratory examinations planned at the last visit should be performed at the end of the study 
whenever it occur s. The reasons for discontinuation will be documented.   
 
Post-Admission Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may be discontinued prematurely for any of the following reasons:  
 Emergence of a severe condition(s) such that, in the judgment of the investigator, conti nuation 
in the trial would negatively impact the health of the subject.  
 Personal reasons ( e.g. withdrawn consent).  
 Non-compliance with study drug  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 20 of 31  Subject lost to follow -up 
 A severe skin reaction judged by the investigator to potentially be related to the s tudy drug  
 A persistent elevation of serum triglycerides  
 Onset of neutropenia  
 New onset of hearing disorder  
 New onset of visual changes  
 Onset of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea  
 Persistent, significant increase of liver enzymes or bilirubi n 
 New onset of significant serum glucose elevation  
 New onset of headache associated with nausea and vomiting  
 Persistent elevation of serum calcium  
 Development of kidney stones  
 Increase in the PHQ9 score to >15 (suggestive of moderately severe depression)  
 
 
14. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Data analysis and Interpretation of Results:  The primary endpoint is the  presence of  sperm in the 
ejaculate at week 32 of treatment compared with its absence at baseline.      The presence of sperm after 
32 weeks of treatment w ill be compared with baseline using a Wilcoxon sign-rank test.  Linear 
regression will be performed to determine if significant relationships between baseline (or delta) serum 
concentrations  of 13 -cis retinoic acid  and changes in sperm quality are present using STATA Version 
10.0 (College Park, TX, USA).  For all comparisons, an alpha of 0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
14.1 Sample size consideration  
Inclusion of 20  men will allow for an 80% power to detect a response rate of greater than 15% in terms 
of sperm production and allowfor a drop -out rate of 10% at an alpha of 0.05  (The primary outcome) .  
 
14.2 Efficacy  
The primary efficacy outcome is the presence of sperm in the ejaculate of formerly azoospermic 
men.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 21 of 31  
14.3 Safety  
Laboratory data, physical examination res ults, vital signs and chemistry levels will be assessed 
and compared for each subject from screening to end of study.  All adverse events will be 
recorded and coded using the body system coding of MedDRA.  
 
The incidence of adverse events will be examined b y using descriptive statistics.  Clinical 
chemistries and allied data will be examined for change over time.  
 
15. Adverse  Events  
Adverse Events (AE) will be carefully monitored and an AE form is included in the CRF. Serious 
adverse events (SAE) as defined be low will be reported  on the SAE form included as appendix  #3. 
 
All adverse experiences must be recorded in the study event record of the subject’s CRF, and will 
include the following information (when applicable):  
 Specific condition or event  
 Indication of whether the condition was pre -existing or not and if yes, whether it has worsened 
in severity (including an increase in frequency)  
 Date of occurrence  
 Date of resolution  
 Relationship to study drug as evaluated by the investigator (causality assessment). The  
investigator must enter their opinion of causality on the AE forms.  
 Action taken (study drug continued or not) and outcome  
 Seriousness according to the approved regulatory classification {i.e. any event that is  fatal, 
life-threatening, disabling, incap acitating, results in or prolongs hospitalization, or is a medically 
significant event, e.g. an intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or any other serious 
criteria (cancer, congenital anomaly, overdose, other significant) is considered serious }. 
 
When any serious adverse drug experience, regardless of causality, is encountered during 
this clinical trial at an investigator’s site, the investigator must notify the Study Monitor by 
facsimile using the form provided as an appendix. This report must  be submitted within 2 
calendar days from the time the investigator’s staff is notified of the event.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 22 of 31  
All serious adverse events that are unexpected will be reported to the FDA by the principal 
investigator or his designated surrogate. All serious advers e events will be followed until fully 
characterized.  The investigator will collect and forward to the FDA via fax, all available 
supporting documentation (with subject name redacted) for serious events, including at a 
minimum hospital discharge summaries and death certificates (where applicable). Additional 
supporting documentation that should be collected whenever possible, to verify the medical 
diagnosis, includes autopsy reports (where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, histology 
reports, and im aging reports.  
 
16. Ethical  Considerations  
16.1 Informed Consent  
Principal investigators will provide the NICHD with a copy of the Informed Consent approved by 
their local Institutional Review Board (IRB). The Informed Consent will be translated and 
certified into the language of the respondent as needed.  
 
Under this consent, the subject shall understand that he is authorizing access to medical records as 
required for monitors, auditors, IRBs and regulatory authorities.  
 
16.2 Conflicts of Interest  
The investigators will  not profit from results, either positive or negative, with regard to the 
product being evaluated.  
 
16.3 Subject Recruitment  
The subjects will be recruited from UW and Community  Infertility and Urology clinics who see 
>200 such men annually.  The study coordin ator will screen potential subjects over the phone by 
inquiring about their age and medical history. Potential subjects who qualify by phone screen will 
be scheduled for an appointment to consult with the investigator about further eligibility 
requirements  for the study.

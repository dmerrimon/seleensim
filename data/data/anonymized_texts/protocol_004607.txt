 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable U nited States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research 
policies and procedures.  
4.1 Abstract  
 
Residual neuromuscular blockade is a common complication in the post- anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) when neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA s) have been used in the operating room.    
The only method of reliably detecting residual neuromuscular blockade is through the use of quantitative neuromuscular monitors.  Unfortunately, several barriers exist that have prevented 
the widespread application of these devices, and m any practitioners are still using qualitative 
(subjective) methods as an assessment of neuromuscular blockade despite the lack of accuracy and the well -described morbidity and mortality a ssociated with residual blockade.  
The aim of this study  is to correl ate the objective electromyography ( EMG )-derived data (TOFR, 
TOFC, PTC) with subjective (blinded) evaluation of responses using TetraGraph.  TetraGraph 
(Senzime AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is a standalone EMG -based quantitative monitor that recently 
received Conformité Européene (CE) and FDA approval.  EMG measures electrical activity 
within the muscle following peripheral nerve stimulation and is unaffected by involunt ary patient 
motion or restricted muscle movements from surgical positioning. We plan to correlate 
measurements with Tetragraph monitoring the adductor pollicis, and visual assessment of the 
thumb movement, throughout various stages of neuromuscular blockade. This will include onset 
of blockade following neuromuscular relaxant administration, maintenance, and depth of block 
prior to reversal of blockade with sugammadex until adequate recovery (train-of- four ratio >0.9).  
4.2 Background 
 Neuromuscular blocking agents  (NMBAs)  are a class  of medications  routinely used during 
anesthesia to facilitate  endotracheal  intubation (1) and improve conditions for optimal surgery 
(2). However,  these  medications  are also associated  with respiratory  complications  in the early  
postoperative period due to residual  neuromuscular blockade (RNMB)  (3-5). Even  when  
neuromuscular blockade is reversed  in the operating  room, postoperative residual  weakness  
continues to be a common problem in the post- anesthesia  care unit (PACU),  and a significant 
number of patients  continue to arrive  in the PACU  with objective evidence of residual  
neuromuscular blockade (6, 7).  While  not every  patient  with residual  weakness  develops a 
postoperative complication,  many  can develop avoidable critical  respiratory  events  (8, 9).  
Furthermore, special  populations such as the elderly  are at particular  risk for developing 
complications  related  to postoperative residual  weakness  (10).   The use of quantitative  
monitoring has been  demonstrated  to reliably  reduce the incidence of postoperative residual  
weakness  and the ensuing complications  (11-13).   
 
Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring devices objectively measure residual weakness and display the results numerically.  This is traditionally accomplished by performing a train-of-four 
(TOF) stimulation at the ulnar nerve and measuring the response of the adductor pollicis muscle.  
The degree of muscle weakness is determined by calculating the TOF ratio, which consists of the 
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 8 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  ratio of the fourth muscle contraction to the first.  Adequate recovery that excludes clinically 
significant weakness from neuromuscular blockade is defined as a TOF ratio ≥ 0.9, a 
measurement that can be determined reliably only with a quantitative monitor (14, 15) .  With an 
abundance of literature supporting the use of objective neuromuscular monitors, a panel of experts recently recommended the universal adoption of such devices whenever NMBA are utilized (16)  however, quantitative monitors can be expensive and require additional training.  
There are several types of quantitative  neuromuscular monitors.   These  devices  can be 
incorporated into the anesthesia workstation, allowing  data to be seamlessly  integrated  into the 
electronic medical  record.   Unfortunately, this setup  can preclude using these  monitors  in the 
PACU  as portability  is sacrificed.   In contrast,  other monitors  exist  as standalone, portable (hand-
held) units.    
Aside  from  portability,  objective monitors can further be categorized  based  on the modality  
utilized  to measure responses.  Mechanomyography (MMG)  measures  the force  of contraction  of 
the adductor pollicis  (thumb) muscle  following ulnar  nerve stimulation  and has served  as the 
traditional “ gold- standard ”.  Mechanomyographic responses are
  precise and reproducible, 
however the setup  is cumber some  and the lack of commercially  available devices  has relegated  
MMG  to strictly  research  purposes. Acceleromyography  (AMG)  measures  acceleration  of a 
muscle  group (typically  the thumb) in response to stimulation  (typically  the ulnar nerve).  This 
technique is similar  to MMG,  but instead  of measuring  the force  of muscle  contraction,  an 
accelerometer  fixed  to the thumb measures  the acceleration  of the thumb in response to ulnar 
nerve stimulation.   Based  on Newton’s  Second  law that states  force  is proportional to 
acceleration,  the measured  acceleration  is correlated  with the force  of contraction  in the clinical  
setting.   There are currently  two standalone AMG -based  monitors available for clinical  use: the 
STIMPOD  (Xavant  Technologies,  Pretoria,  South Africa)  and the ToFscan  (Draeger  Medical  
Inc., Telford,  PA).  These  devices  represent  improvements  in AMG  technology over its 
predecessor,  the TOF -Watch  (Schering -Plough Corp.,  Kenilworth,  NJ, USA)  as they utilize  three  
dimensional transducers  that can better  quant ify the complex  motion  of the thumb.   Despite  these  
advances,  the use of AMG  can be limited  due to patient positioning that precludes  free motion  of 
the thumb, as well instances  of awakening  patients  moving their thumb during measurements.   
Kinem
yography ( KMG)  is based  on similar  principles  to AMG , and relies  on the thumb being 
able to move freely.   Upon neurostimulation, KMG  utilizes  a piezoelectric motion  sensor  that is 
bent between  the thumb and index fingers following muscle  contraction.   The degree of this 
bending is quantified and used to determine a TOF  ratio.   While  Datex -Ohmeda (Helsinki,  
Finland) manufactures  a KMG  device that can be incorporated into the anesthesia work  station,  
there are no currently  available standalone KMG  devices.   Electromyography (EMG)  devices  
measure electrical  activity,  termed  compound muscle  action  potentials  (cMAPs)  following nerve 
stimulation  (typically  at the adductor pollicis  muscle  after ulnar nerve stimulation).   As EMG  
measures  cMAPs and does not require freely  moving thumbs for accurate measurements,  many  
experts  have referred  to this monitoring modality  as the “new  gold standard”.  TetraGraph  
(Senzime AB, Uppsala,  Sweden)  is a standalone EMG -based  device that is FDA-approved.   We 
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 9 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  have previously investigated  this device and presented  our findings at several  annual meetings  
such as International Anesthesia  Research  Society  (May  2018, May 2017, May 2013), the 
Society  for Technology in Anesthesia  (January  2018), and the American  Society  of 
Anesthesio logists (Octotober 2017, October  2012), European Society  of Anaesthesiology (June 
2018, June 2015) (17). Furthermore,  we have recently  submitted  abstracts  to the PostGraduate 
Assembly  in Anesthesiology in December  2018 as well as a manuscript describing a multi-
center,  volunteer study investigating  TetraGraph  versus  AMG -based  monitors.   Our  work  thus 
far has found this device to be easy to apply, reliable,  and able to provide comparable 
measurements  to other quantitative  monitors.    
Many clinicians default to the antiquated practice of subjective monitor ing (18, 19) , which refers 
to visual or tactile evaluation of the train -of-four (TOF) in response to neurostimulation provided 
by peripheral nerve stimulation. However, subjective evaluation may provide inaccurate 
information and assessment of full recovery compared to objective evaluation (20, 21) . A 
consensus statement by the international panel of experts in neuromuscular blockade issued in 2018 state that subjective evaluation is not predictive of adequate neuromuscular recovery, and is 
not sensitive to the presence of residual weakness. They state that their use should be abandoned 
in favor of objective monitoring, because after the TOFR recovers to >0.40, anesthesia providers 
can no longer detect the presence of fade by subjective evaluation and they may assume a 
complete recovery from neuromuscular blockade, despite the presence of minimal levels of 
NMB (16). It is worth highlighting that after tracheal extubation, even minimal degrees of 
residual block is  associated with impaired function o f respiratory and pharyngeal muscles , upper 
airway obstruction (22),hypoxemia (23) , and awareness during anesthesia (24)  
 
Utilizing  recommendations from  the Good Clinical  Practice (GCP)  Guidelines for monitoring  of 
neuromuscular function (25), we will compare visual  and electromyography assessments in 
response to train-of-four stimulation  of the ulnar nerve.  Specifically,   the time points of interest  
will include the onset of blockade following neuromuscular relaxant administration (Train-of-
four count =0), maintenance, especially during redosings of the neuromuscular agent, prior to 
reversal of blockade with sugammadex and every 20 seconds following reserval administration 
until adequate recovery (train -of-four ratio >0.9), and on arrival to PACU (T0,T5,T10).  
4.3 Risk s and Benefits  
• T
he benefits of using neuromuscular blockade monitoring devices:   
Early detection of optimal time for tracheal intubation; optimal management of intraoperative depth of neuromuscular block to facilitate surgical procedures; 
determination of appropriate time and dose of sugammadex reversal; and detection of 
residual neuromuscular blockade  
• The risks of using neuromuscular blockade monitoring devices:  
Slight discomfort when electrical stimulation is administered  in awake volunteers; 
however, our patients will be anesthetized, rendering this risk as extremely minor.

J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  6.4 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint of the study will be to estimate and describe the percent of agreement and 
the percent under or over estimation of the TOFC by the anesthesia provider compared with the 
TetraGraph  
6.5 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 The secondary endpoint is the incidence of postoperative residual weakness at the time of 
extubation.  
6.6 Identification of Source Data  
 The study data points will be recorded on the developed Case Report Forms (CRFs) by the study 
team members.  In addition to the data collected intraoperatively , several  intraoperative 
characteristics will also be extracted from the medical record ( Table 18.2
).  These will include 
type and total dose of NMBA used, time and dose of last NMBA administration, time and dose of specific reversal agent administration, time of tracheal extubation, and TOF ratio at the time 
of extubation (if available).

 Study D evice  
8.1 Description  
 
TetraGraph device is a FDA approved neuromuscular transmission monitor capable of 
measuring the depth of neuromuscular block in anesthetized patients who received 
neuromuscular blocking agents. TetraGraph uses EMG to measure the muscle action potentials that are generated in response to electrical neurostimulation  via skin (ECG) electrodes .  
TetraGraph data is recorded on the monitor’s built -in SD card, and all intraoperative data will be 
recorded and later downloaded for purposes of analysis. The recorded data do not contain PHI, 
only the date/time of recording , and any additional intraoperative interventions, such as the time 
of NMBA dose administration, time of antidote administration, time of extubation, etc .  These 
events are flagged in the monitor’s integrated SD card recordings.  
8.2 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 13 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  This is a  single- blinded investigation and all study participants are assigned to both standard of 
care and investigational device use in the operating room.  The randomization involves the use of 
dominant vs non- dominant arm.  
 
The randomization will be performed utilizing REDCap and assigned anesthesia clinical care 
team will be informed of patients’ assigned to guide them with the selection of the assigned 
treatment option.  
8.3 Masking/ Blinding of Study  
 
Anesthesia providers will be blinded to the TetraGraph values during the entire procedure  while 
the research assistant will remain unblended.  
 Study Procedures  
9.1 Visit 1  (Screening and Enrollment  up to the day of surgery ) 
 
• Review of medical record  
• Informed Consent  - Patients will be identified  during their preoperative appointment and 
introduced to a study; they will be provided with a copy of the consent document and 
information about the study. The consenting will take place after additional discussion on 
the day of surgery.  
9.2 Visit 2  (Randomization and Treatment  – day of surgery) 
 
• Elective surgical procedure as per standard of care  
• Anesthetic management will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist  as per 
standard of care practice.  
• Prior to induction of anesthesia, Tetragraph electrodes will be placed over the ulnar nerve and the thumb to measure the response of adductor pollis nerve. Randomization will be 
performed utilizing REDCap and involves the use of dominant vs non- dominant ar m 
• Following induction of anesthesia but prior to NMBA administration, baseline values will 
be recorded after calibration.  
• Anesthesia providers will be blinded to the TetraGraph values during the entire procedure.  
• After NMBA administration a set of measurements will be taken, and the researcher will ask the provider to give a subjective assessment of the TOF count based on the visual 
assessment following peripheral nerve stimulation of ulnar nerve with TetraGraph.  Each 
set of measurements will involve 2 stimulations 20 seconds apart.  We will record both objective measurements , but the provider will be asked to determine the level of block 
from the average of the two responses.  
• With every redosing of NMBA, measureme nts will be taken and the researcher will ask 
the provider to give a subjective assessment of the TOF count.    
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 14 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  • Near the conclusion of the operation, but prior to the reversal of NMBA, another set of 
measurements will be taken, and the researcher will ask the provider to give a subjective 
assessment of the TOF count or ratio.  
• After sugammadex administration, measurements will be taken every 20 seconds and the 
researcher will ask the provider to give a subjective assessment of the TOF count until 
the patient  is extubated.   
• Anesthesia providers will not be informed about the number of measurements to be made 
or other details about the protocol. They will be told that several TOF measurements 
would be requested during the case, and they will be instructed to use their clinical 
practice of visual assessment using TetraGraph. This is analogous to standard of care that 
utilizes a peripheral nerve stimulator to determine the level of blockade.  
• Each  neurostimulation with the TetraGraph  will be conducted simultaneous ly with 
research staff present, and the anesthesia provider observing the response to neurostimulation.  
• Following measurements obtained at these specified time intervals and assuming TOF 
ratio is >0.9, the device will be removed and the patient will proce ed along the standard 
recovery pathway.

The sample size calculation was estimated based on a paired t –test.  A total of 42 patients will 
give a power of 90% to detect a difference between provider -determine TOFC/TOFR and the 
device- determined TOFC/TOFR with a significance level o f 0,05.  (JMP Pro Software version 
14.0.0 [December 05, 2018]; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We used a standard deviation of 0.73 
which was determined in a previous study comparing tactile and visual assessments vs TOF -
Watch.  However, we will enroll 60 patients to take into account patient loss or missing data and 
will give a power of 95%.

J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  10.2 Statistical Methods  
 
10.3 Descriptive Statistics  
 
Analysis of agreement between subjective counts of the anesthesia provider and the EMG -based 
device measurements will be assessed using Bland -Altman. The limits of agreement are defined 
as bias ± 2 SD, where SD denotes the standard deviations of the differ ences.  Limits of 
agreement are interpreted as the reference range within which 95% of the differences will lie.  The bias and the limits of agreements surrounding the bias (± 2 SD) will be calculated with 95% 
confidence intervals.  Statistical significanc e will be defined as a p -value <0.05.   
  
10.4 Handling of Missing Data  
 
This is a prospective pilot study and therefore we do not anticipate any missing data.  In the 
event of any unexpected missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made; 
missing data will simply be treated as missing in the statistical analysis , and replacement 
participants will be enrolled to ac hieve the target accrual of n=60 participants . 
10.5 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
 
Each participant who goes through the surgery  and completes monitoring of residual 
neuromuscular blockade will be included in the primary analysis regardless of study withdrawal 
for any reason. In the event of any study withdrawals, in secondary analysis we will examine the sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of patients who withdrew.  
 Safety and Adverse Events  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Ser ious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion 
of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, or not part of an underlying

J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased 
frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
11.1.2  Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
11.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience 
• hospitalization  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
 and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor-investigator 
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially com promised the research data.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
11.1.4  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the follow-up period is defined as up to 10 minutes after arrival to PACU  or TOF 
ratio is > 0.9 (whichever occurs first) . 
11.1.5  Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensit y, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
11.1.6  Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor- investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse even t is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor- investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the sponsor-
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.

Page 17 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  11.1.7  Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalizatio n, nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:   
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the 
clinical investigator.  
 
11.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the study team  must seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events 
shoul d be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event section  of the electronic case report form (CRF ). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or  procedure results should recorded in the source document . 
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up , to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting 
Period  and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
11.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
 
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action 
necessary to protect the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet 
and log.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up 
and reporting required.  
11.3.1  Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB   
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non- UPIRTSOs 
according to the Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures.  Each participating site will report SAEs to 
their respective IRB or E thics Committee with copy of submission and review provided to the 
leading site. Should there be any SAEs at any of the participating sites;  the study team at that site 
will notify the primary site (Mayo Clinic in Florida) within 24 hours of learning of th e event.  
 Any serious adverse event (SAE) which the Principal Investigator has determined to be a 
UPIRTSO will be reported to the Mayo IRB as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days 
after the investigator first learns of the problem/event. 
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 18 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL   
The following i nformation will be collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the 
research database):  
• Study ID  
• Disease   
• The date the adverse event occurred  
• Description of the adverse event  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research device * 
• Determination if the adverse event was expected   
• The severity of the adverse event (severity scale described below **) 
• If any intervention was necessary  
• Resolution (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment)  
• Date of Resolution 
 
The sponsor -investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports 
need to be made to the IRB .  The sponsor -investigator will sign  and date the adverse event report 
when it is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs /UPIRTSO s will be reported to 
the IRB.  
 * Relationship Index  
 The relationship of an AE to the Investigational  Device is a clinical decision by the sponsor -
investigator (PI) based on all available information at the time of the completion of the e CRF and 
is graded as follows:  
 1. Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiolog y is 
unrelated to the use and proper application of study device.  
 
2. Unlikely : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship 
to use of the study device which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which use o f 
other devices , chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 3. Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to use of the study device but which could also be explained by concurr ent disease or 
use of other devices  or chemicals . 
 
4. Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to use of the study device, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or use of other 
devices  or chemicals . 
 5. Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  the use of the study 
device.  
 
** Severity Scale  
 
Subjective vs. Objective   Version 1. 1 
  13/May/2021 
Page 19 of 28 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  The maximum intensity of an AE during a day should be graded according to the definitions 
below and recorded in details as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a 
number of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  
 1. Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with 
patient’s  daily activities.  
 2. Moderate: AEs typically introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern  to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
 
3. Severe: AEs interrupt a patient's usual daily activity and traditionally require  systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
11.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and sa fety-
monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting” ).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
12.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
12.2 Source Documents  
Source data i s all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents and data records 
include: hospital records and any forms completed specifically for this study.

a REDCap database that will be designed by an Investigator .  Access to the REDCap database 
will be limited to the Principal Investigator, Investigators, Study Team members, and 
Statistician.  
12.7 Data Quality Assurance  
 
Once the study is completed the Principal Investigator will randomly select 3 participants and 
compare the data documented in the EHR with what is entered into the REDCap database.  If 
there is any discrepancy, the Principal Investigator and/or Investigators will c ross- reference all 
60 patients to ensure accuracy.  
12.8 Data Clarification Process  
 
For any data query the Principal Investigator and Investigators will meet to clarify the data 
queried and make corrections based on consensus.

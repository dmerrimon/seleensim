1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This single arm, multi -site pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting 
and adherence to  a 12 week home -based exercise intervention to  be conducted in  
men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving  
androgen deprivation  therapy  (ADT) . Thirty  patients  will be enrolled, with the 
expectation that 20-25 will complete  all follow -up measures.  
 
The secondary objective of this study are to compare the change s in body 
composition (e.g., percent body fat, bone mineral content, lean mass), muscle 
strength,  cardiovascular and overall physical function , and patient reported 
outcom es (quality of life (QoL), fatigue, depression)  before and after the 12 week 
exercise intervention  as a means of attenuating the declines in these outcomes 
typically seen with ADT . We hypothesize that exercise training will improve (post 
value > baseline v alue) strength and cardiovascular and physical function while 
body composition will remain unchanged. Finally, the effects of exercise on 
markers of inflammation and their relationship with changes in physical function 
and body composition  will also be examined as ex ploratory outcomes . Data from 
this study will be used to  determine feasibility (successfully able to recruit  these 
individuals)  and adherence to  a home -based exercise intervention in men with 
mCRPC receiving ADT  as well as the ability to  refine the exercise intervention 
with plans to  evaluate  it in future larger trials in this population.  
1.2 Prostate Cancer  
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the second 
leading cause of cancer related  deaths in men in the United States. An estimated 
220, 800 men in the U.S will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 201 6 with an 
estimated 27,540 prostate cancer related deaths ( Cancer Facts & Figures 2015).  
Since prostate cancer is stimulated to grow by the male hormone , testosterone, 
medications that shut off the normal production of testosterone referred to as ADT 
represent the first-line (primary) treatment for patients with advanced disease.   
 
Unlike cancers arising from other organs such as lung and pancreas cancer, the life 
expectancy for patients with advanced prostate cancer is measured in years.  Thus, 
side effects of treatment that impact on quality of life are extremely important to 
consider in men with prostate cancer. Loss of testosterone is associated with many 
side effects including those related to negative changes in body composition 
(increase fat mass, loss of muscle mass) (Galvao et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2002), 
male menopause symptoms including hot flashes, loss of sexual drive, 
osteoporosis, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Braga -Basaria 
et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2002, 2006), and severe fatigue.  These side -effects, if not 
treated, may contribute to the development of other co -morbidities as well as lead 
to an inability to function at pre -cancer levels with the potential for a major impact 
on quality of life. ) (Galvao et  al., 2008; Smith et al., 2002)

2 1.2.1 Androgen Deprivation Therapy  (ADT)  
Primary  ADT usually refers to surgical castration (orchiectomy) or medica l 
castration using a gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.  
The onset of ADT is associated with a number of adverse events, including loss of 
muscle strength, altered body composition, higher fatigue, poor physical function, 
and QoL (Galvao et al. 2008, Hanson and Hurley 2011) . Prostate cancer that 
progresses on ADT is referred to as castration resistant, despite its continued 
reliance on androgens.   This reliance is evidenced by the benefits reported with the 
androgen synthesis inhib itor, abiraterone acetate, and the potent androgen receptor 
inhibitor, enzalutamide , in metastatic CRPC  (de Bon o et al. 2011 ; Ryan  et al.  2013 ; 
Scher  et al.  2012 ; Beer  et al.  2014 ). Based on these data, abiraaterone and 
enzalutamide represent the  standard of care in men with mCRPC  in the pre - and 
post-chemotherapy settings . However, additional androgen suppression beyond 
castration (sometimes referred to as androgen annihilation (Rove and Crawford 
2013) or “super -castration” (Pezaro  et al.   2013) may exacerbate the symptoms of 
primary ADT . For example, 7.5 months of abiraterone alone  significantly  
decreased lean mass at 6 months  by -4.3% , particularly in those with a body mass 
index (BMI) >30. While these additional castration agents (inclu ding but not 
limited to abiraterone and enzalutamide) are prolonging survival during mCRPC, 
it becomes increasingly important to examine ways to mitigate the ADT -related 
side effects such that both quantity and quality of life are maintained at the highest  
possible levels.  
1.2.2 Exercise Training  in Prostate Cancer  
One possible remedy  for the complications associated with ADT  use in  mCRPC 
patients  is to prescribe exercise  training . Exercise in men on primary  ADT  who 
were not yet castration resistant  has been shown to improve muscle mass, strength, 
and physical function (Galvao et al. 2007, Galvao et al. 2010, 2009; Newton et al., 
2009)  but has yet to be examined as a potential complementary therapy in mCRPC . 
Specifically , Galvao and colleagues (2010) conducted a randomized controlled trial 
of twice weekly resistance (weights and abdominal crunches) and aerobic exercise 
(15-20 minutes of cycling and walking/jogging at 65 to 80% maximum heart rate) 
for 12 weeks versus usual care in men on ADT for at least  2 months prior to 
enrollment. The study report ed significant difference s between the two groups  for 
muscle strength , lean mass, and sever al physical function tasks , all favoring the 
exercise group. Using the SF -36 QoL tool, significant improvements were reported  
for general health and fatigue, again favoring the exercise group. No adverse events 
were reported secondary to the exercise inter ventions, or to the testing procedures.  
More recently, a resistance training study in prostate cancer patients with bone 
metastases showed similar findings with gains in strength, physical function, and 
lean mass all favoring the exercise group (Cormie et al. 2013). No adverse events 
were reported in this study as well. Considering the current evidence of the positive 
effects of exercise in men with earlier stage prostate cancer  and also those with 
more advanced disease , it is possible that the same benefit s may also be achievable 
in mCRPC . Since many aspects of the proposed study are model ed after Galvao  
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Hanson   UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February  15, 2017  
 
3 and Cormie ’s earlier work in prostate patients, the safe use of and execution of the 
current protocol by mCRPC patients is highly expected.  In addition, the American 
Cancer Society recently convened a group of experts to address physica l exercise 
in cancer survivors  (Schmitz et al. 2010) . These guidelines r ecommend  exercise in 
cancer survivors, including those with bone metastases  provided app ropriate 
support is available during exercise, and attention paid to issues such as balance  
(Rock et al . 2012) .  
 
In addition to these data, a systematic review of 10 studies evaluating the impact of 
exercise in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT was recently published 
(Gardner et al 2013). The majority of study participants (>80%) did not have 
metastatic disease, although  patients with non -bone metastases were included in 
some of the trials.  The authors of this review concluded that exercise is safe i n 
prostate cancer, and leads to similar benefits as those reported in otherwise healthy 
adults.   
1.3 Purpose and Rationale  
The purpose of our trial  is to evaluate the feasibility and adherence to a home -based 
12 week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients re ceiving ADT . We will also 
examine if a home -based exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, body 
composition, physical function, cardiopulmonary function fatigue, and patient 
reported outcomes (fatigue, depression, QoL). Finally, we will also  explore the 
effects of the exercise training on biomarkers of inflammation -hormonal status  and 
their potential association with changes in body composition, physical function , 
fatigue, depression, and QoL .  
 
Most exercise studies in cancer patients have been c onducted within exercise 
facilities , and ones conducted in prostate cancer report adherence rates >90%, 
(Galvao et al. 2006, 2009; Hanson et a. 2013), even in men with bone metastases 
(Cormie et al. 2013). However, this limits the benefits of exercise to i ndividuals 
who live in close proximity to sites where these programs are offered. Recently, 
there are several  reports on home -based exercise interventions. Findings from these 
studies have shown good adherence in addition to improvements in various 
outcomes such as cardiorespiratory function, fatigue, QoL and avoidance of weight 
gain and increases in body fat (Ligibel, et al. 2010; {Pinto, 2005 #78} , et al. 2007; 
Pinto, et al. 2005). This marks an important next step in expanding the number 
patients who can successful access exercise and is particularly relevant for 
advanced diseases (i.e. mCR PC) where patients may travel long distances to be 
seen in clinic but would not be able to regularly attend exercise training programs. 
As the North Carolina Cancer Hospital is a tertiary referral center, this limits the 
number of mCRPC patients who are lo cal. The regimen to be used in the present 
study will include strength training and aerobic exercise 2 -4x times per week, 
building up both components over time, following recommendations from the 
American College of Sports Medicine and utilizing a similar home -based exercise 
training program employed by Spector et al. (2014) in African America breast 
cancer patients. As relatively few studies to date have examined home -based 
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL

February  15, 2017  
 
4 training program in more advanced disease states, feasibility programs are an 
impor tant next step in expanding the outreach of exercise interventions. In addition, 
adaptations will be  made throughout the training program to accommodate 
potential physical limitations and to account for the individual training response  
with the intent of m aximizing feasibility and adherence and while simultaneously 
attempting to improve physical and psychological characteristics that are adversely 
affected during treatment for metastatic prostate cancer .  
 
1.4 Future Work  
Given the relative paucity of home base d interv entions in the mCRPC population, 
this work will determine if recruiting these men for exercise interventions is 
feasible. Moreover, it will also provide insight if the exercise adherence rates 
approach the levels seen in laboratory based exercise i nterventions.  With this 
information in hand, the proposed project will provide the preliminary data to 
justify a randomized control trial to further investigate the role of home -based 
exercise in these patients. Finally, as future randomized control trials  will likely 
need to be multi -site, similar projects are being developed at separate sites as 
parallel trials (Duke University, University of Alabama Birmingham) to 
demonstrate collaboration between these institutes and to be in position to generate 
the ne cessary accrurual numbers for the randomized trials.

7 4.2.1 Overseeing Site  
At UNC, r ecruiting prostate cancer  patie nts undergoing ADT  +/- additional 
hormonal therapies  will be done  in close collaboration and with the support of 
physicians  (see co -investigators)  from the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer 
Center  (LCCC) . In 2015 , LCCC  saw approximately 485 prostate cancer , of which 
~125 were mCRPC. Over the past 3 -year period, 124 men (16%) have enrolled in 
various cooperative group, pharmaceutical  sponsored, or investigator -initiated 
studies. All eligible patients  will be enrolled  and track reasons for drop out, should 
they not complete all aspects of study.  
4.2.2 Participating Sites  
At Wake Fo rest, study activities will be led by Dr Rhonda Bitting , an Assi stant 
Professor of Medicine in  Hematology and Oncology  and Alexander Lucas, PhD, a 
Research Fellow in the School of Medic ine. 
 
All p atients  from all sites  will be requested to maintain their pre -study level of 
physical activity and diet (Appendix 0) during the duration of the study  beyond the 
addition of the prescribed exercises . A 24 hour dietary recall the day before the 
baseline and post -training assessments will be completed to estimate total caloric 
intake  at each time point  and to help ensure that patients have eaten similarly  prior 
to each testing  session . This will help to ensure the validity of the secondary 
outcomes  and also the testing assessments themselves . Physical activity levels will 
be screened during the introduction and consent process, with thresholds for 
inclusio n defined in 3.1.6.   
4.3 Exercise Intervention  
The exercise intervention will consist of a combination of aerobic (cardiovascular 
exercise) and strength  training (emphasis of the intervention) ~3 times per week for 
12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour.  The home -based exercise intervention 
will begin with a low intensity  walking and resistance (ie, strength) training,  which 
progressed to follow the previously tested and successful  home -based program 
demonstrated by Spector et al. (2014) [and designed by Co -Investigator Battaglini] . 
The combined aerobic and resistance training protocol  will follow the  guidelines 
set forth by the American College of  Sports Medicine.  The progressive 
standardized aerobic  exercise plan will involve walki ng. Resistance training  
included upper, lower, and abdominal core strengthening  exercises. Upper body 
strength exercises included lateral  and front raises, wall or modified floor push -ups, 
chest press,  bent row, arm curls, and tricep s stretches. Lower body  strength 
exercises included chair squats, chair leg raises,  hamstring curls, and calf raises. 
The four core strengthening exercises were the bridge, crunches, reverse crunches, 
and obliques. U pper and lower body exercises w ill be  done  with elastic resistance 
band s. All exercises will be demonstrated to the participants during their initial 
exercise testing session. Participants will be  also instructed to  perform stretching 
exercises of major muscle groups after  the walking component of their exercise 
program. Partic ipants  will be given an exercise training workbook  that included 
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Hanson   UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February  15, 2017  
 
8 weekly exercise logs, the exercise training  plan, illustrations of resistance exercises 
and stretches  (Appendix 1) . Participants will be given  activity monitors to wear 
which will record hear t rate, activity minutes and calories expended (these are small 
wrist watch -like devises that are  easily operated). This information will be recorded 
by the participants and regularly synced with a computer so that weekly exercise 
totals (number of aerobic  sessions, amount of time per session) along with the 
exercise intensity can be determined . To stimulate a training effect following  
recommendations from the American College of Sports  Medicine, from week 1 to 
completion of the study, walking  will be incre ased from 15 to 30 minutes and 
intensity from 40% to  65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be  
used for the  resist ance training. Participants will be  instructed to perform  12 to 15 
repetitions per exercise beginning with the light - or medium-strength band and 
progressing to the heaviest  strength band as ability permitted. Once a participant 
can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase 
resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume  incre ased from 1 set 
per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12 (see table below).

To facilitate the engagement of the patients and to help with adherence, weekly 
contact will be made by a member of the research team. This will involve either a 
phone call , Skype,  or an email contact, based upon the patient’s preference.  This 
follow up will allow for answering of any questions related to the study, including 
proper exercise technique, activity levels, or u sing/syncing the wearable device.  
4.4 Study Measures  
All testing procedures will be completed at baseline and 12 weeks after exercise 
training.  All testing will be completed in a single baseline or post -training session 
lasting between 2-3 hours , including res t breaks . Pilot testing of the protocol has 
shown that these tests can be completed in this time frame. Standardized rest 
periods have been included and the testing order has been designed to allow for 
patients that meet the inclusion criteria to be able to perform all tests within a single 
session. The single session will also be more convenient for participants travelling 
longer distances to come to the UNC  or Wake Fo rest Cancer Hospital s, which may 
help with the primary outcome (feasibility).

Patient reported outcome questionnaires will be given out prior for the patients to 
complete at home and to bring into the respective testing sessions.  
4.4.1 Physical Function  
• Overall functionality will be assessed using standard simulated activates 
of daily living (Hanson et al. 2009, 201 3), including the 6m usual and rapid 
walk tests, the timed up and go test, chair stands, and stair climb tasks  and 
400m  walk test  (Appendix 2) . 
• The short physical performance battery (5 chair stands, 8 foot usual walk, 
and side by side, tandem, an d semi -tandem 10 second balance tests) will 
also determined (Guralnik et al. 1994).  
• Body Composition to measure lean and fat mass and bone mineral density 
will be completed using dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA). Both 
total body and regional scans wi ll be performed.  
• Muscle size and quality of the quadriceps muscles will be measured using 
portable ultra -sound technology to determine cross -sectional area (size) 
and echo intensity (quality). The ultrasound CSA measurement will be 
performed on the right Vastus Lateralis  via manual movement of the 
transducer slowly and continually from lateral to medial along an upper leg 
template suitable for each subject. The purpose of the template is to ensure 
precise measurement and reproduction of the same muscle are a for the 
comparison of pre - and post -intervention CSA images. In the 
musculoskeletal mode of the device, gain and frequency will be 
standardized between tests and across subjects in order to optimize image 
quality.  Depth will be adjusted between particip ants to ensure both deep 
and superficial fascia remain visible in the field -of-view. Hypoallergenic 
water -soluble transmission gel (1 - 2 oz.)  will be applied to the skin to 
reduce possible near field artifacts and enhance acoustic coupling 
(Aquasonic 100,  Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA).  
LogicView™ software (General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA) 
will be used to generate real -time panoramic cross -sectional images of the 
muscles. Three scans will be performed and an average of the thr ee will be 
recorded in order to reduce the likelihood of technician error. Following 
each scan, each image will be reviewed to ensure appropriate image 
quality. If a scan is does not produce a clean image of CSA, additional

10 scans will be performed. All ult rasound imaging analyses will be 
performed using Image -J software (version 1.46r, National Institutes of 
Health, USA). Prior to analysis, each image will be individually scaled 
from area in pixels to centimeters using the straight -line function.  CSA of 
VLs will be determined using the polygon function by selecting a region of 
interest that includes as much of the muscle as possible without any 
surrounding fascia.   
• Muscle function in the forms of muscle strength, power, and endurance 
will be assessed using  several different techniques. Upper and lower body 
muscle strength will be assessed on the chest press, knee extension, and leg 
press. Patients will be familiarized prior to undergoing baseline testing to 
minimize the risk of injury and to improve the val idity of the testing 
outcome. Patients will complete sets of a single repetition with increasing 
resistance until they are no longer able to move the weight throughout the 
full range of motion (Hanson et al. 2009, 2013 ). The maximal amount of 
resistance li fted is their maximal strength. Muscle endurance will be 
determined using a repetitions test. Participants will complete as many 
consecutive repetitions as possible at 70% of their maximal strength for the 
chest and leg press (Hanson et al. 201 3). The tota l number of successful 
repetitions will be used to determine endurance capabilities. Knee extensor 
muscle power, which is affected by both force and velocity, will be 
assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Patients will be asked to extend 
their leg as quic kly as possible against a fixed resistance load to determine 
power and rate of force development (Appendix 3) .  
• Cardiopulmonary function (VO 2 peak) will be assessed using a graded 
exercise test on a treadmill. Patients will begin the test walking slowly on 
the treadmill and every two minutes, the grade and speed of the treadmill 
will be increased in a progressive manner until fatigue occurs.  Respiratory 
gases will be collected throughout the test and analyzed using a metabolic 
cart to determine oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production. The 
maximal oxygen uptake that is recorded will be used as a marker of aerobic 
fitness  (Appendix 4) .  
4.4.2 Quality of Life  (QoL)  
QoL questionnaires  will be completed at baseline and after exercise training.  
• Fatigue (FACIT - Fatigue, Appendix 5). Fatigue will be measure using the 
FACIT -Fatigue, a 1 page form that uses a rating scale that goes from 0 (no 
fatigue) t o 10 (severe fatigue). It assesses the patient’s fatigue levels in the 
last 7 days. It also measures how usual activities, performing work, 
walking, relationship, and enjoyment of life are affected by fatigue.  
• Depression will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS; Appendix 6), a concise, self -administered 1 page form that 
categorizes anxiety and depression.   The total score goes from 0 -21, and 
scores are categorized from minimal to severe depres sion/anxiety.  
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Hanson   UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February  15, 2017  
 
11 • QoL will be measured using the Functional Assesment of Cancer Therapy -
Prostate (FACT -P; Appendix 7).   The FACT -P is composed of both multi -
item scales and single -item measures. These include physical, social, 
emotional, and functional well -being, along with an assessment of prostate -
specific health status. five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global 
health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales score from 
0-4 and and a high scale score represents a higher respon se level.  
 
We recognize that any changes in QoL , depression, and fatigue  will be 
difficult to attribute to exercise alone.  
4.4.3 Laboratory Measures  
Fasted b lood draws  will occur  at baseline and after exercise training.  
• Select laboratory measures (testosterone,  lipid profiles, prostate specific 
antigen, stromal cell derived factor (SDF) -1α) and inflammatory markers 
(IL-6, IL -1β, IL -8, IL-10 and IFN -) will be measured using Enzyme -
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) from serum and plasma collected 
in the fasted , resting  state at the beginning and end of the exercise 
intervention  using analysis procedures appropriate for exercise studies 
(Hackney & Viru 2008) . Any excess serum/blood  remaining after protocol -
dictated studies are complete will be destroyed.   
4.5 Removal of Patients from Protocol  
Participants will be removed from the study  intervention  if they indicate they  no 
longer wish to participate and if they are not able to complete the exercise 
intervention due to disease/treatment complications. Additionally, subjects will be 
removed if their physician -oncologist request that their patient is excluded from the 
study for any medical or emotional concerns.  
 
In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue the protocol intervention, the 
patient should be asked if  he may still be contacted for further  scheduled study 
assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in  both the 
medical records and in the study data collection forms.  
4.6 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study all efforts should be made to 
complete and report study  assessments as thoroughly as possible. The investigator 
should contact the patient or a  responsible relative by telephone or through a 
personal visit to establish as completely as  possible the reason for  the study 
withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the  patient’s study 
withdrawal should be made with an explanation of why the patient is  withdrawing 
from the study. If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an  adverse 
event, the principal specific event will be recorded on study data collection forms.

12 5.0 EXPECTED RISKS/ UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS /DATA 
AND SAFETY MONITORING  
5.1 Expected Risks  
5.1.1 Exercise  
There should be no psychological or physiological harm caused by the research, 
and thus this will not cause  the patient any emotional or physical loss. In the 
unlikely event of injury during the fitness assessments and the exercise portion of 
this study, s uch as muscle distensions and joint trauma, medical professionals on 
the research team will provide the appropriate care. Also, due to the stringent 
criteria for participation in the study, only subjects deemed capable by their 
oncologists will be enrolled  in the study.  
5.1.2 Whole Body D XA Scan  
The amount of radiation from exposure to a DXA  scan is low, 0.008 mSv (0.8 
mrem), equivalent to the radiation exposure everyone receives in one day from 
background radiation.  
5.1.3 Ultrasound  
There are no anticipated safety con cerns associated with the use of ultrasound.  
5.2 Unanticipated Problems  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems  involving risks to study subjects 
refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequ ency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied;  
• Is related or possi bly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the 
research than was previously known or  recognized.  
5.3 Reporting  
Any unanticipated problem  that occurs during the conduct of this study and that 
meets at least  the first two criteria listed in  section 5.3  must be reported to the UNC 
IRB (overseeing site) using the IRB’s web -based reporting system.

13 6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Study Design  
This study will recruit patients with metastatic CRPC to undergo a home -based  
exercise intervention in order to e stablish  feasibility in this patient population .  
Secondary objectives include evaluating i ts impact on change s in physical function , 
body composition, muscle function, cardiopulmonary function, fatigue, depression, 
quality of life, and biomarkers . Evaluations will be done at  baseline and  after the 
12-week intervention. I t is hypothe sized that the exercise intervention will increase 
function relatively to baseline in these men .  
6.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Previous exercise intervention studies have shown that  attrition rates in healthy 
controls are between 20 -30% (Hanson et al. 2009; Wal ts et al. 2008) . Surprisingly, 
attrition rates are lower in prostate cancer  patients on ADT at between 2 -10% 
(Hanson et al. 201 3; Galvao et al. 2006, 2011) . However, prostate patients with 
bone metastases experienced higher drop out rates ( 25% (Cormie et al. 2013)). 
Because no study has examined the effects of exercise on metastatic CRPC patients, 
we want to confirm that patients will participate  and complete pre/post study 
measures.  We anticipate that recruiting 30 men should yield a final sample size of 
20-25 subjects.  The table below shows the percentage, along with exact 95% 
binomial confidence interval for possible results .  If we retain 2 0/30 patients, o ur 
fesibility estimate will be 67%, with a 95% CI ranging from 47% -83%. 
 
% n/N Estimate (95% CI)  
50% (15/30)  50.0% (31.3%,68.7%)  
60% (18/30)  60.0% (40.6%,77.3%)  
67% (20/30)  66.7% (47.2%,82.7%)  
70% (21/30)  70.0% (50.6%,85.3%)  
80% (24/30)  80.0% (61.4%,92.3%)  
83% (25/30)  83.3% (65.3%,94.4%)  
90% (27/30)  90.0% (73.5%,97.9%)  
100%  (30/30)  100.0% (88.4%,100.0%)  
 
For seconadary objectives comparing changes over time, a  sample size of 2 5 will 
have 80% power to detect a n effect size of 0.584 using a paired  t-test with a 0.050 
two-sided significance level.   For example, for the 400m walk test - This effect size 
may be seen if the difference from pre to post if -5 seconds with a standard deviation 
is 8.56 seconds . If only 20 patients per group complete the post measures, there will 
be 80% power to detect an effect size of 0. 66, which may be seen if the mean 
difference is 5.65  with a common standard deviation of 8.56.

14  
Accrual of these patients will occur over the span of 24 months. Should sufficient 
recruitment (~30 men) not be obtained in that time period, the research team may 
conclude that exercise interventions in this population and setting appear not to be 
feasible.  
6.3 Data Analysis Plans   
Descriptive statistics  including  means, standard deviations, medians, ranges, and 
percentages, will be used  to report on all measures  at baseline and post intervention  
and changes in measures  over time. Changes in continuous measures will be 
compared between groups using two group t -tests or Fisher’s Exact tests for 
categorical variables.   
 
Associations of changes in biomarkers with changes in physical function or body 
composition measures will be explored using correlation coefficients.  Associations 
of other measures will be explored u sing two group t -tests for continuous and 
categorical variables or Fisher’s Exact tests for two categorical variables.   
 
As sample size permits, analyses will be repeated with stratification based on  
treatment type , treatment  duration , or age .  This will be purely exploratory.  
 
All analysis will be performed by the statistician of record.  
6.4 Data Management /Auditing   
Data will be managed the PI and his designated staff, and it will be entered into an 
REDC cap database designed by the PI’s staff, with inpu t from the statistician of 
record. Co-investigators  Lucas and Bitting  at Wake Forest University  will access 
REDCap for secure data entry.  As an investigator initiated study, this trial will also 
be audited by the Lineberger Cancer Center audit committee every six or twelve 
months, depending on the participation of affiliate sites.  
7.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
   
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, patient will  be asked to give 
verbal consent so that  the medical history screening can be completed over the 
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL

February  15, 2017  
 
15 phone.  At the initial visit, patients will  be given a full explanation of the study and 
will be given the opportunity to review  the consent form. Each consent form must 
include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and 
local or stat e regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the 
patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications 
of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate 
in the stu dy by signing an IRB -approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion.  
7.2 Required D ocumentation  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be 
placed on file  at the University of North Carolina.  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed 
consent  
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any 
associate investigators who will be involved in the study  
• A copy of the IRB -approved consent form  
7.3 Registration Procedures  
All patients will be registered with Oncore™ by the Study Coordinator /PI.  This 
will allow the cancer center to track accrual onto this important trial.  Contact Paul 
Jones (paul_e_jones@med.unc.edu) for any questions on Oncore, and for Oncore 
training.  
7.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for th e protection, safety, 
and well -being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.   
7.4.1 Emergency Modifications  
Investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, th e protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB approval.   
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification form 
must be completed  by PI/UNC Research Personnel  within five (5) business days of 
making the change.   
7.4.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria 
of this study requires the approval of the UNC Principal Investigator and the UNC 
IRB as the overseeing site .  
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Hanson   UNIVERSITY  OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February  15, 2017  
 
16 7.4.3 Othe r Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by the 
Principa l Investigator and the UNC IRB.  According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol 
deviation  is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan 
or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more resear ch 
participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs without  prior approval from the Principal 
Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore®, and 
report to any sponso r or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with 
their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time 
of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel within one 
(1) week  of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online 
mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
7.5 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated 
and documented by the Principal Investigator.  It should also be noted that when an 
amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk 
to the patient, a revised consent form might be required.   
 
The written amendment, and if required the amen ded consent form, must be sent to 
UNC’s  IRB for approval prior to implementation.   
7.6 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or 
queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
LCCC 1613   CONFIDENTIAL

17 logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB 
correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction 
of the clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation 
pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study 
investiga tor.  In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and 
marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last 
approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three 
years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.  
7.7 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical tria l at the 
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally 
overseeing the treatment of all study patients.  The Principal Investigator must 
assure that all study site personnel, including sub -investigators and other study staff 
members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and 
guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  
 
The Principal Invest igator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring 
that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. 
Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal Investigator will 
provide access to  his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of 
data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the 
Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature to verify the accuracy 
of the data.

 Background and Rationale:  Truvada®, is an oral pill comprised of two anti -retroviral compounds, 
emtricitabine (FTC) and teno fovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) . Gilead Sciences reported a total of nearly 100,00 
individuals in the US starting Truvada for  pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) between the years 2012 -2016 1, and 
this number is growing in the US and globally.  Adherence to the one pill per day regimen is crucial for its 
effectiveness in reducing the risk for sexu al transmission of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection by 
90%, and by 70% from injection drug use 2. Two landmark safety and effectiveness trials which supported the 
FDA approval of Truvada for PrEP were the iPrEX trial, which investigated Truvada use in HIV -negative men 
or transgender women, and the Partners PrEP trial, conducted in serod iscordant couples 3, 4. Both showed 
Truvada reduced risk of HIV infection by 42% (iPrEX) and 72% (Partners PrEP),  noting that risk reduction was 
highly correlated with drug adherence.  Another important study supporting PrEP was the TDF2 trial, which 
showed an HIV risk reduction of 62% 5. Although other clinical studies did not show efficacy, the results 
correlating poor drug efficacy wi th low plasma drug levels did confirm the importance of adherence 6, 7. 
Adherence measured by self -report did not correlate with effectiveness 6, 7. Although adherence is key to 
effectiveness, physicians and other health care providers (HCPs) do not have objective tools to monitor drug 
adherence and be able to tailor counselling to the actual needs of their patients and clients. The evid ence 
supporting the association between adherence and effectiveness is strong, but only objective assessment of 
adherence is reliable and correlates with effectiveness. The scientific premise supporting our work is based on 
this evidence, as well as the ab sence of a point -of-care objective diagnostic test for drug adherence. The most 
objective measure of adherence currently available to detect and quantify drug levels in plasma is liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). This method, howev er, requires a specialized lab and 
does not qualify as a point -of-care (POC)  test. Therefore, our project is aimed at filling this gap by developing 
and validating an aptasensor (aptamer -based biosensor), capable of detecting tenofovir (TFV) in various 
biological fluids at a point -of-care/clinic with a simple -to-use procedure, which will empower HCPs to provide 
real-time adherence feedback with each prescription renewal. Ultimately, real -time monitoring of adherence 
will lead to better counselling, resultin g in higher effectiveness and improved success rates for treatment and 
prevention of HIV infection.   
Given the importance of adherence to the efficacy of TDF/FTC it is of clinical significance to have a reliable 
metric for adherence levels. Self -reporting of adherence, a non -invasive and s imple method of assessment  does 
not reliably correlate with effectiveness and blood serum levels. Currently, the most objective measure of 
adherence available is to detect and quantify plasma levels of tenofovir diphosphate  (TFV -DP), the active 
metabolite of TDF, using LC-MS/MS . Although this method of quantification is reliable, it requires a specialized 
lab and equipment which comes at a significant cost and does not qualify as POC  test. Other recently developed  
methods of measuring TFV levels in urine, ELISA and lateral flow assays, have shown promise, but are limited 
by inadequate sensitivity to detect levels observed in plasma and the inability to distinguish high adherence from 
white coat effects. Th e lack of  a POC test to measure adherence leaves a critical gap for physicians and other 
HCPs  when tailoring counseling to improve adherence and ultimately HIV prevention of their patients and 
communities.  
As such, there is an opportunity to evaluate a new method of measuring adherence in a reliable, objective, and 
cost-effective manner. Aptamers are DNA - or RNA -based ligands capable of binding practically any molecular 
target with high specificity, including small molecules suc h as antiretroviral drugs 8. Aptamers have advantages 
over antibodies. They are more stable and made through a process that is more econo mical and reproducible, 
which increases the aptamer’s potential  capability of being more specific than its antibody counterpart.  
Therefore, aptamers are being used as capture molecules for biosensor platforms, which are becoming smaller 
than previous model s, more portable, more sensitive and quantitative (rivaling LC -MS/MS), require less sample 
volume, and simpler to use. Therefore, aptamer -based biosensors or “aptasensors”, have great potential for real -

 time therapeutic drug monitoring.  We will be utilizin g a previously validated DNA aptamer specific for TFV 
and applying it to a biosensor platform.  
This study will focus on determining the sensitivity and specificity of the TFV aptasensor and assess its ability 
to distinguish TFV concentrations associated wi th low and high adherence using biological fluids collected 
from women taking TDF/FTC at different dosing regimens.  
Objectives:  
Compare plasma, urine, and vaginal fluid  TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with those values 
quantitated by LC -MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value ( NPV ), and positive predictive value ( PPV). 
Primary Objective s:  
 Compare plasma TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with those values quantitated by 
LC-MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, NPV  and 
PPV 
 Determine if the TFV aptasensor  can detect differences in  the plasma TFV concentrations between 
high and low adherence dosing regimens and compare the mean difference to the difference calculated 
from values generated by LC -MS/MS  
Secondary Objectives:  
 Compare urine TFV concentration measured by the aptasensor with those values quantitated by LC -
MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and 
PPV 
 Determine if the TFV aptasensor can detect differences in the urine concentrations of TFV between 
high and low adherence dosing regimens and whether these levels correlate with adherence  
 Compare vaginal fluid TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with preclinical 
determinations of the range of detectable TFV levels and the aptasensor’s limit of detection

  Determine if  differences in adherence dosing regimens can be correlated to differences in vaginal fluid 
TFV levels  
 
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoints:  
 TFV concentrations in plasma at baseline (pre -dose), 24 hours, 7 days and  14 days after dosing  
Secondary Endpoints:  
 TFV concentrations in urine and vaginal fluid  at baseline (pre -dose), 24 hours,  7 days, 14 days

Study Design:  
This pilot , prospective, randomized study will  screen approximately 20 healthy, non -pregnant, HIV negative, 
premenopausal women (aged 18 -50) at Eastern Virginia Medical School ( EVMS ) who are not at risk of 
pregnancy and are at low risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  in order to have approximately 14 
women complete  all study visits . This study will examine the plasma , urine, and vaginal fluid  from women in 
two dosing regimens  of oral tablets: High adherence (HA): TDF /FTC (300/2 00 mg) , 7 pills per week versus  
low adherence (LA):  TDF/FTC (300/200mg), 3 pills per week . Participants will be randomized to regimen  as 
per the following schemata:  
Randomization Assignments  
Regimen  N Dose  
LA 7 TDF/FTC  (300/2200 mg), 3 pills/week . Total of 6 pills 
HA 7 TDF/FTC (300/200 mg) , 7 pills/week .  Total of 14 pills  
 
Participants will undergo the low adherence  (LA)  regimen  or a high adherence  (HA)  regimen  for two weeks , 
consisting of  5 visits.  
Visit 1: At screening/enrollment, volunteers will be consented and undergo procedures to confirm they are 
eligible to continue in the study. Eligible participants will proceed to Visit 2 . 
Visit 2 : Baseline blood,  urine, and vaginal fluid will be collected.  Participants will be randomized to dosing 
regimen and the fir st dose of TDF/TFC will be ingested in the clinic . Participants w ill be instructed to take 
subsequent doses at home.  
Dosing Contact: Participants will be sent reminder text messages to facilitate dosing occurring at the same 
time of day. Participants will text message the study coordinator to confirm ingestion of tablet .  If the 
participant does not respond to a text within approximately 4 – 6 hours after it is sent, a reminder text will be 
sent. 
Visits  3 - 5: Participants will return at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after visit 2 for the pre-dose collection of 
blood, ur ine, and vaginal samples.

Page 8 of 45 
 Follow Up Contact:  A final follow up site contact will be conducted approximately 1 – 2 weeks after the last 
visit to ask the participant about adverse events and concomitant medications. The participant will be exited 
unless there are symptoms that require follow up.  
Number of patients (planned):  
Approximately 20 women may be consented and undergo assessment procedures in order to have approximately 
14 women who meet eligibility c riteria complete the study. All 14 women will be randomly assigned to undergo 
either LA dosing or HA dosing . All randomized participants  will be included in the analysis.  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Healthy, non -pregnant, premenopausal, HIV -uninfected women aged 18 -50 (showing regular menstrual 
cycles), with a BMI ≥18 and <35 kg/m2, and either sexually abstinent or in a mon ogamous relationship with a 
healthy partner. Protected from pregnancy by effective contraception, same -sex relationship, or abstinence.  
Study product, dosage and mode of administration:  
Study Products: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate / emtricitabine (TDF/F TC) tablet  
Dosage:  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) with emtricitabine (200 mg)  
Mode of administration: oral  
Control therapy, dosage and mode of administration: HA regimen (7 pills/week) versus LA regimen  (3 
pills/week).  
Duration of treatment:  
Low Adherence (LA) Group : 14 days consisting of 3 pills/week (one tabl et/dose)  for a total of 6 pills ingested  
High Adherence (HA) Group : 14 days consisting of 7 pills/week  (one tablet/dose)  for a total of 14 pills 
ingested  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety : It is expected that there will be no clinically significant concerns.  
Statistical methods:  
Sample size is based on feasibility rather than statistical considerations; thus, analysis will be primarily 
descriptive. Participant flowchart (e.g. number screened, number with sampling) will be provided.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized and have at least one post -
baseline assessment.  
All populations will be define d based on the  adherence regimen . 
Evaluation of Stu dy Objectives:  Study objectives will be evaluated by presentation  of descriptive summaries 
and graphical displays.

 Primary analysis of this study will evaluate the performance of the TFV aptasensor by comparing its 
measurements of the concentrations of TF V in clinical samples from all women with those values obtained 
from LC -MS/MS. Correlation and agreement between the TFV levels measured by the aptasensor and LC -
MS/MS will be analyzed using scatterplot and linear regression.   Continuous variables will be compared 
between values measured with the aptasensor versus LC -MS/MS  using paired comparisons.  From this 
comparison, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of the aptasensor will also be determined. Confidence 
intervals will b e calculated to assess precision and margin of error of those measures. Using the 14 baseline 
pre-dose samples, each woman will be her own control, and these pre -dose samples will be used for the 
assessment of specificity and NPV.   
The secondary analysis of  this study will evaluate whether the aptasensor can detect differences in TFV levels 
between the two independent cohorts of women taking TDF/FTC  at different dosing regimens representing 
high (7 pills/week) and low adherence (3 pills/week).  We will compar e the two independent cohorts using an 
independent samples t test for normally distributed data or a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test for non -parametric 
data.  TFV concentrations from the LA and HA cohorts will be characterized using descriptive statistics (mean,  
median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum).  The values will be compared between the high 
adherence and low adherence groups as well as comparing the mean difference between groups generated by 
the aptasensor to that difference generated by LC -MS/ M S. Distributions will be checked for normality so as 
to determine the appropriate statistical test.  
Descriptive Statistics:  Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles , minima and maxima.  
Control of Type I Error:  This pilot study is descriptive in nature. P -values and confidence intervals around 
estimates of treatment differences will not be adjusted for multiplicity and are descriptive in nature . These 
statistics will be  provided to guide further future development of the aptasensor; caution must be used as t hese 
statistics will not have a controlled Type I error.  
Definition of Baseline:  For both adherence regimens baseline is defined as the Visit 2 pre-dose measurement.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
Nearly 35 million people worldwide have died from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -
related causes, and approximately 77 million people have become infected with HI V since the epidemic 
began 9. This epidemic continues to grow w ith almost 2 million new infections occurring every year, and 
significant increases in youth populations in developing countries will only compound the problem. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate / Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC - Truvada®) is the only oral pill that i s 
approved for prevention of HIV acquisition in the United Sta tes 10. Two landmark safety and 
effectiveness trials which supported the FDA approval of TDF/FTC showed TDF/FTC reduced risk of 
HIV infection by 42% (iPrEX) and 72% (Partners PrEP), noting  that risk reduction was highly correlated 
with drug adherence 4, 5. Although other clinical studies did not show efficacy, the results correlating 
poor drug efficacy with low plasma drug levels did confirm t he importance of adherence 6, 7. The 
approved one pill per day regimen TDF/FTC reduces the risk for sexual transmission of HIV by 90% 
suggesting that with proper adherence a much greater reduction in risk of infection is achievable.  
Given the importance of adhe rence to the efficacy of TDF/FTC it is of clinical significance to have a 
reliable metric for adherence levels. Self -reporting of adherence, a non -invasive and simple method of 
assessment, does not reliably correlate with effectivene ss and blood serum leve ls 6, 7. Currently, the most 
objective measure of adherence available is to detect and quantify plasma levels of tenofovir (TFV) , the 
first metabolite of TDF, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). 
Although this method of quantification is reliable, it requires a specialized lab and equipment which 
comes at a significant cost and does not qualify as point -of-care (PO C) test. Other recently developed 
methods of measuring TFV levels in urine, ELISA and lateral flow assays, have shown promise, but are 
limited by inadequate sensitivity to detect levels observed in plasma and the inability to distinguish high 
adherence fro m white coat effects. This lack of a POC test to measure adherence leaves a critical gap for 
physicians and other health care providers (HCPs) when tailoring counseling to improve adherence and 
ultimately HIV prevention of their patients and communities.  
As such, there is an opportunity to evaluate a new method of measuring adherence in a reliable, 
objective, and cost -effective manner. Aptamers are DNA - or RNA -based ligands capable of binding 
practically any molecular target with high specificity, includin g small molecules su ch as antiretroviral 
drugs 8. Aptamers have advantages over antibodies. They are  more stable and made through a process 
that is more economical and reproducible, which increases the aptamer’s potential capability of being 
more specific than its antibody counterpart.  Therefore, aptamers are being used as capture molecules for 
biosenso r platforms, which are becoming smaller than previous models, more portable, more sensitive 
and quantitative (rivaling LC -MS/MS), require less sample volume, and simpler to use. Therefore, 
aptamer -based biosensors or “aptasensors ,” have great potential for  real-time therapeutic drug 
monitoring.  We will be utilizing a previously validated DNA aptamer specific for TFV and applying it to 
a biosensor platform.  
This study will focus on determining the sensitivity and specificity of the TFV aptasensor and assess its 
ability to distinguish TFV levels associated with low and high adherence using biological fluids 
collected from women taking TDF/FTC at different dosing regimens.

 5. TRIAL PURPOSE, OBJEC TIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
5.1. Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the TFV aptamer -based biosensor 
measuring TFV levels in plasma, urine, and vaginal fluid and its ability to monitor adherence to 
antiretroviral therapy.  The concentrations measured with aptamer -based biosensor will be com pared to 
concentrations measured via LC -MS/MS, which is currently the gold standard for pharmacokinetic analysis 
of TFV.  
5.2. Objectives  
Compare plasma, urine, and vaginal fluid  TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with those 
values quantitated by LC -MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, 
specificity, NPV, and PPV . 
5.2.1.  Primary Objective s 
 Compare plasma TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with those values 
quantitated by LC -MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, 
sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV  
 Determine if the TFV aptasensor can detect differences in the plasma TFV concentrations 
between high and low adherence dosing regimens and compare the mean difference to the 
difference calculated fr om values generated by LC -MS/MS  
5.2.2.  Secondary Objective s 
 Compare urine TFV concentration measured by the aptasensor with those values quantitated 
by LC -MS/MS to determine agreement between the two methodologies, sensitivity, 
specificity, NPV, and PPV  
 Determine  if the TFV aptasensor can detect differences in the urine concentrations of TFV 
between high and low adherence dosing regimens and whether these levels correlate with 
adherence  
 Compare vaginal fluid TFV concentrations measured by the aptasensor with precl inical 
determinations of the range of detectable TFV levels and the aptasensor’s limit of detection  
 Determine if differences in adherence dosing regimens can be correlated to differences in 
vaginal fluid TFV levels  
5.3. Endpoints  
5.3.1.  Primary Endpoint  
 TFV concentrat ions in plasma at baseline (pre -dose), 24 hours, 7 days and 14 days after 
dosing

 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This pilot, prospective, randomized study will screen approximately 20 healthy, non -pregnant, HIV 
negative, premenopausal women (aged 18 -50) at EVMS who are not at risk of pregnancy and are at low 
risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  in order to  have approximately 14 women complete all 
study visits . This study will examine the plasma, urine, and vaginal fluid from women in two dosing 
regimens of oral tablets: TDF/FTC (300/200 mg), 7 pills per week and TDF/FTC (300/200mg), 3 pills 
per week. Partic ipants will be randomized to regimen as per the following schemata:  
Table 3: Randomization Assignments  
Regimen  N Dose  
Low Adherence ( LA) 
Regimen  7 TDF/FTC (300/2200 mg), 3 pills/week , for a 
total of 6 ingested pills  
High Adherence (HA) 
REgimen  7 TDF/FTC (300/200 mg), 7 pills/week , for a total 
of 14 ingested pills  
Participants will undergo the low adherence (LA) regimen or a high adherence (HA) regimen for two 
weeks, consisting of 5 visits.  
Visit 1: At screening/enrollment, volunteers will be consented and undergo procedures to confirm they 
are eligible to continue in the study. Eligible participants will proceed to Visit 2.  
Visit 2: Baseline blood, urine, and vaginal fluid will be collected. Participant s will be randomized to 
dosing regimen and the first dose of TDF/TFC will be ingested in the clinic under direct observation . 
Participants will be instructed to take subsequent doses at home.  
Dosing Contact: Participants will be sent reminder text messages  to facilitate dosing occurring at the 
same time of day. Participants will text message the study coordinator to confirm ingestion of tablet.  If 
the participant does not respond to a text within approximately 4 – 6 hours after it is sent, a reminder text 
will be sent.  
 
Visits 3 -5: Participants will return at 24 hours , 7 days, and 14 days after visit 2 for the pre-dose (for 
visits 3 and 4) collection of blood, urine, and vaginal samples.  
Follow Up Contact: A final follow up site contact will be conducted app roximately  1 – 2 weeks after the 
last visit to ask the participant about adverse events and concomitant medications. The participant will be 
exited unless there are symptoms that require follow up.

Page 22 of 45 
 7. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PARTICIPANTS  
The volunteers for this study will be recruited primarily through word of mouth and by using existing 
databases  of previous study participants  (as protected health information permits. ) 
Only women will be recruited since the endpoints require vaginal sampling. The NIH has mandated that 
children, defined as younger than 18 years old, be included in research trials when appropriate.  This 
study meets “Justifications for Exclusion” criteria f or younger children as set forth by the NIH 
(specifically, “insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children” and “children 
should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies”). As such, this study does not plan  to 
enroll children. Efforts will be made by the sites to recruit participants so that the racial and ethnic 
characteristics of the subject population will reflect the demographics of the study sites. No selection 
criteria shall be based on race or ethnici ty.  
7.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Volunteers must meet all of the following criteria prior to baseline sampling  at visit 2 : 
1. Age 18 to 50 years, inclusive  
2. General good health (by volunteer history and per investigator judgment) without any clinically

8. Abnormal finding on laboratory or physical examination or a so cial or medical condition in the 
volunteer which, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation in the study unsafe 
or would complicate interpretation of data  
7.3. Participant Withdrawal  
7.3.1.  Withdrawal Criteria  
Participants who sign the informed cons ent and agree to participate in the study, but do not meet 
eligibility criteria will not undergo baseline sampling and will not continue in the study.  Once a 
participant undergoes baseline genital/rectal sampling, she may be withdrawn from the study for th e 
following reasons:  
 Failure to follow protocol requirements that is judged severe enough by the investigator to 
significantly affect study outcomes  
 Pregnancy or desire to become pregnant  
 Medical reasons, including diagnosis of an STI  
 Personal reasons (pa rticipant request)  
 Discontinuation of treatment adherence arm, or of entire study ( Section  6.5) 
7.3.2.  Target Enrollment   
Participants who initiate product use but discontinue the study prior to completion may not re -enroll.  
Participants will be screened and enrolled so that approximately 14 women (7 per adherence cohort) 
complete all study visits.  
7.3.3.  Follow -up 
If a participant chooses to discontinue the study after baseline sampling, the site may ask the participant 
to return for the next visit’s study procedures, if she is willing and if releva nt. She will be asked about 
medications taken and adverse events ( AEs) since the last visit. She will be exited from the study during 
her last contact with the site.  
 
Page 24 of 45 
 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Prospective participants may be pre -screened by telephone or in person: the study will be explained, the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed, volunteers’ questions a nswered, and Visit 1 scheduled .  
8.1. Visit 1: Screening/Enrolment  
The following will take place to confirm the volunteer is eligible to continue in the study. Note that if the 
participant is not able to complete any of the  study procedures at this visit, she may return for an 
unscheduled visit prior to Visit 2.  
 The study and informed consent form will be reviewed and all volunteer questions will be 
answered. If the v olunteer is eligible and wishes to participate in the study, she will be asked to 
sign an informed consent form. The Principal Investigator (PI) or designee will sign the form and 
offer a copy to the participant. Permission may be requested as part of the informed consent 
process for storage of the biologic samples obtained during the study for possible future testing, 
as allowed by the site.  
 The informed consent process will include an explanation of adherence support (e.g., text 
message reminders) and a r equest for permission to contact the participant for this purpose.  
 The participant will be interviewed to obtain medical history and demographic information.  
 Height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured and recorded.  
 A urine specimen will be obtain ed for a urine pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, the 
participant will be referred as necessary and will not continue in the study.  
 If the participant’s history is significant for a medical condition, a directed physical exam and or 
pelvic exam will be performed  as necessary . 
 Blood samples (approximately 4 teaspoons) will be collected for HIV and HBsAg testing as well 
as serum creatinine to calculate a creatinine clearance.  Participants who test HIV or HBsAg 
positive at screening are not eli gible to continue in the study. They will be counseled and given 
referrals for medical and social services.  
Eligible participants will be scheduled for the next visit  and directed to refrain from vaginal intercourse 
for 48 hours prior to visit 2 . 
8.2. Visit 2 : Baseline Pre-Dose Sample Collection  
This visit will be scheduled for the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (for cycling women) .  
 An interval history will be collected.  
 Eligibility criteria will be reviewed. If any lab tests reveal that the pa rticipant is not eligible, the 
visit should not proceed and the participant will not continue in the study.   
 If indicated by signs or symptoms or history, a directed physical exam and/or urine pregnancy test 
will be performed. If pregnancy is diagnosed, th e participant will be referred as necessary and 
will be discontinued.  
 
Page 25 of 45 
  A vaginal swab for prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be obtained, if the PSA test indicates 
semen exposure, the visit will be re -scheduled.   
 A urine sample will be obtained.  
 Vaginal  swabs will be obtained  
 A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be obtained.  
 The participant will be randomized to the HA versus LA regimen and will take her first does of 
TDF/FTC in the clinic under direct observation and the time of product ingestion will be recorded 
in the source document.  The pill will be ingested after urine, vaginal and blood samples are 
obtained.  
 The participant will confirm her contact information for the medication  text reminder.  
 Participants will be instructed to refr ain from vaginal intercourse for 48 hours prior to visits 3 – 5. 
8.3. Visits 3 – 5: 24 hours , 7 days , and 14 days  after fi rst dose  
Visits 3, 4, and 5  will be scheduled for 24  hours , 7 days,  and 14 days after initial dosing at Visit 2 , 
respectively. The time of  the visit will assure that it has been at least 24 hours since the participant’s last 
dose of TDF/FTC.  At each visit, the following procedures will be performed:  
 The study staff will ask the participant if she followed the instructions from the previous v isit, 
and ask about adverse events and concomitant medications.  
 If indicated, a directed physical exam, pelvic exam and/or pregnancy test  will be performed. If 
pregnancy is diagnosed, the participant will be referred as necessary and will be discontinued.  
 Visits 4 and 5:  Study staff will count the number of pills remaining and query the participant on 
compliance with her assigned dosing regimen.  
 A vaginal swab for PSA will be obtained, if the PSA test indicates semen exposure, the 
participant will be remin ded of the restrictions on vaginal intercourse, but the visit will proceed.  
 A urine sample will be obtained.  
 Vaginal s wabs will be obtained  
 A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will be obtained.  
 Visits 3 and 4:  The participant will take her dose of medication in the clinic, under direct 
observation, if applicable to her dosing regimen , after urine, vaginal and blood samples are 
obtained .  
 Visits 3 and 4:  Study staff will dispense the appropriate number of TDF/FTC pills in a pill 
carrying case, so tha t the participant has enough pills to take her to before her next scheduled 
visit.  
 
Page 26 of 45 
 8.4. Final Follow Up Contact  
The site will contact the participant approximately 1 - 2 weeks after the last visit. The participant will be 
asked about any AEs and concomitant med ications since her last visit. The participant will be exited 
from the study unless symptoms require further follow up or she is appropriately referred.  
8.5. Unscheduled Visits  
The participant will be instructed to contact the site if she experiences moderate to severe symptoms 
(e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms).  
Unschedu led visits or procedures (e.g. urinalysis, vital sign measurements)  may be performed at the 
participant’s request or as deemed necessary by the investigator at any time during the study. The 
participant will be asked to come in for an evaluation, as indicated. Unscheduled visits that require 
examination or interview due t o symptoms will be in the study database . 
When an unscheduled visit occurs in response to an AE experienced by a study participant, study staff 
will assess the reported event clinically and provide or refer the participant to appropriate medical care, 
as necessary. All AEs will be evaluated and follow -up of any observed abnormalities will proceed 
according to the s tudy manual.  
8.6. Early Discontinuation  
If the participant discontinues from the study prio r to the final visit, the site may ask the participant to 
return for study procedures and/or sample collection, if she is willing and if relevant. At a minimum, the 
site may ask participants to return for safety assessments. She will be asked about medications taken and 
adverse events including symptoms since the last visit. She will be exited from the study during her last 
contact with the site.

 13. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definit ion of Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational or approved 
product in humans, whether or not considered product related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product. Pre -existing events that increase in frequency or severity in nature d uring or as a 
consequence of use of an investigational product in human clinical trials will also be considered as AEs. 
Any AE with an onset date after the first date of study product administration is considered to be 
treatment -emergent.  
All AEs with onse t at or after baseline sampling, whether or not related to the study product, will be 
recorded in the study database .  
According to 21 CFR 312.32 “IND Safety Reports” the following definitions of terms apply to AEs 
occurring in clinical studies involving d rugs.  
13.1.1.  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is “any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study product 
caused the event.” An AE is considered to be a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to 
suggest a cau sal relationship between the study product and the AE. Examples of a causal relationship 
include:  
 A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
product exposure (e.g., not necessarily applicable to this study, in clude angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with product 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the study product (e.g., 
tendon rupture)  
 An aggreg ate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of product exposure) that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the product exposure group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
13.1.2.  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by the study product. Adverse reactions are a subset  of suspected 
adverse reactions whe re there is reason to conclude that the product caused the event.  
13.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
the sponsor, it:  
 Results in death  
 
Page 33 of 45 
  Is immediately life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
All SAEs starting from baseline until the last contact with the site, whether or not they are related to the 
study product, must be recorded on in the source documents and study database . Reporting of SAEs is 
outlined in Section  13.4. 
13.1.4.  Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the drug packet 
insert, is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example (not necessarily 
applicable to this study), under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the package  referred only to elevated hepatic enzy mes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the 
package insert  listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs  or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the package insert  as occurring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under in vestigation.  
13.1.5.  Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
The sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor 
must report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the product and the AE as described above.  
13.2. Relationship to Study Product  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE. Relatedness is an asse ssment made by a study clinician of whether 
or not the event is related to the study agent. Degrees of relatedness will be categorized according to 
current DAIDS -approved guidelines. Per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to 
DAIDS (Versio n 2.0, January 2010), the relationship categories that will be used for this study are:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study product(s)  
 Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to t he study 
product(s)  
13.3. Recording and Grading Adverse Events for Severity  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question from 
the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at t he clinical site. The 
AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the 
investigator will evaluate and report the date of onset, date of resolution, severity, relatedness, action 
 
Page 34 of 45 
 taken, serious outcome (if applicabl e), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. 
Each AE will be graded for severity using the applicable DAIDs tables for grading the severity of 
adverse events (see Table  8 ), which can also be found at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance /.  
Table  8: Grading the Severity of Adverse Events  
Adult and Pediatric AEs  http://rsc.tech -res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/

Rectal Grading Table  http://rcc.tech -res.com/docs/default -source/safety/rectal -tox-table -
updates -05-11-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=6  
 
For clinical AEs NOT identified in the DAIDS AE Grading Tables, the followin g scale (as listed in the 
DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AEs) should be used to grade severity:  
 Mild: Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
 Moderate: Symptoms causing greater th an minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
 Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities  
 Potentially Life -Threatening: Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self -care 
functions OR medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, 
persistent disability, or death  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas 
seriousness is defined by the criteria un der Section  13.1.3 . An AE of severe intensity may not necessarily 
be considered serious.  
Participants must be protected from pregnancy to participate in the study. Should a pregnancy occur after 
baseline sampling, it must be reported as soon as possible to the study investigators.  The participant will 
be discontinued from the study and appropr iate exit procedures will be followed. Note that pregnancy in 
itself is not regarded as an AE. If the participant has been exposed to study product, the course of the 
pregnancy should be followed until it has an outcome (e.g., spontaneous miscarriage, elec tive 
termination, normal birth, congenital abnormality). If the participant seeks care outside the site, every 
effort should be made to obtain her consent for the site to receive a copy of her medical records related 
to the pregnancy, its outcome and the h ealth of the neonate, if applicable.  
Reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.  
 
Page 35 of 45 
 13.4. Reporting Serious Adve rse Events  
Any SAE, includi ng those listed in the protocol  or package insert must be reported to the EVMS IRB 
within 72 hours of discovery. If there is any question whether the event meets the criteria for “serious” it 
should be reported anyway. In additio n, a completed SAE form must be filled out  as soon as possible. 
The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verifying the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the SAE pages and the corresponding source documents.  
Additional follow -up in formation, if required or available, should all be sent to the EVMS IRB  within 
one business day of receipt and this should be completed on an SAE form and placed with the original 
SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the study database and/or study file.  
The investigator will notify the EVMS IRB of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reactions as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after she initially receives the 
information.  
The site  will promptly investigate and follow up on all safety information it receives, with the 
cooperation of the investigator.  
The investigator is responsible for complying with IRB requirements for AE reporting.  
13.5. Temporary Product Hold/Permanent Discontinuation in R esponse 
to Adverse Events  
13.5.1.  Grade 1 or 2  
In general, a participant who develops a Grade 1 or 2 AE, regardless of relationship to study product, 
may continue product use. If the PI/designee opts to temporarily hold study product, reasons for product 
hold mus t be documented in the study source documents . 
Follow -up testing for Grade 2 laboratory test results should be performed at scheduled study visits, as 
clinically relevant. More frequent testing may be performed at any time if required to properly monitor 
and/or manage participant safety, at the discretion of the PI/designee.  
13.5.2.  Grade 3 or 4  
A participant who develops a Grade 3 or a Grade 4 AE that is product -related should have the product 
temporarily withheld. If a participant develops a Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE  that is not product -related, the 
PI/designee may temporarily withhold product. In either case, the PI/designee must continue the 
temporary product hold until resolution of the AE . If product use is resumed and the same AE recurs at 
the same (or worse) gra de level at any time during the study, study product must then be permanently 
discontinued.

 14. STATISTICS  
14.1. Sample Size Justification  
Sample size is based on feasibility rather than statistical considerations; thus, analysis will be primarily 
descriptive and g raphical. Participant flowchart (e.g. number screened, number with genital sampling) 
will be provided.  
14.2. General Statistical Issues  
All attempts will be made to avoid missing data. However, missing values will remain as missing, i.e., 
no attempt will be made to impute. In general, only observed values will be used in data analyses and 
presentations . 
14.3. Analysis Populations  
The population includes healthy, non -pregnant, HIV negative women. The analysis population will 
include all participants who undergo baseline genital/rectal sampling.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized and have at least one post -
baseline assessment. The FAS will be used to summarize study disposition, baseline characteristics, and 
all non -safety endpoints.  
Evaluation of safety endpoints will be conducted using the Treated Population (TP), consisting of 
women with a t least one dose of product use. If all subjects in the TP have at least one post -baseline 
assessment, then the TP will be identical to the FAS.  
All populations will be defined based on the adherence regimen assigned (HA versus LA) . 
Additional populations or refinements to these definitions, if needed due to unanticipated circumstances, 
will be described in the SAP or statistical report.  
14.4. Statistical Analysis  
Sample size is based on feasibility rather than statistical considerations; thus, analysis will be primarily 
descriptive. Participant flowchart (e.g. number screened, number with sampling) will be provided.  All 
populations will be defined based on the adherence regimen.  
Evaluation of Study Objectives: Study objectives will be evaluated by clinical revie w of descriptive 
summaries and graphical displays.  
Primary analysis of this study will evaluate the performance of the TFV aptasensor by comparing its 
measurements of the concentrations of TFV in clinical samples from all women with those values 
obtained from LC -MS/MS. Correlation and agreement between the TFV levels measured by the 
aptasensor and LC -MS/MS will be analyzed using scatterplot and linear regression. Continuous variables 
will be compared between values measured with the aptasensor versus LC -MS/MS using paired 
comparisons.  From this comparison, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of the aptasensor will also be 
determined. Confidence intervals will be calculated to assess precision and margin of error of those 
 
Page 37 of 45 
 measures. Using the14 baseline pr e-dose samples, each woman will be her own control, and these pre -
dose samples will be used for the assessment of specificity and NPV.   
The secondary analysis of this study will evaluate whether the aptasensor can detect differences in TFV 
levels between t he two independent cohorts of women taking TDF/FTC at different dosing regimens 
representing high (7 pills/week) and low adherence (3 pills/week).  We will compare the two independent 
cohorts using an independent samples t test for normally distributed data  or a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test for non -parametric data.  TFV concentrations from the LA and HA cohorts will be characterized 
using descriptive statistics (mean, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum).  The values will 
be compared between the hig h adherence and low adherence groups as well as comparing the mean 
difference between groups generated by the aptasensor to that difference generated by LC -MS/ MS. 
Distributions will be checked to determine normality so as to determine the appropriate stat istical test.  
Descriptive Statistics: Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, minima and 
maxima.  
Control of Type I Error: This pilo t study is descriptive in nature. P -values and confidence intervals 
around estimates of treatment differences will not be adjusted for multiplicity and are descriptive in 
nature. These statistics will be provided to guide clinical judgment; caution must be  used as these 
statistics will not have a controlled Type I error.  
Definition of Baseline: For both adherence regimens baseline is defined as the Visit 2 pre -dose 
measurement.  
14.5. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be conducted .

 15. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
15.1. Loss to Follow -up 
If a participant fails to appear for a scheduled visit, at least three attempts to contact her should be made 
over the subsequent 30 days. These attempts should be documented in the participant’s study file. The 
final attempt must be a certified letter to the participant with return -receipt requested, or an outreach 
attempt. A copy of this letter or documentation of the final outreach attempt should be in her file. After 
these three attempts, no further efforts need to be made to find her, but her file should remain open until 
study closeout.  
If the participant does not contact the clinic before the study is closed, her final disposition will be 
recorded at the time of study closeout, to indicate that she was lost to fol low-up. The lost to follow -up 
designation cannot be made for any participant until study close out.  
15.2. Protocol Adherence and Sampling Windows  
Visits 3, 4 and 5 should be scheduled so that it has been at least 24 hours since the participant’s last dose 
of stu dy medication.  Visit 3 should be conducted 24 hours + 4 hours from the ingestion of the first dose 
at Visit 2.  Visit 4 should be conducted 7 days + 6 hours from the ingestion of the first dose at visit 2.  
Visit 5 should be conducted 1 4 days + 6 hours from the ingestion of the first dose at visit 2.   
The study site should carefully record the date and time of each collection of blood , urine  and CV  swabs.  
The site should carefully record the date and time of each ingestion of medication in the clinic.  
15.3. Protoco l Violations  
If a protocol violation is required to protect the life or physical well -being of a participant in an 
emergency, it may be carried out without prior approval from the IRB. The investigator must, however, 
report the violation to the IRB as soon  as possible, no later than 5 working days after the emergency 
occurred.  
Other violations from the protocol may not be carried out without prior approval from the IRB if the 
change involves the rights, safety, or welfare of participants; and without prior approval from the grant 
PI (Terry Jacot, PhD) if the change involves the validity of the data, the study's scientific soundness or 
the rights, safety, or welfare of participants.  
All protocol violations should be recorded in a protocol violation log . 
15.4. Modification of Protocol  
No modification of this protocol may be made without written approval of Dr. Jacot .

given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate. The study must be conducted in 
accordance with all conditions of approval by the IRB.  
The PI is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with 
local requirements. In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising used to recruit patients for 
the study. The protocol must be re -approved by the IRB or IEC upon receipt of amendments and 
annually , as local regulations require.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. In 
addition, the PI will follow U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations regarding the 
Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HI PAA 45, CFR 164). The PI will ensure that 
appropriate health care or referral is provided for the participants throughout the study.  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
17.3.1.  Procedure for Obtaining Informed Consent  
No volunteer may be admitted into this study until the PI  (or designee) has obtained her legally effective 
informed consent. The PI (or designee) shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide 
the prospective participant with sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the 
study. Informed consent must be obtained without coercion, undue influence, or misrepresentation of the 
potential benefits or risks that might be associated with participation in the study.  
Informed consent encompasses all oral and written information giv en to the volunteer about the study 
and the study materials. This includes the consent form signed by the participant, the instructions for use 
of study materials that are provided to the participant, recruitment advertising, and any other information 
provided to the participant. All such information that is given to the participant will be in a language that 
is understandable to her. The information will not include any language in which the participant is made 
to waive any of her rights or which releases or appears to release the  PI or  the PI’s institution from 
liability for negligence.  
Informed consent will be documented by the use of a written consent form that is signed by the 
participant and the PI (or designee). A copy of the consent form will be offe red to each participant. The 
original signed consent form for each participant will be kept at the site. The consent form must include 
each of the basic and additional elements of informed consent described in 21 CFR Part 50.25 and must 
describe each of th e risks or discomforts to the participant that have been identified as reasonably 
foreseeable.

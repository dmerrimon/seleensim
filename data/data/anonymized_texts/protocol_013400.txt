Amendment 05 08-SEP-2022 Protocol isamended consistent with recommendations of the eDMC after an interim 
review of the data; specifically, to discontinue the study enrollment due to futility. 
Study participants randomized to one of the two experimental arms (olaparib plus 
bevacizumab [Arm 1 ] or olaparib monotherapy [Arm 2 ]) must discontinue the 
therapy. No crossover from either experimental arm to Standard of Care ( SOC )arm 
(Arm 3A and Arm 3B) within the study is allowed. Participants on SOC have the 
option to continue receiving study intervention until criteria for discontinuation are 
met.

1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 3 Randomized, Open -label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of Olaparib Alone or in Combination With Bevacizumab Compared to Bevacizumab 
with a Fluoropyrimidine in Participants with Unresectable or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 
who Have Not Progressed Following First -line Induction (LYNK -003)
Short Title: Olaparib ±bevacizumab in CRC with SD/PR/CR from FOLFOX or CAPOX
with bevacizumab
Acronym: Not applicable.
Hypotheses, Objectives ,and Endpoints :
NOTE: As of Amendment 05,participants who are still on study treatment will no longer 
have tumor response assessments by BICR. However, local tumor imaging assessments 
should continue as per local institutional guidelines . In addition, PRO assessments will no 
longer be performed. Blood for RNA analysis and serum and plasma biomarker analysis will
no longer be collected. Updated analyses are described in Section 9. Post-treatment f ollow -up 
visits are no longer required except for safety and survival follow -up requirements (refer to 
Section8.11.4). The section below is retained for reference.
In male or female participants with unresectable or metastatic CRC who have not progressed 
following prior FOLFOX + bevacizumab or CAPOX + bevacizumab induction.
The study is considered to have met its primary objective if at least 1 primary hypothesis test 
is significant.
Primary Objectives Primary Endpoints
To compare PFS using RECIST 1.1 as 
assessed by BICR between the 
following treatments:
-Olaparib + Bevacizumab versus a 
fluoropyrimidine + B evacizumab
-Olaparib versus A fluoropyrimidine 
+ Bevacizumab
Hypotheses:
H1 –Olaparib + Bevacizumab is superior 
to a fluoropyrimidine + Bevacizumab with 
respect to PFS using RECIST 1.1 as 
assessed by BICR.
H2 –Olaparib is superior to a 
fluoropyrimidine + Bevacizumab with 
respect to PFS using RECIST 1.1 as 
assessed by BICR.PFS: the time from randomization to first 
documented disease progression (PD) or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first

fluorpyrimidine + Bevacizumab with 
respect to OS.OS: the time from randomization to death 
due to any cause
To evaluate ORR, and DOR using 
RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR 
following administration of:
-Olaparib + Bevacizumab
-Olaparib
-Fluoropyrimidine + BevacizumabOR: CR or PR
DOR: the time from first response (CR or 
PR) to subsequent disease progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first

Duration of 
ParticipationEach participant will participate in the study f rom the time the participant 
provides documented informed consent through the final protocol -
specified contact.
After a Screening phase of up to 28 days, each participant will be 
randomized to receive study intervention until disease progression is 
radiographically documented, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that
prevents further administration of study intervention, investigator’s 
decision to discontinue the participant, or administrative reasons requiring 
cessation of treatment.
After the end of study treatment, each participant will be followed for the 
occurren ce of AEs and spontaneously reported pregnancy as described 
under Section 8.4.1.
Participants who discontinue study intervention for reasons other than 
radiographically documented disease progression will have post -treatment 
follow -up imaging for disease s tatus until disease progression is 
documented radiographically per RECIST 1.1 .
All participants will then be followed for disease status until second 
disease progression during re introduction of investigator -choice of 
anticancer therapy . All participants w ill be followed for OSuntil death, 
withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study.
Once the participant has achieved allstudy objective sor the study has 
ended, the participant is discontinued from this study.

2 INTRODUCTION
This clinical trial will study the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, alone or incombination with 
bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab with 5 -FU in participants with unresectable or 
metastatic CRC that has not progressed following prior CAPOX + bevacizumab or FOLFO X 
+ bevacizumab .
2.1 Study Rationale
Human cancers show genomic instability and an increased mutation rate due to underlying 
defects in DNA repair. The deficiencies render cancer cells more dependent on the remaining 
DNA repair pathways, and targeting these pa thways is expected to have much greater impact 
on the survival of the tumor cells than on normal cells. PARP1 and PARP 2, the most 
abundant of the PARP enzymes, play a crucial role in repairing single -strand DNA breaks. 
The cells with inhibited PARP activit y heavily depend on other DNA repair pathways, 
mainly HRR of DNA double strand breaks. A subset of patients with CRC have HRD and 
may be more sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Platinum -based chemotherapy regimens are the 
predominant first -line option for patie nts with advanced/ metastatic CRC, similar to ovarian 
cancer. It is well documented that platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer predicts sensitivity 
to PARP inhibition possibly related to the need for similar repair mechanism to repair their 
drug-induced DN A damage. This study will evaluate the antitumor effect of maintenance 
therapy with olaparib in participants with unresectable or metastatic CRC that has not 
progressed following prior CAPOX + bevacizumab or FOLFOX + bevacizumab .
Platinum -based regimens, specifically CAPOX or FOLFOX, with or without bevacizumab, 
are the most frequently used standard of care in m etastatic CRC as frontline therapy. CAPOX 
and FOLFOX are considered interchangeable in the NCC Nguidelines, and equivalen t
efficacy has been shown in several clinical trials [Zhang, C., et al 2012] [Buchler, T., et al 
2014] .Historically, these regimens are given until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. However, l ong exposure to oxaliplatin results in significant treatment -limiting 
associated toxicity, specifically neuropathy. Oxaliplatin toxicity is cumulative and regressive 
to some degree after drug discontinuation although it can be disabling and persistent [Esin, E. 
2016] . A stop -and-go approach, employing shorter durations of oxaliplatin containing 
regimens, interrupted by periods of oxaliplatin -free therapy, has been shown to have 
equivalent efficacy to continuous t reatment with oxaliplatin, with reduced toxicity [Seymour, 
M. 2012] [ Berry, S. R., et al 2015] . Maintenance treatment options aiming to enhance clinical 
benefit and reduce the associated toxicity derived from long exposures to oxaliplatin are an 
attractive modality in the management of first-linemetastatic CRC.
In general, this approach involves intensive first -line therapy, followed by less intensive 
therapy until progression in patients who did not prog ress during the first -line induction 
chemotherapy [Aprile, G., et al 2016] . This concept is gaining credibility, and recent data in 
the literature suggest that maintenance treatment may play a key role in differ ent cancer types 
such as CRC, lung, breast, and ovarian carcinomas [Fidias, P. M., et al 2009] [Paz -Ares, L. 
G., et al 2013] [Gligorov, J., et al 2014] [Burger, R. A., et al 2011] [Pe rren, T. J., et al 2011] .

MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Currently there are no approved drugs as maintenance after first-linetherapy in metastatic
CRC. However, both NCCN and ESMO guidelines recommend that oxaliplatin may be 
discontinued after 12 weeks of therapy with FOLFOX (six 2 -week cycles) or CAPOX (four 
3-week cycles) when subjects experience unacceptable neurotoxicity. In clinical practice, 
after discontinuation of oxaliplatin patients are switched to a maintenance regimen of 
fluoropyrimi dine and bevacizumab based on the results from clinical trials such as CAIRO3 , 
PRODIGE 9, and AIO KRK 0207 [Goey, K. K. H ., et al 2017] [Hegewisch -Becker, S., et al 
2015] [Aparicio, T., et al 2018] . These trials showed a significant PFS benefit and a trend in 
OS benefit when maintenance was adopted .
The CAIRO3 study was an open -label, Phase 3, multicenter randomized controlled trial 
assessing maintenance therapy with capecitabine/bevacizumab versus observation (no drug) 
in 558 patients with metastatic CRC and with SDor better after first -line treatment with 
CAPOX /bevacizumab [Goey, K. K. H., et al 2017] . After first progression, both groups were 
to receiv e CAPOX /bevacizumab again until PFS2. After a median follow -up of 48 months, 
the primary endpoint of PFS2 was significantly better in the maintenance arm (8.5 vs .11.7 
months; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81; p<0.0001), with 54% of patients overall receivin g 
CAPOX /bevacizumab the second time. A nonsignificant trend toward improved OS was seen 
in the maintenance arm (18.1 vs .21.6 months; adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.01; 
p=0.06).
The AIO 0207 trial was an open -label, noninferiority, randomized Phase 3 trial that 
randomized 472 patients whose disease did not progress on induction FOLFOX/bevacizumab 
or CAPOX /bevacizumab to no maintenance therapy or to maintenance therapy with 
fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab or with bevacizumab alone [Hegewisch -Becker, S., et al 
2015] . The planned protocol included reintroduction of primary therapy after first 
progression. The primary endpoint was time to failure of strategy, defined as time from 
randomization to second progression , death, and initiation of treatment with a new drug. 
After a medi anfollow -up of 17 months, the median time to failure of strategy was 6.4 
months (95% CI, 4.8 to 7.6) for the no treatment group, 6.9 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.5) for 
the fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab group, and 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 7.4) for the 
bevacizumab alone group. Compared with fluoropyrimidine/bevacizumab, bevacizumab 
alone was noninferior, whereas the absence of maintenance therapy was not. However, only 
approx imately one -third of trial participants received the reinduction therapy, thus limiting 
the interpretation of results. Overall survival was one of the secondary endpoints of the trial, 
and no relevant difference was seen between the arms.
The randomized Phase 3 noninferiority SAKK 41/06 trial provides historical data regarding 
bevacizumab monotherapy as maintenance after first -line treatment [Koeberle, D., et al 
2015] . In this study ,the primary endpoint of time to progression was not met (4.1 months for 
bevacizumab continuation vs .2.9 months for no continuation; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 
0.96), and no difference in OS was observed (25.4 vs .23.8 months; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63
to 1.1; p=0.20). Th erefore, the value of bevacizumab monotherapy as maintenance was not 
demonstrated.

CRC [Aparicio, T., et al 2018] . The primary endpoint was TCD, defined as the time elapsed 
between randomization and tumor progression during a chemotherapy sequence. The study 
randomized 494 participants assigned t o either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab induction 
chemotherapy followed by bevacizumab maintenance during CFI (n=247) or to the same 
induction chemotherapy followed by observation during CFI (n=247 ). The median TCD was 
15 months in both arms (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.34; p=0.57). The median PFS was 
9.2months in the maintenance arm and 8.9 months in the observation arm (HR, 0.91; 
95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09; p=0.316). The 12 -month PFS was 30.2% ( ±2.9) in the maintenance 
arm and 21.0 %(±2.6) in the observation arm. The median time to treatment failure was 
11.1 months in the maintenance arm and 12.1 months in the observation arm (HR, 1.17; 
95% CI, 0.97 to 1.40; p=0.092). The trial failed to demonstrate a treat ment difference in TCD 
between the 2treatment strategies of administering and not administering bevacizumab 
monotherapy during the maintenance period.
The current study (MK -7339 -003) aims to compare the combination of fluoropyrimidine and 
bevacizumab to olaparib or olaparib plus bevacizumab as a maintenance strategy following 
discontinuation of CAPOX or FOLFOX in patients with CRC with the goal to improve the 
overall outcome in terms of efficacy and safety of first-linetherapy in metastatic CRC.
2.2 Backgroun d
2.2.1 Olaparib
Olaparib (AZD2281, KU -0059436) is a potent PARP inhibitor (PARP1, 2, and 3) that is 
being developed as an oral anticancer therapy, both as monotherapy (including maintenance) 
and for combination with chemotherap y and other anticancer agents.
PAR P inhibition is a novel approach to targeting tumors with deficiencies in DNA repair 
mechanisms. PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA SSBs. Inhibiting PARPs leads 
to the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to the more serious DNA DSBs during 
the process of DNA replication. During the process of cell division, DSBs can be efficiently 
repaired in normal cells by HR R. Tumors with HRD, su ch as ovarian cancers in patients with 
BRCA m, cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which may become lethal to cells a s it 
accumulates. In such tumo r types, olaparib may offer a potentially efficacious and less toxic 
cancer treatment compared with curre ntly available chemotherapy regimens.
Olaparib traps the inactive form of PARP on DNA at sites of SSBs, thereby preventing their 
repair [Helleday, T. 2011] [ Murai, J., et al 2012] . Olaparib has demonstrat ed efficacy in 
ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic tumors with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and has shown 
proof of concept in tumors with ATM and other indicators of HRD. The specificity of 
olaparib for binding PARP at the replication fork during DNA replicatio n is believed to have 
applicability to tumors associated with mutations in HR R.
Refer to the IB/approved labeling for detailed background information on olaparib.

2.2.2 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
2.2.2.1 Inhibition of PARP as a Target for Cancer
PARP1 and PARP2 are zinc -finger DNA -binding enzymes that play a critical role in DNA 
repair [Ame, J. C., et al 2004] by sensing single -strand DNA damage and converting it into 
intracellular signals that activate the BER and SSB repair pathways. When a break in DNA 
occurs, PARP enzymes are recruited to, and bind at, the end of the broken DNA strands, 
activating their enzymatic activity. PARP subsequently catalyzes the addition of long 
polymers of ADP -ribose onto several other proteins associated with chromatin (eg, PARP, 
histones, DNA repair proteins), resulting in chromatin relaxation, rapid recruitment of DNA 
repair proteins, and efficient repair of the break. In the absence of repair of SSBs, during
subsequent DNA replication these breaks are converted to double strand breaks [Fong, Peter 
C., et al 2009] .
Under normal conditions, HRR is the preferred pathway for repairing double strand DNA 
damage as it is associated with a lower rate of errors compared with other forms of DNA 
repair [Prakash, R., et al 2015] . Cells unable to perform HRR (eg, due to inactivation of 
genes required for homologous recombination, such as occur with deleterious mutations of 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) are more likely to use the error -prone NHEJ or alternative NHEJ 
pathways to repair these DSBs and risk accumulating multiple lesions or LOH due to an 
increase in deletions and accompanying genomic ins tability. Over time, the accumulation of 
excessive DNA errors in combination with the inability to complete S phase (ie, because of 
stalled replication forks due to PARP inhibitor administration), leads to cell death 
demonstrating that PARP inhibition is s ynthetic lethal in the context of BRCA mutations
[Farmer, H., et al 2005] [Bryant, H. E., et al 2005] . Cells without SSBs or with intact HRR, 
such as somatic tissue, replicate normally in the presence of a PARP inhibitor, thereby 
minimizing toxicity.
2.2.2.2 PARP Inhibition in Platinum -sensitive Cancers
Cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are the backbone of platinum -based therapy for several 
malignancies, such as lung, ovarian, head and neck, colorectal, breas t,genitourinary ,and 
pancreatic cancers [Kelland, Lloyd 2007] . General mechanism sof action that arecommon 
among platinum agents arethe formation of DNA cross -links , induction of DNA replicative 
stress, mitotic arrest ,and ultimate cell death [Dilruba, S. 2016] . Hence, cancers with 
deficiencies in DNA damage repair pathways are particularly sensitive to platinum -based 
chemotherapies .
These cancer types are also sensitive to PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors have been shown 
to be effective in ovarian , prostate, breast ,and pancreatic cancers [Ledermann, J., et al 2012] 
[Moore, K., et al 2018] [Robson, M., et al 2017] [Mirza, M. R., et al 2016] [Swisher, E. M., 
et al 2017] . See the olaparib IB for more information.
Sensitivity to platinum -based chemotherapy is a good predictor ofresponse to PARP 
inhibition as demonstrated by these tria lsand therefore ,it has been used as a biomarker for 
patient selection in PARP inhibitor maintenance clinical trials [Gelmon, K. A., et al 2011] .

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 003-05 
MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Olaparib is approved as maintenance therapy forpatients with platinum -sensitive relapsed 
ovarian cancer. Pancreatic cancer is another malignancy where platinum sensitivity is used as 
a selection criterion for testing PARP inhibitor efficacy in patients with g BRCA mutant 
cancers (POLO trial; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).
The cross -sensitivity between PARP inhibitors and platinum -based chemotherapies is 
predicted to be due to similar repair mechanisms being used to repair the DNA damage 
resulting from exposure to both classes of drugs.
Correlating platinum sensitivity to response to PAR P inhibition is also being explored in 
other malignancies , such as breast cancer .Germline BRCA1/2 mutations are frequent in 
HER2 -negative breast cancers, particularly the TNBC subtype. TNBC’s biology, like in 
ovarian cancer, features high frequency of TP53 mutations, genomic instabilities and HRD 
signatures [Paik, S., et al 2012] . These similarities with ovarian cancer led to a number of 
clinical trials exploring PARP inhibitor’s efficacy in HER2 -negative breast cancer and 
TNBC. Olaparib has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with g BRCA m
HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy 
(neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting). In the OlympiAD trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), an 
open -label, multicenter study evaluating olaparib monotherapy efficacy in patients with 
gBRC Am, HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer, the median PFS was significantly longer 
in the olaparib group than in the standard -therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; HR
0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.80; p<0.001) [Robs on, M., et al 2017] . Approximately 30% of the 
participants in this trial were previously treated with platinum -based chemotherapy .
In SCLC, a Phase 1 trial testing the PARP inhibitor talazoparib in participants with multiple
indications ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] )demonstrated preliminary efficacy in participants with platinum -
sensitive cancers . In thiscohort of 23participants , 2 participants (9%) had a PRand 
4participants (17%) had stable disease [de Bono, J., et al 2017] .A Phase 2 trial is currently 
exploring talazoparib in combination with low -dose temozolomide in platinum -sensitive 
participants ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
2.2.2.2.1 Rationale for PARP Inhibition in CRC
Simi lar to ovarian cancer, platinum -based chemotherapy is the standard of care in CRC as 
the frontline treatment. In numerous clinical studies (eg,PAOLA -1, SOLO, PROfound as 
monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab) evaluating the PARP inhibitors’ 
efficacy in ovarian cancer patients, platinum sensitivity was a valuable predictor of response 
to PARP inhibition. Hence, the patient selection was based on participants whose CRC ha d
not progressed following prior CAPOX or FOLFOX induction with bevacizumab. The 
oxaliplatin -freeinterval of ≥6 months in CRC patients is associated with better ORR, PFS ,
and OS, and often this patient subpopulation responds well to second -line platinum treatment
[Venook, A. P. 2015] . Given that the platinum efficacy is the highest in tumors with defects 
in DNA damage repair pathways, it was not surprising that the ovarian cancer patients with 
platinum -sensitive tumors responded well to PARP inhibition in the maintenance setting.

2.2.2.2.2 Rationale for Combining Olaparib and Bevacizumab in CRC
There are several data suggesting that olaparib and bevacizumab may be synergistic. One 
mechanism of bevacizumab resistance is hypoxia induction as a response to vessel regression 
caused by the anti -angiogenic agent, resulting in an increase of DNA damage and genetic 
instability [Chan, N., et al 2010] . This observation that tumor cells exposed to chronic 
hypoxia acquire defects in HR and increased sensitivit y to PARP inhibition [Hegan, D. C., et 
al 2010] is an example of ‘contextual synthetic lethality ’in which hypoxia -induced repair -
deficient tumor cells can be targeted by disrupting backup pathways. Therefore, t he premise 
of combining olaparib and bevacizumab is based on the rationale that direct targeting of 
PARP by olaparib and indirect sensitization to olaparib by acquisition of HR defects by 
bevacizumab will be therapeutically beneficial.
The potential synerg y between olaparib and anti -VEGF therapy has been recently supported 
by the results of randomized Phase 2 trial showing that the combination of the antiangiogenic 
cediranib (30 mg daily po) plus olaparib (200 mg capsules BID) for the treatment of 
recurrent platinum -sensitive HGSOC compared to olaparib alone prolonged PFS from a 
median of 8.2months to 1 6.5months ( HR0.50;95% CI ,0.30to 0.83, p=0.00 7) [Liu, J. F., et 
al 2017] . However, the combination treatment elicited frequent toxicities leading to dose 
modifications in 77% of participants (compared to 24% in the single -agent arm), with 
increased occurrence of severe hypertension, fatigue and diarrhea which were previously 
repor ted toxicities for cediranib.
APhase 1 study established the safety and tolerability of olaparib alone and in combination 
with bevacizumab. Participants with advanced solid tumors received oral olaparib (100 mg, 
200 mg, or 400 mg BID) in combination with bevacizumab ( 5mg/kg IV Q2W). In the 
12participants treated, the most common A Es related to olaparib were Grade 1/2nausea and 
fatigue. No serious drug -related A Es or DLTs were reported. This study demonstrated that 
the combination of olaparib with bevaci zumab was generally well tolerated with no DLTs 
observed and that it warranted additional investigations [Dean, E., et al 2012] .The PAOLA 
trial (NCT 02477644 ) is evaluating the combination of olaparib (300 mg BI D)and 
bevacizumab as maintenance therapy after response to first platinum -based therapy of 
advanced ovarian cancer.
2.2.3 Preclinical and Clinical Studies
The preclinical experience with olaparib is fully described in theIB.
SOLO1
SOLO1 is a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of olaparib (tablets, 300 mg BID) as maintenance monotherapy in newly
diagnosed BRCA m ovarian cancer patients that are platinum -sensitive. Compared to placebo, 
olaparib significantly reduced the risk of disease progression. The median total treatment 
duration in the olaparib arm (106.9 weeks [ approximately 25 months], reflec ting the 2-year
treatment cap) was almost double that of the placebo arm (60.3 weeks [approximately 
14months], reflecting median PFS in the placebo arm); equating to an exposure advantage 
08HF0N
PRODUCT:MK-7339  60
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 003-05 
MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
for patients in the olaparib arm of approximately 47 weeks (approxi mately 11 months) .At 41
months follow -up,the median PFS for the olaparib -treated cohort was not reached, compared 
to 13.8 months for the placebo control (HR 0.30; 95% CI ,0.23 to 0.41; p<0.0001). At the 3-
year timepoint, 60.4% of patients in the olaparib -treated group had no disease progression 
versus 26.9% in the placebo group. Olaparib as maintenance monotherapy led to a substantial 
improvement in PFS in patients with newly diagnosed advanced BRCA mutant ovarian 
cancer patients, with a difference in median PFS for olaparib versus placebo of 
approximately 3 years [Moore, K., et al 2018] .
SOLO2
SOLO2 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3study that evaluated
olaparib (300 mg BID) for the maintenance treatment of platinum -sensitive ,relapsed ovarian 
cancer in patients with g BRCA m.Compared to placebo, olaparib significantly improved 
investigator -assessed median PFS from 5.5 months to 19.1 months (HR 0.30; 95% CI ,0.22
to 0.41; p<0.0001). Overall survival data were immature at the data cutoff [Pujade -Lauraine, 
E., et al 2017] .
Study 19
Study 19 isa Phase 2, randomi zed, double -blind, multic enter study that assessed the efficacy 
of olaparib monotherapy in the maintenance treatment of patients with platinum -sensitive 
serous ovarian cancer, following treatment with 2 or more platinum containing regimens 
[Friedlander, M., et al 2018] . Thirty -two patients (24%) in the study continue d receiving 
olaparib maintenance for over 2 years, and 15 patients (11%) received olaparib maintenance 
for over 6 years. Long -term treatment with olaparib was demonstrated to be well tolerated, 
with no new safety signals observed.
Olympi AD
Olympi AD was a randomized, open -label, P hase 3study that evaluated olaparib
monotherapy (300 mg BID) versus TPC chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic, 
HER2 -, gBRCA mbreast cancer in patients who had received no more than 2previous 
chemotherap y regimens. Compared to TPC, olaparib significantly improved m PFS as 
assessed by BICR (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; HR= 0.58; 95% CI ,0.43 to 0.80; p<0.001). 
Additionally, olaparib significantly improved t he median PFS2 (13.2 months vs. 9.3months ; 
HR: 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.83; p=0.003). Finally, the ORR for olaparib was 59.9% ( 95% 
CI: 52.0 to 67.4; 9% CR) compared to 28.8% (95% CI: 18.3 to 41.3; 1.5% CR) for TPC 
[Robson, M., et al 2017] .
TOPARP
TOPARP w as an open -label, multicenter ,Phase 2investigator -initiated single arm study
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of olaparib (400 mg BID) for the treatment of mCRPC in patients who had 
progressed after 1 or 2 prior treatment regimens. All patients must have received prior 
docetaxel. The primary endpoint, composite RR ,was defined as an ORby RECIST 1.1 , a 
reduction in PSA ≥50% , or a decrease inthe number of CTC from ≥5 to <5 per 7.5mL

blood. The secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, PFS, and OS. Of 49 evaluable 
patients, 16 (32.7%) responded to olaparib (95% CI: 20.0 to 47.5), and 12 patients remained 
on treatment for greater than 6months. Six of 32 patients with RECIST 1.1 -measur able 
disease had radiological responses (18.8 %) and 11 patients had a biochemical response 
(≥50% decrease in PSA). Four responses lasted more than 1 year. Nextgeneration 
sequencing identified homozygous deletions and/or deleterious mutations in DNA repai r 
genes in 16/49 (32.7%) cases, including 7patients with BRCA2 mutations and 5 patients with 
ATM alterations. Of the 16 patients with DNA repair mutations, 14 patients (87.5%) 
responded to olaparib by RR including all 7/7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 bi -allelic somatic 
loss; 3 germline mutations) and 4/5 patients with ATM aberrations. Few responses were 
observed in biomarker -negative patients (2/33 = 6% ORR). Median PFS of the 16 biomarker -
positive patients was 9.8 months with a median OS of 13.8 months . In contrast, in the 
biomarker -negative group, mPFS was2.7 months and m edian OS was7.5months [Mateo, J., 
et al 2015] .
Study 42
Study 42 was a nonrandomized, open -label, multicenter, Phase 2 study of olaparib in patients 
with advanced ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancers and gBRCAm. The ORRs 
reported were 26.2% (78/298, 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) for the total study populati on, 31.1% 
(60/193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1) for ovarian, 12.9% (8/62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9) for breast, 
21.7% ( 5/23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7) for pancreas , and 50.0% (4/8; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) for
prostate cancer [Kaufman , B., et al 2015] .
In summary, olaparib monotherapy treatment has resulted in favorable ORRs in a variety of 
HRRm advanced solid tumors including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. This broad 
response suggests that a strong association between HRRm and olaparib response may be 
tumor -agnostic.
2.2.4 Ongoing Clinical Studies
The Phase 3PRO found clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) isevaluating olaparib in participants
with mCRPC who progressed on prior non hormonal treatments . Participants are randomly

The Phase 3 PAOLA -1 clinical trial ( NCT0 2477644 ) is evaluating olaparib in maintenance 
therapy in participants with high-grade serous or endometrioid advanced ovarian cancer 
(including patients with primary peritoneal and /or fallopian tube cancer) who have res ponded 
following first -line platinum -paclitaxel based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab concomitant 
with chemotherapy and in maintenance (planned for 15 months) . Participants must have 
completed a minimum of 6 and maximum of 9 cycles of first -line platinum -paclitaxel based 
chemotherapy, including a minimum of 3 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the 3 
last cycles of chemotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to olaparib 300 
mg BID or placebo. The primary endpoint is PFS, and secondary efficacy endpoints include : 
PFS2, time to earl iest progression (by RECIST 1.1) or CA-125, TFST , TSST, OS, effects of 
olaparib maintenance compared to placebo, and safety/tolerability .

2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
As olaparib has been found to be well tolerated across various tumor types , a positive 
benefit/risk profile is anticipated .
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical study may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.
NOTE: Based on the data from IA1of safety and efficacy for LYNK -003(data cutoff 10-
MAY -2022), the eDMC recommended stopping the study enrollment for futility based on 
prespecified futility boundary of IA1. The prespecified final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed.
Selected analyses of safety endpoint swill be performed at the end of the study . There will be 
no further analyses of efficacy and P ROendpoints .

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
NOTE: Based on the data from IA1 of safety and efficacy for LYNK -003(data cutoff 10-
MAY -2022), the eDMC recommended stopping the study enrollment for futility based on 
prespecified futility boundary of IA1 .As a result the study team was unblinded and study 
enrollment was stopped (as of 1 8-JUL-2022 ). The prespecified analysis (IA 2,3,4 and FA) of 
the study described in the SAP will not be performed. Study partic ipants randomized to one 
of the two experimental arms ( olaparib plus bevacizumab [Arm 1 ] or olaparib monotherapy 
[Arm 2 ]) must discontinue study intervention. No crossover from either experimental arm to

SOC arm (Arm 3A and Arm 3B) within the study is allowed. Participants on SOC have the 
option to continue receiving study intervention until criteria for discontinuation is met at the 
discretion of the investigator . Participants on SOC will no longer have tumor response 
assessments b y BICR. However, local tumor imaging assessments should continue as per local 
institutional guidelines .
This is aPhase 3 randomized , open -label study of olaparib alone or in combination with 
bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab + 5 -FU or capecitabine in participants with 
unresectable or metastatic CRC that has not progressed following an induction course of 
CAPOX + bevacizumab or FOLFOX + bevacizumab .Approximately 525participants will 
be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms in a 1:1:1 rati oas follows:
Arm 1: Olaparib ( 300 mg BID ) + bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg IV Q2W )
Arm 2: Olaparib ( 300 mg BID )
Arm 3: Bevacizumab ( 5mg/kg IV Q2W ) + 5 -FU (2400 mg/m2IV over 46 to 48 hours 
Q2W )(Arm 3a) or bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg IVQ3W )+capecitabine (1000mg/m2BID
for 14 days, then 7 days off, Q3W )(Arm 3b). The 5-FU regimen may include a bolus of 
5-FU prior to infusion: 400mg/m2IV infusion on Day 1 based on local standards, 
investigator preference, and participant experience with the bolus during the induction 
phase.
Participants who begin study treatment with bevacizumab must remain on bevacizumab 
throughout the study. Participants who begin study treatment with biosimilar bevacizumab 
must remain on the same biosimilar throughout the study.
Randomization will be stratified based on whether the participant experienced SD versus a 
PR or CR to prior CAPOX + bevacizumab or FOLFOX + bevacizumab whether t hey have 
BRAF and/ or Ras mutations versus wild type for both , and whether they received 4to 6
cycles or > 6cycles of CAPOX + bevacizumab or 6 to 8 cycles or >8 cycles of FOLFOX + 
bevacizumab .
The study includes a non -binding futility analysis ( Interim Analysis 1, IA1) to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence to continue the experimental arms. If the PFS HR of 
either Arm 1 or Arm 2 compared to the control arm is less than theprespecified futility 
boundary, the study will continue as planned . Addit ional details regarding interim analyses 
can be found in Section 9.7.
Efficacy will be evaluated using PFS as the primary endpoint using RECIST 1.1 as 
determined by BICR. OS, ORR ,DOR ,and PFS2 will also be assessed. Participants will be 
evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to intervention at regular intervals . 
On study imaging will be assessed every 8weeks ( 56days ± 7days) for 12months and every 
12weeks ( 84days ± 7days) thereafter. After documented PD , participants will receive 
investigator -choice anticancer therapy and will continue to be followed for disease status 
until a PFS2 event is recorded.

All imaging obtained on study, including imaging showing investigator -assessed PD , will be 
submitted to the iCRO for BICR, which will assess the images using RECIST 1.1 for the 
determination of efficacy (Section 8.2.1).The iCRO will also collect scans taken before and 
during Screening and must determine the prior scans areof diagnostic quality and 
confirmation of non -PD by BICR prior to randomization .
Participants may undergo resection of the primary tumor and /ormetastasectomy with 
curative intent after achieving a response to trial therapy that converts previously 
unresectable disease to resectable disease if deemed eligible per the investigator’s discretion 
in a multidisciplinary approach according to his/her i nstitutional standard and with Sponsor 
consultation . After surgery, participants may resume the same therapy that they were 
receiving pre -operatively ,when clinically appropriate and after the surgical wound is fully 
healed .
The first post-operative tumor imaging should be performed at a minimum of (no less than) 4 
weeks after surgery and no more than 8 weeks prior to the next treatment cycle (Section 
8.2.1.2). If treatment does not resume within 8 weeks after surgery the investigator s hould 
consult with the Sponsor.
For participants who undergo surgery with curative intent , a new baseline of tumor burden
will be established as described in Section 8.2.1.2 .
Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing throughout the trial and AEs will be graded in 
severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI CTCAE v 5. Adverse events and
SAE s will be reported by the investigator or delegate from allocation through 30 days 
following cessation of study intervention, or until initiation of reintroduct ion of investigator -
choice of anticancer therapy , whichever is earlier.
Study intervention will continue until documented PD, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness 
that prevents further administration of study intervention, investigator’s decision to 
discontinue the participant, participant withdrawal of consent, pregnancy of the participant, 
or administrative reasons requiring cessation of study intervention (Section 7.1).
Participants who discontinue study intervention for reasons other than documented P D will 
have post -treatment follow -up for disease status (including imaging) until PD .All 
participants will then be followed for disease status until second documented PD, 
withdrawing consent for study participation, or becoming lost to follow -up.Investigator 
assessment of disease status as part of routine clinical practice during the reintroduction of 
investigator -choice of anticancer therapy will be reported to assess for PFS2. No imaging 
will be collected as part of the study to assess or verif y PFS2. Investigators will also provide 
information regarding all anticancer therapies given during the PFS2 follow -up period.
After second documented PD ,each participant will be contacted (eg, by telephone )
approximately every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days) for survival until withdrawal of consent to 
participate in the study, becoming lost to follow -up, death, or end of the study, whichever 
occurs first.

MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
CAPOX is a permitted induction regimen. Participants who received CAPOX/bevacizumab 
as induction, and who are subsequently randomized to the control arm, will receive 
capecitabine and bevacizumab as maintenance. The rationale for this change is based on the 
high utilization of CAPOX as an induction regimen in the community, to the point where 
allowing only FOLFOX/ bevacizumab does not represent real -world practice.
FOLFOX and CAPOX are used interchangeably in CRC, both in the adjuvant and the 
metastatic setting. The NCCN guidelines recommend both of these regimens for first -line 
therapy as equivalent.
BICR confirmat ion of non -PD: the inclusion criteria in this study require a response of SD or 
better to first -line induction. In order to maintain population homogeneity, reduce 
interobserver variability, and ensure all participants enter the trial with the same clinica l 
status, BICR confirmation of non -PD is required prior to randomization.
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3 . Details of each procedur e 
are provided in Section 8 .
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints
This study will use PFS based on RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by BICRas the primary 
endpoint. Progression -free survival is an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a late 
stage study that demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the 
magnitude of the effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk/benefit profile. The use 
of BICR and RECI ST 1.1 to assess PFS is typically considered acceptable by regulatory 
authorities. Images will be submitted to an imaging CRO (iCRO) and read by an independent 
central review blinded to treatment assignment to minimize bias in the response assessments.   
Inaddition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central 
assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment. 
Expedited verification of radiologic progression as determined by central revie w will be 
communicated to the site.
Overall survival will be assessed as a key secondary endpoint ,and ORR and DOR will be 
assessed as additional secondary efficacy endpoints. PFS2 and DCR will be assessed as 
exploratory efficacy endpoint s.
Overall surviva lhas been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of 
superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized clinical studies and will therefore 
be assessed as a key secondary endpoint in the study . However, the anticipated duration
needed to collect adequate OS data to make an accurate conclusion preclude sthe use of OS 
as the primary endpoint in this study.

PRODUCT:MK-7339  69
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 003-05 
MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Objective response rate , DOR , and DCR together are considered acceptable measures of 
clinical benefit and will be assessed. PFS2 is a n additional measure of clinical benefit and is 
most useful in a disease setting where most participants go on to receive similar subsequent 
therap ies. Itis expected for this study that most participants will be restarted on a platinum -
based chemotherapy regimen at progression on study therapy .However, all participants will 
be followed for PFS2 regardless of subsequent therapy.
4.2.1.1.1 RECIST 1.1
RECIST 1.1 , which allows a maximum of 5 target lesion s in total (2 per organ), will be used 
by the BICR and the local site when assessing images for efficacy measures and when 
determining eligibility and for all protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, 
discontinuation of study intervention) (Sectio n 8.2.1) .
4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety parameters frequently used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer 
treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, 
causality, and outcome of AEs/SAEs; and changes in vital signs and laboratory values. 
Adverse events will be assesse d as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0.
4.2.1.3 Patient -reported Outcomes
Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit and accepted by health authorities 
as additional evidence of the risk -benefit profile of any new study intervention . As part of the
analyses for this trial, HRQoL and disease -related symptoms will be investigated among all 
participants via the following assessment tools:
EORTC QLQ C30
EORTC QLQ CR29
EQ-5D-5L
These measures are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are aff ected by both 
disease progression and study intervention tolerability. EQ-5D-5Lwill also be used to 
calculate health utilities for health economic models.
4.2.1.3.1 EORTC QLQ -C30
The EORTC QLQ -C30 was developed to assess the QoL of participants with cancer. It has 
been translated and validated in over 100 languages and used in more than 3000 studies 
worldwide. It contains 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 
3symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, and pain), and 6 single symptom items ( dyspnea, sleep 
disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact) [Aaronson, N. K., et 
al 1993] . It is scored on a 4 -point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3= quite a bit, 4=very much).

PRODUCT:MK-7339  70
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 003-05 
MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
The EORTC QLQ -C30 instrument also contains 1 global health status/QoL scale that use s7-
point scale scoring with anchors (1=very poor and 7=excellent).
4.2.1.3.2 EORTC QLQ -CR29
The EORTC QLQ -CR29, a supplemental colorectal cancer -specific module, comprises 
multi -item and single -item measures of colorectal cancer -associated symptoms and impact. It 
includes 4 scales assessing urinary frequency, fecal seepage, stool consistency, and body 
image, and single items assessing other common problems following colorectal cancer 
therapy.
4.2.1.3.3 EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The 
EQ-5D-5L will provide data for use in economic models and analy ses including developing 
health utilities or quality -adjusted life -years [Rabin, R. and de Charro, F. 2001] . The 5 health 
state dimensions addressed in this instrument are mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ -5D-5L also 
includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the participa nt rates his or 
her general state of health at the time of the assessment. The EQ -5D-5L will always be 
completed by participants first, prior to completing any other PRO instruments. This 
instrument has been used extensively in cancer studies and published results from these 
studies support its validity and reliability [Pickard, A. S., et al 2007] .
4.2.1.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Collection of olaparib PK samples in a limited number of patients (n = 50 in Arm 1 and n =
50 in Arm 2) is proposed to determine the exposure to olaparib. Exposure data along with 
other participant factors can be used to evaluate any potential differences compared to 
established olaparib PK .
4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
PARP inhibitors represent an important class of antitumor agents. However, the mechanism 
of action of t hese new therapies is not completely understood and much remains to be 
learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid 
future patients, it is important to investigate the determinants of respons e or resistance to 
cancer therapy and other treatments administered, as well as determinants of AEs in the 
course of our clinical studies. These efforts may identify novel p redictive/PD biomarkers and 
generate information that may better guide single -agent and combination therapy. To identify 
novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood components, tumor material) will be collected to 
support analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, DNA, RNA, metabolites) and other 
circulating molecules. Investigations of biomarkers that correlate with response or resistance 
to treatment may include but are not limited to:

MK-7339 -003-05FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, SNP analyses, whole exome sequ encing, whole 
genome sequencing)
Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor
The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided 
scientists the opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation 
status, microsatellite instability). To conduct this type of research, it is important to identify 
tumor -specific mutations that occur across all genes in the tumor genome. Thus, genome -
wide approaches may be used for this effort.  
 
 
 
 
irculating tumor DNA and/or RNA may also be evaluated 
from blood samples .
Tumor and bloo d RNA analyses
Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and 
sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed to define gene signatures that 
correlate to clinical response to treatment.  
 
Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor
Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses to identify tumor 
or blood -derived proteins that may also correlate with response . Therefore, tumor tissue may 
be subjecte d to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but are not 
limited to immunoassays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This approach could 
identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection.
Other blood- derived biomarkers
In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, other tumor derived proteins can be shed from 
tumor and released into the blood. Assays such as enzyme -linked immunoassay (ELISA) 
measure such proteins in serum . Correlation of expression with response to therapy may 
identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood, representing a major advance

from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This research would serve to develop 
such assays for future clinical use.
4.2.1.6 Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical r esearch on specimens for which consent was 
provided during this study. This research may include genetic analyses (DNA), gene 
expression profiling ( ribonucleic acid [ RNA ]), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma), 
and/or the measurement of other analytes, depending on whi ch specimens are consented for 
future biomedical r esearch.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented participants. The objective of coll ecting/retaining specimens for 
future biomedical r esearch is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that 
participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the co rrect time. The 
details of this future biomedical r esearch are presented in Appendix 6.
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator
Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and a fluoropyrimidine is frequently used for 
patients with unresectable or metastatic CRC who do not progress following an induction 
course of CAPOX or FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab. Both the ESMO consensus 
guidelines and NCCN practice guidelines for unresectable or metastatic CRC recommend the 
consideration of active maintenance with a fluoro pyrimidine and bevacizumab for patients 
with a good response following first -line chemotherapy and who are experiencing 
unacceptable neurotoxicity due to oxaliplatin . Refer to the approved labeling for 
bevacizumab, 5 -FU, and capecitabine for more informat ion.
4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Rationale for Olaparib Dosing
The dose of olaparib used in this study is 300 mg BID (tablet formulation), which is the 
currently approved dose.
4.3.2 Rationale for 5 -FU Dosing Regimen
5-FU will be administered at anapproved dose and schedule (2400 mg/m2IV over 46 to 48 
hours Q2W) . The 5-FU regimen may include a bolus of 5 -FU prior to infusion: 400mg/m2IV 
infusion on Day 1 based on local standards, investigator preference, and participant 
experience with the bolus during the induction phase. Refer to its approved labeling for more 
information.

4.3.3 Rational efor Capecitabine Dosing Regimen
Capecitabine w ill be administ ered at an approved dose and schedule ( 1000 mg/ m2BID 2 
weeks on, 1 week off , Q3W ). Refer to its approved labeling for more information .
4.3.4 Rationale for Bevacizumab Dosing Regimen
Bevacizumab will be administered at anapproved dose and schedule (5 mg/kg IVQ2W with 
5-FUor 7.5 mg/kg IV Q3W with capecitabine ). Refer to its approved labeling for more 
information.
4.3.4.1 Rationale for Combination Dosing Regimen of Olaparib + Bevacizumab
In a Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of olaparib with 
bevacizumab, 12 participants with advanced solid tumors received increasing doses of 
continuous oral olaparib (100, 200 ,and 400 mg BID) in combination with bevacizumab 
(10mg/kg Q2W )[Dean, E., et al 2012] . No SAEs related to treatment or DLTs were 
reported. The authors concluded the combination of olaparib 400 mg BID(capsule 
formulation) with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W was generally well tolerated with no DLT s
and could be considere d for future clinical investigation. This study will treat participants 
with 300 mg olaparib BID, the current approved dose for olaparib, and 5 mg/kg of 
bevacizumab Q2W as this is the standard recommended dose in combination with FOLFOX 
for unresectable or metastatic CRC. It is expected that combination treatment at these dose 
levels should be safe as they are lower doses than those previously tested.
4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the 
participant is unable to be contacted by the in vestigator). For purposes of analysis and 
reporting, the overall study ends when the Sponsor receives the last laboratory test result or at 
the time of final contact with the last participant, whichever comes last. If the study includes 
countries in the Eu ropean Economic Area (EEA), the local start of the study in the EAA is 
defined as First Site Ready (FSR) in any Member State.
4.4.1 Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination
The clinical study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) o f 
emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population 
as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a)particular 
study site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient com pliance with the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ), and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure -related problems 
or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high .

5 STUDY POPULATION
As of Amendment 0 5, study enroll ment is being stopped for futility. Study participants 
randomized to one of the two experimental arms (olaparib plus bevacizumab [Arm 1 ] or 
olaparib monotherapy [Arm 2 ]) must discontinue study intervention. No crossover from 
either experimental arm to SOC arm (Arm 3A and Arm 3B) within the study is allowed. 
Participants on SOC have the option to continue receiving study intervention until criteria for 
discontinuation is met at the discretion of the investigator.
As stated in the Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials (Appendix 1 , Section 10.1 .1) this study 
includes participants of varying age (as applicable), race, ethnicity, and sex (as applicable). 
The collection and use of these demographic data will follow all local laws and participant 
confidentiality guid elines while supporting the study of the disease, its related factors, and 
the IMP under investigation.
Male/Female participants of at least 18years of age with unresectable or metastatic CRC
who ha venot progressed following prior CAPOX + bevacizumab or FOLFOX + 
bevacizumab will be enrolled in this study.
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also 
known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

All supplies indicated in Table 2will be provided per the "Sourcing" column depending upon 
local country operational requirements. If local sourcing, e very attempt should be made to 
source thes e supplies from a single lot/batch number where possible (eg, not applicable in the 
case where multiple lots or batches may be required due to the length of the study, etc).
Refer to Section 8.1. 9for details regarding administration of the study intervention.
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
6.2.1 Dose Preparation
Bevacizumab , leucovorin, and 5 -FU should be prepared per local and institutional guidelines 
according to the approved product labe ls. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more details 
regarding olaparib administration.
Capecitabine will be given at 1000 mg/m2poBID for Days 1 -14 only of a 21 -day cycle .
As capecitabine is an oral drug available in fixed doses, the dose administered may n ot 
exactly match the calculated dose. Determination of the rounding of capecitabine doses for 
administration should be made according to local institutional practices, with documentation 
of both the calculated and administered dose.
Capecitabine should be prepared and administered per instructions in the package insert. 
Capecitabine will be administered pobased on instructions provided by the investigator. Per 
package insert, it is recommended that capecitabine be administered with food.
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this study is provided in Section 4.3.
6.2.2 Handling, Storage ,and Accountability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention .
Only participants en rolled in the study may receive study intervention , and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention . All study intervention s must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, rec onciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
For all study sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return, or local discard 
and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the

investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented.
The study site is responsible for recording the lot number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor.
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropr iate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
intervention s in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations .
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assign ment
Intervention allocation/randomization will occur centrally using an interactive response 
technology (IRT) system. There are 3study intervention arms. Participants will be assigned 
randomly in a 1:1:1ratio to Arm 1 (olaparib + bevacizumab), Arm 2 (ol aparib monotherapy), 
or Arm 3 a/Arm 3b (bevacizumab + fluoropyrimidine [5-FUor capecitabine ]).
6.3.2 Stratification
Intervention allocation/randomization will be stratified according to the following factors:
1.SD v ersus PR/CR to prior FOLFOX + bevacizumab or CAPOX + bevacizumab induction
2.BRAF mut and/or Ras mut versus BRAF wt + Ras wt
3.Number of induction cycles
For FOLFOX -based induction, 6to 8cycles versus >8 cycles
For CAPOX -based induction, 4 to 6 cycles versus >6 cycles
Note : Stratification is based on the number of cycles of FOLFOX or CAPOX with or 
without bevacizumab .
6.3.3 Blinding
This is an open -label study; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know 
the intervention administered.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Interruptions from the protocol -specified treatment plan for ≥4week s (28 days )require 
consultation b etween the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of the 
collaborative decision on participant management.

MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Participants should be given clear instructions on how and when to take their study 
intervention. Participants will self -administer olaparib except when a clinic visit is scheduled. 
Study site staff will make tablet counts at regular intervals during treatment. After the tablet 
count has been performed, the remaining tablets will not be returned to the pa rticipant but 
will be retained by the investigative site until reconciliation is completed by the study 
monitor. Olaparib compliance will be calculated by the Sponsor based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the Sponsor/designee. All 
participants mu st return their bottle(s) of olaparib at the appropriate scheduled visit, when a 
new bottle will be dispensed. Participants will be instructed to notify study site personnel of 
missed doses.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
All concomitant medications received within 2 8 days prior to the first dose of study 
intervention and up to 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be recorded. 
Concomitant medications administered >30 days after the last dose of study intervention
should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 8.4.7.
Based on limited in vitro data, olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, 
organic -anion -transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, organic cation transporter (OCT)1/2/3, 
and mult idrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)1/2 and reduce exposure to substrates 
of CYP2B6. Caution should be observed if substrates of these isoenzymes or transporter 
proteins are co -administered. A current list of substrates can be found at the following 
website:
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug -interactions -labeling/drug -development -and-drug-
interactions -table -substrates -inhibitors -and-inducers
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the dis cretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription, OTC products, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes 
occur durin g the study period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
should also be included on the eCRF .
6.5.1 Leucovorin /Levoleucov orin
Leucovorin ( calcium folinate/folinic acid/calcium leucovorin, 400mg/m2, IV infusion Q2W) 
or levoleucovorin (200 mg/ m2, IV infusion, Q2W) may be used in Arm 3 awith 5 -FU at the 
investigator’s discretion , and in accordance with local standards .
6.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (Section 5.2) are 
not allowed during Screening and during the study intervention phase of the ongoing study. 
If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination s pecifically prohibited, 
discontinuation from study intervention may be required. The investigator should discuss any

questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical Director. The final decision on any 
supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the participant’s primary 
physician. However, the decision to continue the participant on study intervention requires 
the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor, and the participant.
Listed below are specific concomitant therapi es or vaccinations that are prohibited during the 
study (exceptions noted):
Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy not specified in this 
protocol.
Investigational agents other than olaparib.
Radiation therapy for disease control.
Note: Radiation therapy to symptomatic lesions or to the brain may be allowed following 
Sponsor consultation.
Live or live -attenuated vaccines within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention 
and while participating in the study. 
Note: Any licensed COVID -19 vaccine (including for Emergency Use) in a particular 
country is allowed in the study as long as they are mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vaccines,

There ar e no prohibited therapies during the post-treatment follow -up phase .
For participants being treated with capecitabine, bevacizumab , leucovorin or 5-FU, refer to 
their approved labeling for additional prohibited therapies.
6.5.3 Rescue Medications and Supportive Care
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.
6.6 Dose Modification Guidelines
NCI CTCAE v5.0 must be used to grade the severity of AEs. If appropriate, the investigator 
may attribute each toxicity event to olaparib, bevacizumab, capecitabine or 5-FU alone, or to 
any combination of these agents, and follow the dose modification guidelines accordingly 
below. If a participant experiences se veral toxicities and there are conflicting 
recommendations, following the most conservative dose adjustment is recommended (dose 
reduction appropriate for the most severe toxicity).
Reduction or holding of 1 agent and not the other agents is appropriate if , in the opinion of 
the investigator, the toxicity is clearly related to 1 of the study drugs .If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the toxicity is related to a combination of agents, both drugs should be held 
according to recommended dose modifications .
If toxicity does not revolve to Grade 0 or 1 within 12 weeks after the last dose, study 
treatment should be discontinued after consultation with the Sponsor. With investigator and 
Sponsor agreement, participants with a laboratory AE still at Grade 2 afte r 12 weeks may 
continue treatment in the study if the AE is asymptomatic and controlled. After any Grade 4 
drug-related AE, participants should not restart study treatment without consultation with the 
Sponsor.
6.6.1 Olaparib Dosing Modifications
Any toxicity ob served during the course of the study that the investigator believes 
attributable to olaparib could be managed by interruption of olaparib treatment or dose 
reduction. Repeated interruptions, not exceeding 4 weeks (28 days) duration, are allowed as 
require d. If the interruption is any longer, it must be agreed to by the Sponsor.
The dose of o laparib can be reduced to 250 mg BID initially and then to 200 mg BID as 
needed (except in specific instances as described in Sections 6.6.1.1 through 6.6.1.3) . If the 
200 mg BID dose is not tolerable, no further dose reduction is allowed, and study 
intervention should be discontinued . Once the dose has been reduced, escalation is not 
permitted ( except following concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors –see Section 
6.6.1.3.4 ).
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses) and t he reason (s)for the 
dose interruption /reduction should be captured on the appropriate eCRF.

In Arm 1, ifolaparib is discontinued due to toxicity the participant must discontinue study 
treatment and enter the follow -up phase of the study. If bevacizumab is discontinued due to 
toxicity, the participant may remain on study treatment receiving olaparib alone.
In Arm 3 a/Arm 3b , if 5-FU or capecitabine is discontinued due to toxicity the participant 
must discontinue study treatment and enter the follow -up phase of the study. If bevacizumab 
is discontinued due to toxicity, the participant may remain on study treatment recei ving 5-FU 
or capecitabine alone.
6.6.1.1 Management of Hematological Toxicities
Dose modification guidelines and supportive care guidelines for hematological toxicities that

AEs of neutropenia and leukopenia should be managed as deemed appropriate by the investigator with close follow -
up and interruption of study intervention if CTCAE Grade 3 or worse neutropenia occurs.
Primary prophylaxis with G -CSF is not recommended; however, if a participant develops febrile neutropenia, study 
intervention should be stopped and appropriate management including G -CSF shou ld be given according to local 
hospital guidelines. Please note that G -CSF should not be used within at least 24 hours (7 days for PEGylated G -
CSF) of the last dose of study intervention unless absolutely necessary.
Platelet transfusions, if indicated, sho uld be done according to local hospital guidelines.
The management of prolonged hematological toxicities is detailed in Section 6.6.1.2.
6.6.1.2 Management of Prolonged Hematological Toxicities
If a participant develops prolonged hematological toxicity such as:
≥2 week interruption/delay in study intervention due to Grade 3 or worse anemia and/or 
the development of blood transfusion dependence
≥2 week interruption/delay in study intervention due to Grade 3 or worse neutropenia 
(absolute neutrophil count <1 ×109/L)
≥2 week interruption/delay in study intervention due to Grade 3 or worse 
thrombocytopenia and/or development of platelet transfusion dependence (platelets 
<50×109/L)
Differential blood count, including reticulocytes and peripheral blood smear, should be 
checked weekly. If any blood parameters remain clinically abnormal after the dosing of 
olaparib has been interrupted for ≥4 weeks (≥28 days), the participant should be referred to a 
hematologist for further inv estigations. Bone marrow analysis and/or blood cytogenetic 
analysis should be considered, according to local regulation and/or standard institutional 
hematological practice. Study intervention should be discontinue d if blood counts do not 
recover to NCI CTCAE v5 Grade 1 or better within 4 weeks (28 days) of dose interruption.

Development of confirmed MDS or other clonal blood disorder should be reported as an SAE 
and full reports must be provided by the investigator to the Sponsor as outlined in 
Section 8.4.4. Olaparib intervention should be discontinued for confirmed MDS and/or AML 
(Section 7.1).
6.6.1.3 Management of Non -hematologic Toxicity
Repeat eddose interruptions , not exceeding 4 weeks (28 days) duration, are allowed as 
required. If toxicity reoccurs following rechallenge with study intervention, and where 
further dose interruptions are considered inadequate for management of toxicity, either a 
dose reduction should be considered (Section 6.6.1) or the participant mus t permanently 
discontinue study intervention.
Treatment must be interrupted if any Grade 3 or 4 AE occurs that the investigator considers 
to be related to administration of olaparib .
6.6.1.3.1 Management of New or Worsening Pulmonary Symptoms
If new or worsening pul monary symptoms (eg, dyspnea) or radiological abnormalities occur 
in the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in study intervention dosing is 
recommended and further diagnostic workup (including a high-resolution CT scan) should be 
performed to ex clude pneumonitis.
Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and 
symptoms resolve, then study intervention can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by the 
investigator. If significant pulmonary abnormalities are identi fied, these must be discussed 
with the Sponsor.
6.6.1.3.2 Management of Nausea and Vomiting
Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib intervention. These 
events are generally mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity, intermittent, and
manageable on continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the first month of 
intervention for nausea and within the first 6 months of intervention for vomiting. For 
nausea, the incidence generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting at around 6 to 
7 months.
No routine prophylactic anti -emetic treatment is required at the start of study intervention; 
however, participants should receive appropriate anti -emetic treatment at the first onset of 
nausea or vomiting and as required thereaft er, in accordance with local regulations or 
institutional guidelines. Alternatively, olaparib tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack 
(ie, 2 pieces of toast or a couple of biscuits).
As per international guidance on anti -emetic use in cancer patients ,generally a single agent 
anti-emetic should be considered (eg, dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines, or 
dexamethasone).

6.6.1.3.3 Management of Renal Impairment
If after study entry and/or while still on study therapy, a participant’s estimated CrCl falls 
below the threshold for study inclusion ( ≥50mL/min), retesting should be performed 
promptly.
A dose reduction is recommended for participants who develop moderate renal impairment 
(calculated CrCl between 31 and 50 mL/min as calculated by Cockcroft -Gault e quation) for 
any reason during the course of the study (Table 5).

Initial Dose Moderate Renal Impairmenta
300 mg BID 200 mg BID
Abbreviation: BID = twice daily .
a. Creatinine clearance of 31 to 50 mL/min as calculated by Cockcroft -Gault equation.
Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the 
CrCl falls to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the investigator should use his or her discretion in 
determining whether a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is warranted.
Olaparib has not been studied in participants with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl ≤30mL/min) or end -stage renal disease; if participants develop severe impairment or 
end-stage disease ,it is recommended that olaparib be discontinued.
6.6.1.3.4 Dose Reductions for Concurrent CYP3A4 Inhibitor Use
Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should not be taken with olaparib. If there is no 
suitable alternative concomit ant medication ,then the dose of olaparib should be reduced for 
the period of concomitant administration as described in Table 6. After the washout of the 
inhibitor is co mplete (Section 5.2), the olaparib dose can be re -escalated. Note:After 
washout of the CYP3A4 drug ,dosing of olaparib can immediately resume at the normal 
dosing level –no step -wise titration needed). The dose reduction of olaparib should be 
recorded in the eCRF with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A 4inhibitor use .

6.6.1.4 Interruptions for Non -toxicity Related Events
Olaparib dose interruption sfor conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept as 
short as possible. If a participant cannot restart study treatment within 4 weeks for resolution
of intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or toxicity, the case should be
discussed with the Sponsor’s clinical director. All dose reductions and interruptions 
(including any missed doses), and the reasons for the reductions/interruptions , per drug 
accountability and participant feedback reconciliation, are to be recorded in the eCRF. Study 
treatment should be stopped at least 3 days prior to planned surgery. After surgery, study 
treatment can be restarted when the wound has healed. Study treatment should be 
discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a participant undergoes radi ation treatment. 
Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has 
recovered.
6.6.2 Bevacizumab , Capecitabine, Leucovorin ,and 5 -FU DoseModifications
Bevacizumab , capecitabine, leucovorin ,and 5 -FU doses may be modified in accordance with 
their approved labeling and local practice guidelines.
6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study
There is no study -specified intervention following the end of the study.
6.8 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
This stu dy is open -label; therefore, the participant, the study site personnel, the Sponsor, 
and/or designee are not blinded. Study intervention (name, strength, or potency) is included 
in the label text; random code/disclosure envelopes or lists are not provided.
7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discont inuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants 
who discontinue study intervention prior to completi on of the protocol -specified treatment 
period will still continue to participate in the study as specified in Section 1.3 and Section 
8.11.3.
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be d iscontinued 
from the study inter vention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or
for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be

performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.1. 10 and Section 
8.11.3.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention but c ontinue to be monitored in 
the study for any of the following reasons:
•The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study intervention.
•Documented radiographic disease progression outlined in Section 8.2.1 .
Note: As of Amendment 05, participants remaining on SOC (Arm 3A and Arm 3B) 
should be discontinued from study intervention basedon investigator assessment of 
radiographic disease progression .
•Any progression or recurrence of any malignancy, or any occurre nce of another 
malignancy, that requires treatment.
•Bone marrow findings consistent with MDS or AML .
•The participant interrupts study intervention administration for more than 28consecutive 
days without Sponsor consultation .
•The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the opinion of 
the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued 
administration of study intervention.
•The participant has a confirmed positive pregnancy test.
For participants who are discontinued from study intervention but continue to be monitored 
in the study, all visits and procedures, as outlined in the SoA, should be completed.
Discontinuation from study intervention is “permanent.” Once a participant is dis continued, 
he/she shall not be allowed to restart study intervention .
7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legally 
acceptable representative withdraws consent from the stud y.
If a participant withdraws from the study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits.
Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, as well as specific d etails regarding withdrawal from future biomedical r esearch, are 
outlined in Section 8.1. 10. The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedly

fail to return for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the participant 
are outlined in Section 7.3.
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
•The site must attemp t to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.
•The investigator or designee must make every effort t o regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last 
known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medic al record.
Note: A participant is not considered lost to follow -up until the last scheduled visit for the 
individual participant. The missing data for the participant will be managed via the 
prespecified statistical data handling and analysis guidelines .
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by 
appropriately qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of study 
site personnel responsibilities will be docu mented in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or 
equivalent).
•All study -related medica l decisions must be made by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician .
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening lo g to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA.

•Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, Hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the pa rticipant. In these 
cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study
can be found in the Laboratory Manual .Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for 
safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.
8.1 Administrative and General Procedures

8.1.9 Study Intervention Administrati on
Chemotherapy will be administered according to the specifications within the Pharmacy 
Manual .
Olaparib will be administered by the investigator and/or study staff onDay 1 of each cycle 
according to the specifications within the Pharmacy Manual .Participants will then self -
administer olaparib orally for the remainder of the study intervention period.
Study intervention can be administered within ± 3 days of the target ed Day 1 for each cycle, 
except Cycle 1, when intervention can only be administered within + 3 days of the targeted 
Day 1.
8.1.9.1 Timing of Dose Administration
8.1.9.1.1 Olaparib
Olaparib will be administered at a dose of 300 mg poBID.
Olaparib tablets should be taken with one glass of water twice a day at the same time each 
day, approximately 12 hours (±2h) between doses. The table ts should be swallowed whole 
and not chewed, crushed, dissolved ,or divided. Olaparib tablets can be taken with or without 
food. If vomiting occurs shortly after olaparib table ts are swallowed, the dose should only be 
replaced if all the intact tablets can be seen and counted. Should any participant enrolled on 
the stu dy miss a scheduled dose for any reason (eg, because of forgetting to take the tablets 
or vomiting), the participant will be allowed to take the scheduled dose up to a maximum of 
2 hours after that scheduled dose time. If it is more than 2 hours after the scheduled dose 
time, the missed dose is not to be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at 
the next scheduled time.
Participants must be instructed that if they miss a dose or vomit at any time after taking a 
dose, they should take the ir next dose at its scheduled time. The site will validate compliance 
with study intervention (including missed or vomited doses) at each site visit according to its 
standard operating procedure. If doses are missed or vomited, this must be indicated in th e 
source documents and CRFs.

8.1.10 Discontinuation and Withdraw al
Participants who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the treatment period
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA and Section 8.1 1.3.
When a participant withdraws from particip ation in the study, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the end of treatment should be performed (at the time of withdrawal). Any AEs
that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8.4 and Section 8.11.4 .
8.1.10.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resear ch
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may 
withdraw consent at any time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical 
records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using 
the designated mailbox ( clinical.specimen.management@msd.com ). Subsequently, the 
participant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent 
from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in progress 
at the time of request for withdrawal or already perfo rmed prior to the request being received 
by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. 
No new analyses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main st udy are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal infor mation and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed .
8.1.11 Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng
This is an open -label study; there is no blinding for this study.
8.1.12 Calibration of Equipme nt
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibra ted and /ormaintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible.

8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts
8.2.1 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
As of Amendment 05 ,central tumor response assessments will be discontinued. Imaging 
scans will no longer be submitted to iCRO nor read by BICR. The subsections below are 
retained for reference.
However, for participants who are still on SOC treatment and will c ontinue receiving SOC 
treatment until criteria for discontinuation are met, local tumor imaging should continue per
local institutional guidelines. .
The process for image collection and transmission to the iCRO is given in the SIM.
Tumor imaging should be acquired by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, or contrast -
enhanced MRI when CT is contraindicated or when mandated by local practice (CT is 
strong ly preferred). MRI is the strongly preferred modality for imaging the brain. The same 
imaging modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a 
participant throughout the study to optimize reproducibility of assessment of exis ting and 
new tumor burden and improve accuracy of assessment of response or progression based on 
imaging. Tumor imaging by CT (or MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is required at 
every scheduled imaging time point. Brain imaging should only be perform ed as clinically 
indicated.
All scheduled images for all participants from the sites will be submitted to the iCRO . In 
addition, images (including via other modalities) obtained at an unscheduled time point to 
determine disease progression, as well as imag ing obtained for other reasons but that
demonstrate radiologic progression, should be submitted to the iCRO .
When the investigator identifies radiographic progression, the iCRO will perform expedited 
verification of radiologic PD and communicate the result s to the study site and Sponsor. 
Study intervention should continue until PD has been verified. Images should continue to be 
submitted to the iCRO .In clinically stable participants, imaging should continue until PD has 
been verified by BICR (if initial si te-assessed PD was not verified by BICR, each subsequent 
scan must be submitted to theiCRO for verification of PD until PD has been verified by 
BICR) .
Assessment of treatment response will be according to RECIST 1.1 (some limitation is 
described in Sectio n 8.2.1.2) .
8.2.1.1 Tumor Imaging During Screening
Tumor imaging at Screening must be performed within 28 days prior to the date of 
randomization. Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management is 
08HF0N
PRODUCT:  MK-7339  104
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
acceptable for use in place of the S creening tumor imaging if it is of diagnostic quality and 
was performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization and can be assessed by the 
iCRO.
Upon completion of the Screening tumor imaging ,the investigator must confirm that the 
participant ’s disease did not progress prior to randomization. Non-PD must be verified by 
BICR prior to randomization , based on the images submitted to iCRO as describe d in 
inclusion criterion 4 .
Participant swho do not have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 at Screening because of a 
CR or PR to the induction regimen are still eligible for the study.
8.2.1.2 Tumor Imaging During the Study
In the first year, on study imaging asse ssments must be performed every 8 weeks (56 days, 
±7 days) from the date of randomization. After the first year, imaging assessments must be 
performed every 12 weeks (84 days, ± 7 days). All supplemental imaging must also be 
submitted to the iCRO .
Timing of imaging should follow calendar days from the date of randomization and should 
not be adj usted for delays in cycle starts.
For participants who undergo surgery with curative intent , imaging must be performed at a 
minimum of (no less than) 4 weeks after surgery and no more than 8 weeks prior to the next 
treatment cycle. The last set of imaging prior to restart of treatment will be used to establish a 
new baseline of tumor burden. Subsequent imaging will be compared to this new baseline 
and the visit responses will be limited to PD, non -PD, or not evaluable; these new post -
operative images will b e assessed every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) for 12 months and every 
12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days) thereafter. After documented PD, participants will receive 
investigator -choice anticancer therapy and will continue to be followed for disease status 
until a PF S2 event is recorded .
8.2.1.3 End-of-treatment and Follow -up Tumor Imaging
For participants who discontinue study intervention, tumor imaging should be performed at 
the time of treatment discontinuation (± 4-week window). If previous imaging was obtained 
within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, imaging at treatment discontinuation is 
not mandatory.
For participants who discontinue study intervention without documented disease progression, 
every effort should be made to continue monitoring disease status by tumor imaging with the 
same schedule used while on treatment until the start of new anticancer treatment, disease 
progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard during the 
Screening period .Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history. After the first dose of study intervention, new clinically significant abnormal 
findings should be recorded as AEs. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded.
At visits that do not require a full physical examination (Section 1.3 ), brief directed physical 
examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) per institutional standard .New clinically significant abnormal 
findings should be reco rded as AEs.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.3.2 Vital Signs

8.3.4 Clinical Safety La boratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form 
(CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
•All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the SoA .
•If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinicall y significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
•For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 30days after the last dose of study intervention , every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
8.3.4.1 Bone Marrow or Blo od Cytogenetic Samples
Bone marrow or blood cytogenetic samples may be collected for participants with prolonged 
hematological toxicities as defined in Section 6.6.1.2.
Bone marrow analysis should include an aspirate for cellular morphology, cytogenetic 
analysis and flow cytomet ry, and a core biopsy for bone marrow cellularity. If it is not 
possible to conduct cytogenetic analysis or flow cytometry on the bone marrow aspirate, then 
attempts should be made to perform the tests on a blood sample .
8.3.5 Pregnancy Test
Pregnancy testing (u rine or serum) should be conducted according to Section 1.3 (SoA) and 
at the end of relevant systemic exposure for all arms.

8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an AEas described in Section 8.4.6
and Appendix 3.
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other r eportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an SAE was associated with a medication error, misuse, or 
abuse. Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable 
safety events for outcome according to Section 8.4 .3.
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with respect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality .
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collectin g AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent but before intervention allocation/randomization must be 
reported by the invest igator if the participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in 
treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a 
protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuatio n of 
usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.
•All AEs from the time of intervention allocation/randomization through 30 days 
following cessation of study intervention must be reported by the investigator.
•All AEs meeting serious crit eria, from the time of inte rvention allocation/randomization 
through 30 days following cessation of study intervention or 30 days following cessation 
of study intervention if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is 
earlier, must be reported by the investigator .
•All pregnancies and exposure during breastfee ding, from the time of intervention
allocation/randomization through 1 80 days following cessation of study intervention, or 
30 days following cessation of study intervention if the participant initiates new 
anticancer therapy must be reported by the investigator.

•Any SAE of MDS/AML or new primary malignancy occurring 30 days after the last dose 
of olaparib should be reported regardless of the investigator’s assessment of causality or 
knowledge of the treatment arm.
•Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event 
is considered related to study intervention .
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE sor SAE sor other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
conside rs the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 7.
Adverse events of special interest are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the 
further un derstanding of olaparib’s safety profile and require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigators to the Sponsor . Adverse events of special interest for 
olaparib comprise the Important Identified Risk of MDS/AML and the Important Potential
Risks of new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE sand/or SAE sand other 
reportable safety events. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safety events ,
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). In 
addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in
randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given 
in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
sothat legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and ot her 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB /IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator wh o receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements .
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to 
the investigator or their designe e) that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, f etal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.

AEs or SAEs
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to the Sponsor as described 
in Section 8.4.1.
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.
The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the participants in the study. Any suspected endpoint that upon review is 
not progression of the can cer under study will be forwarded to Global Pharmacovigilance as 
an SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under 
study.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s)
Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. 
Events of clinical interest for this study include: 
•An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section 8.5 , that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.
•An elevated AST or ALT lab v alue that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less 
than 2X the upp er limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of ab normal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File 
Binder (or equivalent).
Any event of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy, or pneumonitis should be reported 
whether it is considered a non -serious AE (eg non -melanoma skin cancer) or SAE and 
regardless of Investigator’s assessment of causality.
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
Olaparib must only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in this protocol. 
Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen specified in this protocol 
should be reported as an overdose.

8.6 Pharmacokinetics
As of Amendment 05, t he collection of blood samples for PK wascompleted and is no longer 
applicable. The section below is retained for reference.
A minimum of 100 PK samples are anticipated to be collected. Pharmacokinetic sample 
collections are currently planned in a limited number of pa rticipants (n = 50 in Arm 1 and n = 
50 in Arm 2) . Based on known non -overlapping clearance pathways for bevacizumab and 
olaparib, PK drug -drug interaction is not expected . The PK of olaparib in combination with 
bevacizumab has been evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors and no impact on PK 
of olaparib was seen in this study [Dean, E., et al 2012] .The PK profile of olaparib is well 
charac terized and additional PK data will be available from ongoing studies in solid tumor 
indications (eg, SOLO3 , PROfound, and LYNK -002).

8.8.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection
The p lanned genetic a nalysis sample should be drawn for planned analysi s of the association 
between genetic variants in DNA and drug response. This sample will not be collected at the 
site if there is either a local law or regulation prohibiting collection, or if the IRB/IEC does 
not approve the collection of the sample for t hese purposes. If the sample is collected, 
leftover extracted DNA will be stored for future biomedical research if the participant 
provides documented informed consent for future biomedical research . If the planned genetic
analysis is not approved, but fut ure biomedical r esearch is approved and consent is given, 
this sample will b e collected for the purpose of future biomedical r esearch.
The planned genetic analysis sample should be obtained predose on Day 1 but may be 
collected at the next scheduled blood draw, if needed. Sample collection, storage, and 
shipment instruct ionsfor planned genetic analysis samples will be in the 
Operations/ Laboratory Manual.

8.11.4.2 Follow -up Vis its
As of Amendment 05 ,follow -up visits for assessment of efficacy will be discontinued for all 
participants . All participants will move into survival follow -up phase (Section 8.11.4.4) . The 
section below is retained for reference.
Participants who discon tinue study intervention for a reason other than BICR -verified disease 
progression will move into the follow -up phase and should be assessed every 8 weeks
(56days ± 7 days) for the first year and every 12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days) thereafter , from 
the date of randomization, to coincide with the imaging schedule at the time of 
discontinuation from study intervention. to monitor disease status. Every effort should be 
made to collect information regarding disease status until the start of new anticancer therap y, 
disease progression, death, or the end of study , whichever occurs first . Information regarding 
post-study anticancer treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated.
8.11.4.3 PFS2 Follow -up
As of Amendment 05 ,PFS2 follow -up visits will be discontinued for all participants . All 
participants will move into survival follow -up phase (Section 8.11.4.4) . The section below is 
retained for reference.
After disease progression, sites should continue to provide updates regarding the participant’s 
disease status until subsequent disease progression occurs, death, withdrawal of consent, or 
the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
Participants will be assessed every 8 weeks for a second progression (using the participant’s 
status at first progression as the ref erence for assessment of second progression). A 
participant’s progression status is defined according to local standard clinical practice and 
may involve radiological or symptomatic progression or death. Copies of the participants 
radiological scans are no t required to be sent to the iCRO and RECIST measurements will 
not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and investigator 
determination of progression status (progressed or non -progressed) at each assessment will 
be recorded in t he eCRF.
8.11.4.4 Survival Follow -up
As of Amendment 05, for all participants , survival follow -up visits will continue until the
final efficacy evaluation ..Those participants remaining on SOC (Arm 3A and Arm 3B) at the 
time of Amendment 05 should continue to be mo nitored in the study through the AE 
reporting period (Section 8.4). The section below is retained for reference. 
Participants who experience second disease progression will move into the survival follow -
up phase and should be contacted (eg, by telephone )approximately every 12 weeks to assess 
for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever 
occurs first. Investigators will be directed to ask during the regular follow -up for OSif the 
participant has developed MDS/A ML or a new primary malignancy and will be prompted to 
report any such cases.

To ensure current and complete survival data is available at the time of database locks, 
updated survival status may be requested during the course of the study b y the Sponsor. For 
example, updated survival status may be requested prior to but not limited to an eDMC 
review, interim and/or final analysis. Upon Sponsor notification, all participants who do 
not/will not have a scheduled study visit or study contact du ring the Sponsor defined time 
period will be contacted for their survival status (excluding participants that have a 
previously recorded death event in the collection tool).
9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The study
team has been unblinded (as of 1 8-JUL-2022). Changes made to primary and/or key 
secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses that occurred 
prior to Amendment 05 were documented in previous protocol amendments(s) (consistent 
with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to exploratory or other non -confirmatory analyses made 
after the protocol has been finalized, but prior to the conduct of any an alysis , will be 
documented in a nsSAP and referenced in the CSR for the study. Aseparate biomarker 
analysis plan will be provided. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the 
CSR. The PRO analysis plan will also be included in the sSAP .
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
As of Amendment 05: The SAP is amended as follows :
NOTE: Based on the data from IA1, an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LYNK -003 
(data cutoff 10-MAY -2022), eDMC recommended stopping the study enrollment for futi lity 
based on prespecified futility boundary of IA1. Based upon the recommendation of the 
eDMC, the study team was unblinded (as of 1 8-JUL-2022). The prespecified interim 
analyses 2, 3, 4 ,andfinal analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be performed. 
Selected analyses of safety endpoints will be performed at the end of the study; there will be 
no further analyses of efficacy and PRO endpoints. The SAP summary has been updated 
accordingly .
Key elements of the statistical analysis plan are summarized below; the comprehensive plan 
is provided in Sections 9.2through 9.12.

Study Design Overview A Phase 3 randomized, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of olaparib alone or in combination with bevacizumab compared to 
bevacizumab with a fluoropyrimidine in participants with unresectable or 
metastatic CRC who have not progressed following first -line induction .
Treatment Assignment Approximately 525participant s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to3
treatment groups (1) olaparib + bevacizum ab,(2) olaparib and (3) 
bevacizumab + 5-FUor bevacizumab + capecitabine (Control) . 
Stratification factors are 1) SD v ersus PR/CR to prior FOLFOX + 
bevacizumab or CAPOX + bevacizumab induction ,2) BRAF mut and/or 
Rasmut versus BRAF wt+ Ras wt, and 3) 6to 8cycles of induction v ersus >8 
cycles for FOLFOX -based induction, and 4 to 6 cycles versus >6 cycles for 
CAPOX -based induction .
This is an open -label study .
As of Amendment 05, study enrollment is being stopped for futility. Study 
participants randomized to one of the two experimental arms (olaparib plus 
bevacizumab [Arm 1 ]or olaparib monotherapy [Arm 2 ])must discontinue 
study intervention. No crossover from either experimental arm to SOC arm 
(Arm 3A and Arm 3B) within the study is allowed. Participants on SOC 
have the option to continue receiving study intervention until criteria for 
discontinuation is met at the discretion of the investigator.

Interim Analyses As of Amendment 05, the prespecified interim analys es 2, 3, 4 ,and final 
analysis described in the SAP will not be performed.
The study includes a non-binding futility analysis (IA1)to dete rmine 
whether there is sufficient evidence to continue the experimental arms.
Three IAs beyond IA1 are planned in addition to the final analysis.
•Interim analysis 1 (IA1) : non-binding futility analysis ( ~119PFS
events have been observed for both treatment comparisons [119events 
in Arm 1 plus Control; and 119events in Arm 2 plus Control ], 
expected to occur ~19months after study start):
-If the P FS HR of either Arm 1 or Arm 2 compared to the control 
arm is less than the pre specified futility boundary, the study may 
continue as planned .
•Interim analysis 2(IA2): ~238 PFS events have been observed for at 
least one treatment comparison ( 238events in Arm1 plus Control or 
238 events in Arm 2 plus Control), ~ 117deaths are expected in the se
2 arms (Arm 1 plus Control or Arm 2 plus Control) when~238 PFS
events are observed, expected to occur ~30months after study start .
-Interim PFS and OS analys es
•Interim analysis 3(IA3): ~297PFS events have been observed for both 
treatment comparisons (297events in Arm 1 plus Control; and 2 97
events in Arm 2 plus Control) ,~174deaths are expected for both 
treatment compari sons, expected to occur ~42 months after study start .
-Final PFS analysis
-Interim OS analysis
•Interim analysis 4 (IA4): ~228deaths have occurred for at least 1
treatment comparison (228deaths in Arm 1 plus Control or 2 28deaths 
in Arm 2 plus Control) , expected to occur ~ 58 months after study start
-Interim OS analysis
•Final analysis: ~268deaths have occurred for both treatment 
comparisons (268deaths in Arm 1 plus Control; and 2 68deaths in 
Arm 2 plus Control) , expected to occur ~ 78 months after study start
-Final OS analysis 
Multiplicity The Type -I error rate over the multiple treatment comparisons and primary 
and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided) .
Asmall alpha penalty of 0.01% will be paid for thefutility analysis (split 
equally between the 2treatment comparisons) .The remaining alpha will be 
initially equally split between the 2treatment comparisons to test PFS 
(1.245% for each treatment comparison : Arm 1 vs. Control and Arm 2 vs. 
Control) . If a test for PFS is significant, then the secondary OS endpoint 
will be tested for that arm . The graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz
[Bretz, F., et al 2009] will be applied to re -allocate alpha among the
hypotheses of PFS and OS . Lan -DeMets O’Brien -Fleming group sequential
methods will be used to allocate alpha among the interim and final 
analyses. The study will be considered positive if thePFS hypothesis test is 
positive for either treatment comparison (Arm 1 vs.Control , and/ or Arm 2 
vs.Control).

Sample Size and Power As of Amendment 05, the prespecified interim analys es 2, 3, 4 ,and final 
analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be performed.
The planned sample size is approximately 525participants. For PFS, based 
on 297events at IA3 , the study has 88% power to detect a nHR of 0.65 at 
α=1.2 45% (1 -sided) for each treatment comparison (Arm 1 vs. Control, or 
Arm 2 vs. Control) , with assumed PFS median of 7 months in the control 
arm. For OS, based on 268events at the final analysis , the study has 53% 
(73%) power to detect an HR of 0.75 (0.70) at α=1. 245% (1 -sided) for each 
treatment comparison , with assumed OS median of 24 months in the 
control arm.
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor .
The Sponsor will generate the randomized allocation schedule(s) for study treatment 
assignment for this protocol, and the randomization will be implemented in I RT.
This study is being conducted as an open -label study ;therefore ,participants, investigators, 
and Sponsor personnel will be aware of participant treatment assignments after each 
participant is enrolled and treatment is assigned. Although the study is open -label, analyses 
or summaries generated by randomized interventio n assignment, or actual intervention 
received will be limited and documented. In addition, the independent radiologist(s) will 
perform the central imaging review without knowledge of intervention group assignment.
9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation
Objectives and hypot heses of the study are stated in Section 3.
9.4 Analysis Endpoints
Efficacy and safety endpoints that will be evaluated are listed below.
9.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints

The analysis of PFS2 and DCR will be described in the sSAP.
9.4.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, 
including AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Furthermore, specific 
events will be collected and designated as ECIs as described in Section 8.4.7.
9.4.3 PRO Endpoints
The following exploratory PRO endpoints will be evaluated as described in Section 4.2.1.3 :
•Global health status/QoL of the EORTC QLQ -C30 (items 29 and 30)
•The multi -item and single -item scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30
•The multi -item and single -item scales of the EORTC QLQ -CR29
•Health utilities as assessed using the EQ -5D-5L
These analyses will be described in the sSAP.
9.5 Analysis Populations
9.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Population
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint are based on the ITT population. All randomized 
participants will be included in this population. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment 
arm to which they are randomized. Details of the approach to handling missing data are 
provided in Section 9.6.

Participants who ent er the study without measurable disease will be excluded from the ORR 
and DCR analysis.
9.5.2 Safety Analysis Population
The APaT population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The APaT 
population consists of all randomized participants w ho receive at least 1 dose of study 
treatment. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment arm corresponding to the study 
treatment they actually receive d. For most participants, this will be the treatment group to 
which they are randomized. Participant s who receive incorrect study treatment for the entire 
treatment period will be included in the treatment arm corresponding to the study treatment 
actually received. 
At least 1 laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained after at least 1 dose of study 
treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To assess 
change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
9.5.3 PRO Analysis Population
The PRO analyses are based on the PRO FAS population, defined as participants wh o have at 
least 1 PRO assessment available and have received at least 1 dose of study treatment.
9.6 Statistical Methods
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified interim analys es 2, 3, 4 ,and final analysis of 
thestudy described in the SAP will not be performed. Selected analyses of safety endpoints 
will be performed at the end of study; there will be no further analyses of efficacy and PRO 
endpoints. The subsections below are retained for reference.
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary efficacy 
objectives. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP. Efficacy 
results that will be deemed to be statistical ly significant after consideration of the Type -I 
error control strategy are described in Section 9.8. Nominal p-values will be computed for 
other efficacy analyses but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of 
multiplicity.
9.6.1.1 Progression -free Survival (PFS)
The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log -rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efr on’s method of tie -handling will be 
used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR) between the treatment 
arms (Arm 1 vs. Control, and Arm 2 vs. Control). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified 
Cox model with Efron ’s method of tie -handling and with a single treatment covariate will be 
reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2) will be applied to

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  123
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Descriptive statistics of the 
treatment di fference (ie ,the HR ,95% CI ,and nominal p -value ) between Arm 1 and Arm 2 
will also be provided.
Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the interval 
between the last assessment when PD is not documented and the assess ment when PD is 
documented. The true date of disease progression will be approximated by the date of the 
first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. Death is 
always considered as a confirmed PD event. Participants who do not experience a PFS event 
will be censored at the last disease assessment. A sensitivity analysis will be performed for a 
comparison of PFS based on the investigator ’s assessment. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoin t per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, 1 primary 
and 2 sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules will be performed. For the 
primary analysis, if the events (PD or death) are immediately after more than 1missed 
disease assessment, the data are censor ed at the last disease assessment prior to the missed 
visits. Data after new anticancer therapy are censored at the last disease assessment prior to 
the initiation of new anticancer therapy. The first sensitivity analysis follows the ITT
principle. That is , PDs/deaths are counted as events regardless of missed study visits or 
initiation of new anticancer therapy. The second sensitivity analysis considers 
discontinuation of treatment due to reasons other than CR or initiation of new anticancer
treatment, whi chever occurs later, to be a PD event for participants without documented PD 
or death. If a participant meets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that 
occurs earliest will be applied. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity ana lyses are 
summarized in Table 8.
For participants who have a surgery with curative intent (described in Section 4.1) , PFS will 
be defined using time f rom randomization to the disease recurrence after the surgery.

9.6.1.2 Overall Survival (OS)
The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The 
treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified 
Cox proportional hazard model with Efron ’s method of tie -handling will be used to assess the 
magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified 
Cox model with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratif ication factors used 
for randomization (Section 6.3.2) will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the 
stratified Cox model. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the date of last known alive date.
9.6.1.3 Objective Response Rate (ORR)
Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method will be used for the comparison of the ORR 
between 2 treatment arms. The difference in ORR and its 95% CI from the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sampl e size will be reported. The 
stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2) will be applied to the analysis.

analysis.
9.6.1.4 Duration of Response (DOR)
For p articipants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first 
documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first. Censoring rules for DOR are summarized in Table 9.
For each DOR analysis, a corresponding summary of the reasons for which responding 
participants are censored will also be provided. Responses in participants who are alive, have 
not progre ssed, have not initiated new anticancer treatment (reintroduction of investigator -
choice of anticancer therapy ), have not been determined to be lost to follow -up, and have had 
a disease assessment within approximately 5 months of the data cutoff date, are considered 
ongoing responders at the time of analysis. If a participant meets multiple criteria for 
censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied.
If the sample size permits, DOR will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier
medians and quartiles. Only the subset of participants with a confirmed CR or PR will be 
included in this analysis.

9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including 
AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements.
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 11). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse events are eith er pre -specified as 
Tier 1 events or will be classified as belonging to Tier 2 or Tier 3 based on the number of 
events observed.
Tier 1 Events
Safety parameters or AEOSIs that are identified apriori constitute Tier 1 safety events that 
will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance. Based on a review of historic 
chemotherapy data in CRC and data from ongoing olaparib clinical studies, there are no AEs 
that warrant inferential tes ting between treatment groups ; therefore, t here are no Tier 1 events 
for this protocol.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 events will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIsprovided for differences in 
the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method 
[Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] , an unconditional, asymptotic method.
Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group show
the event; all other A Es will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants 
was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population enrolled in this study is in critical 
condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; 
events reported less frequently than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the 
overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment 
differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs ( ≥5%of participants in 1 of t he treatment groups) 
and SAEs ( ≥5%of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 
endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the 
CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to b e used in safety review, not as a 
formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences.
Tier 3 Events
Safety events that are not Tier 1 or Tier 2 events will be considered Tier 3 events. Only point 
estimates by treatmen t arm will be provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.
Continuous Safety Measures
For continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory, vital sign, and ECG 
parameters, summary statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change from baseline val ues 
will be provided by treatment arm in table format.

9.6.4 Summaries of Baseline Characteristics
The comparability of the treatment groups for each relevant demographic and baseline

tests will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage of participants 
randomized and the primary reason for discontinuation will be displayed. Demographic 
variables (such as age) and baseline c haracteristics will be summarized by treatment either by 
descriptive statistics or categorical tables. The reasons for exclusion from the ITT population

9.7 Interim Analyses
Note: As of Amendment 05, the prespecified interim analys es 2, 3, 4 ,and final analysis of 
the study described in the SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
An eDMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the unblinded results of the IAsand will 
make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol modifications to an EOC
of the Sponsor . Depending on the recommendation of the eDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a 
regulatory submission .If the eDMC recommends modifications to the design of the protocol 
or discontinuation of the study, this EOC (and potentially other limited additional Sponsor
personnel) may be unblinded to results at the study intervention level in order to act on these 
recommend ations. Additional logistical details will be provided in the eDMC Charter.
Treatment -level results from the interim analysis will be provided to the eDMC by the 
unblinded statistician. Prior to final study unblinding, the unblinded statistician will not b e 
involved in any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, 
identification of protocol deviations, or data validation efforts after the interim analyses.
9.7.1 Efficacy Interim Analyses
The study includes a non -binding futility an alysis (IA1) to determine whether there is 
sufficient evidence to continue the experimental arms. The analysis will occur approximately 
19months after study initiation at 40% information fraction for the PFS analysis. This 
analysis will compare PFS betwee n Arm 1 and the control arm (Arm 3 a/Arm 3b ) as well as 
Arm 2 and the control arm (Arm 3 a/Arm 3b ).The study may be stopped if both arms are 
deemed futile; otherwise, the study may continue as planned. The operating characteristics of 
the futility interim a nalysis for each comparison are shown in Table 12.

9.7.2 Safety Interim Analyses
Note: As of Amendment 05, no further analysis tothe e DMC is warranted as the eDMC has 
recommended at IA1that s tudy participants randomized to one of the two experimental arms 
(olaparib plus bevacizumab [Arm1 ] or olaparib monotherapy [Arm2 ]) must discontinue study 
intervention.
The eDMC conducted regular safety monitoring. The timing of the safety monitoring was 
specified in the DMC charter. No further analysis is warranted.
The eDMC has responsibility for assessment of overall risk:benefit. When prompted by 
safety concerns, the eDMC can request corresponding efficacy data. DMC review of efficacy 
data to assess the overall risk:benefit to study participants will not require a multiplicity 
adjustment typically associated with a planned efficacy IA. However, to account for any 
multiplicity concerns raised by the eDMC review of unplanned efficacy data when prompted 
by safety concerns, a sensitivity analysis for PFS and OS adopting a conservative multiplicity 
adjustment will be pre specified in the sSAP. This analysis will be performed if requested by 
the eDMC.
9.8 Multiplicity
Note: As of Amendment 05, the prespecified interim analyses 2, 3, 4 ,and final analysis of 
the study described in the SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
The Type -I error rate over the multiple treatment comparisons and primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided). Asmall alpha penalty of 
0.01% wi ll be paid for the futility analysis. The study will use the graphic method of Maurer 
and Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as well as IAs [Bretz, F., et al 2009] . 
According to this approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and, when a 
particular null hypothesis is rejected, the α allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to 
other hypothesis tests.
Figure 2shows the initial 1 -sided α allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing 
the hypothesis. The weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are 
represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses.

9.8.1 Progression -free Survival
PFS will be tested at IA2 and IA3. The study allocates α=0.0249, 1 -sided, to test PFS for 
Arm 1 versus Control and Arm 2 v ersus Control (α=0.01245 for each comparison). If the null 
hypothesis for PFS in 1 comparison is rejected, Figure 2shows that its α=0.0 1245 is 
essentially fully reallocated to the OS hypothesis in the same treatment comparison . If the 
null hypotheses for OS is rejected, the alpha will be reallocated to the PFS in the other 
treatment comparison. Thus, each PFS comparison may be tested at α=0.01245 (initial α), or 
at α=0.0249 (if the null hypotheses for the other PFS comparison and OS comparison are 
rejected) ( Table 14). For each comparison, the actual boundaries will be calculated based on 
the observed number of PFS events at the interim and final PFS analyses using the Lan -
DeMets O ’Brien -Fleming spending function accordingly. For PFS interim analysis, the same 
alpha spend will be used for both comparisons (Arm 1 vs. Control and Arm 2 vs. Control ), 
based on the lower number of observed PFS events from both comparisons.

9.8.2 Overall Survival
No initial alpha is allocated to the OS hypothesis. The OS hypothesis will only be tested if 
the test for PFSfor the same treatment comparison is significant. If the test for PFS is not 
significant at the final analysis for PFS, the study may not continue for test of OS.
If the study continues based upon the IA1 futility criterion , OS will be tested at IA2 only if 
the test for PFS for the same treatment comparison is significant at IA2 ; and tested at IA3, 
IA4 and final analysis only if the final analysis of PFS (IA3) for the same treatment 
comparison is significant . Each OScomparison (Arm 1 vs. Control and Arm 2 vs. Control ) 
may be tested at α=0.01245 (if the null hypothesis for the PFS in the same treatment 
comparison is rejected), or at α=0.0249 (if the null hypotheses for both PFS comparisons and 
OS for the other comparison are rejected) . Table 15shows the boundary properties for OS

3a or capecitabine in Arm 3b) .PFS is the primary endpoint for the study, with OS as the key 
secondary endpoint. For PFS, based on a target number of 297 events at IA3 , the study has 
88% power to detect a HR of 0.65 at α=1. 245% (1 -sided) for each treatment comparison 
(Arm 1 vs. Control , or Arm 2 vs. Control ). If PFS is positive for the same treatment

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and sci entific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations (eg, International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH -
GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional in vestigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the 
full control of M SD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, 
efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. 
Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint 
measures , or trials to determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the tria l. 
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative t rial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of 
Good Clini cal Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data 
are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and 
procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misc onduct, or serious GCP -noncompliance is suspected, the issues 
08HF0N
PRODUCT:  MK-7339  137
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
areinvestigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and 
ethics review committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, MSDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers . Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of 
Medica l Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III.Participant Protection
A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [ IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC])
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant 
changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except 
changes required urgently to prot ect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee 
approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the par ticipant informed consent form.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials i s that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All p articipation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regulator y authorities will have 
access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name.
D. Genomic Research
Genomic r esearch will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics c ommittee.
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. Ho wever, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants.

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  138
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SDand that the investigator or s ponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent w ith local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these et hical and scientific standards .
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's 
responsibility to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the United States for th ese purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are tran sferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by th e 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant. 
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other author ized personnel appointed by the S ponsor, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definitions of Medication Error, Misuse, and Abuse
Medication error
This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to or has the potential to 
lead to harm to the patient.
Misuse
This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the terms of the product information.
Abuse
This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional exces sive use of a medicinal 
product for a perceived psychological or physiological reward or desired nontherapeutic 
effect.
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associa ted with the use of a study intervention.
•NOTE: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, or protocol specified procedure wh ether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention) , manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal la boratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered clinically significant in the 
medical an d scientific judgment of the investigator.

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  146
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administr ation even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a co ncomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
•Any new cancer (that is not a condition of the study). Progression of the cancer under 
study is not considered a reportable event unless it re sults in hospitalization or death.
Event s NOT meeting the AE d efinition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (soci al and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
•Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existi ng condition that has not 
worsened.
•Refe r to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.3 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
08HF0N
PRODUCT:  MK-7339  147
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
•The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious ”refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to a n 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the ho spitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed p rior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday li fe functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home f or allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.

10.3.4 Additional Events Reported in the Same Manner as SAE
Additional events that require reporting in the same mann er as SAE
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same time frame as SAEs to 
meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are con sidered serious by the 
Sponsor for collection purposes.
•Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)
•Is associated with an overdose
10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE r ecording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
•It is not accept able for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
•There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms , and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity
•An event is defined as “serious ”when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes a s 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
•The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) according to the NCI CTCAE , version 5.0. Any AE that changes 
CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade 
recorded on the AE CRFs /worksheets.

-Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated .
-Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Assessment of c ausality
•Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE?
•The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’ s product caused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assess ing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information.
•The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor ’s product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor ’s 
product caused the AE:
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor ’s product such as: reliable history, acceptabl e compliance assessment (pill 
count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite 
in bodily specimen?
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor ’s product? Is the ti me of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)?
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other hos t or environmental factors.
-Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor ’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  150
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.
If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor ’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.)
-Rechall enge: Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor ’s product in this study?
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge.
If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE r esulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’ s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR ’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR ’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR AS PER DOSE 
MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
INIRB/IEC .
•Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor ’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?
•The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by 
an investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of the above elements.
•Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (n ot all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor ’s product relationship).
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor ’s product relationship:
There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor ’s product. The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset r elative to the administration of the Sponsor ’s product is reasonable. 
The AE is more likely explained by the Sponsor ’s product than by another cause.
-No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's product relationship:

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  151
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
Participant did not receive t he Sponsor ’s product OR temporal sequence of the 
AE onset relative to administration of the Sponsor ’s product is not reasonable OR 
the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Sponsor’s product. 
(Also entered for a participant with overdose wi thout an associated AE.)
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has min imal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
•The investigator ma y change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
•For studi es in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, 
the investigator may attribute each AE causality to the combination regimen or to a single 
agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the 
combination regimen (ie, to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution 
may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data 
to support full attribution of the AE to the single agent.
Follow -up of AE a nd SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. Thi s may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data t o the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic data 
collection tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool.

-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then th e site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously repor ted SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporti ng to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equi pment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages w ithin the designated reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent) .

-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.
◦A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in th e postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the 
postmenop ausal range is required.
-Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonhormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

10.5.2 Contraception Requirements
Male Participants
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to 1 of the following for the mi nimum protocol -defined time frame in Section 5.1 
or the time frame detailed in the approved product label per local requirements:
•Be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long -term and persistent b asis) and agree to remain abstinent.
•Use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when having 
penile -vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant.
-The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), 
withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) .
Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.
Male and female condom cannot be used together .
Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration.
Female Participants
Female participants of childbearing potenti al are eligible to participate if they agree to 
consistent and correct use of a highly effective method of contraception as described in
Table 17during the protocol -defined time frame in Section 5.1.

Table 17 Highly Effective Contraception Methods
•Contraceptives allowed during the study includea:
•Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependency
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
•Progestogen -only subdermal contraceptive implantb,c
•IUSc
•Nonhormonal IUD
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner 
of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia for a male participant can come from the site personnel’s review 
of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
aContraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive methods for participants of clinical studies.
bIf locally req uired, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to 
those which inhibit ovulation.
cMale condoms must be used in addition to female participant hormonal contraception .
Note: The following are not acceptable metho ds of contraception:
-Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and LAM.
-Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.
-Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

10.6 Appendix 6: Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical 
Research
1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is
a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition .1
b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research3,4
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.9will be 
used in various experiments to understand:
The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by t he body
Other pathways drugs/vaccines may interact with
The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor.
3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research3,4
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be conside red for enrollment in the 
future biomedical research

PRODUCT:  MK-7339  158
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
b.Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a study visit 
by the i nvestigator or his or her d esignate. Informed consent for future biomedical 
research should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If 
delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by the 
participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for regulatory 
reasons.
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s 
clinical document repository.
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical r esearch will be captured in 
the eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be 
destroyed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined in 
the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens ar e being collected for future 
biomedical r esearch, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research3,4
In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducted with future biomedical r esearch 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' clini cal information with future test results. In 
fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing 
participant characteristics like gender, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collect ed from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical r esearch, the Sponsor has developed secure poli cies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical r esearch 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally 
identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant 
identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage3,4
Specimen s obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific 
practices. Analyses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed 
by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by 
the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy 
and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the 
specific scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research protocol and c onsent . 
Future biomedical r esearch specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research3,4
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical r esearch and ask that thei r 
biospecimens not be used for future biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw 
consent at any time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical records 
for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the 
designated mailbox ( clinical.specimen.management@msd.com ). Subsequently, the 
participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study 
use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specifically for future 
biomedical r esearch, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and 
destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or 
destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of t he investigator to inform the 
participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any 
analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already 
performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as 
part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study 
records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a 
link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, 
the reque st for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens3,4
Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for 
longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being 
answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions 
have been adequately addressed.
Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which 
08HF0N
PRODUCT:  MK-7339  160
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:  003 -05  
MK-7339 -003-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 08-SEP-2022
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according 
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
bioreposit ory database.
8.Data Security3,4
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentica tion is highly secure, and is 
accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants3,4
No information obtained from e xploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and conce rns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly report this information to doctors an d participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population3,4
Every effort will be made to recruit all participan ts diagnosed and treated o n Sponsor 
clinical studies for f uture biomedical r esearch.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research3,4
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been mini mized and are 
described in the future biomedi cal research informed consent.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.
12.Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e mailed directly to 
clinical.specimen.manageme nt@msd.com .

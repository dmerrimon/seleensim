Protocol Title: An Open-Label Safety Study of Retinal Gene Therapy for Choroideremia with 
Bilateral, Sequential Administration of Adeno-Associated Viral Vector (AAV2) Encoding Rab 
Escort Protein 1 (REP1)
Protocol Number: NSR-REP-02
Study centres: The study will be conducted at approximately 5 study centres in Europe and 
United States.
Study period (years): 
Estimated overall study duration: 12 months of follow-up 
for each eyePhase of development: Phase 2
Study Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of bilateral, sequential sub-
retinal administration of a single dose of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with choroideremia 
(CHM).
Primary Endpoint: The safety of bilateral administration of AAV2-REP1 will be evaluated 
with the following safety measures:
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart
Ophthalmic examination assessments (including intraocular pressure [IOP], slit lamp 
examination, lens opacity grading and dilated ophthalmoscopy)
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
Fundus autofluorescence (AF)
Fundus photography
Microperimetry
Adverse event (AE) reporting 
Vector shedding post-treatment
Immunogenicity sampling post-treatment 
Vital signs
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints will include:
Change from Baseline in BCVA as measured by the ETDRS chart 
Change from Baseline in AF
Change from Baseline in SD-OCT
Change from Baseline in microperimetry
Study Design: This is a multi-centre, open-label, prospective, 2-period, bilateral interventional 
safety study of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with genetically confirmed CHM.  The study 
will consist of a Screening Period followed by 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with up 
to 9 visits per period.  During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility of both 
eyes.  The Investigator will assign the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., study eye 1 [SE1]-
Period 1 and study eye 2 [SE2]- Period 2, respectively) with a number assigned to each eye.  This 
will be done in collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be selected 
for first treatment. Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed 
collectively by the Patient Eligibility Review Committee, which includes the Investigator, a 
consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). The estimated 
target interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be determined at the 
Screening Visit.
Each study eye will be followed for at least 12 months post-treatment, for up to 9 visits per 
treatment period: Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit); Visit 2 (Day 1, post-operative follow-up 
visit); Visit 3 (Day 3 + 2 days, post-operative follow-up visit); Visit 4 (Day 7 -1/+2 days); Visit 5

6(Day 14 ± 3 days); Visit 6 (Month 1 ± 7 days); Visit 7 (Month 3 ± 14 days); Visit 8 (Month 6 ± 14 
days) and Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 days; end of study visit).
At Period 1, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy with 
retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in SE1.  Visits 2-9 will then 
be conducted according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, unless Period 2 commences during 
this time, in which case, the study visits will follow the schedule for SE2.  Ophthalmic 
assessments during Period 1, Visits 2-9 will be performed on both eyes. 
The interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to vary among subjects from weeks to 
many months.  While the interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will be made 
to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the immunological and 
safety profile of sequential treatment administration.  Thus, approximately 20 subjects each will 
be treated with a short (<6 month), medium (6-12 months), or long (>12 month) surgery window 
between treatment of the first and second eye.  Because the timing of the second surgery visit 
(Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among subjects, the duration of study Period 1 will also be variable.  
The post-operative outcome and visual function of SE1 will inform the scheduling of Period 2.  
Signs of post-operative inflammation, or other post-operative sequelae, as judged by the 
Investigator, should be resolved in SE1 for the subject to continue to Period 2.  After 
comprehensive evaluation of all safety assessments and visual functional tests of SE1 and SE2, 
the Investigator will determine the eligibility of the subject and decide the appropriate time to 
schedule SE2, Visit 1.  
All baseline ophthalmic assessments must be conducted within 10 weeks prior to SE2 surgery 
(Period 2, Visit 1).  Eligibility for SE2 surgery will then be confirmed collectively by the Patient 
Eligibility Review Committee, which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the 
Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). If, at that time, the BCVA in SE2 is <34 
ETDRS letters, surgery may be performed when, in the opinion of the Patient Eligibility Review 
Committee: 1) the subject is found eligible by all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 2) the 
subject is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modifiable disease. 
At Period 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE2), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy with 
retinal detachment and sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in the contralateral, untreated eye 
(SE2).  Post-treatment, subjects will no longer follow the Period 1 visit schedule, but will instead 
attend Period 2, Visits 2-9 according to the Schedule of Study Procedures. Ophthalmic 
assessments scheduled for Period 2, Visits 2-9 will be performed on both eyes. 
Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study; assessments are outlined in 
the Schedule of Study Procedures.  Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery 
if deemed clinically necessary.  If cataract surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 
4 weeks before Month 12 (Visit 9) for the respective eye.  The cataract surgery timing must be 
discussed with the medical monitor prior to the procedure.
Number of Subjects (Planned): Approximately 60 subjects are planned for the study.
Inclusion Criteria: During the Screening Period, subjects will be found eligible for study 
participation if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria. 
1. Are willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study to have both 
eyes treated
2. Are male and ≥18 years of age

4. Have active disease clinically visible within the macular region of both eyes
5. Have a BCVA of ≥34 ETDRS letters (20/200 or better Snellen acuity) in both eyes, or in 
the untreated eye, if the other eye was previously treated with AAV2-REP1*
*If previously treated with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, subjects may be eligible 
for participation following Sponsor approval. 
6. For subjects who received treatment with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, have 
biological samples available to complete an adequate immunology profile

subject’s ability to participate in the study.  This includes but is not limited to a potential 
subject:
with a contraindication to oral corticosteroid (e.g. prednisolone/prednisone)
with clinically significant cataract in either eye
who, in the clinical opinion of the Patient Eligibility Review Committee or 
Investigator, is not an appropriate candidate for sub-retinal surgery (see the 
Patient Eligibility Review Plan)
5. Have participated in another research study involving an investigational product in the 
past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously, except if 
treated within in an antecedent study with AAV2-REP1.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: For each eye, subjects will undergo 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of up to 0.1 mL of study 
drug containing 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 genome particles (gp).  
Reference Therapy (Comparator), Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Not Applicable.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Safety: The safety evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by the ETDRS chart); full 
ophthalmic examination (including IOP, slit lamp examination, lens opacity grading and dilated 
ophthalmoscopy); SD-OCT; fundus AF; fundus photography; microperimetry; AE reporting; 
vector shedding and immunogenicity; and vital signs.
Efficacy: The efficacy evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by the ETDRS chart); 
fundus AF; SD-OCT and microperimetry.
Statistical Methodology: No formal sample size calculation will be performed.
Continuous variables will be summarised over time using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, 
standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals [CI], median, first and third quartiles, fifth and 
ninety-fifth percentiles, minimum, and maximum).  Categorical variables will be described over 
time using counts, percentages, and 95% CIs.  Summaries will be tabulated by visit and eye.  No 
formal statistical testing will be performed. 
AEs will be summarised by system organ class, preferred term, and eye.  The number of eyes with 
an AE, as well as the number of events, will be summarised, by period and eye.    Similar 
summaries will be produced for study drug/procedure-related AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and serious AEs.  AEs will also be summarised by maximum severity, 
relationship to study drug/procedure, and time to onset and resolution.  Vector shedding and 
immune response profiles will be described.
The remaining safety evaluations will be analysed using descriptive statistics.

125 INTRODUCTION
5.1 Choroideremia
Choroideremia (CHM) is a rare, bilateral, untreatable retinal degeneration that begins in 
childhood with loss of night vision, and gradually progresses to blindness by middle age.  
CHM is caused by loss of function of the gene encoding Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), which 
is located on the X-chromosome (Cremers, van de Pol et al. 1990, Seabra, Brown et al. 1993).  
The disease has an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, affects approximately 1 in 50,000 
people, and is mostly caused by loss of function (null) mutations (Sankila, Tolvanen et al. 
1992, MacDonald, Russell et al. 2009).
5.2 Gene Therapy with Adeno-Ass
ociated Viral (AAV) Vectors
Gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of incurable 
retinal diseases ( Bryant, Duker et al. 2012, Boye, Boye et al. 2013).  Gene therapy medicinal 
products (GTMPs) are a type of advanced therapy medicinal product defined as medicines 
derived from genes and cells (EMA 2015).  GTMPs contain or consist of recombinant nucleic 
acid delivered via a viral vector to targeted cells.  The central goal of gene therapy is to 
replace non-functional or defective genes with new genes that are fully functional so that the 
level of genetic expression can return to normal.
The eye is particularly well suited for gene therapy because of its accessibility, relative 
immune privilege status, small size, compartmentalisation and the presence of a fellow 
control eye (Boye, Boye et al. 2013).  The eye is one of the few relatively immunologically-
privileged sites in the body, so vectors used in gene therapy are unlikely to cause a significant 
systemic immune response.  It has long been established that to maintain the transparent 
structures required for vision, the eye has conserved a number of adaptations that selectively 
diminish the immune response (Streilein 2003).  For example, complement-fixing antibodies, 
neutrophils and macrophages are generally excluded from mitigation of an inflammatory 
response to limit the formation of opacities.  Anatomically, the retina is protected by the 
blood-retinal barrier to minimise the circulation of immune cells (Streilein 2003).  Studies 
have demonstrated that antigens introduced to the vitreous and sub-retinal space exhibit a 
reduced immune response due to the varied cytokine environment and the presence of 
molecules that suppress the immune system (Stein-Strelein and Watte 2007). 
Given the defined volume of the eye, the amount of viral vector needed to achieve a 
therapeutic effect will likely be small, reducing the risk of toxicity and increasing the 
likelihood of being able to manufacture quantities of vector sufficient to treat the retina.  The 
eye also allows for localised treatment without intravenous delivery, thus decreasing the 
chance of systemic absorption and toxicity.  Finally, the effects of localised ocular treatments 
can be easily observed and monitored for efficacy and safety, something that cannot be 
readily done with systemic conditions (Bryant, Duker et al. 2012).
The most commonly used deli
very system for retinal gene therapy is the adeno-associated 
virus (AAV), and numerous early phase clinical trials using AAV vectors are currently 
underway for potential treatment of various retinal diseases (Boye, Boye et al. 2013, 
MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014, Edwards, Jolly et al. 2016).  AAVs remain in the nucleus as 
episomes with no integration into the human genome, thereby decreasing the risk of 
insertional oncogenesis.  AAVs allow for stable and long term transgene expression in 
different retinal cells, including photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium cells, ganglion 
and Müller cells (Vanderberghe and Auricchio 2012, Day, Byrne et al. 2014).  Lastly, AAVs

13elicit a minimal immune response as supported by emerging data from non-clinical and 
clinical studies.  
One non-clinical study evaluated immunological and functional consequences of adeno-
associated viral vector type 2 (AAV2) vector re-administration to the contralateral eye in 
dogs and non-human primates ( Amado, Mingozzi et al. 2010).  In this study, rAAV2-
hRPE65v2 administered to the untreated, contralateral eye 15 days after the first injection 
was found to be both efficacious and safe.  The study demonstrated that cell-mediated 
immune responses were benign, with only 1 of 10 animals in the study developing a 
persistent T cell immune response to AAV2, a response that was mediated by CD4+ T cells.  
Sequential bilateral injection caused minimal inflammation and improved visual function in 
affected animals.  The authors concluded that sub-retinal re-administration of AAV2 is safe 
even in the setting of pre-existing immunity to the vector, a parameter that has been used to 
exclude patients from gene therapy trials.  In another non-clinical study in rats, lack of 
apparent immunogenicity was observed following same-day bilateral administration of 
6×10^9 genome particles (gp)/eye of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2) encoding Rab 
escort protein 1 (AAV2-REP1) (CharlesRiverLabs 2015).  This total antigen exposure 
following bilateral dosing is comparable to a unilateral dose of 1.2×10^10 gp, which equates 
to a 1.2×10^12 gp dose in humans. This provides a 12-fold immunogenic safety margin 
compared to the planned clinical dose of 1×10^11 gp.
In the clinical setting, repeat administration of AAV2-RPE65 to the contralateral eye of 
children and adults was also shown to be safe, irrespective of baseline immune status 
(Bennett, Wellman et al. 2016). In this study, 11 children and adults with Leber’s congenital 
amaurosis received a single sub-retinal administration of AAV2-RPE65 at a dose of 
1.5×10^11 gp (1.7-4.6 years after initial sub-retinal injection) to the contralateral, previously 
untreated eye.  No adverse events (AEs) related to AAV2 vector were reported, and humoral 
and cell-mediated responses to AAV2 capsid and RPE65 transgene were benign in all 
patients.  Two individuals who had high pre-existing neutralizing AAV2-antibodies did not 
experience an inflammatory response in either eye following contralateral eye administration.  
AAV2-RPE65, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (LUXTURNA™, Spark Therapeutics, Inc), has 
been approved in the US and the EU as the first adeno-associated virus vector type 2 
(AAV2)-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of patients with confirmed bi-allelic 
RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.
5.3 Study Rationale
CHM is incurable and treatment is supportive at best.  NightstaRx is developing AAV2-REP1 
as a potential GTMP for the treatment of CHM.  AAV2-REP1 is a recombinant  AAV2 
particle encapsulating 1.962kB complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the wild-
type human REP1 gene.  Non-clinical studies with AAV2-REP1 have been very promising 
(Tolmachova, Tolmachov et al. 2013).  AAV2-REP1 expresses high levels of human REP1 
protein, res
tores REP1 to human CHM fibroblasts, provides functional rescue of human 
CHM cells, expresses protein in the retina of CHM mice in vivo, and is non-toxic when over-
expressed by one log unit.  Further, over-expression of the human REP1 protein does not 
significantly affect retinal function (Tolmachova, Tolmachov et al. 2013).
In 2011, an investigator-sponsored, first-in-human study of AAV2-REP1 was initiated in 
adult male patients with CHM.  The first 6 patients were treated with a single sub-retinal 
injection of 1×10^10 gp in 1 eye (MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014).  Six months after receiving 
AAV2-REP1, 2 patients with impaired vision at baseline gained 21 letters and 11 letters in 
best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (i.e., >4 and >2 lines of vision, respectively).  All other

14patients who received the full dose of vector, and all of whom had near normal BCVA at 
baseline, did not suffer any clinically significant deterioration in vision post-treatment.  From 
a safety perspective, the GTMP and surgical application method appeared to be generally 
well tolerated.  A second cohort of 8 patients was treated with a single sub-retinal injection of 
1×10^11 gp in 1 eye.  Following favorable results, 3 other investigator-sponsored studies 
were then initiated in which a total of 26 adult male CHM patients received a single sub-
retinal injection of 1×10^11 gp AAV2-REP1 in 1 eye .  The initial results of these trials are 
consistent with improved rod and cone function, despite any negative effects of retinal 
detachment, and the gene therapy was generally well tolerated.  AAV2-REP1 gene therapy 
has been shown to positively affect visual acuity (VA), considering both maintenance and 
stabilization of vision in the majority of subjects, as well as improvement of vision in subsets 
of CHM subjects for up to 2 years and beyond.  This clinical evidence supports the durability 
of the therapeutic effect of AAV2-REP1 for treating CHM.  
These findings lend support to further assessment of AAV2 gene therapy in the treatment of 
CHM.  NightstaRx is currently sponsoring a multi-centre, global Phase 3 study of a single 
subretinal administration of AAV2-REP1 for the treatment of CHM  (NSR-REP-01, the 
STAR study, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
Considering that CHM affects both eyes, exploration of bilateral AAV2-REP1 administration 
is desirable.  As noted, emerging data from non-clinical and clinical studies with AAV2 
vectors demonstrate that these vectors illicit a minimal immune response, including after 
bilateral administration.  The aim of this study is to provide important insight into the safety 
and tolerability of sequential, bilateral treatment with AAV2-REP1.
5.4 Risk / Benefit Assessment
No treatment currently exists for CHM.
The non-clinical studies conducted with AAV2-REP1 showed that it provides efficient and 
functional transgene expression in CHM mouse and human cells, as well as in mouse and 
human RPE and photoreceptors, without overt toxicity.  Results from the 26-week single-
dose combined toxicity/biodistribution study conducted in rats indicate that administration of 
AAV2-REP1 by single sub-retinal injection to both eyes is well tolerated at dose levels of 
1×10^9 and 6×10^9 gp/eye (equal to 1×10^11 and 6×10^11 gp/eye in humans) when 
evaluated 4 and 26 weeks after injection.  Minor reductions in some ERG parameters, ocular 
inflammation, and microscopic signs of retinal/corneal degeneration were observed and were 
considered procedure-related or not biologically significant.
In humans, application of AAV2-REP1 to the surface of the retina requires retinal 
detachment via vitrectomy.  The 2-step procedure employed in delivering AAV2-REP1 sub-
retinally (see Section 9.4), allows the management of unexpected surgical complications of 
retinal detachment before the AAV2-REP1 is applied. Furthermore, since the volume of fluid 
required to detach the fovea is variable, by excluding the vector from the first step, and 
administering the vector after successful retinal detachment has been achieved, a precise, 
consistent dose in terms of genome particles can be applied into the sub-retinal space.  
Nevertheless, sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 carries the risks associated with 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment, which include intra-operative and post-operative 
complications; infection (most notably infectious endophthalmitis); low and elevated IOP; 
choroidal detachment; persistent retinal detachment, retinal tears, holes and breaks; macular 
hole and macular oedema; vitreous haemorrhage; visual impairment; metamorphopsia; and 
photopsia (Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Thompson, Sjaarda et al. 1996, Banker, Freeman et al.

151997, Cheng, Azen et al. 2001, Anderson, Fineman et al. 2006, Stein, Zacks et al. 2009, 
Recchia, Scott et al. 2010).  Post-operative intraocular inflammation caused by vitrectomy is 
often associated with transient or sometimes permanent visual impairment.  Another 
complication of vitrectomy is cataract formation, which may require an additional surgical 
procedure (cataract extraction) (Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Cheng, Azen et al. 2001, Recchia, 
Scott et al. 2010).  In addition, the surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia, 
which includes the risks of dizziness, confusion, nausea and vomiting.
Loss of VA has been observed post-treatment with AAV2-REP1.  This VA loss was 
determined by the Investigators to be plausibly related to the administration of AAV2-REP1, 
however without definitively attributing the cause to either the study procedure or the GTMP.  
Complications from the surgical procedure are expected and are not considered reportable as 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) unless also assessed to be at least 
possibly related to AAV2-REP1.  The Reference Safety Information described in the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure for AAV2-REP1 defines visual acuity reduced  as an 
expected serious adverse drug reaction, with a frequency of 4/79 (5.1%), defined as common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10).  Loss of VA is considered an identified risk of AAV2-REP1. 
Inflammation is a potential risk of AAV2-REP1. 
See the Investigator’s Brochure for further details.
Thus, although there are risks associated with the administration of the study treatment via 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment, the potential for benefit in the form of improved VA that 
may be provided to subjects with CHM following treatment with AAV2-REP1 provides an 
acceptable risk-benefit profile for participation in this study.

177 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
7.1 Overall Study Design
This is a multi-centre, open-label, prospective, 2-period, bilateral interventional safety study 
of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with genetically confirmed CHM.  The study will 
consist of a Screening Period followed by 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with up 
to 9 visits per treatment period.  A second baseline visit prior to surgery of SE2 (Period 2, 
Visit 1) may be required.  A study schematic is presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Overall Study Schematic
During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility of both eyes.  The 
Investigator will assign the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., study eye 1 [SE1]-Period 
1 and study eye 2 [SE2]-Period 2, respectively) with a number assigned to each eye.  This 
will be done in collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be 
selected for first treatment.  Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be 
confirmed collectively by the Patient Eligibility Review Committee, which includes the 
Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). 
The estimated target interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be 
determined at the Screening Visit.
Each study eye will be followed for at least 12 months post-treatment, for up to 9 visits per 
treatment period: Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit); Visit 2 (Day 1, post-operative follow-
up visit); Visit 3 (Day 3 + 2 Days); Visit 4 (Day 7 -1/+2 Days); Visit 5 (Day 14 ± 3 Days); 
Visit 6 (Month 1 ± 7 Days); Visit 7 (Month 3 ± 14 Days); Visit 8 (Month 6 ±14 Days) and 
Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 Days; end of study visit).
At Period 1, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy 
with retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in SE1.  Visits 2-9 
will then be conducted according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, unless Period 2 
commences during the time of follow-up for SE; in which case, the study visits will continue 
following the schedule for SE2.  Ophthalmic assessments during Period 1, Visits 2-9 will be 
performed on both eyes.
The interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to vary among subjects from  weeks 
to many months.  While the interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will be 
made to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the 
immunological and safety profile of sequential treatment administration.  Thus, 
approximately 20 subjects each will be treated with a short- (<6 month), medium- (6-12 
months), or long- (>12 month) surgery window between treatment of the first and second 

AAV2-REP1

18eye.  Because the timing of the second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among 
subjects, the duration of study Period 1 will also be variable.  
The post-operative outcome and visual function of SE1 will inform the scheduling of 
Period 2. Signs of post-operative inflammation or other post-operative sequelae, as judged by 
the Investigator, should be resolved in SE1 for the subject to continue to Period 2.  After 
comprehensive evaluation of all safety assessments and visual functional tests of SE1 and 
SE2, the Investigator will determine the eligibility of the subject and decide the appropriate 
time to schedule SE2, Visit 1.
All baseline ophthalmic assessments must be conducted within 10 weeks prior to SE2 surgery 
(Period 2, Visit 1).  If these assessments are not available within the required timeframe, a 
Baseline Visit must be added to collect current baseline data on SE2.  Study eye selection and 
eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed collectively by the Patient Eligibility Review 
Committee, which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the 
Patient Eligibility Review Plan).  If, at that time, BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS letters, 
surgery may be performed when, in the opinion of the Patient Eligibility Review Committee: 
1) the subject is found eligible by all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 2) the subject 
is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modfiable disease.
At Period 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE2) subjects will undergo a vitrectomy 
with retinal detachment and sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in the contralateral, 
untreated eye (SE2).  Post-treatment, subjects will no longer follow the Period 1 visit 
schedule, but will instead attend Period 2, Visits 2-9 according to the Schedule of Study 
Procedures.  Ophthalmic assessments scheduled for Period 2, Visits 2-9 will be performed on 
both eyes. 
Study data will thus be collected for both eyes.  Subjects will be assessed for safety and 
efficacy throughout the study, as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures (Table 1).  
The safety evaluation will be based on a full ophthalmic examination (indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, IOP, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation 
grading and lens opacities classification system [LOCS] III cataract grading); fundus 
photography; AE reporting; vector shedding and immunogenicity assessment and vital signs.  
The efficacy evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by the ETDRS chart), AF, SD-
OCT and microperimetry.  Any safety information collected as a result of the efficacy 
assessments (e.g., BCVA) will also be used in the overall safety evaluation, as applicable.
Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery if deemed clinically necessary.  
If cataract surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 4 weeks before Month 12 
(Visit 9) for the respective eye.  The cataract surgery timing must be discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to the procedure.
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he completes Period 2, Visit 9 
(Month 12).  The end of the trial is the date the last subject completes Period 2, Visit 9 
(Month 12) assessments (or early termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature 
discontinuation) or the date of last data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.  After 
study completion, subjects will be invited to participate in a long-term safety follow-up study 
that will permit continued safety and efficacy monitoring over an extended period of time 
post-treatment.

19Subjects Previously Treated with AAV2-REP1
Subjects who have previously participated in a clinical trial of AAV2-REP1 for the treatment 
of CHM and have received AAV2-REP1 in one eye may be eligible for participation in this 
study.  In these cases, only the subject’s untreated eye will be assessed for eligibility per 
Section  8.  Following the Screening Visit and determination of eligibility, the subject will 
move directly into Period 2 for treatment of SE2. 
For subjects who received previous treatment with AAV2-REP1, biological samples must be 
available to obtain an adequate immunology profile related to treatment of the first eye in the 
previous study.  These subjects will require Sponsor approval before being enrolled into the 
study.
7.2 Discussion of Design
Since CHM is a bilateral disease, this open-label study is being conducted to assess the safety 
of AAV2-REP1 administered to both eyes of subjects with CHM.  All enrolled subjects will 
receive treatment with AAV2-REP1 at a dose of 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 gp/eye. Bilateral sub-
retinal administration of AAV2-REP1 was explored in a pre-clinical toxicology study in rats 
and was found to be well tolerated and not associated with drug-related AEs.  Furthermore, 
sequential sub-retinal administration of an AAV2 vector to the contralateral eye in children 
and adults with Leber's congenital amaurosis was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, 
irrespective of baseline immune status (Bennett, Wellman et al. 2016).
The planned sample size (approximately 60 subjects, with a total of 120 treated eyes) is 
considered sufficient to characterise the immunological, vector shedding, and safety profiles 
of bilateral retinal gene therapy with AAV2-REP1.  A prospective trial period of at least 
12 months following the administration of AAV2-REP1 in each eye is considered a sufficient 
period of time to observe any treatment related safety concerns.  
The dose of vector being employed in this study is based on previous clinical trials using the 
AAV2 vector with a chicken β actin (CBA) promoter (Maguire, High et al. 2009, MacLaren, 
Groppe et al. 2014), and the Phase 1 / 2 investigator-sponsored clinical studies in which 
AAV2-REP1 was administered to subjects with CHM (MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014) 
(Dimopolous, Hoang et al. 2018, Fischer, Ochakovski et al. 2018, Lam, Davis et al. 2019).
Application of AA
V2-REP1 to the retina requires retinal detachment following vitrectomy.  
The risks of vitrectomy and retinal detachment are summarized in Section 5.4.
In line with guidance from regulatory agencies, the treatment intervals were chosen to 
comprehensively characterise the immunological profile following bilateral, sequential 
AAV2-REP1 treatment, and to reflect real-world application of gene therapy.  As noted, both 
preclinical data with AAV2-REP1, and clinical data with sub-retinal administration of an 
AAV2 vector in subjects with Leber's congenital amaurosis, support bilateral administration 
of AAV2-REP1 in humans.
To minimise inflammation resulting from surgery, and potential or unexpected immune 
responses to vector/transgene, all subjects will be given a course of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, initiated 2 days prior to surgery on both SE1 and SE2.  The regimen 
has been modified from the 17-day protocol established in the Philadelphia AAV gene 
therapy clinical trial (Maguire, Simonelli et al. 2008), with the allowance of an extra 4 days 
for tapering the dose at the end of the course.  The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day (for 
a maximum of 80 mg/daily) prednisone/prednisolone for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days 
before the vector injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by

228.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.  In 
addition, the Investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the 
Investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including:
Significant protocol deviation
Significant non-compliance with study requirements
AE which results in an inability to continue to comply with study assessments
Lost to follow up
Other (to be specified on the electronic case report form [eCRF]).
oIf severe ocular inflammation (e.g. endophthalmitis) or any other post-
operative sequela that is unresponsive to treatment occurs in SE1, the second 
eye should not be treated.  However, Period 1 should be continued for 
monitoring of safety for the duration of the study.
oAt the discretion of the Investigator, if a persistent post-operative complication 
or poor visual function outcome presents post-operatively in SE1, the second 
eye may not be treated. However, Period 1 should be continued for monitoring 
of safety for the duration of the study.
In the event that a subject discontinues the study, the reason for withdrawal is to be recorded 
in the eCRF, and the site should use every reasonable effort to ensure that an end of trial (ET) 
Visit is conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures (Table 1).  If the subject is 
withdrawn due to an AE, the Investigator will arrange for follow-up until the event has 
resolved, subsided, stabilised, or the subject withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up.  For 
subjects who withdraw consent, data will be collected through their last available study visit.  
Subjects withdrawn from the study may possibly be replaced.  Subjects who withdraw from 
the study must undergo the ET Visit assessments. See Table 1.
Withdrawal from the study will not result in the exclusion of a subject’s data acquired up to 
the point of withdrawal.

239 STUDY TREATMENT
9.1 Treatments Administered
Eligible subjects will undergo vitrectomy and retinal detachment in each eye.  At Period 1, 
Visit 1 (Day 0, the Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will receive in SE1 a sub-retinal 
injection of up to 0.1 mL of study drug containing 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 gp.  At Period 2, 
Visit 1 (Day 0, the Injection Day Visit for SE2), subjects will receive in SE2 up to 0.1 mL of 
AAV2-REP1 via sub-retinal injection.
9.2 Description of Study Drug
The AAV2 vector contains recombinant human cDNA encoding REP1 (AAV2-REP1).  The 
vector genome (AAV2-CBA-hREP1-WPRE-BGH) is comprised of a strong constitutive 
expression cassette, a hybrid CBA promoter, the human cDNA encoding REP1, a modified 
woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) sequence, and a bovine 
growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH-polyA) sequence flanked by AAV2 inverted 
terminal repeats.  The cDNA fragment was originally isolated from a human retinal cDNA 
library from unaffected individuals.
The AAV2-REP1 drug product is formulated in a sterile, 20 mM Tris-buffered solution, 
pH 8.0, and contains 1 mM MgCl 2, 200 mM NaCl and 0.001% PF68.  The drug product is a 
clear to slightly opalescent, colourless, sterile-filtered suspension with a target concentration 
of 1×10^12 gp/mL.
9.3 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage
AAV2-REP1 is currently supplied in sterile single-use vials, stoppered and capped.  A total 
of 0.3 mL vector suspension will be supplied for each eye to be treated.  Prior to shipment, 
each vial will be placed in a labeled secondary container.  The drug product is to be stored at 
<−60oC (<−76oF) in a controlled access, temperature monitored freezer.
The GTMP will be labeled in compliance with regulatory standards. 
9.4 Vitrectomy Procedure and Injection of AAV2-REP1
Injection of AAV2-REP1 is to be performed by an appropriately qualified and experienced 
retinal surgeon.  All surgeons must have completed surgical training and obtained 
certification by NightstaRx to perform the study procedure, before treating a study 
participant.  Training conducted as part of a previous AAV2-REP1 clinical trial or alternative 
AAV NightstaRx-sponsored gene therapy trial, can be used as the basis for approval.
Due to the complexity and unpredictability of detaching the retina in CHM, in which the 
retina and choroid can be extremely thin and fused in places, a modification to the technique 
of sub-retinal gene therapy has been developed.  This involves performing the vector delivery 
in 2 steps after vitrectomy.  An advantage of a 2-step procedure is that any unexpected 
complications of retinal detachment can be managed conservatively, minimising concerns 
about the vector escaping into the vitreous.  Further, the injection could be deferred until a 
later date if, for instance, a macular hole was created which required treatment with gas.  
Also, since the volume of fluid required to detach the fovea is variable, by removing the 
vector from the first step, a precise consistent dose in terms of genome particles can still be 
applied into the sub-retinal space.

24Initially, subjects will undergo a standard vitrectomy and detachment of the posterior hyaloid 
in the respective study eye (Figure 2).  All surgeries will be conducted using the standard 
BIOM vitrectomy system.  A 23-gauge sutured approach is usually favored to avoid any 
potential risks of wound leakage.  The retina will be detached with 0.1-0.5 mL of balanced 
salt solution (BSS) injected through a 41-gauge sub-retinal cannula connected to a vitreous 
injection set.
In the second step of the procedure, the BSS cannula is removed from the eye and AAV2-
REP1 is prepared for injection.  A dose of up to 1.0×10^11 gp of AAV2-REP1 is injected 
into the sub-retinal space through the same entry site.  To improve visualization of the vector 
and facilitate dosing, surgeons are given the option of adding a minute quantity of trypan blue 
ophthalmic solution (~6 µL) to the vector solution.  See the GEMINI Surgical Manual for 
further details.
Prior to administration, the vector needs to be primed in the 1-mL syringe to avoid formation 
of air bubbles, and a connector is used so that the 1-mL syringe can be connected to the 
constant pressure line of the vitrectomy machine.  The sub-retinal injection will target any 
area of the macula, but also include the fovea, if possible.  In each case, the vector is injected 
so that the sub-retinal fluid overlies all edge boundaries of the central region that has yet to 
undergo chorioretinal degeneration, as identified by fundus AF.  After wound closure, care 
will be taken to dispose of all irrigating fluids that may have passed through the eye to limit 
potential vector spread.  See the GEMINI Surgical Manual for further details.
Subjects will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs peri- and post-operatively.  
All AEs, irrespective of relationship to the study drug and/or the surgical procedure, will be 
captured in the subject’s medical record and reported in the eCRF.
Air fluid exchange during pars plana vitrectomy is not required for this surgical procedure.  
However, if an air fluid exchange is considered necessary, patients must be instructed to 
avoid air travel, travelling to high elevations or scuba diving until the air bubble has 
completely dissipated from the eye.  It may take one week or more following injection for the 
air bubble to dissipate.  A change in altitude while the air bubble is still present can result in 
irreversible vision loss.  The dissipation of the air bubble should be verified through 
meticulous ophthalmic examination.

Not applicable for this study.
9.6 Study Masking
Not applicable for this study.
9.7 Study Drug Accountability
Records of the receipt and dispensing of study drug will be kept by each study centre until the 
end of the study to provide complete accounting of all used and unused study drug.  
Dispensation logs will be checked by the Sponsor (or its designee).  Study centres will 
destroy all used vials in accordance with local regulations, and will return all unused study 
drug to the Sponsor (or its designee) at the end of the study.  Final drug accountability will be 
verified by the Sponsor (or its designee).
9.8 Concomitant Therapy
Subjects cannot have participated in another research study involving an investigational 
product in the past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously, 
except if treated within another study with AAV2-REP1.
Throughout the study, subjects may be prescribed any concomitant medications, procedures, 
or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.  Details of concomitant 
medications, procedures and/or treatments will be collected during the Screening Period and 
updated at every study visit (including the ET Visit, if applicable).  Concomitant medications 
(including oral corticosteroid), procedures and/or treatments taken during the study are to be 
recorded in the subject’s medical records and eCRF; an exception to this is any medication 
used in the course of conducting study assessments (e.g., ophthalmic dyes, topical 
anaesthesia, dilating eye drops).
In addition, all subjects will be prescribed a course of oral corticosteroids. 
The oral prednisone / prednisolone regimen has been modified from the 17-day protocol 
established in the Philadelphia voretigene neparvovec-rzyl gene therapy clinical trial for 
treatment of patients with confirmed bi-allelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy 
(Maguire, Simonelli et al. 2008), with the allowance of an extra 4 days for tapering the dose 
at the end of the course.  The
 corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone 
(not to exceed 80 mg/daily) for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector 
injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 
0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total; Study Day (SD) 
-2 through SD18).  This regimen is outlined in detail below. 
Full Corticosteroid Regimen
Prednisone or prednisolone administered as follows:
SD -2 through SD 7 (10 days): 1 mg/kg by mouth daily (not to exceed 80 mg/daily)
SD 8 through SD 14 (7 days): 0.5 mg/kg/day by mouth daily
SD 15 through SD 16 (2 days): 0.25 mg/kg/day by mouth daily
SD 17 through SD 18 (2 days): 0.125 mg/kg/day by mouth daily
For SE1, the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should be initiated as described.  
AAV2-REP1

CONFIDENTIAL
26For SE2 surgeries that occur on day 21 or later, the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should be 
initiated as described, beginning 2 days before the scheduled SE2 surgery.
If SE2 is to be performed prior to Study Day 21, then the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should 
be initiated 2 days prior to the scheduled surgery for SE2, and this will supersede the steroid 
taper in progress for SE1.  The full 21 days of treatment will then be completed for SE2.  
Details of corticosteroid usage will be captured by each subject in a diary card. 
If inflammation is observed in the study eye, and in the opinion of the Investigator additional 
treatment with corticosteroid medication is indicated, corticosteroid therapy may be increased 
during the taper period (to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/day), may be reinitiated following 
completion of the taper, and/or may be supplemented by intraocular corticosteroids.  
9.9 Treatment Compliance
This study involves a single sub-retinal injection of a volume of up to 0.1 mL AAV2-REP1 in 
each eye.  Measure of treatment compliance with AAV2-REP1 is therefore not necessary.
Compliance with the use of prednisone/prednisolone will be captured in the eCRF; subject 
diary cards will be provided to participants prior to each surgery.

2710 STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES
The schedule of study procedures is presented in Table 1.
At each study visit, an attempt should be made to perform all procedures in both eyes.
10.1 Screening Period
The Investigator will explain the study purpose, procedures and subject responsibilities to 
each potential study subject.  The subject's willingness and ability to meet the protocol 
requirements will be determined.
Prior to any study-specific procedure, written informed consent will be obtained.  The subject 
will sign and date 1 copy of the consent form in the presence of the Investigator or his/her 
designee.  The original signed form will be retained at the study site and an additional copy 
will remain in the subject’s medical records; a copy will also be given to the subject.
After informed consent has been obtained, the subject will be allocated a subject identifier 
and evaluated to determine study eligibility.  
Screening procedures will consist of the following (all ophthalmic assessments will be 
conducted on both eyes):
Demography, medical and ocular history
Vital signs
Weight
Vector shedding sampling – blood, tears (both eyes), urine, saliva
Immunogenicity sampling
BCVA 
Microperimetry
Full ophthalmic examination, including IOP, a slit-lamp examination, lens opacity, 
and dilated fundus examination
SD-OCT 
AF
7-field colour fundus photography (including stereo photographs for fields 1, 2, and 3)
AE and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures, and treatment review
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
assigned a subject number and will be enrolled into the study.  The Investigator will assign 
the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., SE1 and SE2, respectively).  This will be done in 
collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be selected for 
treatment first.  Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed 
collectively by the Patient Eligibility Review Committee, which includes the Investigator, a 
consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). The target 
interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be determined at this visit.
For each subject, the interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to range from  
weeks to months.  While this interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will 
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0

CONFIDENTIAL
28be made to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the 
immunological and safety profile of sequential treatment administration and to reflect the 
anticipated real-world application of the study drug.  Thus, approximately 20 subjects will be 
treated with a short- (<6 month), medium- (6-12 months), or long- (>12 month) duration 
surgery window between treatment of the first and second eye.   Because the timing of the 
second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among subjects, the duration of study Period 
1 will also be variable.  To avoid unnecessary study visits, every effort should be made by the 
Investigator to schedule Period 2, Visit 1 to coincide with a planned Period 1 post-treatment 
visit. 
The next study visit (i.e., surgery and dosing, Period 1, Visit 1) is to be scheduled within 
10 weeks of the Screening Period.  Subjects will attend Period 1, Visits 2-9 unless the second 
surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) begins, which will mark the start of study Period 2.  Because 
the timing of the second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among subjects, the 
duration of study Period 1 will also be variable.
Subjects will be treated with oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone / prednisone) during the 
peri-operative period for each eye.  They will be instructed to start taking the drug 2 days 
before their surgery at Period 1, Visit 1 for SE1.  For SE1, the Full Corticosteroid Regimen 
should be initiated, as described in Section 9.8.
For SE2 surgeries that occur on Day 21 or later, the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should be 
initiated as described, begining 2 days before the scheduled surgery. 
If SE2 is to be performed prior to Study Day 21, then the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should 
be initiated 2 days prior to the scheduled surgery for SE2, and this will supersede the steroid 
taper in progress for SE1.  The full 21 days of treatment will then be completed for SE2. 
Subjects will be issued a diary card to capture corticosteroid compliance.  Subjects will also 
be instructed to use barrier contraception or abstain from sexual intercourse for a period of 
3 months from the time they are treated.
The schedule of procedures is identical for Periods 1 and 2; during each period, procedures 
are to be conducted in both SE1 and SE2.
If a subject has previously participated in a clinical trial of AAV2-REP1 for the treatment of 
CHM and has received AAV2-REP1 in one eye, the untreated eye will be assigned as SE2 at 
the Screening Visit and the subject will immediately enter Period 2.
10.1.1 Baseline Visit, Period 2 (<10 Weeks from Visit 1, Period 2 [SE2])
The following baseline assessments for Period 2 must be performed within 10 weeks prior to 
surgery for SE2 (Visit 1, Period 2).  If the assessments have not been performed within a 
regularly scheduled visit within this window, an additional visit is required. 
Vital signs
Weight
Vector shedding sampling – blood, tears (both eyes), urine, saliva
Immunogenicity sampling
BCVA 
Microperimetry

SD-OCT 
AF
7-field colour fundus photography (including stereo photographs for fields 1, 2, and 3)
AE and SAE monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures and treatment review
Eligibility for SE2 surgery will then be confirmed collectively by the Patient Eligibility 
Review Committee, which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor 
(see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). 
If BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS letters, surgery may be performed when, in the opinion of the 
Patient Eligibility Review Committee: 
1. the subject is found eligible by all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
2. the subject is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modifiable 
disease.
10.2 Period 1 and 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit)
At Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit), the following assessments will be performed:
Full ophthalmic examination, including IOP, a slit-lamp examination, lens opacity, 
and dilated fundus examination 
AE/SAE monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures, and treatment review (including review of the 
corticosteroid diary card)
It may be necessary for subjects to undergo a pre-surgical workup according to local hospital 
procedures (e.g., blood draw for anesthetist) which are outside of the protocol-defined 
assessments.  Any assessments performed outside of the protocol will not be collected as part 
of the study analysis.
Subjects will then undergo vitrectomy and receive a volume of up to 0.1 mL sub-retinal 
injection of AAV2-REP1, containing 1×10^11 gp (see Section 9.4 for details).  Subjects will 
be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs during the procedure.  Subjects will return 
to the site 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after surgery for post-operative follow-up (Visit 2 [Day 1], 
Visit 3 [Day 3 + 2 Days], Visit 4 [Day 7 -1/+2 Days] and Visit 5 [Day 14 ±  3 Days], 
respectively).
The post-operative outcome and visual function of SE1 will inform the scheduling of 
Period 2.  Significant signs of post-operative inflammation or other post-operative sequelae, 
as judged by the Investigator, should be resolved in SE1 for the subject to continue to 
Period 2.  After a comprehensive evaluation of all safety assessments and visual functional 
tests of SE1 and SE2, the Investigator will decide the appropriate time to schedule SE2, 
Visit 1. If severe ocular inflammation or any other post-operative sequela that is unresponsive 
to treatment occurs in SE1, the second eye should not be treated. However, Period 1 should 
be continued for monitoring of safety for the duration of the study.

30To allow accurate characterisation of AAV2-REP1 safety and immunogenicity profile, 
treatment of SE2 should not occur if a previous intraocular surgery was performed on the 
same eye within 3 months of the planned treatment date.  If intraocular surgery has occurred 
within 3 months, treatment of SE2 should be delayed until such a time that the 3-month 
interval has elapsed and there is complete post-operative recovery of the eye.
10.3 Period 1 and 2, Visit 2 (Post-operative Day 1)
For Visit 2, ocular assessments and procedures will be performed on each eye.  At Visit 2 
(Post-operative Day 1), subjects will return to the site for their first post-operative visit for the

3411 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
11.1 Evaluation, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events
11.1.1 Definitions
11.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug/surgical procedure.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug/surgical 
procedure, whether or not related to the investigational product or with the surgical procedure 
described in this protocol.
AEs are to also include any pre-existing condition (other than CHM) or illness that worsens 
during the study (i.e., increases in frequency or intensity).
Worsening of the signs, symptoms and visual function related to CHM is not to be considered 
an AE unless, in the opinion of the Investigator, the changes are not consistent with the 
natural progression of the disease. 
11.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Results in vision loss or is vision threatening
Is another important medical event(s)
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the 
subject is at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.
Hospitalisation that was pre-scheduled prior to obtaining the consent to participate in the 
study or for an elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment for a pre-existing 
condition which has not worsened, does not constitute an SAE.
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be 
considered an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized.  The study site must document all of 
the following:
The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent to participate in the study.
The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion of the 
Investigator between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and the time of 
the procedure or treatment.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0
12 Nov2020
CONFIDENTIAL
35The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospital admission.
If a subject is hospitalized due to local requirements for administration of the study treatment, 
the hospitalization should not be considered an SAE unless one of the requirements in 
Section 11.1.1.2 is met.
Other events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening or do not require 
hospitalisation, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.
Vision Loss to be Reported as Serious Adverse Events
Vision Loss not to be Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart occurring within 1 
day of surgery, but recovering / resolving at post-operative Days 7 and 14. 
Vision Loss or Vision-Threatening Event to be Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 
day of surgery and that has not recovered* by the 1-Month Visit.
A decrease in BCVA of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 day of 
surgery, however, in the Investigator’s opinion:
oHas an evolution not consistent with the expected post-operative course; 
oMay be attributable to a complication that occurred during surgery, or another 
untoward event, or the study drug; 
oActually or potentially requires any surgical or medical intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of vision.
Non-surgery-related, sustained (>48 hours duration) decrease from baseline in BCVA 
of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart.
*Recovery / Resolution of BCVA is defined as a return to baseline BCVA within 5 letters on 
the ETDRS chart.
11.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs/SAEs will be collected from the time the subject provides written informed consent 
(Screening Visit) through Period 2, Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 Days or ET Visit, if applicable). 
Subjects will be questioned on the occurrence of an AE at every visit including any 
unscheduled visit, by using non-leading questioning such as ‘How have you been since the 
last visit?’  
All AEs occurring during the study observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject, 
whether or not attributed to study drug or the surgical procedure, will be recorded in the 
subject’s medical records and in the eCRF.  Any clinically significant changes in laboratory 
results or vital sign measurements (as determined by the Investigator) are to be recorded as an 
AE.
Ocular AEs are to be recorded on a per-eye basis.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0
12 Nov2020
CONFIDENTIAL
36The following information will be recorded in the eCRF for each AE: description, date of 
onset and end date, outcome, severity, assessment of relatedness to study drug/study 
procedure, the action taken and confirmation of whether the event is considered serious (see 
Section  11.1.1.2 for the definition of seriousness).  Follow-up information should be provided 
as necessary (see Section 11.1.3 for specifics on follow-up procedures).
AE severity and relationship to the study drug or the surgical procedure will be assessed at 
the site by the Investigator or a medically qualified designee.
AE Severity
The severity of events will be assessed on the following scale:
1 = mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
2 = moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3 = severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).
AE Relationship
When assigning relatedness of the AE, consideration will be given to whether there is a 
plausible relationship to either the study drug or the surgical procedure.  The following are 
definitions of relatedness that will be used in this study: 
Unrelated: The event is not reasonably related in time to the administration 
of the study drug/surgical procedure, or exposure of the study 
drug/surgical procedure has not yet occurred, or biologic 
plausibility does not exist
Related: A reasonable possibility exists that the study drug / study 
procedure caused the AE. A suspected AE can be further 
defined by:
Possibly related: a relationship is clinically or biologically 
reasonable relative to the administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure, but the event could have been due to 
another equally likely cause
Probably related: a relationship is clinically/biologically 
reasonable relative to the administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure, and the event is more likely explained 
by exposure to/administration of the study drug/surgical 
procedure than by other factors and causes
Definitely related: there is a causal relationship of the onset 
of the event, relative to administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure and there is no other cause to explain 
the event.
When a relationship is determined to exist, the Investigator or medical designee will further 
define if that relationship is to the study drug, the study procedure, both, or unknown .
11.1.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events
AEs will be followed until the subject has recovered or the subject’s participation in the study 
is complete.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0

CONFIDENTIAL
37Subjects who are withdrawn from the study as a result of a drug-related AE will be followed 
up until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, or the subject withdraws consent or is 
lost to follow-up.
All SAEs, regardless of attribution to study drug or the surgical procedure, should be 
followed-up until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, or the subject withdraws 
consent or is lost to follow-up.  The Sponsor (or designee) will follow up on SAE reports to 
completion.  Investigators are expected to provide the requested additional information for a 
complete assessment and documentation of the SAE reports in a timely manner.
11.1.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator shall immediately (within 24 hours of learning of the event) report any SAE 
to the Sponsor (or its designee) by completing and emailing the SAE form.  For reporting 
purposes, the date of SAE form submission by the Investigator to the Sponsor will be 
designated as Day 0.. The initial report shall be promptly followed up with a more detailed 
report providing specifics about the subject and the event.  Copies of hospital reports, autopsy 
reports, and other documents should be provided (if applicable).
The Sponsor will report SAEs and SUSARs to investigative sites, the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and regulatory authorities in compliance 
with current regulations.  All cases that are fatal or life-threatening will be reported 
immediately after the Sponsor received the initial report from the Investigator.  All non-fatal 
or non-life-threatening cases will be reported within a maximum of 15 days after the initial 
Investigator’s report.  The Sponsor will also provide periodic safety reports to IRBs/IECs and 
regulatory authorities, as applicable.  Follow-up SAE reports will be submitted within 15 
days of receiving the information.
A sample SAE form is provided in the Study Operations Manual, along with the SAE 
reporting contact information.
11.1.5 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be used in this study to safeguard 
the safety and interests of study subjects and assess the safety and risk/benefit of the gene 
therapy intervention during the trial.
At regular intervals during the study, the DMC will review the progress and accrued study 
data and provide advice to the Sponsor on the efficacy and safety aspects of the study.  The 
DMC will also inform the Sponsor if there is a consensus that the ongoing data show that the 
gene therapy, its method of administration, and/or the study design are no longer in the best 
interests of study subjects.  Details of DMC organisation and responsibilities are included 
within a DMC charter.
11.2 Pregnancy
Any pregnancy that occurs during the clinical study in a female partner of a study subject 
should be recorded on a Pregnancy Notification Form.  Consent from the pregnant partner is 
required prior to the collection of personal data.  However, the Investigator shall immediately

3811.3 Stopping Criteria
Severe ocular inflammation (e.g. endophthalmitis) that is unresponsive to treatment 
should result in the affected subject not being treated in the second eye. However, the 
subject will continue to be followed for safety for the duration of the study. 
At the request of the DMC, the trial may be stopped based on specific safety concerns 
(i.e., SUSARs), not defined in the Investigator’s Brochure (Section 6.3).
The study may be discontinued if the Sponsor deems it necessary for medical, safety, 
regulatory, business, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws or regulations.
11.4 Laboratory Assessments
11.4.1 Vector Shedding
Blood, tears (both eyes), urine and saliva samples will be collected at the times indicated in 
Table 1 and tested using an appropriate assay for evidence of vector shedding and dispersion.  
Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.  Refer to the Study Operations 
Manual for details on the shipping and handling of samples.
11.4.2 Immunogenicity
For the evaluation of immunogenicity, blood will be collected at the times indicated in  Table 
1.  Selected samples will be analysed.  
Immunoassays are planned to assess cell-based and antibody-based immune responses 
against AAV2-REP1.  Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays will be used for the 
assessment of T-cell-mediated immune responses to transgene product (REP1) and the 
capsid.  Antibody responses against the capsid and transgene product will be measured using 
a cell-based neutralization assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
respectively.
Refer to the Study Operations Manual for details on the shipping and handling of samples.
Remaining samples may be stored for up to 15 years or per local regulations. 
11.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs (pulse and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be taken at the times 
indicated in Table 1.  Vital signs should be taken after the subject is seated for at least 
5 minutes.
11.6 Best-Corrected Visual Acuity
To evaluate changes in BCVA over the study period, BCVA will be assessed using the 
ETDRS VA chart and performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 1.
The BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be 
carried out before BCVA is measured.  Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 metres from 
the chart.  If <20 letters are read at 4 metres, testing at 1 metre should be performed.  BCVA 
is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the subject.
For BCVA, assessors will be appropriately qualified for conducting the assessment.
If a subject is not able to perform an assessment due to poor VA, it will be documented 
accordingly in the eCRF and will not be recorded as a protocol deviation.

CONFIDENTIAL
3911.7 Microperimetry
Microperimetry will be conducted on both eyes at the times indicated in Table 1.
Microperimetry will be conducted by certified technicians to assess changes in retinal 
sensitivity within the macula.  All microperimetry images will be sent by the sites to a 
Central Reading Centre (CRC) for review.  For complete technical specifications for 
microperimetry, refer to the Study Operations Manual (which will include procedures from 
the CRC regarding how measurements are to be taken).
11.8 Fundus Autofluorescence
To assess changes in the area of viable retinal tissue, fundus AF will be performed on both 
eyes at the times indicated in Table 1.
All fundus AF images will be performed by certified technicians at the site after dilation of 
the subject’s pupil and sent to a CRC for review; the CRC will enter the data into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system.  For complete technical specifications for AF, refer to 
the Study Operations Manual (which will include procedures from the CRC regarding how 
measurements are to be taken).
11.9 Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography 
SD-OCT will be performed on both eyes at the times indicated in Table 1.
SD-OCT measurements will be taken by certified technicians at the site after dilation of the 
subject’s pupil.  All OCT scans will be submitted by the sites to a CRC where the scans will 
be evaluated; the CRC will enter the data into the EDC system.  SD-OCT will be used to 
quantify integrity of the ellipsoid zone and reduction in the signal from the outer nuclear 
layer and choroid. In addition, foveal changes will be assessed.  For complete technical 
specifications for SD-OCT, refer to the Study Operations Manual (which will include 
procedures from the CRC regarding how measurements are to be taken).
11.10 Full Ophthalmic Examination
A full ophthalmic examination will be performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 
1.
Each ophthalmic examination will include IOP, slit lamp examination, lens opacity grading, 
and dilated ophthalmoscopy.  The same slit lamp machine and lighting conditions should be 
used across study visits for any given subject.
In addition to the parameters listed above, subjects will be carefully examined for the 
presence of intraocular inflammation after vector administration.  Cataract can also develop 
as a result of the vitrectomy procedure and can potentially affect VA.  Pre-operative grading 
of lens opacity and colour should therefore be documented by the established clinical LOCS 
III.  A recent study has shown that cataract surgery is effective in subjects with CHM and 
without any specific risks (Edwards, Jolly et al. 2016).  Subjects who develop cataracts may 
undergo cataract surgery if de
emed clinically necessary.  If cataract surgery is performed, it 
should be carried out at least 4 weeks before Month 12 (Visit 9) for the respective eye.
11.11 7-Field Colour Fundus Photography
Seven-field colour fundus photography will be performed for both eyes at the times indicated 
in Table 1.

4213 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Sample Size
Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study.  A total of 120 treated 
eyes is considered sufficient to characterise the immunological profile of bilateral AAV2-
REP1 administration, which is the key concern of gene therapy re-administration.
13.2 Procedure for Accounting for Missing Data
All reasonable efforts will be made to obtain complete data for both eyes on all subjects.  
However, missing observations may occur.  Management of dropout and missing 
observations will depend on their nature and frequency and will be discussed as part of the 
Data Review meeting before database lock.
Safety data will be analysed on observed data (missing data will not be imputed).  The 
analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed using the last observation carried forward 
approach for imputation of missing data.
13.3 Analysis Sets
The ‘All Treated Subjects’ Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who attend the ‘Day of 
Surgery’ visit of Period 1 (or, of Period 2, for subjects who received AAV2-REP1 treatment 
in SE1 in an antecedent study).  The All Treated Subjects Analysis Set will be the primary 
population for demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety and efficacy analyses.

4514 INFORMED CONSENT, ETHICAL REVIEW AND REGULATORY 
CONSIDERATIONS
14.1 Informed Consent
Male subjects with CHM who meet all of the entry criteria will be invited to take part in the 
study.  Subjects must personally sign and date the latest IEC / IRB approved version of the 
informed consent form before any study-specific procedures are performed.
Written and verbal versions of the subject information and informed consent will be 
presented to the subjects detailing no less than: the exact nature of the study; the implications 
and constraints of the protocol; and the known side effects and any risks involved in taking 
part.  It will be clearly stated that the subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time 
for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for 
withdrawal.
The subject will be allowed as much time as needed to consider the information and the 
opportunity to question the Investigator, their primary care physician/general practitioner or 
other independent parties to decide whether they will participate in the study.  Written 
informed consent will then be obtained by means of subject dated signature and dated 
signature of the person who presented and obtained the informed consent.  The person who 
obtained the consent must be suitably qualified and experienced and have been authorised to 
do so by the Investigator.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to each 
subject.  The original signed form will be retained at the study site and an additional copy 
will remain in the subject’s medical records.
14.2 Ethical/Regulatory Review
The protocol, informed consent form, subject information sheet and any proposed advertising 
material will be submitted to an appropriate Research Ethics Committee (IEC or IRB), 
regulatory authorities and host institution(s) for written approval.  If there are any changes to 
the approved protocol (with the exception of emergency modifications required for the 
subject’s safety), a protocol amendment will be issued by the Sponsor.  When required by 
local law, the IEC/IRB and Competent Authority must give written approval of any 
amendments likely to affect the safety of subjects or study conduct.  Each site must maintain 
accurate and updated records of all correspondence with the IEC/IRB.
14.3 Regulatory Considerations
The study will be conducted in full conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, 
including the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) (CPMP/ICH/135/95).
The study, where permissible, will be conducted in accordance with the relevant articles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki as adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly in 1964 and as 
revised in Tokyo (1975), Venice (1983), Hong Kong (1989), South Africa (1996), Scotland

15.1 Data Quality Control and Assurance
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current approved protocol, ICH GCP, 
relevant regulations and standard operating procedures.
The Sponsor and its selected vendors have systems in place for implementing and 
maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems, with written standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) to ensure that all aspects of the trial will be conducted in compliance with 
this protocol and data will be generated, documented and reported in compliance with this 
protocol.
Data will be entered into a validated clinical study database and subject to programmed 
validation checks and manually verified for accuracy and completeness by a Sponsor’s 
representative, both remotely and during on-site monitoring visits.  Any discrepancies will be 
resolved with the Investigator or designee, as appropriate.
Regular monitoring will be performed by the Sponsor or its designee according to ICH GCP.  
Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source 
documents.  Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the study is conducted and 
data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements.
In addition, this study will be subject to quality assurance audits in order to independently 
verify compliance with the protocol.
15.2 Data Handling and Records Management
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents, which will be the 
basis of information for the eCRFs.  The source documents are to be separate and distinct 
from the eCRFs.  All study data will be entered on an encrypted EDC system with pass-codes 
known to all Investigators and appropriately delegated study team members.  This electronic 
data entry system has been validated. Incomplete or inconsistent data will result in data 
queries that require resolution by the Investigator or designee.
The Investigator must ensure that clinical study records are retained according to national 
regulations.  The Investigator must immediately inform the Sponsor if any documents are to 
be destroyed, transferred to another facility or transferred to a different owner.
In addition, files containing photos or digital outputs will be electronically transmitted to the 
reading centre for centralised, standardised review.  One reading centre is anticipated. Data 
from the reading centre will either be entered into the EDC system or provided as an external 
data set that will be loaded directly into the study database.
Samples will also be provided to a central laboratory for analysis of vector shedding and 
immunogenicity.  Results from these analyses will also be provided as an external data set 
that will be loaded directly into the study database.
The Investigator must retain sufficient documentation that these images, outputs and samples 
were handled and transmitted appropriately.

aScreening Visit/Period must be performed <10 weeks of Period 1, Visit 1. Selection of SE1 and SE2 will be determined by the Investigator in collaboration with the subject. 
bBaseline assessments must occur before the SE2 is dosed. These can occur at a regularly scheduled visit if that visit is within 10 weeks prior to surgery in SE2. If it has been more 
than 10 weeks since a visit, the subject must return for assessments at this Baseline Period 2 visit.  
cSubjects will undergo vitrectomy and AAV2-REP1 administration to SE1 in Period 1; SE2 in Period 2. 
dET visit is to be performed if a subject discontinues at any time. 
eIf clinically indicated, subjects may need to return to the site for an unscheduled visit. At a minimum, the following assessments will be performed: BCVA, full ophthalmic

CONFIDENTIAL
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen MA Inc.
2PRIMARY REASON FOR AMENDMENT
The primary reason for this amendment to Protocol 273CH203 (NSR-REP-02) is for safety of 
participants: a maximum dose of 80 mg daily of corticosteroid has been added to the 
corticosteroid regimen.
New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough.
The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.
Section 7.2 Discussion of Design
Now reads:
The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day (for a maximum of 80 mg/daily) 
prednisone/prednisolone for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on 
the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day 
for 2 days; and 0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total).
Rationale: A maximum dose of 80 mg daily of corticosteroid has been added to the 
corticosteroid regimen.
This change also affects:
Section 9.8, Concomitant Therapy
The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone (not to exceed 80 mg/daily) 
for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on the day of injection, and 
then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 0.125 
mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total; Study Day (SD) -2 through SD18). 
Full Corticosteroid Regimen
Prednisone or prednisolone administered as follows:
SD -2 through SD 7 (10 days): 1 mg/kg by mouth daily (not to exceed 80 mg/daily)
SD 8 through SD 14 (7 days): 0.5 mg/kg/day by mouth daily
SD 15 through SD 16 (2 days): 0.25 mg/kg/day by mouth daily

Summary of Changes: Protocol: NSR-REP-02  30 Apr 2020 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 3 of 5 
 Overview / Rationale:  
The change to this protocol triggering Version 5.0 was to reference the Patient Eligibility Review 
Process.  The protocol now clearly describes that  the Investigator as well as the Sponsor and a 
surgical consultant through a collective decision-making process outlined in the Patient Eligibility Review Plan (version 2.0, dated 03 Ap ril 2020) ultimately determine the subject’s 
eligibility for surgery.  This process takes places subsequent to the subject’s eligibility determination based on meeting inclusion and exclusi on criteria and undergoing baseline 
assessments.  The aim of the Patient Eligibility Review is to determine if the subject is an appropriate candidate for surger y through examination of baselin e imaging (optical coherence 
tomography, fundus autofluorescence, fundus phot ography), best-corrected visual acuity, and 
microperimetry data, as well as genetic test resu lts, taking into consideration disease progression 
and the status of the choroideremic retina.  Both the Data Monitoring Committee for the GEMINI study, and the principal investigators have  been consulted regarding this amendment, 
and both parties did not recommend further amending the protocol to include  specific surgical 
eligibility criteria, preferring the current collaborative Patient Eligibility Review process.   
The Patient Eligibility Review Plan and each subject’s signed GEMINI surgery authorization 
form lie within the Trial Master File for the GEMINI study.

document all of the followi ng: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or was on a waiting

 Overview / Rationale of Major Changes :  
This protocol amendment was triggered primarily by recommendations and interactions  from 
regulatory bodies that have occurred in 2018. Five key revisions were made:  1) the sample size 
was increased from 15 to 60; 2) specific language was added  regarding the allocation of these 60 
subjects into 3 surgery windows of varying length, as recommended by FDA, to provide the broadest safety profile available on subjects treated  with short, medium and long time periods  
between surgeries ; 3) the corticosteroid regimen was revised  to clarify administration  required 
with bilateral treatment  performed with very short windows between surgeries; 4) the visual 
acuity inclusion criterion was revised to allow for the eligibility of subjects with more significant 
visual impairment; and lastly, 5) new requirements have been added to mandate baseline assessments prior to treating the second eye in the case of long surgery windows, to assure that the second eye remains  eligible and that the investigator still recommends treatment based on 
safety assessments and the visual function of both eyes at that time , as well as to establish 
accurate baseline values . In addition, a new inclusion criterion has been adde d mandating that 
subjects who enter this study from an antecedent study must have biological samples available to complete an adequate immunogenicity profile, if needed.  
A new benefit -risk assessment section has also been added to the Introduction, based on 
information collected  from ong oing safety  reporting of the Phase 3 STAR study.  This new 
section  outlines the expected risks of AAV2- REP1 treatment to include visual ac uity loss post-
treatment . The definition of vision loss as a serious adverse event was clarified, without changing 
the original meaning. Adverse event reporting was also modified to a binary system that still allowed the investigator to choose 3 levels of relatedness under “related to study drug or procedure”.  
Minor changes were made solely  for clarification.

Study Design,  
Pages 5 & 6 The study will consist of a 
Screening Visit followed by 
2 treatment periods (Period 
1 and Period 2) with up to 9 
visits per period.  At the 
Screening Visit,  subjects 
will be assessed for 
eligibility of both eyes.  This is a multi -centre, open -label, 
prospective, 2 period,  …, 
The study will consist of  a

Period 2) with up to 9 visits per 
period. During the Screening 
Period , subjects will be assessed for

 The investigator will assign the 
order in which the eyes are treated 
(i.e., study eye 1 [SE1 ]-Period 1] 
and study eye 2 [SE2 ]- Period 2] , 
respectively  with a number assigned 
to each eye.  This will be done in 
collaboration with the subject; 
however, the worse eye will 
generally  be selected for first 
treatment. The estimated target 
interval between the surgical 
procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be 
determined at the Screening Visit.  Added text to

(Added Text Shown as Red)  Rationale  
Each site will work with the 
Sponsor and the assigned 
Contract Research 
Organisation (CRO) to try 
and ensure an even spread 
of subjects across the 
intervals.  Thus , approximately 20 subjects 
each will be treated with a short (<6 
month), medium (6 -12 months), or 
long (>12 month) surgery window 
between treatment of the first and 
second eye.   Specified 
allocation of 
subjects into 3 
surgery windows 
as recommended 
by FDA to mimic 
real-world 
application of drug 
and to provide a 
broad assessment 
of safety with 
bilateral treatment.  
Because the timing of the 
second surgery visit (Period 
2, Visit 1) will vary  
between  subjects, the 
duration of study Period 1 
will also be variable.   To 
avoid unnecessary study 
visits, every effort should 
be made by the investigator 
to schedule Period 2, Visit 1 
to coincide with a planned 
Period 1 post -treatment 
visit.   Because the timing of the second 
surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will 
vary among subjec ts the duration of 
study Period 1 will also be variable.  Clarified text,

  or other post -operative sequelae,  Expanded text  
 …the Investigator will determine 
the eligibility of the subject and 
decide the appropriate time to 
schedule SE2, Visit 1.   
  All baseline ophthalmic 
assessments must be conducted 
within 3 months of SE2 surgery 
(Period 2, Visit 1).  If, at that time, 
the BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS 
letters, surgery may be performed 
when, in the opinion of the 
investigator and after consultation 
with the sponsor: 1) the subject is 
found eligible by all other inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, and 2) the 
subject is considered an appropriate 
candidate who has a potentially 
modifiable disease . Mandated that 
baseline 
assessment s be 
conducted if the 
second  eye is done 
with a long time 
period between 
surgeries to assure 
that the eligibility

In 2012, an investigator -
sponsored, first -in-human 
study of AAV2 -REP1 was 
initiated in patients with 
CHM  (MacLaren 1 study).   In 2011 , an investigator -sponsored, 
first-in-human study of AAV2 -
REP1 was initiated in adult m ale 
patients with CHM .   Specified males  
Based upon these  favorable 
results tThree  other 
investigator -sponsored 
studies were then initiated in which a total of 
32 CHM 
patients have  received a 
single sub -retinal injection 
of 1×10^11 gp in 1 eye with 
AAV2 -REP1 (the 
MacDonald, Fischer and 
Lam studies).  The initial 
(unpublished)  results of 
these trials are consistent with improved rod and cone function 
that overcome  any 
negative effect s of retinal 
detachment, and the gene therapy 
appears to be  
generally  well tolerated 
following a single treatment 
with AAV- REP1 .   
 
Emerging  data from non -
clinical and clinical studies 
with AAV2 vectors demonstrate that 
AAV2 
vectors  illicit a minimal 
immun e response, including 
after bilateral 
administration.   Following  favorable results 3 other 
investigator -sponsored studies were 
then initiated in which a total of 26 
adult male CHM patients received a 
single sub -retinal injection of 
1×10^11 gp AAV2 -REP1 in  1 eye .  
The initial results of these trials are consistent with improved rod and cone function despite  any negative 
effects of retinal detachment, and the gene therapy was generally  well 
tolerated .  AAV2 REP1 gene 
therapy has been shown to positively affe ct visual acuity (VA), 
considering both maintenance and stabilization of vision in the 
majority of subjects, as well as 
improvement of vision in subsets of CHM subjects for up to 2 years and beyond.  This clinical evidence supports the durability of the therapeutic effect of AAV2 -REP1 
for treating CHM.   
These findings lend support to further assessment of AAV2  gene 
therapy in the treatment of CHM.  NightstaRx is currently sponsoring a multi -centre, global Phase 3 study

Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Page 14   5.4 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
No treatment currently exists for 
CHM.  
The non- clinical studies conducted 
with AAV2 -REP1 showed that it 
provides efficient and functional transgene expression in CHM mouse and human cells, as well as in mouse and human RPE and 
photoreceptors, without overt 
toxicity.  R esults from the 26 -week 
single -dose combined 
toxicity/biodistribution study conducted in rats indicate that administration of AAV2 -REP1 by 
single sub -retinal injection to both 
eyes is well tolerated at dose levels of 1×10^9 and 6×10^9 gp/eye (equal to 1×10^11 and 6×10^11 gp/eye in humans) when evaluated 4 and 26 weeks after injection.  Minor 
reductions in some ERG 
parameters, ocular inflammation, and microscopic signs of retinal/corneal degeneration were observed and were considered 
procedure -related or not  
biologically significant.  
In humans, application of AAV2-
REP1 to the surface of the retina requires retinal detachment via vitrectomy.  The 2 -step procedure 
employed in delivering AAV2 -
REP1 sub -retinally  (see Section 
9.4), allows the management of unexpected surgical complications of retinal detachment before the AAV2 -REP1 is applied. 
Furthermore, since the volume of fluid required to detach the fovea is variable, by excluding the vector 
from the first st ep, and Added section for

administering the vector after 
successful retinal detachment has 
been achieved, a precise, consistent dose in terms of genome particles can be applied into the sub -retinal 
space.  Nevertheless, sub -retinal 
injection of AAV2 -REP1 carries the 
risks a ssociated with vitrectomy and 
retinal detachment, which include intra-operative and post -operative 
complications; infection (most 
notably infectious endophthalmitis); 
low and elevated IOP; choroidal detachment; persistent retinal detachment, retinal tears,  holes and 
breaks; macular hole and macular 
oedema; vitreous haemorrhage; 
visual impairment; metamorphopsia; and photopsia (Park et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1996; Banker et al., 1997; Cheng et al., 2001; Anderson et al., 2006; 
Stein et al., 2009; Recchi a et al., 
2010).  Post -operative intraocular 
inflammation caused by vitrectomy 
is often associated with transient or sometimes permanent visual impairment.  Another complication 
of vitrectomy is cataract formation, 
which may require an additional surgical procedure (cataract 
extraction) (Park et al., 1995; Cheng et al., 2001; Recchia et al., 2010).  In addition, the surgical procedure 
is performed under general 
anesthesia, which includes the risks of dizziness, confusion, nausea and vomiting.  Loss of visual  acuity has 
been observed post -treatment with 
AAV2 -REP1.; this visual acuity 
loss was determined by the investigators to be plausibly related to the administration of AAV2 -
REP1, however without definitively attributing the cause  to either the 
study procedu re or the GTMP.  Loss 
of visual acuity is, therefore, considered a Potential Risk of AAV2 -REP1 treatment, in addition 
to the above described potential and

Thus,  although there are risks 
associated with the administration 
of the study treatment via 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment, the potential for benefit in the form of improved visual acuity that may be provided to subjects with CHM following treatment with AA V2-
REP1 provides an acceptable risk -

in the subject’s medical records and eCRF; an exception to this is any medication used in the course of conducting a  
study 
procedure  (e.g., 
anaesthesia, dilating eye drops).  
To minimise inflammation 
resulting from surgery and 
potential or unexpected 
immune responses to 
vector/transgene, all 
subjects will be given a 21 -
day course of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone 
prior to each surgery2 .    
 
Administration of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone is 
to closely follow the 17 -day 
protocol established in the 
Philadelphia AAV gene 
therapy clinical trial 
(Maguire 2008), except for 
the allowance of an extra 4 Throughout the study, subjects may 
be prescribed any concomitant 
medications, procedures , or 
treatments deemed necessary to 
provide adequate supportive care.  
Details of concomitant medications, procedures and/or treatments will be 
collected during the Screening 
Period  and updated at every study 
visit (including the ET Visit, if applicable).  Concomitant 
medications (including oral corticosteroid) taken during the study are to be recorded in the subject’s medical records and 
eCRF; an exception to this is any 
medication used in the course of conducting study assessments (e.g., 
ophthalmic dyes, topical anesthesia, 
dilating eye drops).  
In addition, all subjects will be 
prescribed a course of oral 
corticosteroids.  
 
The oral prednisone / prednisolone regimen has been modified from the 
17-day protocol established in the 
voretigene neparvovec -rzyl 
Philadelphia AAV gene therapy 
clinical trial for treatment of 
patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation -associated retinal 
dystrophy (Maguire 2008), with the allowance of an extra 4 days for tapering the dose at the end of the course.  The corticoster oid regimen 
is 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone for a total 
of 10 days (beginning 2 days before 
the vector injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7 days); 
followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 This revision was 
made to include more than just concomitant 
medications, but 
also procedures or treatments, in the collection of medical status and 
updates of 
subjects.  
  Also the details of the corticosteroid 
regimen are 
provided,  and how 
these change depending on when the second eye is treated.

Subjects will be given two 
21-day courses of oral 
corticosteroid (e.g., 
prednisolone / prednisone) 
and instructed to start 
taking the drug days before 
their next surgery, at Period 
1, Visit 1 for SE1 and 
Period 2, Visit 1 for SE2.   
  Subjects will be issued a 
diary card to capture corticosteroid compliance 
throughout each 21 -day 
period .  Subjects will also  
be instructed to use barrier contraception for a period of 3 months from the time they are treated. For each subject, the interval 
between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to range from week s to 
months.  While this interval will be 
decided on a case- by-case basis, an 
effort will be made to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the immunological and safety profile of 
sequential treatment administration 
and to reflect the anticipated real -
world application of the study drug.  
Thus , approximately 20 subjects 
will be treated with a short - (<6 
month), medium - (6-12 months), or 
long- (>12 month) duration surgery 
window between treatment of the first and second eye.  Because the timing of the second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1)  will vary among 
subjects, the duration of study Period 1 will also be variable.  
The next study visit (i.e., surgery 
and dosing, Period 1, Visit 1) is to 
be scheduled within 10 weeks of the Screening  Period.   
Subjects will be treated with oral corticoster oids (e.g., prednisolone / 
prednisone) during the peri -
operative period for each eye.  They will be instructed to start taking the 
drug 2 days before their surgery at 
Period 1, Visit 1 for SE1.  For SE1, 
the Full Corticosteroid Regimen should be initiated,  as described in 
Section 9.8.   
For SE2 surgeries that occur on Day 
21 or later, the Full Corticosteroid 
Regimen should be initiated as described, beginning 2 days before 
the scheduled surgery.  
If SE2 is to be performed prior to Study Day 21, then the Ful l 
Corticosteroid Regimen should be initiated 2 days prior to the 
scheduled surgery for SE2, and this Updated screening 
visit to include discussion on 
subject duration of 
surgery window, corticosteroid treatment and regimen and baseline 
assessments.

will supercede the steroid taper in 
progress for SE1.  The full 21 days 
of treatment will then be completed for SE2.  
Subjects will be issued a diary card 
to capture corticosteroid compliance .  Subjects will also be 
instructed to use barrier contraception  or abstain from sexual 
intercourse for a period of 3 months 
from the time they are treated. 
All baseline ophthalmic assessments 
must be conducted within 3 months prior to SE2 surgery (Period 2, Visit 1).  If, at that time, BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS letters, surgery may be 
performed when, in the opinion of 
the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor:  
1. the subject is found eligible by all 
other inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and  
2. the subject is considered an 
appropriate candidate who will 
potentially benefit from treatment.

The following baseline assessments 
for Period 2 must be performed 
within 12 weeks prior to surgery for SE2 (Visit 1, Period 2).  If the assessments have not been performed within a regularly 
scheduled visit within this window, 
an additional visit is requir ed.

is a new visit that 
might be necessary 
for subjects whose second eye is treated an extended period of time 
from the firs t eye.

Adverse Event,  
Page 3 5  Worsening of the signs, symptoms 
and visual function related to CHM 
is not to be considered an AE 
unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the changes are not 
consistent with the natural 
progression of the disease.  Text added to 
clarify that 
worsening of CHM 
is not considered an AE  unless the 
PI considers it is inconsistent with the normal course 
of the disease.  
Surgery -related events of 
VA decrease are defined as 
VA decreases occurring in 
close temporal association 
(within <24 hours) with the 
surgical administration of 
the study medication, and 
which are resolving at Day 
7 (Period  1/2, Visit 4) post-
surgery.  These events are 
not to be reported as an AE 
or SAE. However, they 
should be reported as an AE 
if in the investigator's 
opinion, their evolution in 
terms of duration or 
severity cannot be 
explained by the procedure.  
This woul d include, but not 
be limited to instances 
where the abnormal course 
of post -surgery VA 
decrease is associated with 
another complication 
attributable to the surgery 
or the study medication, or 
where the abnormal course 
of post -surgery VA 
decrease can be at tributed 
to another identifiable 
cause.  
• AEs that in the opinion of 
the investigator, actually or 
potentially require any 
surgical or medical 
intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of sight.  Vision Loss to be  Reported as 
Serious Adverse Events  
Vision Loss  not to be Reported as 
an SAE:  
• Surgery- related BCVA decrease of 
≥15 letters on ETDRS chart occurring within 1 day of surgery, but recovering / resolving at post -
operative Days 7 and 14.  
Vision Loss or Vision -Threatening 
Event to be  Reported as an SAE:  
• Surgery- related BCVA decrease of 
≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 day of surgery and 
that has not recovered* by the 1 -
Month Visit.  
• A decrease in BCVA of ≥15 letters 
on ETDRS chart that occurs within 
1 day of surgery, however, in the investigator’s opinion:  
o Has an evolution not consistent with the expected post -operative 
course;  
o May be attributable to a complication that occurred during 
surgery, or another untoward 
event, or the study drug;  
o Actually  or potentially requires 
any surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of vision.  
• Non-surgery- related, sustained 
(>48 hours duration) decrease from baseline in BCVA of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart.  
*Recovery / Resolution of BCVA is defined  as a return to baseline 
BCVA within 5 letters on the 
ETDRS chart.  Clarified vision 
loss procedure for AE/SAE reporting. 
Without changing the meaning of the original language, we have revise d 
this section to 
clarify what does 
and what does not need to be reported as an SAE regarding vision loss.

To evaluate changes in BCVA over 
the study period, BCVA will be 
assessed using the ETDRS VA chart and performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 1.  
The BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, 
and distance refraction should be 
carried out before BCVA is measured.  Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 metres from the chart.  If <20 letters are read at 4 metres, testing at 1 metr e should be 
performed.  BCVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the subject. For BCVA, assessors will be appropriately qualified for 
conducting the assessment.  
BCVA is also used for evaluations 
of efficacy.  
If a subject is not able t o perform an 
assessment due to poor VA, it will be documented accordingly in the 
eCRF and will not be recorded as a 
protocol deviation.  Re-ordered 
assessment to appear first in

Assessment of Efficacy,  
Page 4 3 All efforts should be made 
to conduct the efficacy 
assessments; if a subject is 
not able to perform an 
assessment due to poor 
visual acuity (VA), it will 
be documented accordingly 
in the eCRF and will not be 
recorded as a protocol 
deviation.  
 
To evaluate changes in VA 
over the study period, 
BCVA will be assessed 
using the ETDRS VA chart 
and performed for both eyes 
at the times indicated in 
Table 1.  
The BCVA test should be 
performed prior to pupil 
dilation, and distance 
refraction should be carried  
out before BCVA is 
measured.  Initially, letters 
are read at a distance of 4 
metres from the chart.  If 
<20 letters are read at 4 
metres, testing at 1 metre 
should be performed.  
BCVA is to be reported as 
number of letters read 
correctly by the subject. 
For BCVA, assessors will 
be appropriately qualified The following assessments are 
primary safety assessments that will also be considered secondary 
efficacy endpoints.

b. Baseline assessments must occur before the SE2 is dosed. These can occur at a regularly scheduled visit if that visit is within 12 weeks prior to surgery in SE2. If it has been 
more than 12 weeks since a visit, 
the subject must return for assessments at this Baseline Period 2 visit.  Similarly, for subjects who 
have previously been treated unilaterally with AAV2 -REP1 in an

i- Immunoassays are planned to 
assess cell -based and antibody -
based immune responses against AAV2 -REP1. Enzyme -linked 
immunospot (ELISPOT) assays will 
be used for the assessment of T -
cell-mediated immune responses to 
transgene product (REP1) and the 
capsid.  Antibody responses against 
the capsid and transgene product 
will be measured using a cell -based 
neutralization assay and an enzyme -
linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), respectively. All immunogenicity samples will be sent to a central laboratory for 
analysis.  
j- The ophthalmic examination will 
include IOP, slit lamp examination, 
lens opacity grading, and dilated ophthalmoscopy. The same slit lamp machine and lighting 
conditions should be used across the 
study for each subject.

Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 4Overview of Study Design: This is a phase 1b/2 study of the safety and efficacy of MLN0128 (al so 
known as TAK -228) in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant therapy in women with estrogen 
receptor -positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative (ER+/HER2 ) advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on treatment with eve rolimus in combination with 
exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only). Patients enrolled in this study will be given either 
exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) in combination with MLN0128.
In the phase 1b portion of the study, the saf ety and tolerability of MLN0128 using a capsule 
formulation based on unmilled (Part 1) and milled (Part 2) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in 
combination with either exemestane or fulvestrant will be evaluated. Patients enrolled in Part 1 will 
remai n on MLN0128 capsules based on unmilled API and will continue to take their MLN0128 
doses with a light meal. Patients enrolled into Part 2 will r eceive MLN0128 capsules containing 
milled API and will take each MLN0128 dose on an empty stomach. Patients wil l be enrolled as 
follows:
Part 1 Patients (Capsules Based on Unmilled API):
MLN0128+Exemestane Safety Cohort : Six patients will receive MLN0128 capsule 
formulation based on unmilled API (5mgonce daily [QD]) in combination with exemestane 
(administered pe r prior therapy for the patient) . Steady -state serial PK samples will be 
collected to quantify both MLN0128 and exemestane to characterize the PK of MLN0128 
and exemestane when administered in combination.
MLN0128+Fulvestrant Safety Cohort (US Only) : Six patients will receive MLN0128 
capsule formulation based on unmilled API (5mgQD) in combination with high -dose 
fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly every month).
Part 2 Patients (Capsules Based on Milled API):
MLN0128+Exemestane/Fulvestrant Safety Coho rt 1: Six patients will receive MLN0128 
capsule formulation based on milled API (3 mg QD) in combination with either exemestane 
(any country) or fulvestrant (US only). Serial blood samples will be collected to evaluate the 
PK of MLN0128 when administered i n combination with either exemestane or fulvestrant. 
After the last patient completes Cycle 1, a safety and tolerability assessment will be 
performed. If 2 dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) occur in these 6 patients, the dose of 
MLN0128 will be reduced to 2 mg QD for patients subsequently enrolled in Cohort 2 of 
Part2 of the phase 1b portion of this study. If 1 DLT occurs in Cohort 1, the dose of 
MLN0128 will be escalated to 4 mg QD for patients entering Cohort 2.
MLN0128+Exemestane/Fulvestrant Safety Coho rt 2: Six patients will receive MLN0128 
capsule formulation based on milled API, either 4 or 2 mg QD based on the safety observed 
in Cohort 1, in combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only). 
Serial PK samples will be collected as outlined for Cohort 1. After the last patient completes 
Cycle 1, a safety and tolerability assessment will be performed.
oIf ≥2 DLTs occur in the treatment group receiving 4 mg of MLN0128, the 
subsequent phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated at 3 mg of MLN0128 QD in 
combination with exemestane or fulvestrant.
oIf ≤1 DLT occurs in the treatment group (either at 4 mg or 2 mg QD), the 
subsequent phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated at the same dose (either 
2mg or 4 mg MLN0128 QD) in combi nation with exemestane or fulvestrant.
oIf ≥2 DLTs occur in the treatment group receiving 2 mg of MLN0128 in 
combination with either exemestane and/or fulvestrant, the study will be stopped.

Confidential 5In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will be administered MLN0128 capsule formulation 
based on milled API at 4 mg QD in combination with either exemestane or fulvestrant, based on the 
outcome of the safety and tolerability analysis performed in the phase 1b portion of the study. 
Patients will be enrolled into on e of 2 parallel cohorts, depending on the quality and/or duration of 
their prior response to everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant 
(US only) as follows:
Everolimus -Resistant Cohort: This is a cohort of 56 response -evaluable patients who have 
progr essed on prior treatment with everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any 
country) or fulvestrant (US only) without achieving an objective response (CR or partial 
response) or after achieving SD for 6months as the ir best response. Patients will receive 
MLN0128 in combination with exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only).
Everolimus -Sensitive Cohort : This is a cohort of 48 response -evaluable patients who have 
progr essed on treatment after achieving a CR or partial response of any duration, or SD 
6months with prior everolimus treatment in combination with either exemestane (any 
country) or fulvestrant (US only). Patients will receive MLN0128 in combination with 
exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only).
Sparse PK samples will be collected from all patients enrolled in the study (regardless of whether 
they are administered MLN0128 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant) for plasma PK 
analysis of MLN0128 only. Data generated in this study will be combined with data from other 
studies in which the PK of MLN0128 is characterized for population PK analysis.
Radiological tumor evaluations will be used to evaluate disease response according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1).
Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common T erminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events. Adverse even ts will be assessed and clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and 
electrocardiograms will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 in 
combination with either exemestane or fulvestrant.
Study Population: Female patients must be 18 years of age or older and postmenopausal for at least 
1 year before the Screening visit to be enrolled in the study . Patients must have advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer, and must have histological or cytological confirmation of ER+/HER2 
status. Patients who have a history of treated brain metastasis are eligible for the study provided that 
there is no sign of disease progression or hemorrhage after treatment, they are off -treatment, and 
have no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone or antiepileptic drugs. Patients must have an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate clinical laboratory 
values and left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients must provide paraffin blocks or a minimum of 
10 unstained slides of ava ilable archival tumor tissues (paraffin blocks are preferred) or a tumor 
biopsy before beginning treatment with MLN0128.
To be enrolled in the phase 1b portion of the study , patients may have SD or disease progression 
during their most recent treatment with exemestane (any country) or fulvestrant (US only) . 
Exemestane or fulvestrant in combination with MLN0128 can also be initiated as a new line of 
therapy. To be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study , patients must have measureable disease 
defined as at least 1 extraosseous lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension 
(RECIST, version 1.1) or bone lesions (lytic or mixed [lytic plus sclerotic]) a nd have had disease 
progr ession during treatment with everolimus in combination with eith er exemestane (any country) 
or fulvestrant (US only). Treatment with everolimus in combination with either exemestane (any 
country) or fulvestrant (US only) is not required to be the most recent treatment before enrollment.

Confidential 6Duration of Study: Patients wil l receive MLN0128 in combination with either exemestane (any 
country) or fulvestrant (US only) until they experience disease progression. Patients will discontinue 
treatment if they have an unacceptable drug -related toxicity. The maximum duration of treatm ent 
will be 24 months. If after discussion between the investigator and sponsor it is determined that a 
patient would derive benefit, the patient may continue treatment beyond 24 months.
Patients will attend an End -of-Treatment (EOT)/Early Termination visi t 30 days after receiving their 
last dose of MLN0128, or at the start of subsequent anticancer therapy. After EOT, patients will be 
followed for progression -free survival and overall survival. The study will be terminated 6 months 
after the last patient co mpletes an EOT study visit.

(a) Screening assessments are performed within 28 days before the Cycle 1 Day 1 MLN0128 dose. Screening assessments performed no more than 3 days before Day 1 
will qualify as baseline assessments and need not be repeated, unless otherwise specified.
(b) Patients will attend an EOT/ET visit 30 to 40 days after receiving their last dose of MLN0128 or at the start of subseque nt anticancer therapy, at which time patients 
will enter posttreatment follow -up. If subsequent anticancer therapy is r equired before 30 days after the last dose, the EOT/ET visit should be conducted before the 
initiatio n of subsequent anticancer therapy.
(c) For patients enrolling into phase 2 who have measurable disease and are undergoing CT scans (rather than MRIs) for tumor assessment , the most recent CT scan 
performed before the baseline CT scan for this study will be collected, if available. See Section 7.4.3 .
(d) Vital sign measurements include blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), heart rate, and temperature.
(e) Single , 12-lead ECGs will be collected according to the schedule presented in the Phase 1b Pharmacokinetic and ECG Sample Breakdown and the Phase 2 
Pharmacokinetic and ECG Sample Breakdown table . When the timing of a n ECG coincides with blood samples for PK, the ECG should be completed first.
(f) Contrast -enhanced imaging CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis must be obtained at b aseline within 4 weeks before the first dose of MLN0128. Unless 
contraindicated, such contrast -enhanced imaging CT or MRI scans will be obt ained ever y 2 cycles from Cycle 2 through Cycle 6 (ie, Cycle 2 Day 28, Cy cle4 Day 28, 
and Cycle 6 Day 28) and then every 3 cycles thereafter (ie, Cycle 9 Day 28, Cy cle12 Day 28, Cycle 15 Day 28, etc ). A confirmatory scan should be performed at 
approximately 4 weeks from the previous scan for all patients with a complete or partial response. For those patients who hav e documented radiographic disease 
progression, CT or MRI scans are not required at th e EOT visit. The same imaging modality (CT or MRI) should be used throughout the study. 
(g) After EOT, patients will be follo wed for PFS and OS; see Section 7.10 for more details. For those patients who discontinue MLN0128 for any reason other than 
radiographic disease progression, contrast -enhanced imaging CT or MRI scans should be completed to further assess disease p rogression (per RECIST, version 1.1).
(h) Including serious pretreatment events; see Section 9.1.1 .
(i) Exemestane or fulvestrant should be administered according to the USPI or SmPC and according to the dose administered during previous treatment.

1.1 Scientific Background
1.1.1 Disease Under Treatment
Epidemiology
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer diagnosis in wo men and is the leading cause of 
cancer -related deaths in women in Europe and the second leading cause of cancer -related 
deaths i n wo men in the United States (US). [1,2] The American Cancer Societ y estimates 
that approximat ely 232,340 women will receive a new diagnosis of breast cancer in this 
year. Approximately  39,620 wom en in the US and 88,886 women in Europe are predicted to 
die from their disease in 2013. [1,2]
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease wit h different histologies, prognoses, natural 
history , responses to treatment, and mo lecular characterist ics.[3-5]Breast cancer can be 
classified into 3 m ajor categori es or subt ypes: hormo ne receptor -posit ive tumors that express 
estrogen or progesterone rece ptors (PRs) or both; tumors that over -express the receptor for 
human epidermal growth factor receptor -2 (HER2); and basal epit helial -like or 
“triple-negative tum ors” that do not express hormone receptors or HER2. [3,6] The hormone 
receptor -positive tumors, which represent 66% to 75% of bre ast cancer tum ors, consist of 
2main subt ypes: luminal A and luminal B. [3,5,7-9]
Antiestrogen Treatment
Antiestrogen therapy  remains the first line o f therapy  for estrogen receptor (ER) -positive 
tumors both in the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings. [10] Standard antiestrogen 
therapy  for postm enopausal  wom en wi th hormone receptor -positive metastati c breast cancer 
involves the sequent ial use of select ive ER modulators (eg, tamoxifen), nonsteroidal or 
steroi dal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and select ive ER down regulators (SERDs; eg, 
fulvestrant). [9]In the first -line metastatic disease setting, ant iestrogen therapy  in 
postm enopausal wom en m ay be ei ther m onotherapy  with a thi rd-generat ion, nonsteroidal AI 
(anastrozole or letrozole) or the steroidal AI exemestane or sequent ial therapy  with 
tamoxifen fo llowed by a third -generat ion AI. [11,12]
Resistance to antiestrogen treatment occurs commonly  in pat ients and is an important 
therapeutic limi tation. Approximately  30% of patients wi th metastati c disease have primary  
resistance to init ial endocrine therapy and develop progressive disease wit hin 6 months after 
initiation of ant iestrogen therapy .[9,13] Many other patients may init ially respond to 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 23horm onal therapy  but then devel op secondary  resistance defined as progressive disease 
occurring more than 6 months after init iation of antiestrogen thera py.[9,13] The resistant 
tumors have not com pletely  lost estrogen dependence and may  respond to an addi tional or 
alternat ive antiestrogen therapy, such as the SERD fulvestrant, which binds irreversibly to 
the ER, leading to receptor blockade and d egradation. [14,15] However, the duration of 
response or remissio n after subsequent, alternative therapy  is often shorter than that 
achieved with earlier therapy .[15]This suggests that during estrogen deprivat ion, adaptive 
changes occur in tumor cells that allow them to proliferate and survive in a low -estrogen 
environment.
Estrogen Action and Resistance
Several mechanisms may lead to endocrine resistance, but evidence fro m studi es of estrogen 
action and cell signaling in breast cancer cells indicates that crosstalk between the 
phospho inositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine -specific protein kinase 
(AKT)/m ammalian (or m echanist ic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the ER is an 
important potential mechanism o f resistance to hormo ne therapy  in ER -positive breast 
cancer. In the class ical ligand -dependent geno mic action of the ER, estrogen binding to the 
ERs l eads to receptor dimerization that forms a complex with coactivators or corepressors 
that then binds to estrogen response elements in the promoter region of estrogen responsive 
genes wi th subsequent enhancement or repression of transcript ion.[15,16] However, ERs 
can be act ivated via ligand -independent geno mic mechanisms that can contribute to 
endocrine resistance by inducing estrogen -independent growth. Ligand -independent, 
geno mic act ivation of t he ER is mediated through growth factor receptor signaling, such as 
epidermal  growth factor and insulin -like growth factor 1 receptors (IGF1Rs), and 
subsequent up -regulat ion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Act ivated 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling ult imate ly leads to phosphorylat ion of the ER. The 
phosphorylated ER binds, even in the absence o f its physio logical ligand, to 
estrogen -responsive DNA elements to modulate estrogen -responsive target genes inducing 
proliferat ion and survival of tumor cells indepen dent of estrogen. [15,17] These data suggest 
that activat ion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is critical to induce estrogen -independent 
tumor growth and resistance to antihormonal treatment in breast cancer.
Growth factor and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is often dysregulated in ER+ breast tumors. 
Approximately  28% to 47% of l uminal  tumors harbor activat ing mutati ons of 
phospho inosit ide 3-kinase, catalyt ic alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA), and 41% to 48% have 
activat ion mutations consist ing of the amplificat ion of the IGF1R. [18] Cells in which the 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 24PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway  is activated can proliferate and survive in a 
low-estrogen environment and are likely  to become resi stant to estrogen deprivat ion therapy . 
Thus, se veral lines o f evidence indicate that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling has a central role 
in paths leading to endocrine resistance. This strongly suggests that inhibitors of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway  woul d have the potential to restore endocrine sensit ivity in 
ER/P Rbreast cancers.
1.1.2 Study Drug
1.1.2.1 MLN0128
mTOR Inhibitors
The m TOR serine/threonine kinase has a central role in regulat ing cellular growth and 
metabo lism in response to external environmental factors. [19,20] The m TOR kinase binds 
with other proteins to form 2 dist inct mult iprotein complexes, mTOR complex 1 (TORC1) 
and mTOR complex 2 (TORC2). The TORC1 complex is st imulated by growth factors and 
amino acids and regulates cell growth by  controlling the activit y of the ribosom al protein S6 
kinase (S6K) and eukary otic ini tiation factor 4 -binding protein (4E -BP1). [21] The TORC2 
complex is act ivated by growth factors and promotes cell survival, proliferat ion, and act in 
cytoskel eton organi zation by phosphorylat ing and activat ing kinases, such as AKT kinase 
(also known as protein kinase B), which is a regulator of apoptosis. [22,23]
Two m ajor classes of m TOR inhibi tors are under development: allosteric inhibitors and 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitors. The first -generation, or allosteric, 
inhibitors include rapamycin and the related analogs or rapalogs temsiro limus, evero limus, 
and ri daforolimus. The rapalogs effect ively inhibit phosphorylat ion of S6K but only 
partially inhibi t the phosphoryl ation of 4E -BP1, which regulates cap -dependent translation 
of transcri pts for cell survival, proliferat ion, and angiogenesis. [20] Thus, rapamycin and the 
rapal ogs are only partial inhibitors of TORC1. [20]
The ATP -competitive inhibitors (also known as mTOR kinase inhibitors or TORKinibs), 
such as MLN0128 (also known as TAK- 228), bind to the cataly tic dom ain of m TOR and 
thus inhibit both TORC1 and TORC2 complexes, including the rapamycin -insensit ive or 
resistant acti ons of  TORC1, such as phosphorylat ion of 4E -BP1. [24-26]
The rapalogs temsiro limus and everolimus have been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on as m onotherapy  for patients wi th advanced renal cell carcino ma 
(temsirolimus and evero limus), advanced pancreat ic neuroendocrine tumors (everolimus),

Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 25and sub ependymal giant cell astrocy toma associ ated wi th tuberous scl erosis (everolimus). 
However, resistance to single -agent rapal og therapy  occurs and m ay be rel ated to ei ther 
incomplete inhibit ion of the targeted pathway  (such as phosphorylat ion of 4E -BP1 as 
discussed above) or l oss of S6K -mediated feedback inhibit ion of growth factor receptor 
signaling leading to paradoxic hyperactive signaling. The normal feedback loop invo lves 
activated S6K, which phosphorylates and inactivates insulin receptor substrate -1 and inhibit s 
signaling through the PI3K pathway .[23,27] In the presence of rapalogs, the feedback loop 
is abrogated, leading to continued PI3K signaling, TORC2 activat ion, and subsequent 
phosphorylat ion of AK T at Threonine 308 and Serine 473 (S473), which markedly  enhances 
the activit y of AKT. [20,23,27]
The l oss of feedback inhibit ion by rapalogs has been demo nstrated in clinical trials. In an 
analysis of eit her paired fresh tumor samples or skin b iopsies obtained from  55 pati ents who 
received different doses of evero limus eit her daily or weekly in a phase 1 trial, everolimus 
inhibited TORC1 in a dose -and schedule -dependent m anner wi th near com plete inhibit ion 
of S6K. [28]Half the paired tumor samples had a posttreatment increase in the 
phosphorylat ion of AKT at S473. [28] These results provide direct evidence that loss of S6K 
feedback and subsequent PI3K/TORC2- induced activat ion of AKT occurs commo nly in 
patients wi th solid tum ors receiving single -agent everolimus.
Clinical Evidence Supporting the Use of mTOR Inhibitors in Breast Cancer
The utilit y of targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway  to overcom e or am eliorate 
endocrine therapy  resistance has been evaluated in 2 randomized clinical trials in 
postm enopausal wom en wi th metastatic breast cancer. In the phase 3 study  Breast Cancer 
Trials o f Oral Everolimus -2 (BOLERO -2), 724 postm enopausal wom en wi th hormone 
receptor -positive, HER2- negative, metastatic breast cancer who developed progressive 
disease while on nonsteroidal AI the rapy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the 
steroi dal AI exemestane in co mbinat ion with everolimus or exem estane pl us pl acebo. [29] At 
the interim analysis , the m edian progressi on-free survival (PFS) was longer in patients who 
received the combinat ion of exemestane and everolimus co mpared with those who received 
exemestane and placebo, according to both local assessments by the investigators (6.9 
versus 2.8 months) and a central assessment (10.6 versus 4.1 months). [29] In a smaller, 
open -label, phase 2 study  (TAMRAD study ), postmenopausal wo men with horm one 
receptor -positive, HER2- negative, and AI -resistant metastatic breast cancer were stratified 
according to primary  or secondary  horm one resistance and rando mized to receive either 
tamoxifen and everolimus (n=54) or tamoxifen alone (n=57). [30] The 6 -month clinical 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 26benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of patients who achieved co mplete response 
(CR) or partial response or stable disease (SD) at 6 months, was higher for patients who 
received the combinat ion of tam oxifen and everolimus compared with those who received 
tamoxifen alo ne (61% [95% CI of 47 to 74] versus 42% [95% CI of 29 to 56]). [30] Both of 
these studies demo nstrated that targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway wit h 
evero limus can overcome acquired resistance to antiestrogen agents in postmenopausal 
wom en wi th horm one receptor -posit ive, AI -resistant breast cancer.
The results of the clinical trials o f everolimus in postmenopausal wo men with hormone 
receptor -positive, AI -resistant breast cancer demonstrate the clinical ut ility of targeting the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway  with a rapalog to overcome resista nce to antiestrogen 
therapy  in this population. However, it is likely  that patients receiving everolimus may  
develop resistance to everolimus due to the loss of feedback inhibit ion and subsequent 
TORC2 -induced act ivation of AKT, which is suggested by  the p harmacodynamic result s 
from a phase 1 study  with everolimus. [28] The goal o f this study  (C310 01) is to test the 
hypothesis that acquired resistance to combinat ion antihormonal treatment with evero limus 
in patients with hormone receptor -positive breast cancer is due to feedback reactivation o f 
PI3K/AKT signaling and that antihormonal sensit ivity can be restored by  targeting thi s 
pathway  with the dual  TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128.
1.2 Nonclinical Experience
MLN0128, also known as INK -0128, is an orally available, potent, and highly  select ive ATP 
competitive inhibitor of mTOR kinase that exhibit s dual  speci ficity against both the TORC1 
and TORC2 co mplexes. MLN0128 is a second- generat ion mTOR inhibitor that targets the 
kinase domain of the mTOR enzyme to suppress TORC1 and TORC2 functions, a feature 
believed to increase the ant itumor effect rel ative to curren tly available m TOR inhibitors, 
which as a class, are derivat ives of rapamycin and referred to as rapalogs. These agents are 
TORC1 -only inhibi tors and operate through a dist inct mechanism to MLN0128.
In vitro studies have demonstrated that MLN0128 select ively and potently  inhibi ts the 
mTOR kinases (1 nM), but relative to mTOR inhibit ion, MLN0128 has >100- fold less

displays potent cellular inhibition of both the TORC1 and TORC2 pathway with cellular 
pharmacodynamic concentration producing 50% inhibition values of less than 10 nM.
MLN0128, administered orally in multiple human tumor xenograft mouse models, can 
inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth by inhibiting mTOR signaling at plasma concentrations associated with in vitro inhibition of mTOR in a dose- and time-dependent 
manner. These effects display a clear pharmacokinetic (PK)-to-pharmacodynamic 
relationship. [31] MLN0128 inhibits both the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1, the 
downstream substrates of TORC1, and selectively inhibits AKT phosphorylation at S473, as evidenced by decreased pAKT, the downstream substrate of TORC2. [31-33] Dual TORC1/2 
inhibition mitigates the feedback activation of AKT, which is known to cause resistance to 
TORC1-only inhibitors such as rapamycin.[ 34]MLN0128 inhibits mTOR signaling and has 
demonstrated anticancer activity against a number of human solid tumor cell-line xenograft mouse models, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutant endometrial, 
breast, and renal cell carcinomas.

1.3 Clinical Experience
1.3.1 Clinical Experien ce With MLN0128
Single-agent MLN0128 is in clinical development with 2 phase 1 studies in patients with 
advanced solid malignancies (INK128-001) and in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma or Waldenström macroglobulin emia (INK128-002). A third phase 1 study 
of MLN0128 is in combination with paclitaxel wi th or without trastuzumab in patients with 
advanced solid tumors (INK128-003). These studies have been designed to investigate the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of MLN0128 for the treatment of CCI

combinat ion with chem otherapy  and/or HER2 -targeting agents. Addit ionally , the 
combinat ion of MLN0128 with MLN1117 (an oral PI3Kα inhibitor) is being evaluated in a 
phase 1b study  in adult patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies (Study  
C32001).
Refer to the current edition o f the IB for updated summaries of the clinical experience wit h 
MLN0128.
1.3.1.1 Clinical PK of MLN0128
The PK parameters measured for MLN012 8 in the phase 1 clinical studies have been 
generally consistent across a range of doses and mult iple schedules. MLN0128 has shown 
linear PK and fast oral absorption wit h single -dose first time o f occurrence of maximum 
(peak) concentration (T max) occurring between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. The mean 
terminal disposit ion half -life (t 1/2) of MLN0128 is approximately 8 hours, and no 
accumulat ion has been observed in plasma after repeat daily dosing.
The PK properties of MLN0128 are detailed in the IB.
1.4 Study Rationale
The primary  object ive of this phase 1b/2 study  is to evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of 
MLN0128, in co mbination wit h either exemestane or fulvestrant, in postmenopausal wo men 
with estrogen receptor -posit ive/human epidermal growth factor receptor -2-negative 
(ER+/HER2 ) advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression after previous 
treatm ent wi th everolimus (in combinat ion with either exemestane (any  country ) or 
fulvestrant [ US only]) .
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is often act ivated in E R/PR+ breast cancer with 
approximately  20% to 25% of tum ors harboring activat ing PIK3CA mutations and 15% to 
35% having loss o f the PTEN tumor suppressor protein. [7,35,36] Beyond thi s, several lines 
of evidence suggest that reactivat ion of the pathway  is a cellular response to long -term 
estrogen deprivat ion and plays a key ro le in acquired ant iestrogen resistance. [18,37,38]
Combined targeting o f both ER and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway s, as dem onstrated by  the 
BOLERO -2[29]and TAMRAD [30] studi es, is a promising and proven therapeutic approach 
for ER/PR+ breast cancer.
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 29MLN0128 is a potent, highly select ive, ATP -competitive inhibitor of mTOR. MLN0128 is 
mechanist ically dist inct from the allo steric inhibitors of  mTOR (rapamycin and its 
derivat ives, referred to as rapalogs). The rapalogs only partially inhibit TORC1, whereas 
MLN0128 inhibit s both TORC1 (more completely S6K and 4E -BP1) and TORC2. Dual 
TORC1/2 inhibit ion mitigates feedback activation of P I3K and AKT, known to cause 
resistance to TORC1 -only inhibi tors, such as everolimus. [34]
MLN0128 administered in co mbinat ion with antihorm onal therapy  may restore sensi tivity to 
antihormonal treatments in pat ients who have progressed on such therapies in combinat ion 
with everolim us.
Rationale for Starting Dose of MLN0128
The starting doses of 5 mg MLN0128 and 4 mg MLN0128, in combinat ion with exemestane 
or fulvestrant, are both predicted to provide an area under the plasma concentration versus 
time curve (AUC) that wi ll be above those considered bioactive in nonclinical 
pharmaco logy studi es conducted in tumor xenograft models and associated with stasis. The 
4 mg once daily  (QD) dose of MLN0128 already provides daily  plasma exposures that are 
comparable to those observe d with a 10 m g QD dose of the TORC1 inhibitor everolimus, 
after accounti ng for differences in plasma protein binding and in -vitro cell  proliferat ion 
assay inhibitory  potency  for each agent.
The single -agent maximum  tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN0128 for conti nuous QD dosing 
established in the escalation phase of Study  INK128 -001 i s 6 m g QD; however, a substant ial 
number of patients required dose modificat ion after prolonged exposure at this dose. The 
expansio n phase of Study  INK0128 -001 has established that 5 mg QD is the recommended 
phase 2 dose of MLN0128. Because no PK -based drug -drug interactions (DDIs) between 
MLN0128 and either exemestane or fulvestrant are expected, it is projected that the plasma 
exposures of MLN0128 in co mbination wit h either exemestan e or fulvestrant will be less 
than those at the respective single -agent exposures at the MLN0128 MTD of 6 mg QD.
Part 1 of the phase 1 portion of the study  will ini tiate wi th enro llment of 6 patients at the 
starting dose of 5 mg QD of MLN0128 capsules based on unmilled active pharmaceut ical 
ingredient (API) in co mbinat ion with either exemestane (a t the established dose) or 
high-dose fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular [IM] once a month). After complet ing 2 cycles 
of treatm ent wi th MLN0128 (Cycle 2 Day  28) in combinat ion with either exemestane or 
fulvestrant, a safet y and tol erabilit y assessment will be performed.
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 30Part 2 of the phase 1 portion of the study  will ini tiate wi th enro llment of 6 patients at a 
starting dose of 3 mg QD of MLN0128 capsules based on milled API. The starting dose of 
3mg was chosen to account for the possibilit y of increased absorption with MLN0128 
capsules based on milled API and on emerging safety  data from  Part 1 of the phase 1b 
porti on of  this study  with MLN0128 dosing at 5 mg QD i n combinat ion with either 
exemestane (any country ) or fulvestrant (US only). During Part 2 of the phase 1 portion of 
this study :
If ≥2 dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) occur in the treatment group receiving 4 mg o f 
MLN0128, the subsequent phase 2 portion of the study  will be init iated at 3 m g of 
MLN0128 QD in co mbinat ion with exemestane or fulvestrant.
If ≤1 DLT occurs in the treatment group (either at 4 mg or 2 mg QD), the subsequent 
phase 2 portion of the study  will be init iated at the same dose (either 2 mg or 4 mg of 
MLN0128 QD) in combinat ion with exemestane or fulvestrant.
If ≥2 DLTs occur in the treatment group receiving 2 mg o f MLN0128 in 
combinat ion with either exemestane and/or fulvestrant, the study  will be stopped.
Based on the outcome of a safet yand tol erabilit y analysis performed in the phase 1b portion 
of the study , MLN0128 4 mg QD in co mbination with either exemestane or fulvestrant was 
determined as the Phase 2 starting dose. Another safet y and tol erabili ty assessment will be 
perform ed during the phase 2 porti on of  the study  where the fi rst 6 pati ents treated with 
MLN0128 (4 mg QD) in co mbinat ion with exemestane (any  country ) or fulvestrant (US 
only) who have co mpleted 2 cy cles of treatm ent wi th MLN0128 will be evaluated for 
treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Enrollment of patients into the study  will 
continue during this safet y and tol erabilit y assessment.
In addit ion, during the phase 2 portion of the study, both tolerabilit y and need for dose 
reducti ons and/or m odificati ons will cont inue to be monitored for all pat ients in all cycles. 
If, based on this assessment, the 4 mg QD starting dose ident ified in Part 2 of the phase 1 
porti on is deemed unfavorable, in conjunct ion with agreem ent of the study  invest igators and 
the medical mo nitor, the starting dose may be adjusted to 2 or 3 mg QD, respectively, for all 
newly enrolled pat ients to improve long- term tolerabili ty. Pati ents who were enrolled at 3 or 
4 mg QD in Part 2 of the phase 1 portion and the phase 2 portion will be maintained at this 
dose unl ess dose m odificat ions are required due to individual tolerabilit y. A starting dose

1.4.1 Mutual DDI Assessment
Mutual DDI Assessment Between MLN0128 and Exemestane
Recent ly co mpleted in vitro metabo lism experiments in human hepatocytes using 
14C-labeled MLN0128 suggest that MLN0128 is metabolized primarily  via cytochrom e 
P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 (approximately 31% -40%), with a minor contribut ion from CYP3A4 
(approx imately 11% -22%). These data suggest that MLN0128 is also metabo lized by direct 
glucuronidat ion (approximately 22%) and an unident ified non–uridine di phosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase pathway  (approximately 18%). The new data differ from the 
previous in vi tro CYP phenoty ping data obtained using recombinant CYP enzymes, which 
suggested the invo lvement of CYP2C9 (approximately 35%), CYP2C19 (approximately 
28%), and CYP3A4 (approximately 28%) in MLN0128 metabo lism.
MLN0128 neit her inhibited nor induced any of the maj or CYP enzymes. MLN0128 did not 
inhibit P -glycoprotein but did inhibit breast cancer resistance protein at a relat ively high 
concentration not expected at the dose of 5 mg QD proposed for administration to patients in 
this study . In addi tion, physio logically based PK modeling and simulat ion using the new 
metabo lism data for MLN0128 suggest that the risk for a metabo lism-based drug- drug 
interact ion with MLN0128 appears to be low. Therefore, strong CYP1A2 inhibitor s and 
CYP inducers (see Sect ion14.4) should be administered only with caut ion and at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator during the study.
Exemestane is metabo lized by various CYP enzyme s, including CYP3A4, CYP1A1>2A6, 
and 4A11. Exemestane did not inhibit any o f the maj or CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 
2E1, or 3A4). Exemestane did not affect the PK of tamoxifen, a CYP3A4 substrate, in 
clinical DDI studies, suggest ing a low risk for DDI wi th other CYP3A4 substrates. 
Ketoconazo le, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not significant ly affect the PK of exemestane, 
but rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exemestane exposure by approximately 
41%. [39] Inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampin, phenyto in, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 
and St. John’s wort) should be avo ided during this study (refer to Section 6.4).
It is not known if exemestane is a substrate for any of the major drug transporters. Based on 
the available informat ion for both of these agents, the risk of a clinically meaningful DDI 
between MLN0128 and exemestane can be considered low.
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 32To assess this risk, steady-state, serial PK samples will be collected to quantify both 
MLN0128 and exemestane. The PK data collected for this assessment will be compared 
against historic PK data for the respective agents to evaluate the risk for mutual DDI 
between these agents.
Mutual DDI Assessment Between MLN0128 and Fulvestrant
A mutual DDI assessment between MLN0128 and fulvestrant is not planned in this study. 
Fulvestrant is metabolized by numerous biotransformation pathways (including oxidation by CYP3A4) and is not known to inhibit any of the major CYP enzymes. No meaningful change in fulvestrant PK was observed when co-administered with ketoconazole (a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor), rifampin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer), or midazolam (a CYP3A4 
substrate). [40] Collectivel y, this information suggests a low risk for DDI between MLN0128 
and fulvestrant.
In addition, fulvestrant is administered IM, and its peak plasma concentrations, when 
administered by this route, are observed approximately 168 hours (or 7 days) after dosing. 
Fulvestrant also has a plasma half-life of approximately 40 days, making it difficult to fully characterize the PK of fulvestrant. [40] Based on this information, and given the relatively 
low risk for DDI between MLN0128 and fulvestrant, no serial PK samples will be collected 
for mutual DDI assessment between these agents; however, sparse PK samples will be 
collected to characterize the PK of MLN0128 (as a population PK assessment). Population PK analysis can then be used to assess clinically meaningful changes in the PK of MLN0128, when co-administered with fulvestrant.

Confidential 331.5 Potential Risks and Benefits
The most common TEAEs observed with MLN0128 are consistent with the 
pharmacodynamic mechanism of mTOR inhibition that is also seen with rapalogs (TORC1 
inhibition) or other dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors. The TEAEs observed across the MLN0128 
single-agent studies include diarrhea, fa tigue, vomiting, rash, mucosal inflammation, 
asthenia, dysgeusia, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, and blood creatinine increased.
During the phase 1 portion of the study, risk  mitigation strategies for potential adverse 
events (AEs) include criteria for determining DLTs. Additionally, in both the phase 1 and 
phase 2 portions of the study, risk mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to, strict application of the study inclusion and exclusi on criteria, frequent monitoring of clinical and 
laboratory results, guidelines for managemen t and prophylaxis of potential toxicities, criteria 
for dose modification, and regular monitoring of AE s and serious adverse events (SAEs) by 
the sponsor.
The potential benefits of MLN0128 are discussed in Section  1.1.2.1.
Further details are presented in the IB.

Confidential 47For patients receiving MLN0128 capsules with milled API : MLN0128 will be 
administered on an empt y stom ach. The patients should be instructed to refrain fro m 
eating and drinking (except for water and prescribed medicat ions) for 2 hours before 
and 1 hour after each dose.
If severe emesis or mucosit is prevents the patient from taking an MLN0128 dose, that dose 
will be skipped. If emesis occurs after study  medicati on ingest ion and who le capsule(s) are 
visible in the vo mitus, repl acement capsule(s) should be taken; otherwise the dose will not 
be readministered, and patients should simply adhere to the dosing schedule and resume 
dosing at the next scheduled time with the prescribed dosage. Patients should record the time 
of the em esis in their dosing diary  (see the Study  Manua l). Under no ci rcumstance shoul d a 
patient repeat a dose or double- up doses.
Exemestane and fulvestrant will be administered per their current USPIs or SmPCs, and 
according to the dose regimen administered before study  entry .
For patients assigned to recei ve MLN0128 in combination with exemestane:
MLN0128 should be administered first on an empty stomach (ie, nothing to eat or 
drink for 2 hours before and 1 hour after MLN0128 dosing).
Patients shoul d have a m eal before taking their exemestane dose, which may be 
taken between 1 and 6 hours after MLN0128 dosing.
6.2 Definitions of DLT for the Phase 1b Portion of the Study
DLTs are defined according to the AE profile observed during the first 28 days of study  
drug administration in phase 1b of the study  and as desc ribed below. All AEs should be 
considered possibly  related to the study  drug unless such relat ionship can be definit ively  
excluded. In Part 2 of the phase 1b portion of the study :
If ≥2 DLTs occur in the treatment group receiving 4 mg o f MLN0128, the 
subsequent phase 2 portion of the study  will be initiated at 3 m g of MLN0128 QD in 
combinat ion with exemestane or fulvestrant.
If ≤1 DLT occurs in the treatment group (either at 4 mg or 2 mg QD), the subsequent 
phase 2 portion of the study  will be init iated at the same dose (either 2 mg or 4 mg of 
MLN0128 QD) in combinat ion with exemestane or fulvestrant.

Toxicit ywill be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, versio n4.03, effective 14 June 
2010 .[43]These criteria are prov ided in the Study  Manual. A DLT will be defined as any  of 
the following events that are considered by  the investi gator to be at l east possibly related to 
treatm ent wi th MLN0128 in combinat ion with either exemestane or fulvestrant:
Grade 3 or higher nonhema tologic toxi city, despi te adequate treatment, except for 
the following:
oGrade 3 hy perglycemia last ing ≤14 days (all pat ients should receive optimal 
antiglycemic treatment, including insulin).
oGrade 3 rash last ing ≤3 days (all pat ients should receive topica l steroi d treatm ent, 
oral antihistamines, and oral steroids, if necessary).
Grade 4 neutropenia last ing >7 days in the absence of growth factor support.
Grade 4 neutropenia of any durat ion acco mpanied by fever ≥38.5°C and/or systemic 
infect ion.
Any other ≥Grade 4 hematol ogic toxi city.
Inabilit y to administer at least 75% of planned doses of MLN0128 wit hin Cyc le 1 
due to study  drug -related toxici ty.
Any clinically  significant occurrence that the investigator and sponsor agree would 
place pat ients at an undue safet y risk.
Patients who experience an AE that meets the definit ion of a DLT during or after complet ing 
Cycle 1 should have their study  drug treatm ent interrupted. If the event resolves to Grade 1 
or baseline values wit hin 2 weeks of interrupting planned therapy , and in the opinio n of the 
investigator and the sponsor’s project clinician the benefits of cont inuing treatment outweigh 
the risks posed by  the toxici ty, patients may  cont inue study  treatm ent wi th MLN0128 at a 
25% to 50% dose reduction (ie, dose reduced from 4 mg to 3 mg [25%]; from 3 mg to 2 mg 
[33%]; or fro m 2 mg to 1 m g [50%] QD) wi th approval  of the sponsor’s proj ect clinician. 
Alternat ively, if dose modification is required for patients receiving 2 mg QD, then the 
dosing frequency  may also be decreased to 5 days per week (28% reduction) instead of 
MLN0128

14consecutive days for MLN0128 -related toxi city, despi te supportive treatment per 
standard clinical pract ice, or more than 2 dose reductions o f MLN0128 are required, the 
patient will be discont inued fro m the study .
6.3 Dose- Modification Guidelines for the Phase 2 Portion of the Study
6.3.1 Dose Modification or Treatment Delay for MLN0128 -Related Toxicity
Based on the outcom e of a safet y and tol erabilit y analysis performed in the phase 1b portion 
of the study , MLN0128 4 m g QD in combination with either exemestane or fulvestrant was 
determined as the phase 2 starting dose. Another safet y and tol erabili ty assessment will be 
performed during the phase 2 portion of the study  where the fi rst 6 pati ents treated with 
MLN0128 4 mg QD in co mbination wit h exemestane or fulvestrant who have co mpleted 
2cycles o f treatm ent wi th MLN0128 will be evaluated for TEAEs. Enrollment of patients 
into the study  will cont inue during this safet y and tol erabili ty assessment.
In addit ion, during the phase 2 portion of the study, both tolerabilit y and need for dose 
reducti ons and/or m odificati ons will cont inue to be monitored for all pat ients in all cycl es. 
If, based on this assessment, the 4 mg QD starting dose ident ified in Part 2 of the phase 1 
porti on is deemed unfavorable, in conjunct ion with agreem ent of the study  invest igators and 
the medical mo nitor, the starting dose may  be adj usted to 2 or 3 m g QD for all newly 
enrolled patients to improve lo ng-term tolerabili ty. Pati ents who were enrolled at 3 or 4 mg 
QD in Part 2 of the phase 1 portion and the phase 2 portion will be maintained at this dose 
unless dose modificat ions are required due to individu al tolerabili ty. A starting dose 
reducti on, if required, will be documented to all study  sites by  formal written 
communicat ion.
MLN0128 administration should be withheld for MLN0128 -related toxi cities that are 
≥Grade 3 despite supportive treatment per stan dard clinical pract ice. If the event resolves to 
Grade 1 or baseline values wit hin 2 weeks o f interrupting treatment, the patient may resume 
study  treatm ent at a 25% to 50% dose reduction (ie, 2 mg QD). Alternatively, if dose 
modificati on is requi red for patients receiving 2 mg QD, then the dosing frequency should 
be decreased to 5 days per week instead of decreasing the daily dose administered. If 
MLN0128 dosing is delayed for more than 14 consecutive days for MLN0128 -related 
toxicity despi te supportive tr eatm ent per standard clinical practice, or more than 2 dose 
reducti ons of MLN0128 are required in a patient, stop MLN0128 therapy , discont inue the 
patient from the study , and com plete the EOT vi sit within 30 to 40 days after the last dose of

Systemic corticosteroi ds (ei ther IV or oral  steroi ds, excluding inhalers), unless 
necessary  for treatm ent of  an MLN0128- related AE (eg, rash).
Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP inducers should be administered with caution 
and at the discret ion of the investigator ( see Section14.4 for a list of these agents ).
Antiepileptic drugs for patients with a history of treated brain metastasis.
Concomitant administration of any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not permitted 
during the study . Pati ents receiving PPI therapy  before enrollment m ust stop using 
the PPI for 7 day s before thei r first dose of study  drugs. Exam ples of PPIs include 
omeprazo le, eso meprazo le, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazo le.
Histamine H2 receptor an tagoni sts m ay be allo wed, if needed provided that the 
histamine H2 receptor antagonist is not taken with in 12 hours before and within 
6 hours after study drug administration. Patients receiving histamine H2 receptor 
antagonists before enrollment must stop using these medicat ions for at least 24 hours 
before their first dose of study  drug. Exam ples of histamine H2 receptor antagonists 
include ranit idine, famot idine, and nizatidine. Cimetidine, a moderate CYP1A2 
inhibitor, is not recommended as a first choice H2 receptor antagonist (see

preparati ons may  also have antaci d properti es, and shoul d also not be permitted from 
4 hours before until 2 hours after study  drug administration.
6.5 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Prophylactic use of antiemetic (including ondansetron and granisetron), antinausea, and 
antidiarrheal medicat ions is encouraged, and these may be administered before the first dose 
of MLN0128, as needed throughout the study  before each dosing, and as clini cally  indicated 
per standard practice.
Concomitant treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted for treatment of osteoporosis or 
management of exist ing bone metastases if init iated at least 4 weeks before administration of 
the first dose of MLN0128. Bisphos phonates should be given after Cy cle 1 to minimize 
confounding factors that may contribute to potential drug -related toxi cities.
Other medications considered necessary  for the safety  and wellbeing of the patient may be 
administered at the discret ion of the invest igator. Any conco mitant m edicati ons added or 
discontinued during the study  shoul d be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
6.6 Precautions and Restrictions
No di etary  restri ctions will be imposed on study  patients other than daily  fasting for glucose 
monitoring (refer to Section 7.4.16 ).

Prevention/Prophylaxis
Follow fasting serum glucose levels during clinic visits.
Monitor home glucometer test results.
Check HbA1c levels ever y 3 mo nths during therapy.
Recommend lifestyle modifications, as appropriate (balanced diet, limited alcohol consumption, 
increased physical activity).
Most episodes of Grade 1 and 2 hyperglycemia respond qui ckly to oral metformin. Early initiation of 
therapy  is recommended to prevent higher -grade hyperglycemia.
FBG levels ≥150 mg/dL by glucometer should be followed by closer monitoring of serum glucose and 
possible intervention.
QD 5D=once daily for 5 days each week.
(a) Phase 1b Part 1 cohorts: for patients receiving a starting dose of 5 mg, reduce by 20% (to 4 mg). If dose 
modification is required for patients receiving 4 mg QD, then the frequency of dosing should be 
decreased to QD 5D, rather than decrea sing the daily dose administered. For all other patients: the initial 
dose reduction should be from 4 mg to 3 mg, with further reduction to 2 mg if necessary.
If any fast ing serum glucose reading performed at the site indicates hyperglycemia (>ULN 
or ≥110mg/dL), the study  staff shoul d first confirm that the patient was fast ing at the time

Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 53of the bl ood draw (i e, nothing by mouth for at least 8 hours before). To aggressively  manage 
the hyperglycemia per standard clinical pract ice, the fo llowing gui delines are provi ded to ai d 
the invest igator in init iating antiglycemic therapies.
Based on the clinical experience in MLN0128 trials, most episodes of hyperglycemia 
observed have been Grade 1 or Grade 2 and have responded quickly to oral met formin. 
Hyperglycemia has not been dose -limit ing since instituting a standard regimen for early 
treatm ent of hyperglycemia. All pat ients developing hy perglycemia on the study  shoul d 
have their glucose closely  monitored by  study  staff. The invest igator may choose either to 
conti nue close mo nitoring of pat ients who develop Grade 1 hy perglycemia (fast ing serum 
glucose>ULN ≤160 m g/dL) or consider init iating treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent, 
such as met formin. All pat ients with ≥Grade 2 hyperglycemia (fast ing serum glucose 
>160mg/dL) must be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as 
clinically indicated while cont inuing on MLN0128 treatment. The invest igator should 
consult an endocrino logist if needed to aid in optimizing the hyperglycemia treatment plan 
of the pati ent.
It is recommended that patients be treated init ially with a fast-acting insulin sensit izer, such 
as metformin at 500 mg orally QD, and titrate up to a maximum o f 1000 m g orally twice 
daily  as needed. Concurrent addi tion to m etformin o f dipeptidyl peptidase -4 inhibitors 
(eg,sitaglipt in or vildaglipt in) and/or insulin should also be considered. Oral sulfo nylureas 
(eg, glipizide or glyburide) should be used wit h cauti on due to the higher risk of inducing 
hypoglycemia in pat ients. The dos e of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in 
patients wi th renal insufficiency .

modalities and methods should be used f or pati ents throughout the study . CT scans of the 
chest, in addit ion to CTs or MRIs of the abdo men and pelvis, will be obtained at Screening 
and all subsequent time points. Supplemental x-ray and/or bone scanning may  be perform ed, 
but these methods are not suitable for lesio nmeasurement. Object ive assessments will be 
perform ed at each time point specified in the Schedul e of Events . When possible, the same
qualified physician will interpret results to reduce variabilit y.

The appearance of 1 or more new lyt ic lesio ns in bone.
The appearance any  extraosseous l esions.
Unequivocal progression of exist ing bone lesio ns.
Radiographic images will be maintained at the site, and test results and physicians’ findings 
will be filed in patient source documents. The sponsor may requ est el ectroni c images for 
those patients who demonstrate a response. Digital Imaging and Co mmu nicati ons in

8.1.1 Determination of Sample Size
Phase 1b
The safet y and tol erabilit y of MLN0128 in co mbination with eit her exemestane or 
fulvestrant will be evaluated. Patients will be enrolled as fo llows:
In Part 1 of the phase 1b portion of the study , up to 6 pati ents will  be enrolled into the 
MLN0128+Exemestane Safet y Cohort and up to 6 patients will  be enrolled into the 
MLN0128+Fulvestrant Safety  Cohort. The number of patients is based on clinical 
considerations.
In Part 2 of the phase 1b porti on of  the study , 6 patients will be enrolled into 
MLN0128+Exemestane/Fulvestrant Safet y Cohort 1, and 6 patients will be enrolled 
into MLN0128+Exemestane/Fulvestrant Safet y Cohort 2. The number of pat ients is 
based on clinical considerat ions.
Phase 2
The s ample size for each cohort in the phase 2 portio n of the study  is based on a standard 
Simon two -stage design. A Bayesian predictive probabilit y design was used to allow 
multiple interim analyses to stop early for fut ility.[45] See Section 8.1.9 for sample size

9.ADVERSE EVENTS
9.1 Definitions
9.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 76medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study 
participat ion.
9.1.2 AE Definition
AE m eans any  untoward m edical  occurrence in a pati ent or subj ect administered a 
pharmaceut ical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefor e be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (incl uding an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal product. This includes any ne wly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has 
increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of MLN0128.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is 
considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from Baseline.
9.1.3 SAE Definition
Serious AE means any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitaliz ation
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropri ate medical  judgment, m ay jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, 
or invo lves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 77Examples of such medical eve nts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or i nfect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010. [43] Clarificat ion should be 
made between a serious AE and a n AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), 
because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often 
used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be 
of relatively minor m edical  significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the 
same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or ac tion cri teria described above, 
and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000 /mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
9.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  observati on, physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 9.3for the 
period of  observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptom s indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 9.1) 
must be reported (see Section
 9.3for the period of observat ion) by the invest igator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact informat ion provi ded 
below). This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after beco ming aware 
of the event. The SAE Form, created specifically  by Millennium , will be provi ded to each 
clinical study  site. A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study  Manual. 
Follow-up inform ation on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested by 
Millennium. SAE report informat ion must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF.

Confidential 78SAE Reporting Contact Information
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before MLN0128 was given are not to be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated 
in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery was performed earlier or later than 
planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For pretreatment 
events, the investigator must determine both the in tensity of the event and the relationship of 
the event to study procedures.
Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 .[43] The criteria are provided in the 
Study Manual.
Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by the investigator responding 
yes or no to this question: Is there a reasonab le possibility that the AE is associated with the 
study drug?
9.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be monitored throughout the study as follows:

within 7 calendar days for fatal and life -threatening events and 15 calendar day s for other 
serious events, unless otherwise required by nat ional regul ations. The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where these might materially  alter the 
current benefit -risk assessment of an invest igational medicinal product or that would be 
sufficient to consider changes in the investigat ional medicinal product’s administration or in

Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 9314.5 Amendment 1 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 1The primary purpose of this amendment is to expand the number of investigative sites to 
include sites in the United States (US), Belgium, and France. In conjunction with this 
expansion, it has been noted that Millennium will provide exemestane and fulvestrant to 
sites outside of the US and references to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) 
for each agent have been added. This amendment also incorporates procedural clarifications 
that were contained in prior administrative letters and clarifies posttreatment follow-up 
procedures, including a specification for an overall study ending time point. 
To optimize analysis of the phase 2 exploratory endpoint of
 
Several eligibility criteria have been clarified. The inclusion criterion for human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative status was simplified to reference the updated 
HER2 testing criteria of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the
College of American Pathologists (CAP). The exclusion criterion for treatment with 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors has been aligned with the prohibited concomitant 
medications.
The revisions and clarifications in this protocol amendment are listed below.
Purposes for Amendment 1
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Study Administration 
∀Increase the number of investigative sites to approximately 40, including sites in the 
US, Belgium, and France
∀Add the EudraCT (European Clinical Trials Database) number 
∀Update the contact information for the reporting of serious adverse events in both the 
US and the rest of the world (incorporates Administrative Letter #1, 06 December 2013) 
∀Specify that the study will end no later than  6 months after the last patient completes 
the end-of-treatment visit 
Eligibility
∀Refine the HER2-status inclusion criterion by clarifying the language and revising the 
reference histologic criteria to conform with the recently updated ASCO/CAP 
recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer
∀Align the eligibility criteria with the list of prohibited concomitant medications 
regarding moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9
∀Clarify that patients enrolled in the phase 1b portion are not eligible to participate in 
the phase 2 portion of the study CCI

∀Replace “study drug” with “MLN 0128” where applicable, for clarity
∀Specify that MLN0128 should be taken once daily at approximately the same time 
each day 
∀Specify that exemestane and fulvestrant will be provided by Millennium 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to the investigative sites located outside of the US 
∀Clarify that patients in the phase 1b portion who receive exemestane as their prior 
therapy will continue their therap y at their previously established dose 
∀Reference the current version of the SmPC for exemestane and fulvestrant in addition 
to the US Prescribing Information
Procedures and Assessments
∀Clarify that information on concomitant medications is collected from the time of the 
first dose of MLN0128 through 30 days after last dose of MLN0128 (incorporates 
Administrative Letter #2, 06 February 2014) 
∀Clarify the language regarding food and beverage restrictions
∀Simplify the wording of the definition of dose-limiting toxicity in phase 1b 
∀Revise the procedure subsection heading to emphasize that either (but not both) a 
multiple gated acquisition scan or echocardiogram should be performed (incorporates 
Administrative Letter #2, 06 February 2014) 
∀Specify that coagulation assessments are required for all patients at the time points 
listed in the Schedule of Events
∀Specify that the coagulation assessments are included in the list of hematology 
assessments in the clinical laboratory evaluations section 
∀Clarify that glycosylated hemoglobin testing is required only at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events (incorporates Administrative Letter #2, 06 February 2014) 
∀Clarify that tumor responses are based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors) guidelines (Version 1.1), without any modification
∀Add a request for the most recent historical prebaseline CT scans (if available) for 
patients enrolling into phase 2 who have measurable disease

14.8 Amendment 4 Rat ionale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 4
This amendment modifies the eligibilit y criteria to expand the pool of potential study  
participants and to clarify disease status confirmat ion requirements, and decreases the 
number of PK samples required in th e phase 2 portio n of the study .This amendment also 
revises the excluded medicat ions sect ion of the protocol based on characterization o f PK 
from the phase 1 porti on of  this study  and other clinical studies in the MLN0128 
development program. The starting dose f or the phase 2 portion of this study  has also been 
confirmed as 4 mg (milled) MLN0128 + either exemestane 25 mg or fulvestrant 500 mg, 
based on a safet y and tol erabili ty review of pat ients in Cohort 2 of phase 1b Part 2. It is not 
anticipated that th ese m odificat ions will affect the scientific integrit y of the study  or the 
safet y of study  participants.
Administrative changes have been made such as introducing the new co mpound code for the 
study  drug, adding the suspected unexpected serious adverse reacti ons (SUSAR) l anguage, 
and revising the product complaints vendor and contact informat ion. Addit ional minor 
clarificati ons or correcti ons have been made as necessary .
Purposes for Amendment 4
The purposes of this amendment are to:
Expand eligibilit y criteria to:
Allow enrollment of patients with an Eastern Cooperative Onco logy Group 
(ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 at baseline (previously baseline ECOG 
status must have been 0 to 1; see inclusio n criterion #5). 
Remove the requi rement that everolimus in combinat ion with exemestane or 
fulvestrant must be the most recent anticancer therapy  prior to enrollment 
(see inclusio n criterion #13).
Allow prior treatment with PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors, or TORC1 
inhibitors (see exclusio n criterion #5).
Clarify the requi rements for confirmat ion of ER+/HER2 -status, separate from the 
requi rement of m etastati c or advanced breast cancer (see inclusio n criteria #1 and #2).
Decrease the number of PK samples required of patients in the phase 2 portion:
For pati ents in the PK/Tumor PD cohort on Cy cle 1 Day  15 replace 6 serial 
PK samples (predose, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours postdose) with a single 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 98sample to be collected at the time of the Cycle 1 Day  15 bi opsy  (2-4hours 
after the MLN0128 dose).
For all other patien ts in phase 2 on Cy cle 1 Day  15, a single PK sample will 
be co llected at 2 -hours postdose.
For all patients in phase 2 on Cycle 2 Day  1, replace 3 seri al PK samples (0.5, 
2, and 4 hours postdose) with 2 samples that can be collected any  time during 
the Cycle 2 Day  15 clinic visit, wi th the second sample to be collected 1 hour 
after the first. 
For pati ents in the phase 2 PK/Tumor PD Cohort: 
Remove PK assessment of exemestane. 
Remove requi rement for taking exemestane at the same time as MLN0128 
and on an e mpty stom ach during Cycle 1.
Add clinical laboratory  testi ng for fast ing lipid profile on Cycle 2 Day 1.
Modify excluded medicat ions based on characterization of PK from the phase 1 portion 
of this study  and other clinical studies, and revise text describi ng the excluded 
medicat ions to align wit h the other phase 2 protocols in the MLN0128 development 
program:
Do not exclude the conco mitant use of a drug needed by  patients that has a 
potenti al to be a m oderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, pending fo llow-up wi th the 
study invest igator and the medical mo nitor. 
Exclude conco mitant PPI therapy  on study .
Provi de gui delines for use of histamine H2 receptor antagonists, neutralizing 
antacids, and calcium preparat ions. 
Replace the list of Relevant Cy tochrom e P450 Inhibitors a nd Inducers wit h 
the most current information and revise the source citation.
Confirm that the starting dose of MLN0128 for all phase 2 patients is 4 mg, based on a 
safet y and tolerabilit y review of pati ents in Cohort 2 of phase 1b Part 2.
Add clarificat ion regarding dose modificat ions depending on starting dose:
The previous reco mmendat ion to change fro m daily  dosing to dosing on 
5consecutive days per week for patients receiving doses ≤4 mg was 
applicable only  to pati ents in the phase 1b Part 1 portion o f the study .
The previous reco mmendat ion to reduce the dose by 20% also applies only to 
patients in the phase 1b Part 1 portion of the study; new dose reduction 
recommendat ions (fro m 4 mg to 3 m g, and then to 2 mg if needed) have been 
added for patients in the phase 2 portion.
Provi de m ore explicit guidance to the invest igator when prescribing any conco mitant 
strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers and/or inhibitors and moderate inhibitors of 
CYP2C9.
Introduce the new compound code “TAK -228” for MLN0128.
Add the suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) reporting section, 
clarifying the sponsor’s responsibilit ies for reporting expected and unexpected adverse 
events (AEs).

as appropri ate to monitor and assess the overall disease progressi on,burden 
unless contraindicated for a particular patient using in accordance with
RECIST guidelines (versio n1.1)[25], where measureable disease is defined as 
at least 1 extraosseous lesio n that can be accurately measured in at least 1

may be documented by MRI. Anatomical measurements (summed across target 
lesions) will  be collected at Baseline and at each subsequent evaluation using an 
imaging modalit y consistent with that used at Screening. As much as possible, 
the same imaging modalities and methods should be used for patients 
throughout the study. CT scans of the chest, in addition to CTs or MRIs of 
the abdomen and pelvis, will be obtained at Screening and all subsequent 
time points. Supplemental x-ray and/or bone scanning may be performed, 
but these methods are not suitable for lesion measurement. Object ive 
assessments will be performed at each time po int specified in the Schedule of 
Events .When possible, the same qualified physician will interpret results to 
reduce variabilit y. 
Rationale for Change:
This l anguage was changed t o clarify that if an MRI is used for imaging, contrast is 
preferred unless contraindicated.

Change 6: Update the description of potential drug -drug interactions between MLN0128 
and e xemestane. .
The p rimary  change occurs in Secti on1.4.1 Mutual DDI Assessment :
Initial 
wording:In-vitro, MLN0128 is m etabo lized by various cytochro me P450 (CYP) enzymes, 
including 2C19 (35%), 3A4 (28%), and 2C9 (28%); MLN0128 neit her inhibited 
nor induced any of the majo r CYP enzymes. Addit ionally , MLN0128 di d not 
inhibit P -glycoprotein but did inhibit breast cancer resistance protein at a 
relatively high concentration not expected at the dose of 5 mg QD proposed for 
administration to patients in this study .
Amended 
or new 
wording:Recently completed in vitro metabolism experiments in human hepatocytes 
using 14C-labeled MLN0128 suggest that MLN0128 is metabolized primarily 
via cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 (approximately 31% -40%), with a minor 
contribution from CYP3A4 (ap proximately 11% -22%). These data suggest 
that MLN0128 is also metabolized by direct glucuronidation (approximately 
22%) and an unidentified non –uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31001 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-001921-34
Confidential 103pathway (approximately 18%). The new data differ from the previous in 
vitro CYP phenotyping data obtained using recombinant CYP enzymes, 
which suggested the involvement of CYP2C9 (approximately 35%), 
CYP2C19 (approximately 28%), and CYP3A4 (approximately 28%) in 
MLN0128 metabolism.
In-vitro, MLN0128 is metabolized by vari ous cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, 
including 2C19 (35%), 3A4 (28%), and 2C9 (28%); MLN0128 neither inhibited 
nor induced any of the major CYP enzymes. Additionally, MLN0128 did not 
inhibit P-glycoprotein but did inhibit breast cancer resistance protein at a 
relatively high concentration not expected at the dose of 5 mg QD proposed for 
administration to patients in this study. In addition, physiologically based PK 
modeling and simulation using the new metabolism data for MLN0128 
suggest that the risk for a metabolism-based drug-drug interaction with 
MLN0128 appears to be low. Therefore, strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and 
CYP inducers (see Section 14.4) should be  administered only with caution 
and at the discretion of the investigator during the study.
Rationale for Change:
This paragraph was amended to describe updated data on MLN0128 metabolism by specific 
CYP isoforms.
Change 7: Update the signature page.
The primary change occurs on the signature page of the amendment.

2/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 5:
RATIONA LE
Changes to Protocol GO30182, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized 
below:
The protocol has been amended to reflect the update to the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). Overall survival (OS) will remain the primary endpoint. However, the 
hierarchical testing procedure will only include the OS comparisons between arms. 
The secondary endpoints (progression -free survival [PFS] and objective response 
rate [ORR]) will be deleted from the testing hierarchy and analyzed based on the 
methodologies stated in the revised SAP. The rationale for this amendment is to test 
the primary endpoint (OS) in both comparisons, (Arm A versus Arm C and Arm B 
versus Arm C) while maintaining type- 1 error (Section 6.1, Figure 3).  The time of 
analysis has been updated accordingly and will be conducted when there are 
approximately 235 deaths in the study, which is expected to occur 23 months after 
the first patient is randomized (Sections 3.2 and 6.1) .
References to Foundation Medicine have been removed from Section 4.5.7. 1
because Foundation Medicine isno longer being used for centralized confirmation of 
RAS and microsatellite testing.
References to guidelines for managing cobimetinib -specific adverse events have 
been updated ( Sections 5.1.1.1, 5.1.1.2, and 5.1.1.3).
The reporting of adverse events after initiation of study drug has been updated to 
align with the Schedule of Assessments and to align with current m odel document 
language (Section 5.3.1).
The reporting of the term “sudden death” has been updated to also require the 
presumed cause of death (Section 5.3.5.8).
Event reporting for hospitalization has been clarified (Section 5.3.5.11).
Contact information regarding Medical Monitors has been updated (Section 5.4.1).
Language has been added to clarify that the end of the adverse event reporting is 
defined as 90 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of a new anti -cancer 
treatment ,whichever comes first (Sections 5.4.2.2 and 5.6 ).
The reference document for assessing the expectedness of adverse events for 
regorafenib has been updated from local prescribing information to Summary of 
Product Characteristics (Section 5.7).
The process for reviewing and handling protocol deviations has been updated per 
internal standard operating procedures (Section 9.2).
The web address for the Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data 
(Section 9.5) .
Guidelines for managing patients who experience atezolizumab -associated adverse 
events have been revised to include guidelines for hypophysitis and myocarditis and 
have been provided in an appendix so there is no longer a need to consult the 
Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for management guidelines (Appendix 9) .  The 
list of risks was updated in Section 5.1.2 and c ross-references have been updated 
(Sections 1.4.2.2, 4.3.2.2, 5.1.2, 5.1.4.2, 5.1.4.3, 5.1.4.4 , and Appendix 3 ).
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

vemurafenib (62%) improved or resolved with management according to the 
dose- modification guidelines (see Appendix 3 Section5.1.4.3 ).
Photosensitivity (w hen A dministered with Vemurafenib)
Grade 3 photosensitivity events in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm were 
primarily treated with topical medication in conjunction with interruption of study agents.  
Refer to Section 5.1.4.3 for photosensitivity management guidelines.
Pneumonitis
There were n o reported Grade 3 events in either study arm.  Serious events were 
reported in 2 patients (0.8%) treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib.   Refer to 
Appendix 3 for pneumonitis management guidelines.
SECTION 5.1.1.2:  Potential Risks A ssociated with Cobimetinib
Liver Laboratory Abnormalities and Severe Hepatotoxicity

modification guidelines.  In both study arms, the majority of Grade 3 liver laboratory test 
abnormalit ies resolved.   Refer to Appendix 3 for hepatotoxicity management guidelines.
SECTION 5.1.1.3:  Other Risks with Cobimetinib
Rash
Generally, Grade 3 rash events were effectively managed with dose modification 
guidelines.  In Study GO28141, approximately 90% of Grade 3 rash events resolved in 
both arms.  Refer to Appendix 3 for rash management guidelines.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity
The combination of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting has the potential to contribute to 
clinically significant volume depletion/dehydration from the combination of fluid losses 
with decreased oral intake. In the majority of cases, diarrhea has been effectively 
managed with antidiarrheal agents and supportive care. Routine antiemetic prophylaxis 
is not recommended. Refer to Append ix 3 for gastrointestinal toxicity management 
guidelines.
SECTION 5.1.2:  Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab

dermatologic, and neurologic events), are provided in the Atezolizumab Investigator's 
Brochure Appendix 9 .
SECTION 5.3.1:  Adverse Event Reporting Period
After initiation of study drug , all serious adverse events and Adverse Events of Special 
Interest , regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported until 90 days after 
the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  All other adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
repo rted until 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anti -cancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first. adverse events will be reported until 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug.  After this period, the investigator should report any se rious 
adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment Instructions 
for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are 
provided in (see Section 5.6).
SECTION 5.3.5.8:  Deaths
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  The term "sudden death" should be used only for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
6/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in 
the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive 
and stable.   If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
caus e of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by the established cause of death.   The term "sudden death" should not 
be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac 
death").
SECTION 5.3.5.11:  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be adverse events: An 
event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead: The following hospitalization scenario is not co nsidered to be a serious adverse 
event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:
SECTION 5.4.1:  Emergency  Medical Contacts
For all other non -emergency medical questions, please contact your clinical study 
monitor or one of the following Medical Monitor s:
 , M.D.:  
 , Ph.D.:   
SECTION 5.4.2.2:  Events That Occur after Study  Drug Initiation
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of 
another anti -cancer drug, whichever comes first .  Investigators should record all case 
details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the 
EDC system.
SECTION 5.6:  POST -STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS
After the end of th e reporting period for serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest After the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug or initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment whichever 
comes firs t), all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the 
Long -Term Survival Follow -Up eCRF.  In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of a 
serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment, the 
event should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF.

regorafenib (StigvaraSPC 2017)
SECTION 6.1:  DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The OS final a nalysis will be conducted when there are approximately 235 deaths in the 
study.  This is expected to occur approximately 23months after the first patient is 
randomized.  At that time, it is expected that approximately 178 deaths for the 
comparison of Arm A versus Arm C and approximately 127 deaths for the comparison 
of Arm B versus Arm C will have occurred.  The OS final analysis will be conducted 
when there are approximately 178 deaths for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C 
and approximately 127 deaths for the comparison of Arm B versus Arm C.  This is 
expected to occur approximately 22 months after the first patient is randomized.  If 178th
event from Arms A and C occurs after 127hevent from Arms B and C, the OS final 
analysis will be conducted after 178thevent from Arms A and C has occurred.
SECTION 9.2:  PROTOCOL DEVIA TIONS
The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations.  The investigator 
should promptly re port any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and 
data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.   The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess 
whether any repre sent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
require reporting to health authorities. As per the Sponsor's standard operating 
procedures, prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to 
waive protocol eligibilit y criteria, are not allowed.

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a Phase III, multicenter, open -label, three -arm, randomized study in patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC who have received at least two prior regimens 
of cy totoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  The study compares regorafenib, a standard 
of care therapy in this setting, to cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy.
The primary  objective of the study is to evalua te the efficacy  of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab 
compared to regorafenib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC who 
have received at least two prior regimens of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.  
Theefficacy  of atezolizumab monotherapy compared to regorafenib in the same patient 
population will also be evaluated as a primary  objective.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
20/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5This study will be conducted globally and approximately 360 patients will be randomized in a 
2:1:1 ratio to receive: 
Arm A:  cobimetinib 60 mg  orally on Days 1 21 plus atezolizumab 840 mg intravenous ( IV) 
on Day 1 and Day 15 in a 28 -day c ycle (n ≈ 180), or
Arm B:  atezolizumab monotherapy 1200 mg IV on Day 1 in a 21 -day cycle (n ≈90), or 
Arm C:  regorafenib 160 mg orally on Days 1 21 in a 28 -day cycle (n ≈ 90).
At least 50% patients with extended RAS -mutant tumors will be enrolled in each arm.  
Enrollment of patients with MSI -high status will be limited to approximately 5% to reflect the 
natural prevalence in mCRC.
Stratification factors are extended RAS mutation status of the tumor and time since diagnosis of 
first metastasis ( 18 m onths vs. 18 months).  Permuted -block randomization will be applied to 
ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm.  Randomization and stratification wi ll be 
managed through an interactive voice/web response system.
The Sponsor will monitor the enrollment for each region (North America, Europe, and 
Pacific/Asia).  To ensure balanced global enrollment, the Sponsor may institute temporary  
limitations on enrollment in certain regions in the event of disproportionate accrual of patients.
After signing informed consent, patients will undergo screening procedures that include testing 
the tumor for extended RAS mutation status and MSI status (local tests accepte d but 
confirmatory centralized testing required); laboratory tests (e.g., hematology, chemistries, liver 
function tests); left -ventricular function evaluation (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition 
scan); contrast -enhanced computed tomography scan or ma gnetic resonance imaging of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and ophthalmologic assessments.  
All eligible patients will be randomized to treatment in either Arm A (cobimetinib plus 
atezolizumab), Arm B (atezolizumab monotherapy) or Arm C (regorafenib).  
All patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability during all cycles of therapy, at the 
treatment discontinuation visit, and during the follow -up period.  The N ational Cancer Institute
Common Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0 will be used to 
characterize the toxicity profile of the study treatments on all patients.  Patients will be assessed 
for adverse events according to the schedule of assessments and as necessary throughout the 
study.
Tumor response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1.  Any evaluable and measurable 
disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor 
evaluation.  Investigators will assess tumor response at 8 -week intervals, regardless of any 
dose delays o r treatment cycle. 
Treatment will continue until the patient has disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or phy sician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever 
occurs first.  A rising CEA level alone is not considered disease progression.  No crossover will 
be allowed.  Patients are allowed to receive study treatment beyond disease progression if 
certain conditions are met.
After discontinuation of study treatment, patients may  receive any subsequent line the rapy as 
directed by their treating physician .
Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., toxicity ) 
will continue scheduled tumor assessments until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, 
study termination by Sp onsor, or death, whichever occurs first.  In the absence of disease 
progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start a new 
anti-cancer therapy, unless consent is withdrawn.  All patients will be followed for survival 
unless consent is withdrawn.
Number of Patients
Approximately 360 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC who have 
received at least two different chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease will be enrolled in 
this study.

26/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is OS, which is defined as the time (in months) between the date 
of randomization and the date of death due to any cause.  Patients who have not died at the 
time of analysis will be censored at the date when they were last known to be alive.  
Comparisons with respect to OS between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, Arm B vs. 
Arm C) will be tested based on a stratified log -rank test.  The stratification factors will be 
extended RAS mutation status of the tumor and time since diagnosis of first metastasis 
(18months and 18 months).
Each comparison will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 within the intent- to-treat
(ITT) population:
Test to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in OS between either experimental arm 
(i.e., Arm A or Arm B) and the control arm (Arm C) in the ITT population.  If the 2 sided 
p-value corresponding to the stratified log -rank test is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis will 
be rejected.
The hazard ratio ( HR)for OS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model.  Two -sided 
95% CIs for the HR will be provided.  The stratified analy ses will incorporate extended RAS 
mutation status and tim e since diagnosis of first metastasis as stratification factors.  Results 
from an unstratified log -rank test and the unstratified HR will also be presented.  Kaplan -Meier 
methodology will be used to estimate median OS for each treatment arm, and the Kaplan- Meier 
curves will be provided.  The Brookmey er-Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 
95% CI for the median OS for each treatment arm.
The comparison between the two experimental arms (Arm A vs. Arm B) will be conducted for 
descriptive purposes.
Determination of Sample Size  
The study will randomize approximately 36 0 patients, including a minimum of 180 patients with 
extended RAS -mutant mCRC (assuming a prevalence of at least 50%), to cobimeti nib plus 
atezolizumab (Arm A), atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm B), and regorafenib (Arm C) with the 
randomization ratio of 2:1:1 , respectively.
The type 1 error ( ) for the analysis of the primary  endpoint of OS in the comparison of 
cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (Arm A) against the control arm of regorafenib (Arm C) is 
0.05 (2-sided).  If OS in the comparison of Arm A against Arm C is statistically significant, then 
the OS in the comparison of Arm B against Arm C will be tested at a 2 -sided level of 0.05. 
The sample size of this study is determined on the basis of the number of events required to 
demonstrate efficacy  with regard to OS in both comparisons (Arm A vs. Arm C and Arm B vs. 
Arm C).
The estimate of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to OS is 
based on the following assumptions:
Two-sided significance level of 0.05
Arm A versus Arm C:  87% po wer to detect an HR of 0.61, corresponding to an 
improvement in median OS from 6.4 months in Arm C to 10.5 months in Arm A
Arm B versus Arm C:  80% power to detect an HR of 0.61, corresponding to an 
improvement in median OS from 6.4 months in Arm C to 10.5 months in Arm B 
No interim analysis for OS
Dropout rate of 10% in 24 months
Hierarchical testing of Arm A versus Arm C followed by Arm B versus Arm C to control the 
overall level of 5%
With these assumptions, approximately 360 patients in total will b e randomized into this study, 
with approximately 270 patients for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C and approximately 
180 patients for the comparison of Arm B versus Arm C .  The OS final analysis will be 
conducted when there are approximately 235 deaths in the study.  This is expected to occur 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
27/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5approximately 23 months after the first patient is randomized.  At that time, it is expected 
that approximately 178 deaths for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C and approximately 
127 deaths for the comparison of Arm B versus Arm C will have occurred.
This number of events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference in HR of approximately 
0.73 for the Arm A versus Arm C comparison and approximately 0.71 for the Arm B versus 
Arm C com parison .

31/Protocol GO30182 , Version 51. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON META STATIC COLORECTA L CA NCER
1.1.1 Incidence and Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 
Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males 
and second in females .CRC also isthe fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in 
males and third in females ( Torre et al. 201 6).  The estimated incidence of new cases in 
2012 in developed countries was 736,900, and mortality was 333,200 ,with the highest 
incidence rates in North America, Europe, and Australia/ New Zealand (Torre etal.2016 ).
In the United States, about 40% of CRC patients are diagnosed with early- stage disease ,
with another 40% diagnosed with regional disease ,and 20% diagnosed with distant 
metastasis.  Five -year survival rates are 90%, 70% ,and 13% ,respectively ,with most of 
these patients dying from metastatic disease ( Alberts andWagman 2008 ; 
American Cancer Society 2015 ; Kennecke etal.2014 ).  
Without treatment, the median survival for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is less 
than 1year ( Liu et al. 2003 ).  Surgical resection of metastases can improve outcomes.
The5-year survival rates of the small fraction of patients eligible for resection of 
metastatic lesions are around 27%41% ( Mandalà et al. 2007 ;Zaydf udim et al. 2015 ).  
In the vast majority of mCRC patient s, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy is the mainstay 
of treatment and median overall survival (OS) is only around 30months.  Anti -vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF )therapies such as bevacizumab, ramucirumab, and 
ziv-aflibercept, and anti -epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) such as cetuximab and panitumumab can be used in combination with 
chemotherapy in first -, sec ond-, and third- line therapies ,though treatment combinations
vary by region ( Petrelli et al .2015 ).  In the United States and Western Europe, 
anti-VEGF and anti -EGFR therapy is used 30 %50% and 17% 30% of patients during 
the course of treatment ,respectively ( Zhao et al 2012 ; Abrams et al .2014 ).
1.1.2 Management of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Bey ond 
Second -Line Chemotherapy
Once patients have exhausted standard chemotherapy regimens, their survival is less 
than 6months.  Recently two agents, regorafenib (Stivar ga) and t rifluridine and tipiracil 
(TAS-102; L ONSURF) have been approved in these pre viously treated 
chemotherapy -refractory mCRC patients.
Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that was appr oved in heavily pretreated mCRC 
patients based on an international, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trial in 760 patients.  The median OS for regorafenib plus best 
supportive care was 6.4 months compared to 5 months for placebo plus best supportive 
care (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; p 0.0102).  Com mon side effects were 
hand -footsyndrome, fatigue, rash, diarrhea, hemorrhage, hypertension, mucositis, and 
infection ( Grothey et al. 2013).
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
32/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Trifluridine/ tipiracil is an orally administered combination of a thymidine based nucleic 
acid analogue, trifluridine, and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil hydrochloride. 
It has recently been approved in the United States based upon an international, 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, p lacebo -controlled trial in 800 patients.  
Themedian OS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 7.8) inthe trifluridine and tipiracil group
and 5.3 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.0) in the placebo group (HR0.68; p 0.001) .  Notable 
side effects were neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia as well gastrointestinal 
toxicity ( Mayer etal.2015 ).
Even with the recent approvals of these two agents, a high unmet need remains in this 
patient population for more e fficacious treatment options with better safety profiles .
1.2 THE PROGRA MMED T -CELL DEA TH LIGAND -1 PA THW AY
Encouraging clinical data in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that 
therapies that are focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can result in 
significant survival benefit in patients with Stage IV cancer ( Hodi et al. 2010 ; 
Kantoff etal.2010 ).  Therefore, immunomodulation represents a promising new strategy 
for cancer th erapy that may result in improved anti -tumor activity.
Programmed T-cell death ligand
-1 (PD -L1) expression is prevalent in many human 
tumors (e.g., lung, ovarian, melanoma, colon carcinoma) ,and its overexpression has 
been associated with poor prognosis in some cancers ( Thompson et al. 2006; 
Hamani shi et al. 2007 ; Ozaki and Honjo 2007 ; Hino et al. 2010 ).  PD -L1 is one of two 
ligands (PD -L1 and PD-L2) that bind programmed cell death -1 (PD -1).The PD -1 
receptor is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation in states 
of chronic stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer ( Blank et al. 2005 ; 
Keiretal.2008 ).  Ligation of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell proliferation, cytokine 
production, a nd cytolytic activity that lead to the functional inactivation of T cells.  
Aberrant expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti -tumor 
immunity, resulting in immune evasion ( Blank and Mackensen 2007 ).  Therefore ,
interruption of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway represents an attractive strategy to reinvigorate 
tumor specific T -cell immunity.
Blockade of PD -L1or PD- 1 with mAbs results in strong and often rapid anti -tumor effects 
in several mouse tumor models ( Iwai et al. 2002 ; Strome etal. 2003 )and has 
demonstrated clinical activity with drugs such as atezolizumab (Besse et al. 2015 ; 
Rosenberg et al. 2015 ; Vansteenkiste et al . 2015) . 
Atezolizumab is a human ized IgG1 mAb that targets PD -L1 and inhibits its interacti on 
with its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80).  Both of these interactions are 
reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells. Atezolizumab was engineered to impair 
its binding to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector functi on and 
associated antibody -mediated clearance of activated effector T cells. Section 1.4
describes the nonclinical and clinical data of atezolizumab.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
33/Protocol GO30182 , Version 51.3 THE MAPKSIGNA LING PA THW AY AND REGULA TION OF THE 
IMMUNE TUMOR MICROENVIROMENT
The MAPK signaling cascade is a key intracellular signaling network that transduces 
multiple proliferative and differentiating signals from the extracellular environment to the 
nucleus of cells to activate cellular growth and differentiation.  Signaling through ERK is 
one major MAPK pathway that has been identified that plays a significant role in normal 
cellular regulation ( Johnson andLapadat 2002 ; Roberts and D er2007 ).  Given the 
central role that the MAPK pathway plays in normal cellular development, abnormal 
regulation of this signaling pathway could lead to tumorigenesis through contribution to 
uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis as well as diminished 
apoptosis.
The MAPK pathway has also been implicated in the regulation of the immune 
microenvironment of tumors.  In invitro cell lines, blocking the MAPK pathway was 
shown to increase antigen expression and enhance reactivity to antigen specific 
Tlymphocytes ( Boni et al. 2010).  In melanoma patients who are treated with a 
combined BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi), increased intratumoral 
lymphocytes (CD4 -and CD8 -positve Tcells) were observed compared to pre- treatment 
biopsy samples ( Kakavand et al. 2015 ).  Furt hermore, pre- treatment biopsies where 
there were increased tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated a larger increase in 
tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-1expression after treatment with a BRAFi and 
MEKi ( Cooper etal.2015 ; Kakavand etal.2015 ; Liu et al. 2015 ).  The inhibition of the 
MAPK pathway leads to an increase in immune effector cells in the tumor ,thus priming 
the microenvironment to enable to immune system to attack the tumor.
Inhibition of the MAP Kpathway has focused on the suppression of targets within this
signaling network, such as MEK 1 and MEK2.  There are multiple upstream activating 
signals ,but multiple alternative pathways exist to bypass their inhibition and still activate 
ERK1 and ERK2. ERK1 and ERK2 can only be activated and phosphorylated by MEK1 
and MEK2 ,which therefore render MEK1 and MEK2 as key signaling hubs for the 
inhibition of the MAPK pathway.  
Cobimetinib is a n orally dosed, potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK. Section1.5
describes the nonclinical and clinical data of cobimetinib.
1.4 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMA B MONOTHERA PY
See the atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on nonclinical and 
clinical studies.
1.4.1 Summary  of Nonclinical Studies with A tezoli zumab
The nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab program was to demonstrate in vitro and 
invivo activity, to determine in vivo pharmacokinetics, to demonstrate an acceptable 
safety profile, and to identify a Phase I starting dose. Comprehensive pharmacology, 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
34/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5pharmacokinetic ( PK), and toxicology evaluations were thus undertaken with 
atezolizumab.
The safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in 
mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and to aid in 
projecting the appropriate starting dose in humans. Based on the similar binding affinity 
and pharmacologic activity of atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1, 
the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the relevant nonclinical model for 
understanding the safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequat e safety factors for the 
proposed Phase I starting doses. The results of the toxicology program were consistent 
with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of downmodulating the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway 
and supported entry into clinical studies in patients.
1.4.2 Clinical Experience with Atezolizumab
1.4.2.1 Ongoing Clinical Studies
In the United States, atezolizumab is approved for the treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial bladder cancer who have progressed during or following platinum -
containing chemotherapy and for metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who 
have progressed during or following platinum -containing chemotherapy and if harboring 
an EGFR or ALK aberration have progressed on U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration -approved therapy for these aberr ations.   Atezolizumab i s currently being 
tested in multiple Phase I, II, and III studies, both as monotherapy and in combination 
with several anti -cancer therapies (see the atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for 
study descriptions). Much of the safety a nd efficacy data summarized below is from 
Phase I Study PCD4989g, a multicenter, first -in-human, open -label, dose -escalation 
study evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, exploratory 
pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of biologic activity of atezolizumab 
administered as a single agent by IV infusion once every three weeks (q3w) to patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies.
1.4.2.2 Clinical Safety  as a Single A gent
The safety da ta for atezolizumab have been derived mainly from the treatment of 
patients in Study PCD4989g. As of 10 May 2015, the clinical database contained 
preliminary safety data from 558 patients who have received any amount of 
atezolizumab at doses between 0.01 and 20 mg/kg across multiple tumor types. 
Nodose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed at any dose level, and no 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established.
Adverse Events
Of the 558 treated patients,520 (93.2%) reported an adverse event regardless of 
attribution to atezolizumab. The majority of these adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 in 
maximum severity based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
35/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). The most frequently observed 
adverse events (occurring in 10% of treated patients) included fatigue, nausea, 
decreased appetite, pyrexia, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, cough, headache, back 
pain, vomiting, anemia, arthralgia, rash, insomnia, asthenia, abdominal pain, ch ills, 
pruritus, generalized pain, and peripheral edema.
There were 66 patients (11.88%) who experienced Grade ≥	3 adverse events that were 
assessed as related to study drug by the investigators. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events 
considered related by the invest igator included dyspnea, pneumonitis, increased ALT, 
increased AST, increased -glutamyl transferase, lymphocyte count decreased, cardiac 
tamponade, asthenia, autoimmune hepatitis, pneumonia, influenza, and hypoxia.
Immune Mediated A dverse Events
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation 
and/or immune mediated adverse events have been closely monitored during the 
atezolizumab clinical program. These include potential dermatologic, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal, endocrin e, neurologic ,and respiratory events as well as events of 
hepatitis/elevated liver function tests and influenza- like illness that are considered 
potential adverse drug reactions associated with atezolizumab.
Refer to the atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure and Appendix 9for details regarding 
immune mediated adverse events and identified risks ( adverse drug reactions) 
observed in patients treated with atezolizumab as well as recommended management 
guidelines for atezolizumab -specific immune mediated adverse events.
1.4.3 Clinical A ctivity of Atezolizumab
Anti-tumor activity, including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) −based responses (i.e., RECIST v1.1 responses), have been observed in 
patients with different tumor types, including NSCLC , renal cell carcinoma (RCC) , 
melanoma, bladder cancer, CRC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, 
and sarcoma treated with atezolizumab monotherapy in Study PCD4989g. 
Analyses of PD -L1 expression on baseline tumor tissue have been perform ed for 
Study PCD4989g, with results suggesting that PD -L1 expression is likely to be 
associated with response to atezolizumab.
Among 345 efficacy evaluable patients treated as of 21 October 2013 (data cutoff of 
21April 2014), with a median of 30.4 weeks o f follow -up, 62 patients experienced 
objective responses per RECIST v1.1, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 
18% (95% CI: 14.1%, 22.3%). Objective responses with atezolizumab monotherapy 
were observed in a broad range of malignancies, including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, 
bladder cancer, CRC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and 
sarcoma. Theatezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 29/Protocol GO30140, 
Version 1median duration of response (DOR) was 77.6 weeks (range: 6.4 to 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
36/Protocol GO30182 , Version 597.9weeks, for which the “ ” denotes a censored value). The majority of these 
responses have been durable, with 72.6% of responses (45 of 62 patients ) ongoing as of 
the clinical cutoff date.
1.4.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  of 
Atezolizumab
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03 20 mg/kg), atezolizumab appeared 
to show linear pharmacokinetics at doses 1 mg/kg. For the 1 -and 20 -mg/kg dose 
groups, the mean apparent clearance and the mean volume of distribution at steady 
state ranged from 3.20 to 4.44 mL/day/kg and 48.1 65.7 mL/kg, respectively, which is 
consistent with the expected pharmacokinetics of an IgG1 antibody in h umans.
The development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in 
all dose cohorts and was associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients 
in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). The development of detectable ATAs 
has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses ranging from 
1020mg/kg. Patients dosed at the 10- , 15-, and 20 -mg/kg dose levels have 
maintained the expected target trough levels of drug despite the detection of ATAs.
Todate, no clear relationship between detection of ATAs and adverse events or infusion 
reactions has been observed.
1.5 BACKGROUND ON COBIMETINIB MONOTHERA PY
Cobimetinib is a reversible , potent ,and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 .
Cobimetinib is approved in the United States, European Union, Switzerland, and in 
multiple other countries across the world for use with vemurafenib for the treatment of 
advanced BRAF -mutated melanoma.
1.5.1 Summary  of Nonclinical Studies with Cobimetinib
Cobimetinib inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines through inhibition 
of MEK1 and MEK2.  In addition, cobimetinib inhibits ERK phosphorylation in xenograft 
tumor models and stimulates apoptosis.  Cobimetinib accumulates in tumor xenografts 
and remains at high concentrations in the tumor after plasma concentrations have 
declined.  The activity of cobimetinib to inhibit ERK1 phosphorylation is more closely 
correlated with its concentration in tumor tissue than in plasma; in general, there is a 
good correlat ion between reduced ERK1 phosphorylation and efficacy in tumor 
xenograft models.  Tumor regression has been observed in several human tumor 
xenograft models.  This regression was dose dependent with up to 100% regression at 
the highest doses tested.  The m odels studied included CRC, malignant melanoma, 
breast carcinoma, and anaplastic lung carcinoma.
A characterization of the pharmacologic and PKproperties of cobimetinib was performed 
in a series of nonclinical studies that are summarized in the cobimetini b Investigator’s 
Brochure.

1.5.2 Summary  of Clinical Studies with Cobimetinib Monotherapy
As of October 2015, cobimetinib had been administered alone or with other agents to 
more than 1000 adult cancer patients and approximately 120 healthy volunteers in 18 
clinical trials ; the vast majority of patients had been treated with cobimetinib plus other 
agents ,such as vemurafenib.  These include one trial of cobimet inib as a single agent, 
seven clinical pharmacology studies, and nine trials of cobimetinib with other agents. 
Study MEK4592g was a Phase I, non -randomized, open -label, safety and PK
dose- escalation study. The study was conducted in patients with metastatic or
unresectable solid tumors for which standard curative or palliative measures did not exist
or were no longer effective. Atotal of 115 patients were treated ,and the study has 
since been completed.
The study consisted of five treatment stages:
Stage I: Dose -escalation cohorts; patients were treated on a 21 -days -on, 7 -days -off
(21/7) schedule to determine the MTD. 
Stage IA: Dose -escalation cohorts; patients were treated on a 14- days -on,
14-days -off(14/14) schedule to determine the MTD on an alternate dosing regimen.
Stage II: Expansion cohort with the MTD determined in Stage I (60 mg daily [QD]
21/7) in patients harboring a BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation.
Stage IIA: Expansion cohort with the MTD de termined in Stage IA (100 mg QD 
14/14) in patients harboring a BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS mutation.
Stage III: A dedicated drug-drug interaction study at the MTD determined in Stage I 
(60 mg QD 21/7) in approximately 20 patients with solid tumors.
Dose -Limiting Toxicities
Four DLTs were observed in Stage I (21/7 dosing schedule) of Study MEK4592g. At the 
40-mg dose level, a DLT of Grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy and Grade 3 elevated 
ammonia was reported in a patient with pre -existing liver metastases. At the 60 -mg 
dose level, a DLT of Grade 3 rash was reported that improved with skin toxicity 
management and drug holiday. At the 80 -mg dose level, two DLTs were reported: 
1patient with Grade 3 diarrhea despite treatment with anti -diarrheal medications and 
1patient with Grade 3 rash.
Two DLTs were observed in Stage IA (14/14 dosing schedule) ,both at the 125 -mg dose 
level. One patient had Grade 3 rash and another had Grade 3 blurred vision associated 
with neurosensory detachment of the retina.

1.6 COMBINED INHIBITION OF PD -L1 A ND MAPKSIGNA LING 
PATHW AYS AS POTENTIA L ANTI -CANCER THERA PY IN 
METASTATIC COLORECTA L CANCER
Because of the high unmet medical need in heavily pretreated advanced mCRC, where 
OS is only 6 months, several clinical studies have tested checkpoint inhibitors in this 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
39/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5setting with disappointing results ( Brahmer et al. 2012 ; Topalian et al. 2012 ; 
Poulin -Costello et al. 2013 ).  
Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to have clinical benefit in 
microsatellite (MSI) unstable mCRC but not in MSI stable cohorts ( Le et al. 2015 ). 
This preferential effect of checkpoint inhibitors on MSI -high CRCs has been postulated 
to be due to an increase in neo -antigens from a greater somatic mutation load.  This 
increase in somatic mutations amplifies upstream pathways required for a n immune 
response ,such as recruitment of immune effector or antigen presenting cells 
(Llosa etal.2015 ; Zhang etal.2015 ).  Furthermore, the mismatch repair deficient 
cancers have increased CD8- positive T cells and PD -L1 expression in the tumor, which 
may explain why they are responsive to checkpoint inhibitors ( Li et al. 2015; 
Smedt etal.2015 ).
One potential mechanism to convert otherwise resistant cancers is to recruit immune 
cells to the tumor si tes so that the anti -PD L1 can be effective in activating the local 
immune system against the cancer cells. Nonclinical models suggest that MEK 
inhibition may have pleiotropic effects that could impact the tumor immune 
microenvironment, as t he MAPK pathwa y has been implicated in the immune resistance 
of tumors and inhibition of this pathway can lead to increase CD8 positive T-cell 
infiltration ( Kakavand et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015 ).    
Within the tumor, MEK inhibition results in increase dmajor histocompatibility complex 
(MHC )class I expression and tumor antigen presentation, which acts to enhance tumor 
recognition by the immu ne system.  Interestingly, MEK inhibition in tumors also 
increases expression of the checkpoint receptor PD -L1, which could counteract the 
increased presentation of tumor antigens.  Lastly, the MAPK pathway is known to 
regulate a number of cytokines and chemokines, such as VEGF, interleukin (IL) -6 (IL-6), 
IL-8, and g ranulocyte macrophage colony -stimulating factor , which may impact 
recruitment of vascular and other stromal cell types, including myeloid derived 
suppressive cells (MDSCs) that can inhibit the a nti-tumor activity of T cells 
(Bancroft etal.2001 ;Sano etal.2001 ; Bancroft etal.2002 ; Phan etal.2013 ).  Activity 
of MEK inhibition outside of the tumor cells may further contribute to the modul ation of 
the immune microenvironment that could enable a more permissive immune reaction 
against the tumor.  These effects include inhibition of tumor vascular maturity and 
integrity, tumor infiltration, activity of MDSCs, neutrophils, increased activity o f 
antigen -presentation cells, such as macrophage and dendritic cells, and recruitment and 
activation status of T -cell subsets, including CD8- positive cytolytic and CD4 positive 
helper cells ( Giordano etal.2015 ; Liu etal.2015 ; Loi et al.2015 ).  
Collectively, these effects enable tumors to demonstrate stronger anti -tumor resp onses 
with t he combination of a MEK iand PD -L1/PD -1 blockade in multiple mouse models , 
including colorectal, breast ,and melanoma models (Liuetal.2015 ; Loi et al.2015 ).  
Increased anti -tumor activity is associated with increased CD8 positive T-cell infiltration 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
40/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5of tumors that express markers consistent with tumor cell cytolytic activity.   These data 
suggest that MEK inhibition can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and 
enable better tumor recognition and killing by the immune system, particularly when 
paired with a checkpoint inhibitor against the PD- 1/PD -L1 axis .

1.8 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT
The rationale for specific details of the study design are discussed in Section 3.3.
The combination of a MEK iand PD -L1 inhibitor has nonclinical and clinical data that 
strongly support further evaluation in previously treated mCRC patients.  Both in vitro 
and in vivo models have shown that the MAP Kpathway plays an important role in the 
immune tumor microenvironment ,and MEK inhibition leads to increases in MHC -1and 
PD-L1 expression as well as incre ases in CD 8positive lymphocyte recruitment into the 
tumor microenvironment.  This enhancement of the local immune system in combination 
with a PD -L1 inhibitor has demonstrated increased efficacy in nonclinical and clinical 
models.  The Phase Ib clinical trial evaluating cobimetinib plus atezolizumab in 
previously treated KRAS mutated mCRC patients shows an efficacy of a 13% PRrate 
and a26% SDrate,with some responses lasting more than 1 year .  The regimen is well 
tolerated ,and the safety profile is manageable and tolerable .
There is clearly a high medical need in this patient population of previously treated 
mCRC patients ,where OSis less than 6months and treatment options are very limited 
and often poorly tolerated.  Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab ha sshown clinically efficacy 
in these mCRC patients and is well tolerated; thus,further study in this clinical trial is 
warranted.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTI ON OF THE STUDY
This is a Phase III, multicenter, open -label, three -arm, randomized study in patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC who have received at least two prior 
regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The study compares 
regorafenib, a standard of care therapy in this setting, to cobimetinib plus atezolizumab
and atezolizumab monotherapy.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus 
atezolizumab compared to regorafenib in patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic CRC who have received at least two prior regimens of chemotherapy in the 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
44/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5metastatic setting.  The efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy compared to regorafenib 
in the same patient population will also be evaluated as a primary objective.
This study will be conducted globally and approximately 360 patients will be randomized 
in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive ( Figure 1and Figure 2):
Arm A:  cobimetinib 60 mg orally on Days 1 21 plus atezolizumab 840 mg I V on 
Day 1 and Day 15 in a 28 -day cycle (n ≈ 180) , or
Arm B:  atezolizumab monotherapy 1200 mg IV on Day 1 in a 21 -day cycle (n≈90), 
or 
Arm C:  regorafenib 160 mg orally on Days 1 21 in a 28 -day cycle (n ≈ 90) .
At least 50% patients withextended RAS -mutant tumors (see Section 4.5.7.1 for 
definition) will be enrolled in each arm .Enrollment of patients with MSI -high status
(see Section 4.5.7.1 for definition) will be limited to approximately 5% to reflect the 
natural prevalence in mCRC ( Goldstein et al. 2014).
Stratification factor sareextended RAS mutation status of the tumor and time since 
diagnosis of first metastasis ( 18 months vs.18 months) . Permuted -block 
randomization will be applied to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm .
Randomization and stratification will be managed through an interactive voice/web 
response system (IxRS).
The Sponsor will monitor the enrollment for each region (North America, Europe, and 
Pacific/Asia).  To ensure balanced global enrollment, the Sponsor may institute 
temporary limitations on enrollment in certain regions in the event of disproportionate 
accrual o f patients.
The schedule of study assessments and procedures are detailed in Appendix 1.
After signing informed consent, patients will undergo screening procedures that include 
testing the tumor for extended RAS mutation status and MSI status (local tests accepted 
but confirmatory centralized testing required) ; laboratory tests ( e.g., hematology, 
chemistries, liver function test s); left -ventricular function evaluation (echocardiogram
[ECHO] or multigated acquisition scan [ MUGA ]); contrast -enha nced computed 
tomography ( CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis; and ophthalmologic assessments. 
All eligible patients will be randomized to treatment in either Arm A ( cobimetinib plus 
atezolizumab), Arm B ( atezol izumab monotherapy )or Arm C (regorafenib) . The dosing 
regimen and schedule for each treatment arm is shown in Figure 2and Section 4.3.
All patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability during all cycles of therapy, 
at the treatment discontinuation visit, and during the follow -up period. The NCI CTCAE 
v4.0 will be used to characterize the toxicity profile of the study treatments on all patients.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
45/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Patients will be assessed for adverse events according to the schedule of assessment s
in Appendix 1and as necessary throughout the study.
Tumor response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 5).
Anyevaluable and measurable disease must be documented at screening and 
re-assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. Invest igators will assess tumor 
response at 8-week intervals, regardless of any dose delays or treatment cycle .
Treatment will continue until the patient has disease progression according to RECIST 
v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or physician decisi on to withdraw ,or 
pregnancy ,whichever occurs first .A rising CEA level alone is not considered disease 
progression. No crossover will be allowed. Patients are allowed to receive study 
treatment beyond disease progression if certain conditions are met (Section 4.3.2.4 ).
After discontinuation of study treatment, patients may receive any subsequent line 
therapy as directed by their treating physician .
Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression 
(e.g., toxicity) will continue scheduled tumor assessments until disease progression, 
withdrawal of consent, study termination by Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.  
Inthe absence of disease progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless 
of whether patients start a new anti -cancer therapy, unless consent is withdrawn .  
Allpatients will be followed for survival unless consent is withdrawn.

3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY
The OS final analysis will be conducted when there are approximately 235 deaths in the 
study.  This is expected to occur approximately 23months after the first patient is 
randomized.  
The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs 
or the date at which the last data point required for statistical analys is (i.e., OS) or safety 
follow -up is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later. LPLV is expected to 
occur 3 years after the first patient is enrolled. The study will end at any time if the 
Sponsor decide s to end the trial.
3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
This Phase III study is designed to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy and 
MEK inhibition over regorafenib in unresectable mCRC patients who have received at 
least two prior lines of chemotherapy in this setting. Despite recent improvements in 

Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
47/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5treatment, the prognosis for these heavily pretreated patients remains dismal, with a 
median OS of approximately 6 months.  Approved therapies are associated with 
significant toxicities .Therefore, there is a continuing need for more efficacious and
better-tolerated treatments.
3.3.1 Rationale for Overall Survival as Primary  Endpoint 
Overall survival was chosen as the primary endpoint because it is the gold standard 
endpoint for cancer. Measurement of this endpoint is not questionable and patients with 
either measurable or non -measurable disease can be evaluated without the possibility of 
discrepancies in interpretations. This patient population has very few treatment options 
that would confound the assessment of OS, thus making OSa particular meaningful 
endpoint.
3.3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Study
The primary endpoint of the study is OS ,and an open -label design would have minimal 
impact on OS .Given that this study is being conducted in a patient population with 
almost no treatment options that c ould affect the endpoints of the study , an open -label 
study design is unlikely to impart a significant bias to the study results . Furthermore, the 
study utilizes three study drugs with twoadministration routes and schedules , which 
introduces substantial challenges to blinding and can result in erroneous drug 
administration. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Patient Population , Stratification Factors , and 
Capping
ThePhase Ib trial (GP28363 ) evaluate dthe cobimetinib and atezolizumab in 
KRAS-mutated mCRC patients and demonstrated promising clinical activity (Section 1.7).
RAS−mutated mCRC, in general, have a relatively poor immune cell infiltration and low 
immune inhibitory molecule expression compared to RAS wild-type colorectal tumors 
(Lal et al. 2015 ).
Theproposed mechanism of action would predict that this combination would be just as 
effective or potentially more efficacious in patients with RAS -wild type mCRC who 
generally have a more favorable tumor immune microenviro nment . Therefore, given the 
promising clinical activity and high unmet need, this Phase III study will include both 
RAS mutant and RAS wild-type mCRC patients.
This Phase III study willstratify patients based on their tumor extended RAS mutati on 
status and time since diagnosis of first metastasis . These are important predictive and 
prognosis factors for mCRC and may potentially affect treatment outcomes.
RAS mutation status has important implications in treatment and prognosis of mCRC 
(Karapetis et al. 2008; De Roock et al. 2010 ; Sorich et al. 2015; Allegra etal.2016 ).
Several studies have demonstrated that RAS mutations are associated with a worse 
prognosis compared to RAS wild type cohorts ( Sorbye etal.2015 ; Sorich et al. 2015 ; 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
48/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Vincenzi et al. 2015 ). This bears particular importance for regorafenib, which is the 
treatment in the control arm of this Phase III study. In the CORRECT study (regorafenib 
monotherapy for previously treated mCRC ), subgroup analysis showed a treatm ent 
effect for OS in fav or of regorafenib over placebo for patients with KRAS wild- type 
tumors whereas a numerically lower effect was reported in pa tients with KRAS -mutant 
tumors ( Grothey et al .2013 ).The HR(95% CI ) of OSwas 0.653 (0.476 to 0.895) for 
patients with KRAS wild- type tumors and 0.867 (0.670 to 1.123) for patients with 
KRAS- mutant tumo rs.Given th atRAS mutation status has substantial prognostic 
significance, patients on this study will be stratified by their tumor RAS mutation status.
Time since diagnosis of first metastasis ( <18 months, 18months) also will be used as 
a stratification factor.  This stratification is commonly used when studying this patient 
population ( Gothrey et al. 201 4;Mayer et al 2015 ).  The percent survival of mCRC 
patients is dramatically reduced from the first year from diagnosis to the second year 
from d iagnosis of metastatic disease ( Golan 2013 ;van der Geest 2015;
Roder etal.2015 ). Because time from diagnosis has great prognostic implications on 
survival, this trial will stratify accordingly.
In the mCRC setting, the natural frequency of tumors with MSI -high status is 
approximately 5% ( Goldstein et al. 2014). In order to ensure generalizability of the study 
results, this Phase III study will limit the patients with MSI -high tumors to approximately
5%. Similarly, the frequency of extended RAS mutations in the previously treated 
mCRC patient population ranges from 50% −65% ;thus, to reflect this prevalence, this 
study will enroll at least 50% mCRC patients with RAS -mutated tumors.
MSI status in CRC has im portant implications in both the treatment and prognosis for 
mCRC ( Goldstein et al. 2014). In particular, recent data has shown that anti PD-1 
mAbs may be more efficacious in patients with MSI-high mCRC tumors (Le et al. 2015 ; 
Oh et al. 2015 ).  Atezolizumab, a n anti -PD-L1 mAb,inhibits the PD -L1 ligand ,thereby
block ing the interaction of PD -L1with PD-1 and B7-1.Given that atezolizumab inhibits
the interaction between PD -L1 and PD-1, patients with MSI -high mCRC tumors will likely 
experienc edifferential efficacy compared to patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) 
mCRC tumors . In this study, the number of MSI-high patients will be capp ed at 
approximately 5% to represent the prevalence in this patient population. S tratification by 
MSI/MSS will not be necessary asthe small number of MSI -high patients will likely not 
affect the overall results of the trial.
3.3.4 Rationale for Cobimetinib plu s Atezolizumab Arm
Both nonclinical and clinical data from the Phase Ib Study GP28363 show edpromising 
efficacy of cobimetini b plus atezolizumab in heavily pretreated KRAS−muta tedmCRC 
patients.  All the patients tested had MSI -stable tumors, unlike results from other 
checkpoint inhibitors ( see Section 1.6).Because cobimetinib plus atezolizumab was 
well tolerated, and the efficacy data are promising, this combination will be further 
explored in this setting of high medical need.

49/Protocol GO30182 , Version 53.3.5 Rationale for A tezol izumab Monotherapy  Arm
Recent data showed that anti PD-1 mAbs may be more efficacious in patients with 
MSI-high mCRC tumors ( Le et al. 2015 ; Oh e t al. 2015 ).  In contrast to anti PD-1 agents, 
atezolizumab is an anti PD-L1 mAb, which is capable of inhibiting the interaction of 
PD-L1 with PD -1 and also PD-L1with B7 -1. Given that atezolizumab inhibits PD-L1 
ligand from binding the PD -1 receptor and another immunomodulatory receptor (B7 -1), 
the activity of atezol izumab may not be limited to MSI-high mCRC tumors.  
 
.
Therefore, the atezolizumab monotherapy was included in this Phase III study to further 
evaluate the activity of atezolizumab in mCRC . 
3.3.6 Rationale for Regorafenib as Control A rm
Regorafenib and t rifluridine/tipiracil are approved treatment s for previously treated
mCRC patients. Regorafenib was approved based on a Phase III trial that showed an 
improvement of OS compared to best supportive care of 1.4 months and a PFS of 
0.3months ( Grothey et al. 2013 ).Regorafenib is approved in numerous countries 
worldwide ,including the United States and European Union. 
Trifluridine/tipiracil was recently approved in September 2015 in the United States . 
Theapproval was based on a Phase III trial demonstrating median OSimprovement
from 5.3 months with placebo to 7.1 months with trifluridine/tipiracil (Mayer et al. 2015 ).
Asthis is a global trial and regorafenib has been established as a standard ofcare 
treatment in patients in this setting in numerous countries, regorafenib is an appropriate 
treatment for the control arm.
The dosing and schedule for regorafenib that will be used in this study is the same as 
the dose that was used in the pivotal clinical trials ( Grothey et al. 2013 ;Li et al.2015 ) 
and the approved and marketed dose for this indication.  Regorafenib will be 
administered at the rec ommended dose of 160 mg regorafenib (four 40 mg tablets) 
taken orally once daily for the first 21 days of each 28 -day cycle.
3.3.7 Rationale for Dose and Schedule for Cobimetinib plus 
Atezolizumab and for A tezolizumab Monotherapy
In Arm A ( cobimetinib plus atezolizumab ), concomitant administration of atezolizumab 
and cobimetinib was studied in the Phase Ib Study GP28363 .Cobimetinib 60mgon a
21/7 schedule isthe approved dose and schedule of cobimetinib .For administration 
with cobimetinib, on a 28 -day cycle, a dose of 840 mg atezolizumab administered every 
2weeks has the equivalent dose exposu re as the 1200 mg every 3 weeks (21 –day 
cycle), the planned dose for the atezolizumab monotherapy arm .  In Study GP28363, 
atezolizumab was dosed concurrently with cobimetinib at800 mg IV q2w.The 840 mg
dose is expected to be similar to the 800 mg dose of atezolizumab dose and selected in 
this study t o simplify dose administration. 

Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
50/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5In Arm B (atezolizumab monotherapy ), atezolizumab will be dosed at 1200 mg IV q3w.
This is the dosing schedule that is being used in multiple Phase III studies of 
atezolizumab monotherapy across multiple tumor types. This dose and schedule of 
atezolizumab has been demonstrated to be safe and tolerable in over 1000 treated 
patients. 
3.3.8 Rationale for A llowing Patients to Continue Treatment until 
Loss of Clinical Benefit
Conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of 
immunotherapeutic agents asincrease in tumor size does not consistently reflect 
therapeutic fail ure (Wolchok et al. 2009).  The phenomena of pseudo progression or 
infiltration of tumor by immune cells may mimic tumor progression. Therefore , as this 
study is evaluating an immunotherapy, the study will allow patients to continue to receive 
study treatment after documented RECIST v1.1 defined radiographic disease 
progression, provided the benefit -risk ratio for the patient remains favorable as assessed 
by the physician and study monitor (see Section 4.3.2.4 ).  
3.3.9 Rationale for Patient -Related Outcomes A ssessments
The patient experience of mCRC includes impacts on symptoms (disease and treatment 
burden), functioning ,and HRQoL. Disease -specific symptoms (e.g., bloating, abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite ) and other symptoms (e.g., fatigue) that 
negatively impact patients’ functioning and quality of life are relevant in this population .  
Patient -completed questionnaires areincluded to characterize the impact of disease and 
treatment on patients. The collection of this type of data will provide gre ater insights for 
both the medical and patient communities to understand disease and treatment burden 
and resulting HRQoL when patients are exposed t o cobimetinib plus atezolizumab or 
atezolizumab monotherapy treatments in the mCRC setting ( Marventano etal.2013 ).
The EQ -5D-5L will be include d to derive utility to inform pharmacoeconomic models.
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of A rchiv al and/or Fresh Tumor 
Specimens, Stratification Criteria, and Biomarker A ssessments
Tumor tissue samples will be collected at baseline for genetic and histopathological 
assessments at DNA, RNA, protein ,and tissue levels to add to researchers' 
understanding of disease pathobiology.  Gene based CRC classification increasingly 
has been proposed as a way of differentiating various subtypes of CRC and may have 
profound effects on both treatment and prognosis.  These subtypes have been shown to 
have different immunomodulatory affects and may influence the efficacy of this 
combination ( Guinney etal.2015 ; Kocarnik etal.2015 ; Lal etal.2015 ).  As these 
biomarkers may also have prognostic value, their potential association with disease 
progression will also be explored.  Archival/baseline tumor analysis and classification of 
different CRC subtypes will be performed to further assess this possible relationship.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
51/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Tumor biopsies while on treatment and at progression are scheduled to further elucidate 
the possible mechanism of action or mechanisms of resistance (innate or acquired) of 
this regimen and may include evaluation of CD8 positive T-cell infiltrate, PD -L1 
expression, and biomarkers of enhanced immune response, MAPK activation, and 
others involved in apoptosis or inflamm ation.
3.3.11 Rationale for Blood Sampling for Biomarker A ssessments
An exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate biomarkers (including but not limited 
to cytokines, whole genome sequencing [ WGS],cfDNA, and cancer -specific biomarkers ,
such a s CEA) in bl ood samples.  The evaluation of blood biomarkers may provide 
evidence for biologic activity of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and atezolizumab 
monotherapy in patients with mCRC and may allow for the early prediction of clinical 
benefit of cobimetinib and atezolizumab use.
In addition, potential correlations of these biomarkers with the safety and activity of 
cobimetinib and atezolizumab will be explored.
3.3.11.1 Ratio nale ofOptional Whole Genome Sequencing
Genomics is increasingly informing understanding of disease pathobiology and rationale 
for the development of new therapeutic approaches. WGS provides comprehensive 
characterization of the genome and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may 
increase the opportunity for making these discoveries.
Relevant literature on genomic analyses shows ample examples of genetic variations 
and their implications in immune responses. For instance, a recent report identified 
20genes linked to variability o f the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccination,
seven of which were shown to be involved in intracellular antigen transport, processing, 
and presentation ( Franco et al. 2013 ).Similarly, genome wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified specific genetic variants that are associa ted with differences in 
WBC, neutrophil , and monocyte counts among individuals ( Knight 2013). Furthermore, 
GWAS in autoimmune diseases have led to novel insights, an example of which is the 
role of autophagy in Crohn’s disease, which was elucidated based on variation at two 
loci and has now become a major therapeutic target in this disease ( Hu and Daly 2012 ).
It is also established that geneti c variants of drug -metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects safety and efficacy. 
For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine 
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, w hich facilitates the metabolism and 
excretion of SN -38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at a higher risk for adverse 
effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan 
(O’Dwyer andCatalano 2006 ).
In addition to the link between genetic variatio n in drug -metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters and pharmacokinetics, recent studies have also identified genetic variants 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
52/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5that increase the likelihood of (or are protective of) developing drug induced adverse 
events. For example, HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the 
development of drug- induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepine, abacavir, and 
allopurinol ;Michels et al. 2015 ;Shirzadi et al. 2015; Stamp et al. 2015). In addition, 
mutations in GSTP1 , CTLA4 , and FDG4 have been associated with development of 
druginduced peripheral neuropathy of various small molecules ( Lecomte et al. 2006 ; 
Ruzzo et al 2007 ; Favis et al. 2011; Baldwin et al. 2012 ).
Therefore, determining host genetic variation by performing WGS  on patient samples 
collected in this study and assessing the relationship w ith response to treatment and
observed adverse events may enable a further understanding of efficacy and safety for 
cancer immunotherapy and other therapeutic approaches. To this end, a blood sample 
may be collected from patients enrolled in this study for DNA extraction toenable W GS 
analysis. The W GS testing is an optional component of this study ;patients can decline 
this sample collection and test.
WGS is contingent upon the review and approval by each site's IRB/EC and, if 
applicable, an appropriat e regulatory body. Ifa site has not been granted approval for 
WGS, this assessment will not be applicable at that site.

64/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5All medications must be recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF .
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health 
authority -approved or experimental, is prohibited for various time periods prior to starting 
study treatment, dep ending on the anti -cancer agent (see Section 4.1.2 ), and during 
study treatment until disease progression is documented and patient has discontinued 
study treatment.  This includes but is not limited to chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational agents, or herbal therapy.
The following medications are prohibited while receiving study treatment, unless 
otherwise noted:
Traditional herbal medicines as their use may result in unanticipated drug -drug 
interactions that may cause or confound assessment of toxicity.
Denosumab: P atients who are receiving denosumab prior to enrollment must be 
willing and eligible to receive a bisphosphonate instead while in the study.
Any live, attenuated vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within 4 week s prior to randomization or 
at any time during the study or within 5 months following the last infusion of 
atezolizumab.
For patients on atezolizumab:
–Use of steroids to premedicate patients for whom CT scans with contrast are 
contraindicated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance); 
in such patients, MRIs of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with a non -contrast 
CT scan of the ches t must be performed. 
–Immunomodulatory agents, including but not limited to interferons or IL -2, 
during the entire study; these agents could potentially increase the risk for 
autoimmune conditions when received in combination with atezolizumab
–Immunosuppre ssive medications, including but not limited to 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide; these agents 
could potentially alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab
–Systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may attenuate pote ntial 
beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  Therefore, in 
situations where systemic corticosteroids or TNF -inhibitors would be routinely 
administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered first 
by the tre ating physician.  If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic 
corticosteroids and TNF- inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of 
the treating (see Section 4.4.2 )
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
65/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5For patients on cobimetinib:
–Concomitant use of strong and moderate inhibitors o f CYP3A 
(e.g.,clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, 
telithromycin, and voriconazole) should be avoided as cobimetinib is a sensitive 
substrate of CYP3A and exposures will be increased in presence of these 
agents (appr oximately 7 -fold increase in presence of itraconazole in healthy 
subjects).
–Avoid strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. ,rifampin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort) as they increase the 
metabolism of cobimetinib.  Strong indu cers of CYP3A4 should be avoided, or 
selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal 
potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
For patients on regorafenib:
–Avoid use of strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g. ,clarithromycin, 
grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin, and 
voriconazole) as mean AUC of regorafenib was increased by 33% (St ivarga 
[regorafenib] Prescribing Information).
–Avoid strong UGT1A9 inhibitor (e.g., mefenamic acid, d iflunisal, and niflumic 
acid) during regorafenib treatment as their influence on the steady -state 
exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites has not been studied. 
–Avoid strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. ,rifampin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital ,and St. John’s wort) as they increase the 
metabolism of regorafenib.  Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided, or 
selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal 
potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. 
The above lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive.  Thus, the 
investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication 
as well as the Internet references provided below w hen determining whether a certain 
medication is metabolized by or strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A or UGT1A9.  
Inaddition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise 
regarding medications not listed above.

Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study -related procedures.  Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained a t the study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by the investigator to confirm 
that patients meet all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will 
maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm 
eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Medi cal History  and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, prior surgeries, reproductive 
status, and use of alcohol, and drugs of abuse.  In addition, all medications 
(e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccin es, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to initiation of 
study drug will be recorded.
Demographic data will include age, sex ,and self-reported race/ethnicity . Baseline 
disease characteristics data will include AJCC disease stage at enrollment, ECOG 
performance status, date of diagnosis of first metastatic disease, site of primary disease, 
RAS status, MSI status, history of metast asectomy, location of metastasis at enrollment , 
number of prior che motherapy regimens, and prior therapy ( 5-fluorouracil , oxaliplatin, 
irinotecan, trifluridine and tipiracil , anti- EGFR, anti -VEGF), 
A chemotherapy regimen is defined as a set of chemotherapy agents with an initial 
defined dose and frequency that are given ina prescribed order, which may be 
concurrently.  A regimen can consist of only one chemotherapy agent or multiple agents.  
If one of the agents is discontinued because of toxicity or other concerns, the remaining 
chemotherapy combination is not considere d a new regimen.  Maintenance therapy is 
also not considered a separate regimen.  If a chemotherapy regimen is held and 
restarted at a later date, this is considered one regimen and not two separate 
chemotherapy regimens.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete p hysical examination should be performed at screening and should include 
an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, 
dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  
Any abnormal ity identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom directed physical 
examinations should be performed.  Changes from baseline abnorm alities should be 
recorded in patient notes.  New orworsened clinically significant abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF (See Section 5.2).
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
67/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Patients on cobimetinib plus atezolizumab will be asked specifically about vision 
changes as part of each physical examination in addition to interval medical history.  
Note:  If physical examinations are performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1, they do 
not have to be repeated on Cycle 1Day 1 (see Section 4.5.11).
4.5.4 Vital Signs
Vital signs are defined as:  temperature (°C), heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure.  Height and weight will be recorded on Cycle 1 Day 1.
4.5.4.1 Vital Signs for Patients A ssigned to Receive Atezolizumab w ith 
or without Cobimeti nib ( ArmsA and B)
Vital signs will be measured and recorded at the following timepoints:
Within 60 minutes prior to infusion
During infusion and/or after infusion if clinical lyindicated
For patients in the atezolizumab arm who experienced an infusion -related reaction 
during the previous atezolizumab infusion, refer to Section 5.1.4 .
4.5.4.2 Vital Signs for Patients A ssigned to Receive Regorafenib 
(ArmC)
Monitor vital signs weekly for the first 6 weeks and then with every cycle, especially 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure as indicated by the Stivarga (regorafenib) 
Prescribing Information as uncontrolled hypertension has been known to occur .
4.5.5 Tumor and Response Evaluations
Baseline tumor assessments should be performed 35days before Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
assessed according to RECIST v 1.1 (see Appendix 5). The same procedure used to 
assess disease sites at baseline should be used throughout the study (e.g., the same 
contrast protocol for CT scans or MRI scans ).To the extent that it is feasible, thesame 
assessor should read and evaluate the tumor assessments for the same patient 
throughout the study . CT or MRI scans should include chest, abdomen, and pelvic 
scans; CT or MRI scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated. At the 
investigator’s discretion, CT scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is 
suspected. 
Evaluation of tumor response conforming to RECIST v1.1 must be documented every 
8weeks 1 week no matter where the patient is in the chemotherapy treatm ent cycle
(this can occur mid -treatment) until documented investigator determined progressive 
disease, loss of clinical benefit, withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the 
Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  Schedule of tumor assessments are i ndependent of 
any changes to the study treatment administration schedule (e.g., dose delay) and may 
occur mid -cycle depending on length of cycle .  If a tumor assessment has to be 
performed early or late, subsequent assessments should be conducted according to the 
original schedule based on the date of first study drug administration (Cycle 1 Day 1).  
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
68/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Confirmation of response (PR or complete response [CR] ) will be done no earlier than 
28days from study entry.  In the case of SD, measurements must have met t he SD 
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval not less than 6 weeks.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason other than disease progression 
will continue to undergo tumor response evaluations (approximately every 8 w eeks) until 
progressive disease.  A rising CEA alone without radiological evidence of progression is 
not considered progressive disease. 
Patients who continue to experience clinical benefit in all three arms , despite evidence of 
radiographic progression a s defined by RECIST v1.1 ,may continue treatment (see 
Section 4.3.2.4 ) and will continue tumor assessments as per the schedule listed above.

71/Protocol GO30182 , Version 54.5.7.1 Archival and Fresh Tumor Sample for Screening
Representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least 20 serial cut, 
unstained slides with an associated pathology report must be submitted for
determination of extended RAS status and MSI status.
Extended RAS mutation is defined as mutations occurring in KRAS and NRAS gene 
codons 12 and 13 of exon 2; 59 and 61 of exon 3; and 117 and 146 of exon 4 
(Allegra etal. 201 6).  Local RAS testing results will be accepted with a copy of the 
results and interpretation as part of the screening process with a requirement for central 
confirmation.
MSI status can be defined by several methods such as IHC detection of hMLH1 and 
hMSH2 gene products, NGS testing, or PCR testing by the fraction of MSI loci that 
exhibit differently sized repeats ( Lindor et al. 2002 ; Salipante etal.2014 ).  Local MSI 
testing resu lts will be accepted with a copy of the results and interpretation as part of the 
screening process with a requirement for central confirmation . 
In addition, NGS for exploratory research on non -inherited (or tumor specific) biomarkers 
(including, but not limited to, cancer -related genes and biomarkers associated with 
common molecular pathways) and exploratory biomarkers (including but not limited to 
markers related to immune, MAP kinase pathway, or CRC biology, such as T -cell 
markers or tumor mutation stat us) may be evaluated (see Table 2 in Section 4.5.6 ).
Foundation Medicine NGSbased genomic profiling will be performed.  When performed 
by Foundation Medicine, the investigator can obtain resu lts from the samples collected 
in the form of an NGS report, which is available upon request directly from Foundation 
Medicine.  The investigator may share and discuss the results with the patient, unless 
the patient chooses otherwise.  The Foundation Medicine NGS assay has not been 
cleared or approved by health aut horities.  The NGS report is generated for research 
purposes and is not provided for the purpose of guiding future treatment decisions.
Archival tumor tissue should be collected as follows:
A representative formalin fixed, paraffin -embedded ( FFPE )tumor sp ecimen 
collected at first diagnosis and/or subsequent tumor recurrence(s) consistent with 
the patient’s diagnosis is required for participation in this study (FFPE block 
[preferred], or a minimum of 20 unstained serial sections). This specimen must be 
accompanied by the associated pathology report.  
–The available tumor sample must be adequate to determine extended RAS 
status and MSI status.
–The tumor sample and associated pathology report must be confirmed to be 
available prior to any study specific scree ning procedures.  Fine -needle 
aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, and lavage samples are 
not acceptable.  For core needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should 
be submitted for evaluation.

72/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5–For samples that do not meet the min imum requirements for size/slide number, 
contact the Medical Monitor via site contact with tissue size and tumor 
content/number of slides to determine eligibility.  
–Alternatively, or if the archival tumor sample does not meet minimum 
requirements, the pat ient may be offered the option of undergoing a 
pretreatment procedure (excisional or core tumor biopsy) to obtain an adequate 
tumor sample, provided that his or her disease is easily accessible and tumor 
biopsies can be performed with minimal risk and disc omfort .
If archival tissue is unavailable, a pretreatment tumor biopsy is required.  
Cytological or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable.  Acceptable samples 
include:
Core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue; at least three cores, embedded into a 
single paraffin block, should be submitted for evaluation.
Excisional or incisional tumor biopsy
Tumor tissue resection
4.5.7.2 Optional Tumor Biopsy  on Treatment
An optional biopsy while on treatment is requested on Cycle 1 Day 15 5 days provided 
the patient’s disease is easily accessible and tumor biopsies can be performed with 
minimal risk and discomfort.  
This biopsy is for exploratory research on biomarkers associated with the MAP kinase 
pathway and immune- related pathways, and for DNA and RNA extraction on non -
inherited biomarkers (including, but not limited to cancer -related genes).
4.5.7.3 Tumor Biopsy at Time of Progression
Patients will undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy to obtain a tumor sample at time of 
progression unless not clin ically feasible and provided that their disease is easily 
accessible and tumor biopsies can be performed with minimal risk and discomfort.  
This biopsy is for DNA, RNA, and protein analysis for exploratory research on 
non-inherited (tumor specific) biomar kers included but not limited to studying 
mechanisms of resistance.   NGS will be performed by Foundation Medicine.  W hen 
performed by Foundation Medicine, the investigator can obtain results from the samples 
collected in the form of an NGS report, which is available upon request directly from 
Foundation Medicine.  The investigator may share and discuss the results with the 
patient, unless the patient chooses otherwise.  The Foundation Medicine NGS assay 
has not been cleared or approved by health authorities.  The NGS report is generated

LVEF does not need to be performed at thetreatment discontinuation visit if an 
evaluation has been performed within the last 12 weeks and there are no clinically 
signific ant findings and/or changes from baseline. 
All patients who restart treatment with a reduced dose of cobimetinib because of a 
decrease in LVEF should have LVEF measurements taken after approximately 
2weeks, 4 weeks, 10 weeks ,and 16 weeks and then resume monitoring LVEF 
every 3 cycles.
Any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms suspicious of cardiac failure should 
undergo an LVEF assessment.  Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by the same 
method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly encouraged that the same 
laboratory and operator perform ECHO/MUGA scans for each individual patient.  
Investigators must be aware of local institution regulations regarding repeat MUGA 
scans.  The repeat administration of radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear medicine 
laboratories, and some patients in this study could require monitoring on four or more 
occasions.
4.5.9 Ophthalmologic Examination
All patients will require an ophthalmologic examination at screening and only patients 
receiving cobimetinib (Arm A) will require subsequent ophthalmologic examinations.
Ophthalmologic examination must be performed at the following timepoints:
Screening
Cycle 2 Day 1 1 week
Day 1 of Cycles 5, 8, and 11 (every 3cycles) 2 weeks
Day 1 of Cycles 15, 19, and 23 (every fourtreatment cycles) 2 weeks
Day 1 of Cycles 29, 35, 41, 47, etc. (every sixtreatment cycles) 2 weeks
Treatment discontinuation visit. If an ophthalmologic evaluation has been performed 
within the last 12 weeks of the treatment discontinuation visit, the ophthalmologic 
examination does not need to be performed during the treatment discontinuation 
visit.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
74/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5The objective of baseline ophthalm ologic examination is to evaluate for evidence of 
retinal pathology that may be a risk factor for central serous retinopathy orretinal vein 
occlusion. Ophthalmologic examination must be performed by a qualified 
ophthalmologist. Risk factors for retinal vein occlusion include uncontrolled serum 
cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and glaucoma. Patients 
with such conditions will be excluded from the study as detailed in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Baseline and serial surv eillance ophthalmologic examination will include visual acuity 
testing, intraocular pressure measurements by tonometry, slit -lamp ophthalmoscopy, 
indirect ophthalmoscopy, spectral domain optical coherence tomography , and 
Humphrey Automatic Visual Field using Swedish interactive threshold algorithm 
Fast 10-2 protocol .
4.5.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes
PRO data will be collected via the EORTC QLQ -C30 and twoadditional items from the 
EORTC item bank (see Section 4.5.10.1 )to more fully characterize the clinical pr ofile of 
cobimetinib plus atezolizumab as compared to regorafenib.  In addition, to derive utility 
for pharmacoeconomic models , patients will complete the EQ-5D-5L.  
Thequestionnaires will be translated as required in the local language.  To ensure 
instru ment validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, 
questionnaires scheduled for administration during a clinic visit will be completed in their 
entirety by the patient prior to the performance of non -PRO assessments and the 
administr ation of study treatment (where applicable).
Patients will use an electronic PRO (ePRO) device to capture PRO data at in-person 
clinic visits .  The ePRO device and/or instructions for completing the PRO 
questionnaires electronically will be provided by the investigator staff.  The data will be 
transmitted via a pre -specified transmission method (e.g., web or wireless) automatically 
after entry to a centralized database at the ePRO vendor.  The data can be accessed by 
the appropriate sponsor study personnel securely via the Internet.
The questionnaires will be completed on the ePRO tablet at the beginning of each cycle 
upon arrival at the study clinic during treatment period and at the treatment 
discontinuation visit.Theassessments should continue until loss of clinical benefit and 
then follow the survival follow -up frequency at 3 and 6 months .If the survival follow -up  
study visits are conducted by telephone, the PRO data (the reduced EORTC QLC 30) 
for that visit will be collected via telephone interview and recorded by the investigative 
staff on the ePRO tablet.
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor.

75/Protocol GO30182 , Version 54.5.10.1 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality  of Life -C30 Questionnaire and Additional I tems
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a self -report questionnaire that assesses multiple dimensions 
of HRQoL among cancer patients.  Responses to this 30 -item questionnaire are 
categorized into five functional domains (i.e., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and 
social) (scored on a 4-point Likert sc ale), one global health status domain (scored on a 
7-point Likert scale) ,three symptom domains (i.e., fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain) ,and 
six single items (scored on a 4 -point Likert scale).  Items that assess abdominal bloating 
andabdominal pain that are issued from the validated EORTC item bank will be added 
to the assessment. Each score is transformed into a 0 100-point scale.  In the five 
functional scales and the global health status scale, a high score means a “high level of 
functioning or global health status.”  In the case of symptom scales and single items, a 
higher score implies a “high level of symptoms or problems.”
To maintain validity and minimize patient burden, the EORTC instrument administered 
via telephone interview will consist of a reduced version of the EORTC QLQ items 
(Items 17, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 , 29, and 30 from the C30 and the two additional items 
from the item bank).
4.5.10.2 EuroQo L 5Dimensions
The EQ -5D questionnaire is a generic, preference -based health util ity measure with 
questions about mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression that are used to build a composite of the patient’s health status.  
TheEQ-5D will be utilized in this study for economic modeling.   The EQ -5D 
questionnaire takes 5 minutes or less to complet e.
To maintain validity and minimize patient burden, the EQ -5D-5Linstrument administered 
via telephone interview will consist of the telephone interview version of the EQ -5D-5L.
4.5.11 Timing of A ssessments
4.5.11.1 Screenin g
Screening tests and evaluations will be performed within 35days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  
Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed 
consent and within 35 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used; such tests do not need 
to be repeated for screening.
See Appendix 1for the schedule of screening assessments and Appendix 2for the 
schedule of PK and ATAassessments .
4.5.11.2 On Treatment
All treatment visits must occur within ± 3 days from the scheduled date unless otherwise 
noted (see Appendix 1).  All procedures, tests ,and assessments will be performed on 
the day of the specified visit unless a time window is specified.  Assessments scheduled 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
76/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5on the day of study treatment administration (Day 1) of each cycle shoul d be performed 
prior to study treatment infusion unless otherwise noted.
4.5.11.3 Treatment Discontinuation
Patients who discontinue study treatment will return to the clinic for a treatment 
discontinuation visit within 30 days after the last dose of study treatmen t.  The visit at 
which the investigator determines a loss of clinical benefit may be used as the treatment 
discontinuation visit.  In the event that the decision for discontinuation is due to an 
adverse event and this visit also show sprogressive disease, discontinuation will be 
marked as due to progressive disease.
See the study flowcharts provided in Appendix 1.
Patients who discontinue study treatment must be followed according to the follow -up 
visit schedule for progression and/or survival until death, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal 
of consent, which will be defined as study discontinuation.
4.5.11.4 Follow -Up
After the treatment discontinuation visit, adverse events should be followed as outlined 
in Section 5.6.  For patients who discontinue study treatment fo r reasons other than 
disease progression, tumor assessments should continue to be performed as scheduled 
(i.e., every 8 weeks 1 week) until patient death or documented disease progression .
Survival follow -up should continue until death, withdrawal of con sent, the patient is lost 
to follow -up, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  If the patient 
withdraws from study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county 
records) when permissible, to obtain information ab out survival status only.
See the study flowcharts provided in Appendix 1for assessments to be performed 
during follow -up visits.
4.5.11.5 Unscheduled Visits
Assessments for unscheduled visits related to a patient’s underlying CRC, study 
treatment, or adverse events should be performed as clinically indicated and entered 
into Unscheduled Visit eCRFs.
4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISC ONTINUA TION

5.1 SAFETY PLA N
The risk sassociated with cobimetinib, atezolizumab ,and regorafenib are detailed in 
Section 5.1.1 , Section 5.1.2 , and Section 5.1.3 , respectively.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
79/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.1.1 Risks A ssociated with Cobimetinib
Information related to risks attributed to cobimetinib is based on safety data from 
Phase III Study GO28141 (cobimetinib plus vemurafenib), Phase Ib Study NO25395 
(cobimetinib plus vemurafenib), and Phase I Study MEK4592g (cobimetinib 
monotherapy). For further information regarding clinical safety, please refer to the 
current cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure.
5.1.1.1 Important Identified Risks A ssociated with Cobimetinib
Hemorrhage
Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical 
area o r organ, can occur with cobimetinib. In clinical studies with cobimetin ib, events of 
cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, reproductive tract hemorrhage, 
and hematuria, have been reported.
In the Phase III Study GO28141, Grade 1 4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 13.0% 
of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, and in 7.3% of patients treated 
with placebo plus vemurafenib. Themajority of hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 
and non- serious.  Grade 3 4 hemorrhage events were reported in 1.2% of patients 
receiving cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo plus 
vemurafenib. 
Caution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as brain 
metastases, and/or in patients that use concomitant medications that increase the risk of 
bleeding (includi ng antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy).
Instructions for dose modification for hemorrhage events are included in Appendix 3.
Serous Retinopathy
Serous retinopathy (fluid accumulation within the layers of the retina) has been observed 
in patients treated with MEK -inhibitors, including cobimetinib ( Flaherty etal.2012 ). 
Manifestations of serous retinopathy include visual disturbances, findings of retinal 
detachment, and retinopathy. Serous retinopathy events may also be asymptomatic.
Serous retinopathy has been characterized in the Phase III Study GO28141.  The study 
incorporated prospective serial ophthalmic examinations for all enrolled patients.  Serous 
retinopathy was reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (25.5% vs. 2.8%, respe ctively), and 
approximately half the events were asymptomatic Grade 1 events.  Few patients treated 
with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib experienced Grade 3 ocular events (2.8%); the 
majority of these were managed with dose modification of both cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib.
To address serous retinopathy with cobimetinib treatment, all patients are required to 
undergo a baseline ophthalmologic examination to assess for history or evidence of 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
80/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5retinal pathology that is considered to be a risk factor for or indicative of neurosensory 
retinal detachment, central serous chorioretinopathy , neovascular retinopathy, or 
retinopathy of prematurity. Patients will also undergo ophthalmolog ic examinations at 
specified time points throughout the study (see Appendix 1).Details regarding baseline 
and subsequent ophthalmologic examinations are provided in Appendix 3.
Guidelines for management of patients who develop Grade 2 visual disorders or 
retinopathy are provided in Appendix 3.
Left Ventricular Dy sfunction
Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline has been reported in patients 
receiving cobimetinib. Left ventricular dysfunction may occur with signs and symptoms of 
cardiac failure, or reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction events may be 
asymptomatic.
Left ventricular dysfunction has been characterized in the Phase III Study GO28141.  
The study incorporated prospective serial left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation in all 
patients.   With active surveillance, measured reductions in left ventricular ejection 
fraction were observed more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib ( 8.5% vs. 3.7%, respectively , of Grade 2 or 
3 decrease).  Of the patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, 2patients (0.8%) 
had symptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and the remaining patients 
were asymptomatic.  Most left ventricular ejection fractio n reduction events in patients on 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (62%) improved or resolved with management according 
to the dose -modif ication guidelines (see Appendix 3). 
Rhabdomyolysis and CPK Elevations
Elevations in CPK have been observed in patients who received cobimetinib 
monotherapy as well as when administered with other agents.  The majority of CPK 
elevations reported were asymptomatic, non -serious, and resolved with or without study 
drug interruption.  One event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in t he Phase III 
Study GO28141 (cobimetinib plus vemurafenib), and rhabdomyolysis has been reported 
in postmarketing experience.
In Study GO28141, elevated CPK was reported as an adverse event more frequently in 
patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (32.4% all grades, 11.3% Grade 3 
events) than placebo plus vemurafenib (8.1% all grades, 0% Grade 3 events).  
CPK will be monitored at baseline and monthly during treatment or as clinically 
indicated. Instructions for Dose Modification for elevated CPK and rhabdomyolysis are 
included in Appendix 3.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
81/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Photosensitivity (w hen Administered with Vemurafenib)
No evidence of phototoxicity has been observed with cobimetinib as a single agent. 
However, photosensitivity was observed on the GO28141 trial with a higher frequency in 
the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm versus placebo plus vemurafenib arm (46.3 % vs. 
35.4%, respect ively). The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2, with Grade 3 events 
occurring in 3.6% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm versus 0% in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm. Grade 3 photosensitivity events in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm were primar ily treated with topical medication in conjunction with 
interruption of study agents. 
Pneumonitis
Events of pneumonitis have been reported in cobimetinib clinical studies. Most reported 
events were considered non -serious and l ow-severity grade.  In the Phase III 
Study GO28141, pneumonitis events were reported more frequently in patients treated 
with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (1.6% vs. 0.4%, all 
grades).  There were no reported Grade 3 events i n either study arm.  Serious events 
were reported in 2 patients (0.8%) treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib.   Refer to 
Appendix 3for pneumonitis management guidelines.
5.1.1.2 Potential Risks A ssociated with Cobimetinib
Liver Laboratory Abnormalities and Sev ere Hepatotoxicity
Liver laboratory test abnormalities, including increases in ALT, AST, and alkaline 
phosphatase have been reported as adverse events and serious adverse events in 
patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib.
In the Phase III Study GO28141, liver laboratory test abnormalities reported as Grade 3 
adverse events occurred more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (20.5% vs. 15.1%, respectively) .
Generally, elevations in liver laboratory tests were managed effectively with dose 
modification guidelines.  In both study arms, the majority of Grade 3 liver laboratory test 
abnormalities resolved.   Refer to Appendix 3for hepatotoxicity management guidelines.
Impaired Female Fertili ty and Developmental Toxicity
There is a potential for effects on fertility and embryo- fetal toxicity based on results from 
nonclinical studies. 
While no dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with cobimetinib in animals, 
degenerative changes observed in reproductive tissues included increased 
apoptosis/necrosis of corpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epididymal and vaginal 
epithelial cells in rats, and epididymal epithelial cells in dogs.  These changes were 
reversible upon discontinuation of cobim etinib administration.
In a dedicated embryo -fetal toxicity study, cobimetinib produced fetal toxicity (resorptions 
and reductions in fetal weight), and teratogenicity (malformations of the great vessels 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
82/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5and skull) at similar systemic exposures to those observed in patients administered the 
60mg dose.
5.1.1.3 Other Risks with Cobimetinib
Rash
In the Phase III Study GO28141, combined rash events of all types and grades were 
reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than 
placebo plus vemurafenib (71.7% vs. 66.7%, respectively), although Grade 3 events 
(approximately 16% of patients) and types of rash reported were similar between study 
arms.  Specific events in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib included 
rash (39 % all grades, 5.9% Grade 3, 1.6% serious adverse events) and rash 
maculo -papular (14.6% all grades, 6.3% Grade 3, 1.2% serious adverse events).
Generally, Grade 3 rash events were effectively managed with dose modification 
guidelines.  In Study GO28141, approximately 90% of Grade 3 rash events resolved in 
both arms.   Refer to Appendix 3for rash management guidelines.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity
A range of gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, 
have been report ed in all cobimetinib studies in adult cancer patients.
In the Phase III Study GO28141, diarrhea was the most common adverse event 
reported. Diarrhea events of all severity grades were reported in 59.9% of patients and 
Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 6.5% of patients treated with cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib versus 30.9% (Grade 3) and 0.8% (Grade 4)in the patients treated with 
placebo plus vemurafenib. No Grade 5 events of diarrhea have been reported. Serious 
adverse events of diarrhea were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with cobimetinib 
plus vemurafenib.
Nausea and vomiting have been reported in association with cobimetinib. Most nausea 
and vomiting events were considered non -serious and low -severity grade. In the 
Phase III Study GO28141, nausea and vomiting events were reported more frequently in 
the active cobimetinib arm than the control arm (nausea 41.3% vs. 25.2%; vomiting 24.3% 
vs. 12. 6%). However, of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, few 
experienced Grade 3 events (nausea 0.8%, vomiting 1.2%).
In the Phase I single -agent study (MEK4592g), all grades of nausea and vomiting were 
both reported as 33.9% with 0.9% reported for Grade 3 nausea and none reported for 
vomiting.
The combination of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting has the potential to contribute to 
clinically significant volume depletion/dehydration from the combination of fluid losses 
with decreased oral intake. In the majority of cases, diarrhea has been effectively 
managed with antidiarrheal agents and supportive care. Routine antiemetic prophylaxis 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
83/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5is not recommended. Refer to Appendix 3for gastrointestinal toxicity management 
guidelines.
Hypersensitivity  
There have been few reports of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis in clinical trials with 
patients who have been exposed to cobimetinib monotherapy or cobimetinib when used 
with other agents. These have appeared to be isolated reports, and in some cases, 
occurred in patients with histories of drug allergies. Thus, the relationship of cobimeti nib 
to these events is unclear.
In the Phase III Study GO28141, Grade 3 hypersensitivity events were reported in 
3patients in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm compared with no such events in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm.  All events required hospit alization and treatment with 
steroids. 
Investigators should promptly evaluate and treat patients who are suspected of 
experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction.
5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as IRRs and immune -related hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, 
adrenal insufficiency, Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia 
gravis, meningoencephalitis , myocarditis, and hypophysitis .  In addition, systemic 
immune activation is a potential risk associated with atezolizumab.  Refer to Section 6 of
the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety 
risks for atezolizumab and Appendix 9.
Systemic imm une activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune 
response.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation 
is a potential risk when administered in combination with other immunomodulating 
agents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for 
patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis -like syndrome 
after administration of atezolizumab, and the initial evaluation should include the 
following:
CBC with peripheral smear
PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D -dimer
Ferritin
Triglycerides
AST, ALT, and total bilirubin
LDH
Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
84/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5If systemic immune activation is still suspected after the init ial evaluation, contact the 
Medical Monitor for additional recommendations.
5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Regorafenib
The overall safety profile of regorafenib is based on data from more than 1 200treated 
patients in clinical trials including placebo -controlled Phase III data for 500 patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer and 132 patients wit h gastrointestinal stromal tumo rs. 
Themost serious adverse drug reactions in patients who receiv eregorafenib are severe 
liver injury, hemorrhage, hypertension, dermatologic toxicity, cardiac ischemia and 
infarction, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, and gastrointestinal perforation. 
The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions ( 30%) in patients who receiv e
regorafenib are asthenia/fatigue, hand foot skin reaction, diarrh ea, decreased appetite 
and food intake, hypertension, dysphonia and infection.  
Please refer to the Stivarga(regorafenib) Prescribing Information for complete

Event Action to Be Taken
Other toxicities:  Grade 1 No action required. 
Other toxicities:  Grade 2 No action required
Other toxicities:  Grade 3 or 4 Interrupt dosing of atezolizumab (or cobimetinib if in Arm A)
depending on the attribution of the toxicity, at the discretion 
of the investigator. During this time, treatment may  continue 
with the other non -attributable treatment agent (i.e., either 
the atezolizumab in arm A or B or cobimetinib if in Arm A ). 
If AE resolves to Grade 1 within 1 cycle, then restart dosing 
of the attributable drug (atezolizumab at fixed dose and 
cobimetinib decreased by 1 dose level). 
If the AE does not resolve to Grade 1 within 1 cycle, 
permanently discontinue the attributable dru g. If one drug is 
discontinued dosing of the other drug may continue at the 
discretion of the investigator.
If the Grade 4 AE recurs (a second time), the attributable 
drug should be discontinued. If one drug is discontinued 
dosing of the other drug may continue at the discretion of the 
investigator.
For Grade 3 toxicities associated primarily with laboratory 
abnormalities only, study treatment may continue without 
interruption and/or dose reduction at the discretion of the 
investigator per institutiona l practice.

5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINITIONS
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing 
protocol specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol specified vital 
signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
89/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.2.1 Adverse Events
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the fo llowing:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbati on of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.10
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervent ion, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may j eopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe" and "serious" are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or s evere, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
90/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Intere st (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study 
include the following:
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongifo rm encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a 
patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only when a 
contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Pneumonitis
Colitis
Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, or thyroid 
disease
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Neurologic: Guillain -Barré syndro me, myasthenia gravis, meningoencephalitis
Nephritis
Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, cytokine release, influenza -like illness, 
systemic inflammatory response system, or infusion -reaction syndromes
Retinal vein occlusion
Serous retinopathy ,including events of retinal detachment, retinal pigment 
epithelium detachment, neurosensory retinal detachment ,and c entral serous 
chorioretinopathy
Rhabdomyolysis or Grade 3 CPK elevation
Grade 3 hemorrhage or any grade cerebral hemorrhage
Grade 3 rash

91/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Grade 3 diarrhea
Significant liver toxicity
oAST and/or ALT 10ULN
oCases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT 
or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, 
as defined by Hy’s law (see Section 5.3.5.7): 
Treatment emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with 
either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice, 
without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
No other reason can be found t o explain the combination of 
increased ALT/AST and total bilirubin, such as: liver metastasis; 
viral hepatitis A, B, or C; alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis; 
other liver diseases; or exposure to other drugs known to cause 
liver injury 
Symptomatic heart failure or Grade 3 left ventricular ejection fraction reduction 
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 ), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and 
causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  
Alladverse events, whether repo rted by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study  drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protoco l-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug , all serious adverse events an d Adverse Events of Special 
Interest, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported until 90 days after 
the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  All other adverse events, regardless of rela tionship to study drug, will be 
reported until 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anti -cancer 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
92/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5therapy, whichever occurs first . Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur 
after the adverse event reporting period are pr ovided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will b e used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 7 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.
Table 7Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically
Listed in NCI CTCA E
Grade Severity
1 Mild; as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations

NCI CTCAE National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE v4.0 which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm http://ctep.cancer.g
ov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
aInstrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.
bExamples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
dGrade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
93/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration:
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medication s known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protoco l-mandated therapy.
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
5.3.5.1 Infusion -Relate dReactions
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis 
(e.g., infusion -related reaction ) on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid 
ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should 
be recorded on the dedicated infusion -related reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences 
both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should 
be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also 
recorded separately on the dedicated infusion -related reaction eCRF.
5.3.5.2 Diagnosis vs.Signs and S ymptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation o f signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported a dverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
94/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.3.5.3 Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy a dult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation ti mepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most ex treme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4for reporting instr uctions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
bychanging the event from "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treat ment discontinuation)
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
95/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may n ot qualify as adverse 
events.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.5for details 
on recording persistent adverse events).
5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is t he investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
96/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.5for details 
on recording persistent adverse events).
5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The findin g of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by Hy's law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin)
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
5.3.5.8 Deaths
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed 
by the investigator solely to progression of colorectal cancer should be recorded on the 
Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCR F.  All other on -study deaths, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or c ondition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.   If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by the established cause of death.   The term "sudden death" should not 
be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac 
death").
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
97/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Colorectal Cancer 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v1.1.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical 
progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should 
be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported 
as an adverse event.
5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization
Any adverse event that resul ts in hospitalization (i.e., in- patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:
Hospitalization for respite care
Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study drug administration 
orinsertion of access device for study drug administration)
Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal 
progression of the disease
The patient has not experienced an adverse event
Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
98/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5An event that leads to hospitalization under the followi ng circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours
5.3.5.12 Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not 
itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events 
associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteri a, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
There is no clinical experience with an overdose of cobimetinib and thus no safety data 
related to overdosing are avail able.  Please see the cobimetinib I nvestigator’s Brochure
for more details.
There is no clinical experience with an overdose of atezolizumab and thus no safety data 
related to overdosing are available. Please see the atezolizumab Investigator’s 
Brochure for more details.
The highest dose of regorafenib studied clinically was 220 mg /day. The most frequently 
observed adverse drug reactions at this dose were dermatological events, dysphonia, 
diarrhea , mucosal inflammation, dry mouth, decreased appetite, hy pertension, and 
fatigue. Please see the Stivarga (regorafenib) Prescribing Information for more details.
5.3.5.13 Patient -Reported Outcome Data
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  However, if any PRO responses 
suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, 
the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met 
and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF.

INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must r eport 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 ho urs after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.
5.4.1 Emergency  Medical Contacts
To ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will 
access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide 
medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical 
Responsible (listed above and/or on the Roche Medical Emergency List), and track all 
calls.  The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be available 24 hours per day, 
7days per week.  Toll -free numbers for the Help Desk, as well as Medical Monitor and 
Medical Responsible contact information, will be distributed to all investigators.

5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious A dverse Ev ents and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study  Drug Initiation
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  

Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
100/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Spec ial Interest Reporting Form provided 
to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or 
by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.
5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study  Drug Initiation
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study dru gor initiation of 
another anti -cancer drug, whichever comes first .  Investigators should record all case 
details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the e lectronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the 
EDC system.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provide d to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using 
the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.  
Instructions for reporting post -study adverse events are provided in Section 5.6.
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
5.4.3.1 Pregna ncies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study ,within 5 months after the last dose 
of atezolizumab ,or within 3 months after the last dose of cobimetinib orregorafenib.  
AClinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the 
Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number
or email address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the 
patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious 
adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in 
the mother during or afte r the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the 
child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.   In addition , the investigator will 
submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the 
course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available .  
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
101/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
90days after the last dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form 
should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and 
emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any 
pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  The pregnant partner
will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  After the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when 
update d information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available .  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide 
information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to 
suppor t an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.
5.4.3.3 Abortions
Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  
5.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female pati ent exposed to study 
drug orthefemale partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified 
as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENTS A FTER ADVERSE EVENTS
5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient 
is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to 
follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
102/Protocol GO30182 , Version 55.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from 
hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform 
an independent medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 POST -STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS
After the end of the reporting period for serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest (defined as 90 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of a 
new anti -cancer treatment whichever comes first ), all deaths, regardless of cause, 
should be reported through use of the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up eCRF.  In additio n, 
if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event that is believed to be 
related to prior study drug treatment, the event should be reported through use of the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGA TORS, INST ITUTIONA L REVIEW BOARDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference docu ments:
Cobimetinib Investigator's Brochure
Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure
 Summary of Product C hara cteristics (SPC) for regorafenib (Stivar gaSPC 2017 )
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirem ents will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
This is a randomized, Phase III, global, multicenter, open -label stud y designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and atezolizumab 
monotherapy as compared totreatment with regorafenib in approximately 360 patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
103/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5The efficacy analyses of OS, PFS, and ORR will be performed on all randomized 
patients (i.e., intent to treat [ITT]) irrespective of whether the assigned treatment was 
actually received.  DOR will be assessed in patients who have an objective response.  
For all efficacy analyses, patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization.
The safety population will include all randomized patients who received any amount of 
study drug.  Patients who are randomized into the study but do not receive any amount 
of study drug will not be included in the safety population.  For safety analyses, patients 
will be grouped according to whether any amount of cobimetinib and/or atezolizumab 
was received, including the case when study drug (cobimetin ib and/or atezolizumab) 
was received in error.
Statistical details for all the analyses will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan .
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The study will randomize approximately 360 patients, including a minimum of 
180patients withextended RAS-mutant mCRC (assuming a prevalence of at least 50%) ,
to cobimet inib plus atezolizumab (Arm A), atezolizumab monotherapy (Arm B), and 
regorafenib (Arm C) with the randomization ratio of 2:1:1, respectively.
The type 1 error ( ) for the analysis of the primary endpoint of OS in the comparison of 
cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (Arm A) against the control arm of regorafenib (Arm C) is 
0.05 (2 -sided).  If OS in the comparison of Arm A against Arm C is statistically significant, 
then the OS in the comparison of Arm B against Arm C will be tested at a 2- sided level
of 0.05. 
The sample size of this study is determined on the basis of the number of events 
required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to OS in both comparisons (Arm A vs. 
Arm C an d Arm B vs. Arm C).
The overview of the Type I error ( α) control is shown in Figure 3.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
104/Protocol GO30182, Version 5Figure 3Overview  of Hierarc hical Testing Sequence for Ty peI Errora
Control ( 2-Sided)
OSoverall survival .
aOS will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level  0.05 only if the result of previous testing 
is positive (i.e., statistically significant).  
The estimate of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to OS 
isbased on the following assumptions:
Two-sided significance level of 0.05
Arm A versus Arm C: 87% power to detect an HR of 0.61, corresponding to an 
improvement in median OS from 6.4 months in Arm C to 10.5 months in Arm A
Arm B versus Arm C: 80% power to detect an HR of 0.61, corresponding to an
improvement in median OS from 6.4 months in Arm C to 10.5 months in Arm B 
No interim analysis for OS
Dropout rate of 10% in 24 months
Hierarchical testing of Arm A versus Arm C followed by Arm B versus Arm C to 
control the overall level of 5%
With these assumptions, approximately 360 patients in total will be randomized into this 
study, with approximately 270 patients for the comparison of Arm A versus Arm C and 
approximately 180 patients for the comparison of Arm B versus Arm C.  The OS final 
analysis will be conducted when there are approximately 235 deaths in the study.  This 
is expected to occur approximately 23months after the first patient is randomized.  At 
that time, it is expected that approximately 178 deaths for the comparison of Arm A 
versus Arm C and approximately 127 deaths for the comparison of Arm B versus 
Arm C will have occurred .
This number of events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference in HR of 
approximately 0.73 for the Arm A versus Arm C comparison and approximate ly 0.71 for 
the Arm B versus Arm C comparison.
6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY
Enrollment, study drug administration, and discontinuation from the study will be 
summarized by treatment arm.  The incidence of study drug discontinuation for reasons 
other than disease progression will similarly be tabulated.  Protocol violations, including 

Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
105/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5major violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be summarized in a similar manner by 
treatment arm.
6.3 SUMMA RIES OF TREA TMENT GROUP COMP ARAB ILITY
Demographic characteristi cs, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and baseline disease 
characteristic swill be summarized by treatment arms for the ITT populations.  
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and range) will be presented 
for continuous data, and freque ncies and percentages will be presented for categorical 
data.  Study treatment administration will be summarized by treatment arm for all treated 
patients.
6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES
Unless otherwise noted, all efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients
(ITT analysis), and patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization.
6.4.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint is OS,which is defined as the time (in months) between 
the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause.  Patients who have 
not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the date when they were last known 
to be alive.  
Comparisons with respect to OS between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, 
Arm B vs. Arm C) will be tested based on a stratified log -rank test. The stratification 
factors will be extended RAS mutation status of the tumor and time since diagnosis of 
first metastasis (18 m onths and 18 months) .
Each comparison will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.0 5 within the ITT 
population :
Test to reject the null hy pothesis of no difference in OS between either experimental 
arm (i.e., Arm A or Arm B) and the control arm ( Arm C) in the ITT population. If the 
2sided p -value corresponding to the stratified l og-rank test is less than 0.05 , the 
null hypothesis will be rejected.
The HRfor OS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model.  Two -sided 95% CIs for 
the HRwill be provided. The stratified analyses will incorpora te extended RAS mutation 
status and time since diagnosis of first metastasis as stratification factor s.  Results from 
an unstratified log -rank test and the unstratified HR will also be presented.  K
aplan -Meier 
methodology will be used to estimate median OS for each treatment arm, and the 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be provided.  The Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be 
used to construct the 95% CI for the median OS for each treatment arm 
(Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ).
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
106/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5The comparison between the two experimental arms (Arm A vs. Arm B) will be 
conducted for descriptive purposes.
6.4.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary endpoints include investigator -assessed PFS, ORR, and DOR per 
RECIST v1.1.  The analyses of PFS, ORR, and DOR will take place at the time of the 
OS analysis.
PFS is defined as the time between date of randomization and the date of first 
documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.  Disease progression 
will be determined based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1.  Data from 
patients who have not experienced disease progression or death will be censored at the 
last tumor assessment date and known to be free of disease progression.  Data from 
patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the randomization 
date plus 1day.  Comparisons with respect to PFS between the two treatment arms will 
be tested based on a 2 -sided stratified log -rank test.  The HR for PFS will be estimated 
using a stratified Cox model.  Two -sided 95% CIs for the HR will be provided.   Stratified 
analyses will incorporate the same stratification factors as for the analysis of OS. 
Results from an unstratified log- rank test and the unstratified HRwill also be presented. 
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS for each treatme nt arm, 
and the Kaplan- Meier curves will be provided.
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who had a confirmed objective response of 
CR or PR assessed by the investigator according to the RECIST v1.1.  An estimate of 
ORR and its 95% CI will be calc ulated using the Clopper -Pearson method for each 
treatment arm. 
Treatment difference in ORR will be tested using the stratified 
Cochrane- Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by the same factors used in the OS analysis, 
and a 95% Hauck -Anderson CI will be calc ulated for the difference in ORR between 
treatment arms.
DOR is defined as the period measured from the date of the first occurrence of a CR or 
PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that progressive disease or 
death is documented.  D isease progression will be determined on the basis of 
investigator assessment with use of RECIST v1.1.  DOR will be assessed in patients 
who have an objective response during the study as determined by the investigator with 
use of RECIST v1.1.  Patients who have not progressed and who have not died by the 
date of data cutoff for analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment 
date.  If no tumor assessments were performed after the date of the first occurrence of a 
CR or PR, DOR will be censor ed at the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR plus 
1day.  Median DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and the 95% CI 
will be calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley ( 1982 ).  DOR analysis is 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
107/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5performed on the basis of a non -randomized subset of patients (i.e., patients who 
achieve an objective response); ther efore, formal hypothesis testing will not be 
performed for this endpoint.  
6.5 PATIENT -REPORTED OUTCOMES ANAL YSES
For PROs , the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire and two additional items will be scored 
according to the EORTC Scoring Manual.
The primary analysis population for evaluation of PRO assessments will include patients 
in the ITT population with a baseline PRO assessment and at least one post -baseline 
PRO assessment.
Data from the physical function scale and the global health status/ quality of life will 
be analyzed as a tim e to deteriorat ion, which will be compared as secondary efficacy 
endpoint samong treatment groups with use of the log rank test ( 2-sided). Deterioration 
will be defined as 1) a decrease of 10 point son a transformed 0 to 100 score from 
baseline on the physical function score or the global status/ quality of life scores ,or 
2)death ,or 3) progression .The HR will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model and its 95% CI will be provided. 
Foreach assessment time point and for each treatment arm, the mean (and 95% CI) and 
median (and inter -quartile ranges) of the absolute scores for the EORTC QLQ -C30 and 
additional items and their changes from baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1), will be calculated.  
Exploratory descriptive analyses will be conducted using post -treatment data.
6.6 SAFETY ANAL YSES
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population and will include all 
randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  Summaries will be 
presented for the safety -evaluable population by treatment arm.  For safety analyses, 
patients will be grouped according to whether any amount of atezolizumab or 
cobimetinib was received, including when atezolizumab or cobimetinib was received in 
error. For example, if a patient assigned to Arm C received either cobimetinib or 
atezolizumab in error, this patient will be grouped to Arm A or Arm B, respectively. If a 
patient assigned to Arm A received atezolizumab but no cobimetinib at all, then this 
patient will be grouped to Arm B. 
Study drug exposure, including treatment duration, number of doses, and dose intensity, 
will be summarized for each treatment arm using descriptive statistics.
Verbatim description of adverse events will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms and 
graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.   All adverse events that occur during or after the 
first study drug dose will be summarized by treatment arm and NCI CTCAE grade.  
Inaddition, serious adverse events, severe adverse events (Grade 3, 4, and 5), adverse 
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
108/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5events of special interest, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation or 
interruption will be summarized accordingly.  Multiple occurrences of the same event will 
be counted once at the maximum severity.  The proportion of patients who experience at 
least one adverse event will be reported by toxicity term and treatment arm.
Deaths reported during the study treatment period and those reported during the 
follow -up period after treatment discontinuation will be summarized by tre atment arm.
Laboratory data with values outside the normal ranges will be identified.  In addition, 
selected laboratory data and vitals will be summarized by treatment arm.
6.7 PHA RMA COKINETIC A NALYSES
PK samples will be collected in this study as outlined in Appendix 2.  Cobimetinib and 
atezolizumab maximum and minimum concentration data (C minand C max, respectively ) 
will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, median, range, coefficient 
of variation [CV%], geometric mean and geometric mean coefficient of variation [CVb%]) , 
as appropriate.
Additional PK and pharmacodynamic analyses will be conducted, as appropriate, based 
on the availability of data.
6.8 IMMUNOGENICITY ANALY SES
Patients are considered to have treatment -induced ATA responses if they are ATA 
negative at baseline and then develop an ATA response following study drug 
administration.  Patients are considered to have treatment -enhanced ATA responses if 
they are ATA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post -baseline samples is 
at least 4 -fold greater (i.e., 0.60 titer units) than the titer of the baseline sample.  
Patients are considered to be negative for ATAs if they are ATA negative at all 
timepoints.  Patients are considered to be treatment unaffect edif they are ATA positive 
at baseline but do not have any post -baseline samples with a titer that is at least 4 -fold 
greater than the titer of the baseline sample.
The immunogenicity analyses will include patients with at least one predose and one 
postdo se ATA assessment, with patients grouped according to treatment received
(safety population) .
The number and proportion of ATA-positive patients and ATA-negative patients during 
both the treatment and follow -up periods will be summarized by treatment group .  
Patients are considered to be ATA positive if they have treatment -induced ATA 
responses or treatment -enhanced ATA response s. Patients are considered to be ATA 
negative if they are ATA negative or unaffected by treatment.
The relationship between ATA st atus and safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics will be 
analyzed and reported descriptively via subgroup analyses.   
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
109/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5ATA sampling timepoints are provided in Appendix 2.
6.9 EXPLORA TORY BIOMA RKER ANAL YSES
Exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed in an effort to understand the 
association of these markers with study drug response, including efficacy and/or adverse 
events.  The blood and tumor biomarkers include but are not limited to NGS, PD -L1, and 
CD8, as defined by IHC, qRT -PCR, or other methods.  Additional pharmacodynamic 
analyses will be conducted as appropriate.
7. DATA COLLECTION A ND M AN
AGEMENT
7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of 
eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event o f 
discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites 
will resolve electronically in the EDC system.
The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the 
quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory and other non EDC 
system -captured data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard 
procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data 
will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures.
7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS 
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive t raining and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor .
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.
7.3 ELECTRONIC PA TIENT -REPORTED OUTCOME DA TA
An electronic device will be used to capture PRO data.  The data will be trans mitted to a 
centralized database maintained by the electronic device vendor.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
110/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Once the study is complete, the data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will 
be archived.  The investigator will receive patient data for the site in both human -and
machine- readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the 
study records as source data.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is 
required.  In addition, the Sponsor will receive all data in a machine -readable format on a 
compact disc.
7.4 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate 
and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, mi crofilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly d efined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6.
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow 
inspection by applicable health authorities.
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical obs ervations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  
Anacceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original 
entry of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit 
trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the 
person making the change, and date of the change.

Adverse Events (Arm A)
Note:  For information regarding management of atezolizumab -associated adverse 
events , including infusion -related reactions and immune -related events (e.g., endocrine, 
ocular, pancreatic, and neurologic events) , please refer Appendix 9.
GASTROINTESTINA L TOXICITY
Diarrhea and colitis have been associated with the administratio n of cobimetinib plus 
atezolizumab.
Diarrhea can frequently be managed with anti -diarrheal agents but can also progress to 
clinically significant dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances with effects on other 
organs, possibly resulting in renal, hepatic, and/or cardiac failure.  Patients should be 
instructed to promptly contact the investigators if they develop diarrhea.  Investigators 
should treat diarrhea and intervene promptly for patients who appear to be at increased 
risk of developing significant deh ydration, electrolyte imbalances, and/or multi -organ 
failure.  Patients should receive maximum supportive care per institutional guidelines.
SeeTable 1 for guidelines on how to manage gastrointestinal toxicity in patients treate d 
with cobimetinib plus atezolizumab.

Event Action to be Taken
Gastrointestinal
events:  general 
guidanceAll events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for 
more common etiologies other than drug induced effects.
For events of significant duration or severity or associated with signs 
of sy stemic inflammation or acute phase reactants, check for immune -
related colitis. 
Administer anti -diarrheal agents and other maximal supportive care 
per institutional guidelines such as: at the first report of water y 
diarrhea or loose stool, initiate maximal anti -diarrheal supportive care 
(Lomotil and loperamide).
Suggested regimen: 
oLoperamide: Initiate dose with 4 mg, then 4 mg/6 hr around the 
clock, alternating with Lomotil. 
oLomotil (diphenox ylate and atropine): 2 tablets (diphenoxylate 
5mg, atropine 0.05 mg) every 6 hr around the clock 
oContinue Lomotil and loperamide until no loose stools for 24 
hours. 
oIf Grade 2 diarrhea persists after 48 hr total treatment with 
Lomotil and loperamide, consider second -line agents (e.g., 
octreotide, budesonide, tincture of opium). 
Oral supplementation: 
oInitiate oral supplementation of potassium and/or magnesium if
serum levels are < LLN. 
oConsider oral rehydration therapy (e.g., Pedialyte) for Grade 1 
diarrhea or vomiting. 
Dietary modifications: 
oStop all lactose -containing products and eat small meals. 
oThe BRAT (banana, rice, apples, toast) diet, without fiber (other 
vegetables and fruits), may be helpful. 
oEncourage adequate hydration with salt- containing liquids, such 
as broth or Gatorade.
Diarrhea, Grade 1 or 
Grade 2 (tolerable) )Continue atezolizuma b and cobimetinib.
Initiate supportive care and monitor patient closely
Investigate etiology, referring patient to GI specialist for evaluation of 
possible colitis if appropriate.

140/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5HEPA TOTOXICITY
Hepatoxicity has been associated with the administration of atezolizu mab and 
cobimetinib.  Eligible patients must have adequate liver function, as manifested by 
measurements of total bilirubin and hepatic transaminase, and liver function will be 
monitored throughout study treatment. 
While in this study, patients presenting with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain and/or 
unexplained nausea or vomiting should have liver function tests (LFTs) performed 
immediately and reviewed before administration of the next dose of study drug.
If LFTs increase, neoplastic, concurrent medica tions, viral hepatitis, and toxic etiologies 
should be considered and addressed, as appropriate.  Imaging of the liver, gall bladder, 
and biliary tree should be performed to rule out neoplastic or other causes for the 
increased LFTs.  Anti -nuclear antibody , perinuclear anti -neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, 
anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and anti- smooth muscle antibody tests should 
be considered.
Patients with LFT abnormalities should be managed according to the guidelines i n 
Table 2 .

SYSTEMIC IMMUNE A CTIVATION
Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune 
response.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation 
is considered a potential risk when given in combination with other immunomodulating 
agents.
Recommendations regarding early identification and management of systemic immune 
activation are provided below.  In the event of suspected systemic immune activation, 
atezolizumab should be withheld and the Medical Monitor should be contacted 
immediately for additional guidance.
Early disease recognition is critical, and systemic immune activation shoul d be 
suspected if, in the absence of an alternative etiology, the patient meets two or more of 
the following criteria:
Hypotension that is refractory to aggressive IV fluid challenge
Vasopressor support may be required.
Respiratory distress that requires a ggressive supportive care
Supplemental oxygen and intubation may be required.
Fever 38.5C
Acute renal or hepatic failure
Bleeding from coagulopathy

Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
Version 1.1 1are presented below, with slight modifications and the addition of 
explanatory text as needed for clarity.2
MEA SURA BILITY OF TUM OR AT BASELINE
DEFINITIONS
At ba seline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:
Measurable Tumor Lesions
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5mm)
10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be 
accuratel y measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
20 mm by chest X -ray
Malignant Ly mph Nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
slice thi ckness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on “Baseline 
Documentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions” for information on lymph node 
measurement.
Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm 
orpathological lymph nodes with 10 to 15 mm short axis), as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable inclu de 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not 
measur able by reproducible imaging techniques.

Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.
Bone lesions:
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these 
techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets
the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.
Cystic lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should notbe 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable 
lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection 
as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.
TARGET LESIONS:  SPE CIFICATIONS BY METHODS O F MEA SUREMENTS 
Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never mo re than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.  
Imaging -based evaluation shou ld always be the preferred option.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
158/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Appendix 5
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  Modified Excerpt 
from Original Publication (cont.)
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  
Forthe case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested.
Chest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particul arly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.
CT, MR I.  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  W hen CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable. 
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans 
withintravenous (IV) contra st due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to 
whether a noncontrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the 
patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under 
investigation and the anatomic location of the disease.  For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to 
whether noncontrast CT or MRI (enhanced or nonenhanced) will be performed should 
also be based on the tumor type and th e anatomic location of the disease and should be 
optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be 
discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the p atient should be considered not evaluable from that point 
forward.   Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality 
and interpretation of nontarget disease or new lesions since the same lesion may appear 
to have a different size using a new modality.
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in the assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.
Endoscopy , Laparoscopy , Tumor Markers, Cy tology , Histology .  The utilization of 
these techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.

TUMOR RESPONSE EVA LUATION
ASSESSMENT OF OVERA LL TUMOR BURDEN A ND M EASURA BLE 
DISEA SE
To assess object ive response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least 
onemeasurable lesion, as detailed above.
BASELINE DOCUMENTA TION OF TA RGET A ND NON TARGET LESIONS
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means in instances where patients have only one or two 
organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), 
respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be 
recorded as non -measurable lesions (even if the size is 10mm by CT scan).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but additionally, should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements .  It may be the case that, 
onoccasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, 
inwhich circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected .
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above, pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must me et 
the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes 
will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally 
reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan, this 
is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, 
or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded 
as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm 
but 15mm) should be considered nontarget lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis 
10mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.

from Original Publication (cont.)
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added 
into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
identified as nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare 
cases “unequivocal pr ogression.”
In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as 
a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
RESPONSE CRITERIA
Evaluation of Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.
Complete response (CR) :  disappearance of all target lesions
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have 
reduction in short axis to 10 mm.
Partial response (PR) :  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Progressive disease (PD) :  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diam eters 
oftarget lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), 
including baseline
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
anabsolute increase of at least 5 mm.
The appearance of one or more new lesions i s also considered progression.
Stable disease (SD) :  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study

Special Notes on the A ssessment of Target Lesions
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to 10 mm on study.  This means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero 
even if CR criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis 
10 mm.
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   While in the study, all lesions 
(nodal and non -nodal) that are recorded at baseline should be recorded as actual 
measurements at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at 
baseline become so faint on the CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable 
assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When 
this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows:
If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
themeasurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and below measurable limit (BML) should 
be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rulewill be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are freq uently surrounded by fat such 
as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and 
isfaintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked. ) 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non -nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may 
bemaintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of 
eachindividual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.

Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of nontarget lesions.  While some nontarget lesion s may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.
CR:  disappearance of all nontarget lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor 
marker level)
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non- PD:  persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or (if 
applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
PD:  unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
Special Notes on A ssessment of Progression of Nontarget Disease
When the Patient A lso Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting, to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsening in nontarget disease in a magnitude that, even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit disconti nuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or 
more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in nontarget 
disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
Cobimetinib plus A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
163/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Appendix 5
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  Modified Excerpt 
from Original Publication (cont.)
When the Patient Has Only  Non -Measurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in
some Phase III studies when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease.  The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this 
instance, there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of 
anincrease in non- measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in nontarget 
disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition:  if all lesions are truly non -measurable), 
a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is 
to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -
measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required 
to declare PD for measurable disease, that is, an increase in tumor burden representin g 
an additional 73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter 
in a measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” 
to“large” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespre ad or may 
bedescribed in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.”  If unequivocal 
progression is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that 
point.  W hile it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non- measurable 
disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the 
increase must be substantial.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion an d will indicate disease progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.

EVALUATION OF RESPON SE
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)
It is assume d that at each protocol -specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs.  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each timepoint 
for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.
When patients have non- measurable (therefore nontarget) disease only , Table 2 is to be 
used.

a“Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for nontarget 
disease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy  in some studies ; thus, assigning “stable disease” 
when no le sions can be measured is not advised.
Missing A ssessments and Not -Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are mad e at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) 
would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be mos t likely to happen 
in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three 
measured lesions and, during the study, only two lesions were assessed, but those gave 
a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, regardl ess of the contribution 
of the missing lesion. 
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done 
or the scan could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the 
response for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more nontarget lesions are not assessed, the response for 
nontarget lesions should be “unable to assess” except where there is clear progression.  
Overall response would be “unable to assess” if either the target response or the 
nontarget response is “unable to assess,” except where this is clear evidence of 
progression as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that timepoint.

SDstable disease.
aIf a CR is truly met at the first timepoint, any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, 
even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, qualifies as PD at that point 
(since disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether 
the minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes CR may  be claimed when 
subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had 
PR, not CR, at the first timepoint.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR and the best response is PR.
Special Notes on Response A ssessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size ( 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.

167/Protocol GO30182 , Version 5Appendix 5
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  Modified Excerpt 
from Original Publication (cont.)
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective respo nse; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target 
and nontarget disease as shown in Table s Table 1 ,Table 2 , and Table 3 .
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled ass essment progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.
In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e., primary disease still 
or partially present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or nontarget 
lesion, as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of complete response if 
theprimary tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or nontarget lesion.

Risks Associated with Atezolizumab and Guidelines for 
Management of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab 
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogen ic etiology.
Although most immune -related adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of 
atezoli zumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, 
immune -related toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, 
systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents. 
The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may be 
experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab.  In patients who have met 
the criteria for permanent discontinuation, resumption of atezolizumab may be 
considered if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the 
immune -related event.  Patients can be re -challenged with atezolizumab only after 
approval has been documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and 
the Medical Monitor. 
DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab in this study.
TREATMENT INTERRUPTI ON
Atezolizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing 
toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for 
treatme nt of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1month to 10mg/day oral 
prednisone or equivalent before atezolizumab can be resumed.  If atezolizumab is 
withheld for 105 days after event onset, the patient will be discontinued from 
atezolizumab.  Howe ver, atezolizumab may be withheld for 105 days to allow for 
patients to taper off corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab can be 
resumed after being withheld for 105 days if the Medical Monitor agrees that the 
patient is likely to de rive clinical benefit.  Atezolizumab treatment may be suspended 
for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with Medical Monitor 
approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine the acceptable 
length of treatment interrupt ion.

PULMONARY EVENTS
Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates have been 
associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will also have computed 
tomography ( CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, 
pulmonary embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or 
pulmonary hypertension.   Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided 
in Table 1 .

Immune -related hepatitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.   
Eligible patients must have adequate liver function, as manifested by measurements of 
total bilirubin and hepatic transaminases, and liver function will be monitored 
throughout study treatment.  Management guidelines for hepatic events are provided in 
Table 2 .
Patients with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain and/or unexplained nausea or 
vomiting should have liver function tests (LFTs) performed immediately and reviewed
before administration of the next dose of study drug.
For patients with elevated LFTs, concurrent medication, viral hepatitis, and toxic or 
neoplastic etiologies should be considered and addressed, as appropriate.

Immune -related colitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Management guidelines for diarrhea or colitis are provided in Table 3.
All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for other more common 
etiologies.  For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of 
systemic inflammation or acute -phase react ants (e.g., increased C -reactive protein, 
platelet count, or bandemia):  Perform sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) 
with colonic biopsy, with three to five specimens for standard paraffin block to check for 
inflammation and lymphocytic infiltra tes to confirm colitis diagnosis.

ENDOCRINE EVENTS
Thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and pituitary disorders have 
been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  Management guidelines for 
endocrine events are provided in Table 4 .
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgias, impotence, 
constipation, or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of 
thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopathies.  The patient should be referred to an 
endocrinologi st if an endocrinopathy is suspected.  Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) 
and free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels should be measured to determine whether 
thyroid abnormalities are present.  Pituitary hormone levels and function tests (e.g., 
TSH, grow th hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulating hormone, testosterone, 
prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels, and ACTH stimulation test) 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed pituitary sections)

Immune -related myocarditis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -related myocarditis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not 
limited to, dyspnea, ches t pain, palpitations, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or 
syncope.  Immune -related myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis 
resulting from infection (commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history 
of gastrointestinal il lness), ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of 
preexisting cardiac conditions, or progression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing 
cardiac enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac 
MRI as appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  
An endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 6.

No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) with Cycle 1 of 
atezolizumab may receive premedication with a ntihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics 
(e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in 
treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 7 .  
For subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.

Immune -related meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the 
administration of atezolizumab.  Immune -related meningoencephalitis should be 
suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or 
encephalitis, including, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, 
motor or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness.  
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningo encephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.  
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated 
with a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, 
or edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an 
identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 11 .

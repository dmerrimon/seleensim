9k.Treatment with lithium at screening or planned during the study.
l.[New criterion] Participation in an interventional clinical study within 30 days or 5half-lives of the 
investigational product before enrollment , whichever is longer .
Study Drug Dose, Mode of A dministration, and Administration Rate: Tbo-filgrastim is a biosimilar of Neupogen 
filgrastim, a human G -CSF. Patients will receive subcutaneous doses of tbo -filgrastim 5 μg/kg body weight daily; each 
dailydose will be taken from a vial containing 300 µg/mLtbo-filgrastim. The first dose of tbo -filgrastim will be 
administered after24hours (±3 hours) following the end of myelosuppressive CTX in week1 of the studycycle1. 
Daily dosing with tbo -filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadi r is passed and the neutrophil count 
has recovered to 2.0 ×109/L but not longer than on 14 consecutive days. A transient increase in neutrophil counts is 
typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of tbo -filgrastim therapy follow ed by the chemotherapy in duced nadir . 
Method of Blinding and Randomization: open-label, no blinding
Duration of Participation: The maximum duration of the study for an individual patient (from screening period until 
the end of the 90-dayfollow-up period) w ill be approximately 1 8weeks.
General Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and immunogenicity of tbo-filgrastim at a dose of 5 μg/kg/day in 
infants, children and adolescents with solid tumors scheduled to receive at least 1 cycle of CTX .
The study will include 3 groups stratified by age: 1 month to <2 years; 2 to <12 years; 12 to <16 years. Recruitment of 
subjects in the youngest age stratum (1 month to <2 years) will begin only once safety (from the start of study to CTX-
day21) and pharmacodynamic (from the start of study t o day15 [relative to first tbo -filgrastim administration]) results 
are available for a minimum of 6 subjects in the middle age stratum group andhave been reviewed by the Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) and no significant safety signals that prevent recruitment in the youngest age stratum 
have been detected.
Safety Variables an d Endpoints: The primary outcome variables and endpoints for this study are safety evaluations. 
The safety of tbo -filgrastim will be assessed by evaluating the following :
adverse event reports throughout the study
clinical laboratory test results at screen ing and at the end -of-study visit
vital signs measurements (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature) at screening, 
throughout the study treatment ,and at the end -of-study visit
electrocardiography findings at screening, pre -dose,and 4 and 6hours after the first tbo -filgrastim 
administration, and at the end -of-study visit
physical examination results at screening and at the end -of-study visit
concomitant medication usage throughout the study
local tolerability at the injection si te at 1hour (±30 minutes) after each study drug injection
spleen sonography assessments at screening, on day4 of tbo-filgrastim treatment, at the end -of-study visit ,
and if the patient reports left upper abdominal and/or shoulder tip pain
anti-drug antib odyassessment prior to the first tbo -filgrastim administration ,at the end-of study visit ,and 
at 30days and 3months after the last tbo -filgrastim study drug treatment in the first cycle . 
survival at 90dayfollow-up.

211. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1. Introduction 
Although cancer differs between adults and the pediatric population regarding incidence and cancer 
type, chemotherapy  (CTX) has become a cornerstone of anti- cancer therapy  in both popul ations. 
Intensive chemotherapeutic regimens have contributed to an increase in long -term disease -free 
survival in both adult and pediatric patients over the past decades. 
CTX can cause a decrease in the counts of neutrophils in the peripheral blood, a sid e effect termed 
“chemotherap y-induced neutropenia”. This important side effect occurs in more than 1 out of 
3patients receiving CTX for cancer, and increases the chance of infection as well as the 
development of fever. In cases of severe CTX -induced neutr openia, life -threatening gastrointestinal 
and pulmonary  infections may  occur, as may  sepsis. In addition to the increased risk of infections, 
CTX-induced neutropenia may  also lead to chemotherapy  cycle delay as well as chemotherapy  dose 
reductions in subse quent cycles, thereby  potentially  affecting the efficacy  outcomes intended from 
the CTX administration. 
In the pediatric population, CTX- induced neutropenia is the primary  dose-limiting toxicity  in 
patients receiving m yleosuppressive chemotherap y(te Poele et al 2005 ).The definitions of 
neutropenia in children older than 1 year are the same as those for adults (Segel and Haltermann 
2008),and the risk factors are also consistent with those id entified in the adult population.
Children receiving intensive CTX regimens have a 6 times greater chance of developing sepsis than 
those receiving more conservative and less intensive regimens (Mendes et al 2007). Many risk
factors have been identified for CTX- induced neutropenia and its serious medical complications, 
and several risk models have been developed (Lyman et al 2005 ).In pediatric patients, higher bod y 
temperature, prolonged neutr openia, a low monocy te count, and shock are predictive factors for the 
occurrence of bacter emia. 
Endogenous growth factors regulate the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells within 
the bone marrow and the release of mature neutrophils into the peripheral blood. They  restore the 
number of neutrophils and keep it above the critical level (Holmes et al 2002 ).Recombinant 
granulocy te colony-stimulating factors (G -CSFs) have been developed and are part of standard
management for patients receiving intensive CTX at high risk of CTX -induced neutropenia. Current 
standard treatments for prevention of CTX -induced neutropenia, both in adult and pediatric 
populations, include recombinant human G- CSFs (filgrastim, Neupogen , Amgen [also biosimilars]), 
which have proven to add clinical benefit both as primary  prophylaxis following the administration 
of high risk CTX when severe neutropenia is anticipated, as well as following retreatment with 
CTX after a previous cy cle of CTX caused febrile neutropenia ( FN; secondary  prophylaxis). 
Filgrastim has also been shown to shorten the duration of severe CTX -induced neutropenia without 
fever(Goodwin et el 1998 ).
G-CSF, an endogenous growth factor, regula tes the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor 
cells within the bone marrow and the release of mature neutrophils into the peripheral blood. G -CSF 
is a positive regulator of granulopoesis, acting at different stages of m yeloid cell development. It
enhances the effector functions of normal mature neutrophils, including chemotaxis, phagocy tosis,
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
22and oxidative metabolism. I t exerts its effects via a high -affinity G-CSF-specific receptor 
mechanism, which accounts for its selective action as compared wi th many other cytokines.The 
natural human G -CSF is a gl ycoprotein composed of a single poly peptide chain of 174 or 177 
amino acids.
The bacterially  synthesized non -glycosylated recomb inant methiony l form of human G -CSF 
(r-metHuG-CSF) was approved by  the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)in 
1991 under the international nonproprietary  name (INN)filgrastim. I t is used for reducing the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of FNin patients undergoing my elosuppressive CTX for 
malignant diseases and for reducing the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing 
myeloablative therap y followed by  bone marrow transplantation and who are at risk of prolonged 
severe neutropenia. It is further used to mobiliz e peripheral blood stem cells as monotherap y or 
after myelosuppressive CTX. Finally it is indicated in long -term treatment of severe congenital, 
cyclical,or idiopathic neutropenia or neutropenia associated with advanced human 
immunodeficiency  virus (HIV)infection.
Filgrastim was examined in a number of clinical trials investigating its efficacy  in the treatment of 
neutropenia caused b y cancer therap y. Administration of filgrastim was shown to increase absolute 
neutrophil counts(ANC)and to decrease the duration of neutropenia, the day s of hospitalization,
and the number of infections. Therapy with filgrastim allowed the development of dose -intense 
regimens for the treatment of malignancies.
The presentpostmarketing study is designed to investigate the pharmacology  and clinical effects of
tbo-filgrastim (the investigational product in this study whichhas been approved as a biosimilar to 
filgrastim [Neupogen] in the European Union [ EU], under the product names Tevagrastim, 
Ratiograstim and Biograstim [I NN: filgrastim], and has the Teva pro duct code XM02-i t has been 
approved under the product name Granix (tbo-filgrastim) in the US via a Biologic License 
Application [BL A]. To retain a consistent nomenclature throughout this protocol that distinguishes 
the investigational product from filgra stim [Neupogen], the investigational product is termed 
“tbo-filgrastim” throughout) in children aged 1 month to <16 years with solid tumors without bone 
marrow involvement, who are scheduled to receive my elosuppressive CTX. The study  was 
requested b y the FDAto meet the requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity  Act (21 U.S.C. 
355c) and section 505B (a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The study will be 
performed in conformit y with the I nternational Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) E6guidance.
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product
Tbo-filgrastim (also known as XM02) is a non -glycosylated r-metHuG-CSF expressed in 
Escherichia coli,and has a molecular weight of 18,798.98Daltons. Tbo-filgrastim was developed 
as a biosimilar to filgr astim, the active substance in EU-sourced Neupogen.
Tbo-filgrastim was approved by theEuropean Medicines Agency in September 2008, and is 
indicated for reducing the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of FNin patients treated with 
established cy totoxic CTXfor malignancy  (with the except ion of chronic my eloid leuk emia and 
myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients
undergoing my eloablative therapy  followed by  bone marrow transplantation considered to b e at 
increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
23Tbo-filgrastim was also approved b y the FDA in August 2012, indicated for reduction in the 
duration of severe neutropenia (DSN)in adult patients with non- myeloid malignancies receiving 
myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically  significant incidence of FN.
Tbo-filgrastim is administered by  the subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) routes in the EU and 
SC in the US .
1.3. Findings From Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies
The affinities of tbo-filgrastim and Neupogen forhuman G-CSF receptors were similar, andthe 
binding was specific and dose -dependent. In 2in vitro experiments with the cell line M-NFS-60, 
tbo-filgrastim and Neupogen induced half -maximum and maximum cell proliferation at similar 
concentrations.
Estimates of the relative potency  in the cyclophosphamide -induced neutropenia model in mice 
indicated that tbo-filgrastim and Neupogen induce neutrophilia to a similar extent. The 
pharmacod ynamic effects of tbo-filgrastim in monkey safter IV and SC administration were 
comparable. Tbo-filgrastim did not exhibit any  tumor growth -promoting activity  on human tumor 
cell lines and did not differ from Neupogen in that respect.
In safety pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of tbo -filgrastim in vivo on the cardiovascular 
system in dogs, on the respiratory  system in rats, and on the central nervous sy stem in rats, no 
adverse effects were recordedafter single SC administration of 3500 μg/kg, a dose 700-f old greater 
than the human dose .
Overall the kinetics of tbo-filgrastim in rat plasma remained unchanged following repeated SC 
dosing.
The pharmacokinetic profile of tbo -filgrastim was determined in the C ynomolgus monkey 
following single IV or SC injections. A slightly  lower area under the drug concentration by  time 
curve (AUC)following SC administration compared to IV administration was noted. The difference
was, however, not significant.
A single SC injection of 3500μg/kg tbo-filgrastim to rats, 700 -fold greater than the human dose, 
was not associated with any  evidence of toxicity .
A multiple dose toxicity  study in the rat using SC tbo-filgrastim revealed the following target 
organs: bone marrow, fore and hind limbs/paws and joints/tar sus,mesenteric ly mph nodes, spleen,
and thymus. An increase in white blood cell (WBC)countconcomitant with a change in 
lymphocyte count, extramedullary  hematopoesis in the spleen,and myeloid hypercellularity  in the 
bone marrow were observed, effects th atare considered to be linked to the pharmacod ynamic 
effects of tbo-filgrastim . Elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase were consistent with the 
increased bone formation observed. Osteoarthritis was observed in the tarsal joints. I n the majority  
of samplesanalyzed, antibody  titers produced against tbo-filgrastim were not detected.
Subcutaneous injections of tbo-filgrastim up to 125μg/kg/day  for 26weeks to the monkey were 
generally well tolerated. Effects on hematology parameters, organ weight changes and macroscopic 
and microscopic findings were considered to reflect the pharmacological activity  oftbo-filgrastim . 
Elevations in alk aline phosphatase were observed in high dose animals concomitant with an 
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
24increased bone turnover observed histopathologically . Bilateral bone cortical thickening and 
proliferative h yperostosiswerenoted in single animals at the high dose. In the vehicle g roup, 
occasional ventricular extrasy stoles occurred in 2 animals and are known to occur spontaneously  in 
the monkey . Test article action can thus be ruled out. Antibodies were present in all treated groups 
from the first determination in week 4,increased in week12,and returned to lower levels in 
week26. Exposure to the drug was slightl y higher in males. A slight decrease in tbo-filgrastim 
plasma elimination over time was observed.
Local tolerance studies were performed in the rabbit. The results suggest edthat tbo-filgrastim can 
be safely administered to humans by  the SC and IV routes.Erroneous maladministration is 
considered to cause no local intolerance.
The mutagenic potential of r- metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) was evaluated in vivo as wellas in vitro. 
R-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) was found to be not mutagenic. No additional mutagenicity  tests were 
performed on tbo-filgrastim .
There is no evidence for carcinogenicity  of any G-CSF product. Reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies were not performed on X M02.
A 28-day study compared the immunogenicit y of SCadministered tbo-filgrastim andNeupogen in 
rats at doses of up to 125μg/kg/day . The stud y drugs were generally well tolerated. During the 
treatment period known pharmacod ynamic effects of tbo-filgrastim and Neupogen were seen (ie,
increased neutrophil counts, enlarged spleen and increases in spleen weights, andincreased al kaline 
phosphatase activity ). Most changes had subsided at the end of the treatment -free period. All 
changes observed were attributed to the direct and adaptive responses of the organism to the 
massiveneutrophilic impulse given b y G-CSF and are usuall y observed after G -CSFadministration. 
The plasma concentrations revealed a dose -related exposure of the animals to tbo-filgrastim and 
Neupogen following SC injection. Toxicokinetic parameters were similar between sexes. The AUC 
values point to a slightly  decreased clearance with time and, hence, a slight accumulation with time 
for the high- dose. All findings noted were caused by  the pharmacod ynamic effect of the test item. 
Therewere no differences in the safet y profile with respect to pharmacod ynamic effects or toxicity 
between tbo- filgrastim and Neupogen . The immunogenicity  of tbo-filgrastim andNeupogen was 
comparable for all employed test assay s. The percentage of samples positive for antibodies against 
both study  drugs, the median and the maximal values pe r treatment group exhibited a time -and 
dose-dependent increase. Eleven percent of all samples were considered as antibody -positive. Based 
onthe results of this trial, it can be concluded that the immunogenicit y of tbo-filgrastim and
Neupogen is comparabl e.
1.3.2. Clinical Studies
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology and Efficacy Studies
Two single -blind, randomized, 2-way crossover, single -dose studies were performed in healthy  
male subjects and in healthy  male and female subjects to compare the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacod ynamicprofiles of tbo -filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen ( StudyXM02-01-LT and 
StudyXM02-05-DE).
The first study  compared the pharmacod ynamicand pharmacokinetic parameters of tbo-filgrastim
and EU-sourced Neupogen in healthy  male volunteers, when both tre atments were administered SC 
at 5 or 10 µg/kg.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
25Overall, the stud y results demonstrate that tbo-filgrastim is bioequivalent to the reference 
formulation filgrastim (Neupogen) with respect to the ANC time profile and the rate and the extent 
of absorption of G-CSF.
The second stud y compared the pharmacod ynamicand pharmacokinetic parameters of 
tbo-filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen in healthy  male and female volunteers, when both 
treatments were administered at 5 or 10 µg/kg by the IV or by the SC route.
Overall, the study  results demonstrate that tbo-filgrastim is bioequivalent to the reference 
formulation filgrastim ( EU-sourced Neupogen) with respect to the ANC time profile, the CD34+ 
count time profile, and the rate and the extent of absorption of G -CSF.
Five and 10µg/kg treatments of tbo -filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen appear to be comparable 
with respect to the safet y profile after single dosing b y both the IV and the SC route.
Three multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase3studies wer e performed in patients 
with breast cancer ( StudyXM02-02-INT), small -cell or non -small-cell lung cancer 
(StudyXM02-03-INT),and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( StudyXM02-04-INT) receiving CTX .
In the stud y in breast cancer patients ( StudyXM02-02-INT), mean DSN i n cycle1 was 1.1 days for 
patients treated with tbo-filgrastim or filgrastim (EU-sourced Neupogen) and 3.9days for patients 
receiving placebo. In the subsequent cy cles, where all patients received tbo-filgrastim or filgrastim, 
mean DSN ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 days. For patients receiving tbo -filgrastim or filgrastim, the ANC 
values distinctly  increased after start of treatment, reaching a maximum on day3 and then 
decreased to a nadir on day7. Thereafter, ANC values increased again, reaching a maximum on 
day11. By the end of the cy cle on day21, mean values returned to values as observed on day1.
The pharmacokinetic profiles of tbo -filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-sourced Neupogen) are similar ,
and t½values correspond to published data on filgrastim. N o accumulation was observed for either 
filgrastim or tbo-filgrastim.
In summary , treatment with tbo-filgrastim was beneficial in ameliorating severe neutropenia in 
breast cancer patients receiving m yelosuppressive CTX. The assay  sensitivity  with respect to the
DSN in cy cle1 for tbo-filgrastim versus placebo was confirmed. Tbo- filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-
sourced Neupogen) were significantl y more effective than place bo in reducing the DSN in cycle1 
of CTXin patients with breast cancer. Tbo-filgrastim was equally effective as fil grastim in reducing 
the DSN in cycle1 of CTXin patients with breast cancer. Tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim had a 
similar effect on the incidence of FNand the time to ANC recovery . Finally, tbo-filgrastim and 
filgrastim had similar pharmacokinetic profiles.
The pharmacokinetic profiles of tbo -filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-sourced Neupogen) in patients 
with lung cancer (StudyXM02-03-INT) were similar and correspond to data on filgrastim in the 
product information. No accumulation was o bserved for either filgrastim or tbo-filgrastim.
With regard to efficacy , which was investigated in an explorative manner in this safety  study, there 
were no statisticall y significant differences between tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim with respect to the 
most important efficacy  variables, DSN ,and incidence of FN. 
It is concluded that tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-sourced Neupogen) have similar effects with 
regard to DSN and the incidence of FNin cycle1 during CTX in patients with lung cancer, as 
demonstrated for the breast cancer patients.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
26The pharmacokinetic profiles of tbo -filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-sourced Neupogen) in patients 
with Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma ( StudyXM02-04-INT) were similar and correspond to data on 
filgrastim in the product informat ion. No accumulation was observed for either filgrastim or 
tbo-filgrastim. 
With regard to efficacy , which was onl y investigated in an explorative manner in this safet y study, 
there were no statistically  significant differences between tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim (EU-sourced 
Neupogen) in cycle1 with respect to the DSN, the incidence of FN, ANC nadir , and the time to 
ANC recovery . It is concluded that tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim have similar effects with regard to 
the DSN, the incidence of FN, ANC nadir ,and the time to ANC recovery  during CTX in cycle1.
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety Studies
Single SC injections and IV doses of 5 µg/kg and 10 µg/kg tbo-filgrastim and EU-sourced 
Neupogen have been studied in healthy  male and female subjects (StudyXM02-01-LTand 
StudyXM02-05-DE).
Tbo-filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen were found to be safe and well tolerated in these studies. 
Headache and my algia as well as skeletal pain in the first study  and back pain in the second study 
were the most frequent adverse eventsrelated to the investigational product. These adverse events
wereof mild to moderate intensity . Based on clinical observations, no difference was observed after 
a single SC or IV dose between the stud y drugs tbo-filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen with 
respect to their safet y profile. Further, no difference was observed between the 5 and 10 µg/kg 
treatment groups.
Three multinational, multicente r, randomized, controlled Phase3studies were performed in patients 
with breast cancer (StudyXM02-02-INT), small-cell or non-small-cell lung cancer 
(StudyXM02-03-INT),and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (StudyXM02-04-INT).
In 112 (32.2%) patients with breast cancer receiving CTX(StudyXM02-02-INT), a total of 
294treatment -emergent adverse events were considered as possibl y studydrug-related. Of these, 6
were consi deredsevere in 6 (1.7%) patients. Two possibly  study drug-related serious adverse event s 
occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients: hy persensitivity  (allergic reaction with bronchospasm) of severe 
intensity (tbo-filgrastim group) and syncope of severe intensit y (placebo /tbo-filgrastim group in 
cycle3). Three (3) patients (0.9%) discontinued the study  due to a possibly  study drug-related 
treatment -emergent adverse event.
The most commonly  observed possibl y drug-related treatment -emergent adverse events were bone 
pain (10.3%), asthenia (7.8%), my algia (6.3%), and diarrhea (5.2%). In general, possibly drug -
related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred earl y in the stud y, ie,they were reported within 
15days after study  start and within the first 4 days of a cycle.
There were 6 cases of injection sit e reactions during the stud y (2 in the tbo-filgrastim group, 3 in the 
filgrastim group, and 1 in the placebo/tbo -filgrastim group).
In 50(21.5%) patients with lung cancer receiving CTX(StudyXM02-03-INT), a total of 
111treatment -emergent adverse event s were considered as possibl y study drug -related. Of these, 
16were considered severe in 11 (4.6%) patients. There were 4 possibl y study drug- related serious 
adverse event s in 3(1.3%)patients, which were also considered related to CTX. Ten patients 
(4.2%) discontinued the stu dy due to a possibl y study drug-related treatment -emergent adverse 
event.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
27The most commonly reported possibly  drug-related treatment -emergent adverse event s were 
myalgia (2.1%), back pain (2.1%), anemia (2.1%) ,and headache (2.1%). Possibly  drug-related 
treatment -emergent adverse event s were expe rienced earl y in the study, ie ,they were reported 
within 20 days after study start, or within 6 days after start of a cy cle. All cases of anemia possibly  
related to stud y drug were also reported to be possibly  related to CTX.
There were 2 cases of injection site reactions during the stud y.
In summary , tbo-filgrastim was safe and well tolerated in patients with lung cancer r eceiving CTX.
In 63(68.5%) pa tients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma receiving CTX(StudyXM02-04-INT), a 
total of 310 treatment -emergent adverse event s were considered possibly CTX-related. Of these, 
20were considered severe in 13 (14.1%) patients. There were 16 possibl y CTX-related serious 
adverse event s in 12(13.0%) patients, and 4 (4.3%) patients discontinued the study due to a 
possibly CTX-related treatment -emergent adverse event .
Most frequentl y reported possibly  drug-related treatment -emergent adverse e vents (preferred term) 
were bone pain (9.8%) and arthralgia (4.3 %). Possibly  drug-related treatment -emergent adverse 
events were experienced earl y in the stud y, ie,they were reported within 20 days after study  start, or 
within 4days after start of a cy cle.
There were 2 cases of injection site reactions during the stud y.
In summary , tbo-filgrastim was safe and tolerated in patients with Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma in the 
doses applied in this study .
Possibly drug-related serious adverse event s observed in these s tudies were hy persensitivity  
(allergic reaction with bronchospasm), s yncope of severe intensit y, myocardial infarction, 
thrombocy topenia,and hyperuricemia.
The development of antibodies against tbo-filgrastim and EU-sourced Neupogen was investigated 
in the 3cancer patient studies. Overall, the incidence of binding and neutralizing antibodies was 
low and similar between the treatment groups. Excluding implausible test results, only  one 
borderline positive neutralizing test sample w as found at the antibody  follow-up visit(Ratiograstim 
Assessment Report 2008). In addition, it can be stated that no clinical signs of a possible 
neutralizing effect c aused by antibodies were observed in an y patient. There were no 
immunogenicit y findings of clinical relevance which had “major consequences for efficacy  and 
safety”.
According to the US prescribing information for tbo-filgrastim and the prescribing information for 
US Neupogen, the mo st common adverse drug reaction for filgrastim in can cer patients isbone pain 
(in 3.4% of treated patients). Potential serious adverse reactions are splenic rupture, acute 
respiratory  distress s yndrome, allergic reactions ,alveolar hemorrhage and hemopty sis,and severe 
sickle cell crises in patients with si ckle cell disease. The possibility that tbo- filgrastim acts as a 
growth factor for an y tumor type cannot be excluded.
Very common (>1 0%) treatment -emergent adverse event s observed during CTX(with or without 
filgrastim treatment) were n ausea, vomiting, and γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase, lactate deh ydrogenase, 
alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid increases, as well as chest pain and musculoskeletal pain. 
Common treatment -emergent adverse event s (1%-10%) are alopecia, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, 
mucositis, headach e, generalized weakness, cough, skin rash, throat pain ,and constipation. Pain of 
unknown etiology  is observed in <1% of patients ,and vascular function disturbances are observed

28in <0.1% of patients. Allergic reactions, deterioration of rheumatoid arthrit is, pulmonary  infiltrates, 
Sweet syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis ,and urinary  abnormalities are seen in < 0.01% of patients.
Further adverse effects of G-CSFsare reported in healthy  subjects undergoing peripheral stem cell 
mobilization (headache, musculoske letal pain, leukocy tosis, thrombocy topenia, increase in alkaline 
phosphatase and lactate dehy drogenase, severe allergic reactions, spleen disorder, increased levels 
of aspartate aminotransferase ( AST), hyperuricemia and deterioration of arthritic sy mptoms,rupture 
of the spleen in very  rare cases, in some cases lethal), in patients with severe chronic neutropenia

1.3.3. Postmarketing Safety Data
In the postmarketing experience in normal donors, in Europe, pulmonary  adverse events 
(hemopty sis, pulmonary  hemorrhage, lung infiltration, dy spnea,and hypoxia) have been reported. 
Transient cy togenic modifications have been observ ed in normal donors following G -CSF use. The 
significance of these changes in terms of the development of hematological malignancy  is 
unknown. L ong-term safety  follow-up of donors is ongoing. A risk of promotion of a malignant 
myeloid clone can not be excluded.
In the latest Periodic Safety  Update Report covering the period 01April2012 to 31March2013 it is 
concluded tha t the general benefit- risk ratio of filgrastim (parenteral formulations) shows an 
unchanged positive profile. 
Estimated post -approval cumulative exposure to Teva Group products 
containing filgrastim was . No new signals of concern were 
raised by data on either adults or children treated with filgrastim.
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
The benefits of G -CSFs such as filgrastim are a reduction ofthe duration of neutropenia and the 
incidence of FNin patients treated with established cy totoxic CTX for malignancy  (with the 
exception of chronic m yeloid leukemia and my elodysplastic syndromes) and a reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therap y followed by bone marro w 
transplantation .
The main adverse effect of G -CSFs such as filgrastim during short -termand long-termtreatment is 
musculoskeletal pain . Hypersensitivity  reactions have been reported rarel y. Other a
dverse effects 
include splenic enlargement, thrombocy topenia, anemia, epistaxis, headache, diarr hea, and 
cutaneous vasculitis. There have been reports of pulmonary  infiltrates leading to respiratory  failure 
or acute respiratory  distress sy ndrome, and rare reports of splenic rupture. Rises in lactate 
dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid, are usuall y mild to moderate, dose -dependent, 
and reversible (Ref.: Summary  of Product Characteristics ratiograstim/tevagrastim, product 
information Neupogen) .
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after G -CSF administration and is characterized b y 
hypotension, hy poalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Patients who develop s ymptoms of 

Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
29capillary leak syndrome should be closely  monitored and receive standard sy mptomatic treatment, 
which may  include a need for intensive care.
Additional information regarding risks and benefits to human patients may be found in the US

313. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Design and Study Schema
This is aPhase2, multicenter, open -label study  to evaluate the safety, tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics , pharmacody namics,efficacy, and immunogenicit y of tbo-filgrastim at a dose of 
5μg/kg/day  in infants, children ,and adolescents with solid tumors without bone marrow 
involvement scheduled to receive at least 1 cy cle ofCTX.
Three groups stratified by  age (1month to <2 years, 2to <12years, and 12 to <16 years) will be 
enrolled. Recr uitment of subjects in the y oungest age stratum (1 month to <2 years) will begin only 
once safet y (from the start of study to CTX -day 21) and pharmacody namic (from the start of stud y 
to day15 [relative to first tbo -filgrastim administration]) results are available for a minimum of 
6subjects in the middle age stratum group andhave been reviewed by  the Data Monitoring 
Committee ( DMC)and no significant safet y signals that prevent recruitment in the youngest age 
stratum have been detected.
Tbo-filgrastim ad ministration will be started at approximately  24hours (±3hours) after the end of 
the last CTX treatment in the first week of this CTXcycle.Daily dosing with tbo- filgrastim should 
continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to 
2.0 ×109/L but not longer than on 14 consecutive day s. 
Commercially  available G -CSFs must not be administered during the treatment period of the study
or less than 6 weeks before inclusion. If a patient receives additional CTX tre atments during the 
study follow-up period, G-CSFs may  be administered at the discretion of the i nvestigator.
The study  will consist of 3 periods: screening period, treatment period, and follow -up period.
Screening period : Screening to confirm elig ibility must be completed in 14 days or less prior to the 
initiation of CTX. 
Treatment period : Subjects will be treated for at least 1 cy cle of CTX. The treatment period begins 
at the start of the first cy cle of CTX administered under this protocol and ends at th e end of this 
cycle (possibly immediately followed b y further out -of-study CTX cycles).This period may  last up 
to 3weeks. The first dose of tbo- filgrastim will be administered 24 hours (±3 hours) after the end of 
last CTX in week 1 of this CTXcycle.
Follow-up period : The follow -up period includes collection of an immunogenicity  sample at 
30days and3monthsafter last tbo -filgrastim study drug administration in the first cy cle. 
During the conduct of the study , an independent DMC will review accumulatin g safety data on a 
regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and stud y conduct issues. The 
maximum duration of the study  for an individual patient (from screening period until the end of the
90-dayfollow-up period) will be approximately 18weeks.
Patients who complete all scheduled visits will have final procedures and assessments performed at 
the end-of-study visit. Patients who withdraw from the study  before completing the evaluation 
period will have end-of-study procedures and assessments performed at their final visit .

413.11.1. Procedures for Screening and Enrollment 
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained from each parent/legal guardian, and 
a signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient before screening procedures 
commence, according to local I RB/IEC requirements. Evaluations obtained as part of routine 
medical care and performed during the screening period may  be used in place of the 
study-specific evaluations. In case the results from the central laboratory  will not be available on 
day1 before start of CTX, the investigator may  use test results from local laboratories in order to 
initiate CTX. In addition, disease -specific assessments performed within a specified time frame 
beforeinformed consent may  be used for the study . Parents/legal guardians will acknowledge 
and agree to the possible use of this information for the st udy by giving informed consent.
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8 -digit 
permanent identification number such that all patients from each investigational center are given 
consecutive identification numbers in successive order of inclusion . The first 2 digits of the 
patientnumber will be the number assigned to the countr y where the investigational center is 
located, the next 3digits will be the designated investigator center number, and the last 3 digits 
will be assigned at the investigator center (eg, if the number assigne d to the country  is 01, the 
3rdpatient screened at center5 would be given the number of 01005003).
A patient who is screened but not enrolled, eg, because entry  criteria were not met or enrollment 
did not occur within the specified time, may  be considered for screening again if, eg, there is a 
change in the patient’s medical background or a modification of study  entry criteria . (Note: 
details of rescreening criteria and procedures are included in the Monitoring Plan for this study .)
The screening visit will take place not more than 14 daysbefore the initiation of CTX . The 
following procedures will be performed at the screening visit:
obtain written informed consent before an y other study -related procedures are 
performed
collect demographic data (sex, age, race, year of birth, and ethnicity )
review incl usion/exclusion criteria 
review medical and ps ychiatric history  
review medication history 
perform clinical laboratory tests
perform urine drug screen 
perform vital signs measurements (body temperature to be obtained twice daily  
[morning and evening] an d recorded in the patient diary  and CRF)
perform ECG
perform full ph ysical examination (including height and weight)
perform urine pregnancy  test (for female patients who have attained menarche )
perform spleen sonography

47In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country ’s 
acceptance), each patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time. Eachinvestigator also 
has the right to withdraw a patient from the stud y in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse 
events, pregnancy  (see Section6.2), or other reasons concerning th e health or well -being of the 
patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation . In addition, a patient may  be withdrawn from the 
study as described in Sections3.6and3.11.4.
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of the study drug, or should the 
investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all 
observations up to the time of withdrawal . A complete final ev aluation at the time of the 
patient’s withdrawal should be made and an explanation given as to why  the patient is 
withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study .
The reason for and date of wit hdrawalfrom the study  must be recorded on the source 
documentati on and transcribed onto the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every  attempt will 
be made to determine the reason . If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory  test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the 
investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care 
of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or 
study procedure is made). Thespecific event or test result(s) must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
All evaluations should be performed according to the protocol for the end -of-study visit.
A patient who is enrolled but never treated with the stu dy drug may  be replaced with another 
qualified patient to ensure a minimum of 30 patients are evaluable for the primary  endpoints.

There are no restrictions on exercise.
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Any prior or concomitant therapy , medication, or procedure a patient has had within 2months
before stud y drug administration and up to the end of the study period, including follow -up,will 
be recorded on the CRF . Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded . The 
sponsor will encode all therap y and medication according to the World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug dictionary  (WHODrug).
The following medications will not be allowed in CTX cy cle1during this study :
Commercially  available G -CSF such as filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or lenograstim or 
their biosimilars
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients and/or parents or 
legal representatives whether they  have taken an y medications (other than study  drug), including 
OTC medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit.
5.4. Procedures for Monit oring Patient Compliance
Each investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance . A check of stud y drug 
compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of study  drug, and 
study drug accountabilit y records will be completed . If the investigator or the sponsor determines 
that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor 
should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn . The IRB/EC should be notified.
5.5. Total Blood Volume
Blood sampling maybe performed using an indwelling catheter instead of multiple 
venipunctures to minimize patient discomfort , at the discretion of the investigator. In addition, 
the frequency  and volume of blood samples has been set to the minimum that will allow the 
study objectives to be achieved.
According toEU guidelines (Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products

516. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  staff by evaluating the following : 
reported adverse events ,clinical laboratory  test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, 
physical examination findings (including body  weight and height measurements), concomitant 
medication usage , local tolerability  at the injection site, sple en sonograph y, anti-drug antibodies 
assessment, and survival at 90daysfollow-up.
6.1. Adverse Events 
6.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment . 
In this stud y, any adverse event occurring after the ICFhas been signed and throughout the stud y 
treatment period, and until 30days fromlast tbo-filgrastim administration ,should be recorded 
and reporte d as an adverse event .
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of the study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under st udy or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present before study  entry and do not worsen during the study  will not be considered adverse 
events. 
Worsening of the disease under study  should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
presentation and/or outcome is more severe than would normally  be expected from th e normal 
course of the disease in a particular patient.
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
significant worsening (change in nature, seve rity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions . (Note: a condition recorded as pre- existing that 
is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, headache] and which occurs during the study
should be recorded as an adverse event.)
drug interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phase of the 
study
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
52event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered 
by the investigator to be clinically  significant . Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study  
treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be evaluated to monitor data
from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
all events of possible drug- induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as 
AST or alani ne aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3 times the upper limit of the normal range
[ULN], plus either bilirubin ≥2 times the UL N or international normalized ratio [ INR]
>1.5) or Hy ’s Law events require immediate study treatment cessation and reporting 
as a serious adverse event.
6.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
Adverse events will be recorded from the time a patient’s parent(s) or legal representative(s) has 
signed the ICF(and the adolescent patient has given informed assent) and throughout the study  
treatment period and until 30-days fromthelast tbo-filgrastim administration . They should be 
reviewed and updated at each subsequent visit within this period.
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  periodmust be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged 
relationship to the study  drug. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Form must 
also be completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately  (see 
Section6.1.5.3). All serious adverse events that occur after the stud y period must be reported b y 
the investigator as described in Section 6.1.5.3.1.
At each contact with the patient, the inv estigator or designee must query  the patient for adverse 
events by  asking an open -ended question such as, “Have you had an y unusual symptoms or 
medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and 
symptoms wil l be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical 
condition or disease state . A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible . When such a 
diagnosis is made, all related signs, s ymptoms, and any  test findings will be rec orded collectivel y 
as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the Serious Adverse 
Event Form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved or 
stabilized or returned to baseline, or until the patient is referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study procedure is 
made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24hours), action 
taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF . 
6.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event will be gra ded according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events, current version 4.03 (NCI  CTCAE version 
4.03).
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
53Adverse events that are not included in the NCI  CTCAE lists will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE general guideline for grades as follows:
Grade 1 Mild; asy mptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only ; 
intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local intervention, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate in strumental activities of daily  living (ADL), eg, preparing meals, shopping for 
groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money
Grade 3 Severe or medicall y significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL , eg, bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to adverse event
6.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relationship of an adverse event to the study  drug is characterized as follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No 
reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events, which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are judged to 
be unrelated to the study drug.The relationship of a n adverse eventmay be considered “no 
reasonable possibility ”if it is clearly du e to extraneous causes 
or if at least 2 of the following apply :
it does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
administration of the test drug.
it could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
it does not follow a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
it does not reappear or w orsen when t he drug is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection 
with the test drug administration 
cannot be ruled out with cer tainty 
nor felt with a high degree of 
certainty to be related to the study 
drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility ”if at least 2 of the following apply:
it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administra tion of the drug.
it cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.
it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. 
There are important exceptions when an adverse event does 
not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists.
it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
546.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
6.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious A dverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
death
a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay  were required for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event . 
Hospitalizations scheduled for an elective procedure or for treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened during participation in the study  will not be 
considered serious adverse events. 
persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
a congenital anomaly /birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse . Note: any suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event.
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
6.1.5.2. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information by  its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safet y information for this study is the Investigator’s 
Brochure.The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmaco vigilance Department will determine 
the expectedness for all serious adverse events.
6.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
6.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section6.1.5.1) 
that occur during or after the study period (including the protocol- defined follow -up period), 
regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study  drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor by  the investigator within 24hours of when the investigator learns about it or, if the 
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
55event occurs on a weekend or national holiday , on the next working day .Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information 
is available.
The Serious Adverse Event Form should be sent to the local safety  officer (LSO) or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization in a country  without a Sponsor L SO) 
(contact information is in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Infor mation section); the LSO 
will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department .
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number XM02 -ONC-201
investigator and investigational center identification
patient number
patient initials
onset date and description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information may include the following:
age and sex of patient
date of first dose of study drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data 
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event resulting in death: 
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study  drug)
autopsy findings (if available)
The sponsor or its designee must ensure that the IC is also informed of the event, in accordance 
with local regulations.
For EU countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for I nternational Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/XML 
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
56file to the L SO for local submission to the regulatory  authorities and IEC/IRBs and investigators 
according to regulations.
The LSO will be responsible for submission of the MedWatch form 3500/CIOMS form/XML  
file to the regulatory  authorities. Serious adverse events should be reported by  the sponsor to 
investigators. Investigators should report to their local IEC/I RB as dictated by  their board’s 
policies and procedures.
Note: Although pregnancy  is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form(see 
Section6.2). 
6.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility
Serious adverse events of neutropenia are anticipated to occur in this study  population with some 
frequency , independent of drug exposure . Therefore, the sponsor does not plan to report these 
events individually  in an expedited manner . This provision has no impact on the investigator’s 
responsibility  for reporting serious adverse events (see Section6.1.5.3.1).
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of tbo -filgrastim and the appropriate regulatory  authorities. 
In addition to notify ing the investigators and regulatory  authorities, other measur es may be 
required, including the following:
altering existing research by  modifying the protocol
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
altering the process of informed consent b y modifying the existing consent form and 
informing current stud y participant s of new findings
modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as 
related to tbo -filgrastim
6.1.6. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting
No protocol-defined adverse events for expedited reporting were iden tified for this study .
6.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adver se event may  be withdrawn from the study  at any time at 
the discretion of the investigator . If a patient is withdrawn wholl y or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time . 
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform theclinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of all 
patients who are being consid ered for withdrawal due to adverse events . Additional reports must 
be provided when requested.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
57If a patient is withdrawn from the studyfor multiple reasons that include adverse events, the 
termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal wa s related to an adverse event. 
An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event which in the opinion 
of the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but which requires the use of a 
prohibited medication, there by requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason 
for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event.
6.1.8. Medical Emergencies
Medical emergencies must be reported to the individual identified in the c linical study  personnel 
contact information section of this protocol.
Equipment, supplies, and properl y skilled medical personnel must be accessible for an adverse 
event requiring immediate treatment . Any dose of study  drug, whether taken intentionally  or 
unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the sponsor .
6.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patient safet y, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact the individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation . The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study . Any 
departures from the proto col because of adverse events mus t be noted on the CRF and in source 
documents, along with the reason for such departures. 
6.2. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies ( pregnancies of females participating in the study  and partners of males
participating in the stud y) that occur during the study , or within 30daysof completion of the 
study, are to be reported immediately  to the individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel 
Contact Information sectionof this protocol, and the investigator must provide the LSO with the 
pregnancy  form.The process for repor ting a pregnancy  is the same as that for reporting a serious 
adverse event (see Section 6.1.5.3). 
Any patient becoming pregnant during the study  will be withdrawn. All patients (or partners) 
who become pregnant w ill be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy . If the 
pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and presence or absence of an y birth 
defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the 
sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy  will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continu e to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event .
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
58For an elective abortion notdue to development al anomalies, report on the Pregnancy  
Form.
6.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
Allclinical laboratory  test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted b y the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories:
abnormal but not a clinically  significant worsening
abnormal and a clinicall y significant worsening
A laboratory  test result that has significantly  worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section6.1.2.An adverse event includes a 
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once confirmed by  repeat testing) that results in the 
withdrawal of the patie nt from the study , the temporary  or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up.
Clinical laboratory  tests (serum chemistry  and hematology ) will be performed at screening and at 
the end-of- study visit. Clinical laboratory  tests will be performed using a central laboratory . In 
case the results from the central laboratory  will not be available on day 1 before start of CTX , the 
investigator may  use test results from local laboratories in order to initiat e CTX. Specific 
laboratory  tests to be performed are listed below.
6.3.1. Serum Chemistry
The following serum chemistry  tests will be performed:
ALT
AST
total bilirubin

neutrophils
lymphocytes
eosinophil s
monocytes
basophils
6.3.3. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
Other clinical laboratory  tests will be performed to ensure the safet y of the patients, but will not 
be used to assess the safety  of the stud y drug.
6.3.3.1. Human Chorionic Gonadotrop in Tests 
Human chorionic gonadotropin urine tests will be performed for all female patients of 
childbearing potential at screening and if clinically  indicated thereafter . Any patient who 
becomes pregnant during the study  will be withdrawn. Procedures for reporting the pregnancy  
are provided in Section6.2. 
6.4. Vital Signs
In accordance with the schedule of stud y procedures shown in Table1, vital signs will be 
measured at allvisits.Vital signs include the following:
pulserate
blood pressure
body temperature (axillary  or external ear )
respiration rate
Body temperature is to be measured twice daily during the stud y, once in the morning and once 
in the evening, and recorded in a patient diary  given to the patient or the 
parent(s)/representative(s) on day1 of the CTX cycle. Additional measurements will be taken if 
the patient feels feverish. Body temperatures will be measured by the clinical staff for inpatients, 
and by the parent(s)/representative(s) for outpatients. Body  temperature records will be 
transferred to the CRF.The effica cy variable is the incidence of FN which is defined as an 
axillary or external ear temperature >38.3°C or 2 consecutive readings >37.8°C for 2 hours (ie, 
2consecutive readings at least 2 hours apart) andANC<0.5 ×109/L.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
60Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or seated position 
and resting for at least 5 minutes. (The same position and arm should be used each t ime vital 
signs are measured for a given patient.) For any abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement 
should be repeated as soon as possible . Any vital sign value that is judged by  the investigator as 
a clinically significant change (worsening) from a ba seline value will be considered an adverse 
event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as 
described in Section 6.1.2.
6.5. Electrocardiography
In accordance with the schedule of stud y procedures shown in Table1, a12-lead ECG will be 
conducted at screening, pre-dose, 4 and 6 hours post -dose on day1 of tbo-filgrastim 
administration, and at the end -of-study visit. A qualified phy sicianatthecentral diagnostic 
center identified in the front matter of this protocol will be responsible for interpreting the ECG . 
Any ECG finding that is judged by  the investigator as a clinically  significant change (worsening) 
compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in Section6.1.2.
6.6. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only ) andweight 
will be performed at screening and at the end -of-study visit. Any physical examination finding 
that is judged b y the investigator as a clinicall y significant change (worsening) compared witha 
baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as 
described in Section 6.1.2.
6.7. Other Safety Measures and Variables
6.7.1. Concomitant Medication
Concomitant therap y or medication will be recorded after the ICF is signed and throughout the 
studytreatment period and until 30days fromlast tbo-filgrastim administration . Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section5.3.
6.7.2. Tolerability at t he Injection Site
Local tolerability  at the tbo-filgrastim injection site will be assessed at 1 hour (±30minutes)
following tbo -filgrastim administration. The site will be assessed for the presence and severit y of 
pain, erythema/redness, ecch ymosis, and i nduration.
Severity of any reaction should be assessed as described in Table4. At the discretion of the 
investigator, severe cases should be recorded as an adverse event .

and/or shoulder tip pain .
Any abnormal findings or changes (worsening) compared to a baseline value assessed b y the 
investigator as clinicall y significant should be recorded in the relevant CRF modules (eg, adverse 
event, medical hist ory).
6.7.4. Immunogenicity Assessment
In accordance with the schedule of stud y procedures shown in Table1,blood will be drawn for 
the assessment of ADA at screening , at the end-of- study visit,andat30 and 90days after the last 
administration of tbo -filgrastim in CTXcycle1.
Immunogenicit y tests will require 1.2 mL blood samples (for 0.6 mL serum) collected in 
vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant . Details on sample processing are provided in 
Section7.3.1.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
62Furthermore, all adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis (eg , scheduled safety  
reviews for tbo- filgrastim ) as interim/preliminary  safety databases become available (see 
Section6.1).
During the conduct of t he study, an independent DMC will review accumulating safet y data on a 
regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and stud y conduct issues.
The DMC will be composed of independent phy sicians with expertise in the relevant therapeu tic 
field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician. The DMC will receive safet y data 
periodicall y. They will have the right to recommend discontinuation of the study  for safety 
reasons.
DMC sessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor and 
the Steering Committee may  be present and information is provided and discussed. During 
closed sessions, the only  participants are members of the DMC and the designated statistician (if 
approved to be present).
The DMC chai rperson will communicate with the sponsor with regard to issues resulting from 
the conduct and clinical aspects of the stud y. The sponsor will work closel y with the committee 
to provide the necessary  data for review.
Recruitment of subjects in the y oungestage stratum (1 month to <2 years) will begin onl y once 
safety(from the start of study  to CTX-day21)and pharmacod ynamic(from the start of study  to 
day15 [relative to first tbo -filgrastim administration]) results are available for a minimum of 
6subjects in the middle age stratum group andhave been reviewed by  the DMC and no 
significant safet y signals that prevent recruitment in the y oungest age stratum have been 
detected.

689. STATISTICS
9.1. Study Design and Ra ndomization
This is a non- comparative, open -label study .
9.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The overall sample size of 50 (at least 6 in the infants group, 12 in the children group and 12 in 
the adolescents group) is not the result of a formal sample siz e calculation but was chosen for 
pragmatic reasons, taking into account the difficulty  of recruiting subjects in the requested age 
classes for such a stud y, and is considered sufficient to allow exploratory analysis. Data will be 
evaluated using statistica l approaches for exploratory  data analy ses.
9.3. Analysis Sets/Populations 
9.3.1. Intent-to-Treat Population
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all enrolledpatients. A patient is considered 
enrolled when there is a record of patient eligibility . The set of enrolled patients includes all 
patients who were enrolled in the study, regardless of whether or not a patient took any  study 
drug.
9.3.2. Safety Population
The safety population will include all enrolled patients who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug.
9.3.3. Full Analysis Set (FAS)
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will include all patients in the I TT po
pulation who receive at least 
1dose of study  drugand have at least 1 p ostbaseline efficacy assessment . 
9.4. Data Handling Conventions
For all variables, onl y the obser ved data from the patients will be used in the statistical anal yses, 
ie, there is no plan to estimate missing data. For the calculation of pharmacody namicparameters 
DSN and time to ANC recovery  missing ANC values might be imputed. Details will be 
described in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan.

clinical laborat ory (serum chemistry , hematology, and urinal ysis) test results at 
screening and at the end -of-study visit
vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) measurements at each visit
ECGfindings at screening, pre -dose and 4 and 6 hours following the first 
tbo-filgrastim administration and at the end-of- study visit
physical examination findings, including body  weight measurements, at screening 
and at the end- of-study visit
concomitant medication usage throughout the study
local tolerability  at the injection site at 1 hour (±30 minutes) after each study  drug 
injection
spleen sonograph y assessments at screening, on day 4of tbo-filgrastim treatment, at 
the end-
of-study visit and if the patient reports left upper abdominal and/or shoulder 
tip pain
ADA assessment prior to the first tbo- filgrastim administration, at the end -of-study 
visit, and at 30and 90daysafter last tbo- filgrastim study  treatment
survival at 90daysfollow-up
9.6.2. Safety Analysis
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) . Each patient will be counted only  once in each preferred term or sy stem organ class 
(SOC) category  for the analy ses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events 
(overall and b y severity), adverse events determined by  the investigator to be related to stud y 
treatment (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 6.1.4) (overall and b y severity), serious adverse

9.7. Pharmacok inetic Analysis 
9.7.1. Pharmacokinetic Variables and End points
The pharmacokinetic variables and endpoints for this study  are as follows: 
Cmax
tmax
AUC0-12
AUC0-inf
t1/2
9.7.2. Planned Method of Analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters derived for serum concentrations will be individually  listed and 
summarized for each age group (number of subjects, mean, SD, geometric mean [for AUCs and 
Cmax], coefficient of variation, minimum, median, and maximum). 
Serum concentration data will similarly  be individually  listed and summarized using descriptive 
statistics by  nominal tim e point.
Serum concentration -time profiles for each subject will be presented graphically . Mean serum 
concentration -time profiles will be presented b y age group. 
The initial analy sis of the pharmacokinetic data will be performed using noncompartmental 
analysis methods. Due to the sparse sampling design of this study , it is possible that population 
compartmental pharmacokinetic anal ysis using the computer program NONMEM will be 
performed to provide a more robust estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters and to 
correlate the pediatric pharmacokinetic data with the pharmacody namic endpoints collected in 
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
71this study . In addition, available pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic data from adult studies with 
more extensive sampling may  be added to the population pharm acokinetics model in order to 
support the pharmacokinetics modeling effort. If this analy sis is performed, it will be reported 
separately .
9.8. Pharmacodynamic Analysis
For continuous pharmacody namicvariables mean, median, SD and minimum and maximum 
values wil l be calculated. Categorical variables will be statistically  described by  giving the 
number and percent of patients with the respective attribute. All statistical analy ses will be 
broken down b y age group and will also be displayed across age groups. For p harmacod ynamic
metrics (ANC AUC, ANC nadir, time to ANC recovery ) appropriate regression models will be 
estimated to scrutinize the influence of age and possible other baseline characteristics (eg ,sex, 
type of cancer, t ypeofCTX) on the respective metric.
9.9. Efficacy Analysis
The incidence of febrile neutropenia will be summarized by  a frequency  table along with 95% 
confidence int ervals for the incidence rate, by age group and across age groups.
9.10. Planned Interim Analysis
No interim anal ysis is planned for this study.
9.11. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described 
in protocol amendments, the complete statistical plan, the clinical study  report, or an y 
combination o f these, as appropriate.

7210. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DA TA/DOCUMENTS
The medical experts, study  monitors, auditors, IEC/I RB, and health authority  inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation (eg, medical charts/recor ds, 
laboratory  test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient 
confidentiality  is maintained in accordance with local requirements.
Eachinvestigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s 
data at all times . Examples of source documents are hospital records, office visit records, 
examining phy sician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory  reports, 
drug inventory , study drug label records, diary  data, protocol required worksheets, and CRFs that 
are used as the source (see Section 3.9).
Eachinvestigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient. All study -related documents must be kept until 
notification by  the sponsor.

7311. QUALITY  CONTROL  AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by  the IEC/IRB, except when necessary  to 
address immediate safet y concerns to the patients or when the change involves only logistics or 
administration. The pri ncipal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 
11.1.2. Protocol Deviations
Any significant deviation from the protocol will be considered a protocol violation . Protocol 
violations includenonadherence on the part of the patient, the investi gator, or the sponsor to 
protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP 
guidelines; noncompliance to study  drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any  
other deviations that may have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safet y of 
the patients. P rotocol violations will be identified and recorded b y investigational center
personnel on the CRF . All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible I RB/IEC, as 
required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval 
from the medical representative . The decision will be based on ensuring th e safety of the patient 
and preserving the integrity  of the stud y. 
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol are not prospectively  granted by  
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet pro tocol 
eligibility  criteria was entered into a study , they must immediately  inform the sponsor of the 
protocol violation . If suchapatient has alread y completed the study  or has withdrawn earl y, no 
action will be taken but the violation will be recorded.
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
Eachinvestigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all staff members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg,when new staff become involved) . Eachinvestigator must 
assure that all stud y staff members are qualified b y education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the 
investigational ce nterauthorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities . This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary .Each 
investigator is responsible for notify ing TevaGCQA of an y clinical product complaint.
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including each
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply with the protocol . Additional information will be 
made available during the study when new staff become involved in th e study and as otherwise 
agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
7411.3. Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consen t form and the study  is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedures ( SOPs), the protocol, and other written 
instructions and regulatory guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and each investigator. The 
main responsi bilities of the study  monitors are to visit each investigator before, during, and after 
the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely recorded 
and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IRB/IEC approvals.
The study  monitors will contact each investigator and visit the investigational center at regular 
intervals throughout the study . The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, to include specific e lectronic 
source documentation [ see Section3.9]) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being recorded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study , the study  monitor will indicate verification by  
electronically  applying source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all 
required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingly .
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study monitor on visits to the investigational center . Each investigator and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring 
visits and/or provided in follow- up written communication.
11.4. Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCP, and applicable regulatory  requirements. The spo nsor quality  assurance
(QA)unit, independent of the Clinical Research Department, is responsible for determining the 
need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
Each investigator must accept that regulatory authorities and sponsor representa tives may  
conduct inspections to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study XM02-ONC-201
7512. ETHICS
12.1. Informed Consent/Assent
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by  the investigator, should fully  inform the 
patient and parent or other legally  acceptable representa tive of all pertinent aspects of the stud y 
including the written information approved b y the IRB/IEC . A signed and dated informed 
consent/assent form will be obtained from each parent/guardian and a signed and dated assent 
form will be obtained from each a pplicable minor patient before any  study-specific procedures or 
assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are 
explained; according to local IRB/IEC requirements . Beforethe patient’s participation in the 
study, the written assent form will be signed and personall y dated by the parent/guardian . Each 
investigator will keep the original consent/assent forms and copies will be given to the 
patients/parent/guardian . It will also be explained to the patient and parent/guardian that the 
patient is free to refuse entry  into the study  and free to withdraw from the study  at any time 
without prejudice to future treatment.
Written and/or oral information about the study  in a language understandable by  the 
parent/guardi an will be given to all parents/guardians with ample time for their consent/assent.
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards
Before this study  starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health autho rities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study  will not start at a given investigational center
before the IEC/I RB and health au thority (where applicable) for the center give written approval 
or a favorable opinion.
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients
Eachinvestigator must assure that the privacy  of the patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by  their names, but by  an 
identification code (eg, initials and identification number).
Personal medical information may  be reviewed for the purpose of patient safet y and/or verifying 
data in the source and transcribed onto the CRF .This review may  be conducted by  the study  
monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, the QA unit, and/or regulatory  
authorities. Personal medical information will alway s be treated as confidential.
12.4. Declaration of the End of the Clinica l Study
For clinical investigational centers located in the EU, a declaration of the end of the clinical 
study will be made according to the procedures outlined in Directive 2001/20/ED, Article 10(c); 
for other countries, local regulations will be followed .

13.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using CR Fs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21 CFR part 11. The CDMS will be fully  validated to ensure 
thatit meets the scientific, regulatory , and logistical requirements of the study  before it is used to 
capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and any  study-specific training . After they are trained, users will be provided with 
individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient screened according to the data source. 
Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF . Data will be 
verified using the data source b y the stud y monitor, and reviewed for consistency b y Data 
Management using both automated logical checks and manual review . All data collecte d will be 
approved b y the investigator at the investigational center . This approval acknowledges the 
investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate . 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central 
image center, electronic diary  data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where 
they will be retained but not entered into the CRF unless otherwise specified in the protocol . 
These data may  also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data 
management) for direct entry  into the clinical database (see Section3.9). Laboratory  test results 
will not be entered into the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol . All data from other 
sources will be available to the investigator(s).
For patients who enter a study  but do not meet screening criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF . 
13.2. Data Quality Assurance
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data QA, will comply  with 
international re gulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data management and 
control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken regarding data 
management and data QA, will be described in a data -management plan.
CRFsreceived will b e processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the presence 
of mandatory  values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for 
this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality  and accuracy . Any 
necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation 
procedures will be repeated as needed . Data from external sources will be compared with the 
information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried.
Pediatric Study–Chemotherapy -Induced Neutropenia

78Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function . The system 
requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates and 
times of modifications, and authorized electronic approvals of the changes.
At the conclusion of the study , the CDMS and all other study  data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections . Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed as accurate.
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Form s and Source Documents 
13.3.1. Investigator Responsibilities
All records related to the study  (ie, source data, source documents, CRFs [see Section3.9], data 
results from other sources [see Section 13.1], copies of protocols and protocol amendments, drug 
accountability  forms, correspondence, patient identification lists, signed informed consent forms, 
and other essential documents) must be retained until the sponsor notifies the institution, in 
writing, that records may be destro yed. 
If the sponsor has not provided written notification of records destruction after 15 years from 
study completion (or earlier in the event of an institution closing), and the institution determines
the study record retention is unduly  burdensome, the institution may  submit a written request to 
the sponsor at least 60 days before the planned disposition of the study  records. No study 
document or image (eg, scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) should be des troyed without prior 
written agreement between the sponsor and each investigator . Should an investigator wish to 
assign the stud y records to another party or move them to another location, advance written 
notice will be given to the sponsor.
13.3.2. Sponsor Respon sibilities
The sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality  control of the data . Data 
management and filing will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies.
If data management and filing of documents for this study are delegated to a contract 
organization, these functions will be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at 
that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by  the sponsor before the start of data 
management and filing activities. The ori ginal CRFs will be archived by  the sponsor .

8217. SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PROTOC OL
17.1. Amendment 02 Dated 24February 2016
The primary  reason for this amendment is to delete the requirement of administering at least 
5daily doses of tbo- filgrastim in the CTX cy cle. This isin response to the FDA comment that 
the instruction to administer at least 5 days of tbo-filgrastim is not consistent with labeling or the 
current standard of care . The proposed protocol change was intended to provide advice and 
clarify for the investigators “when the expected nadir is passed” , sincea transient increase in 
neutrophil counts is ty pically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of tbo-filgrastim therapy, but this 
does not imply  that the nadir has passed.
The tbo-filgrastim dosing schedule has been amended to clarify that the dosing schedule 
indicating that atransient increase in neutrophil counts is ty pically seen 1to 2days after 
initiation of tbo -filgrastim therapyfollowed b y the chemotherap y induced nadir ”.
Table1(Study Procedures and Assessment s) has been revised to reflect changes described 
below.
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol (and protocol s ynopsis, as 
appropriate) and are considered substantial b y the Teva Authorized Representative.

Treatment Indication:  Spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease , 
or herniated nucleus pulposus  affecting  either 1 to 3  
contiguous levels between C2 and C7 (for cervical 
patients) or L 1 and S1 (for lumbar patients) . 
Purpose : The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and 
radiographic outcomes in patients who undergo 1-3 level 
anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) or lumbar 
interbody fusion (TLIF, PLIF, ALIF, LLIF)  using ViBone. 
Subjects  will be followed for 12 months following surgery 
to determine the number of study subjects that are solidly 
fused at or before 12 months postoperatively.  
The data for cervical and lumbar fusions will be analyzed 
separately and will be compared to published and/or 
retrospective data for autograft or other similar graft 
materials .  
Design:  Up to 50 patients undergoing ACDF using ViBone will be 
enrolled.   
Up to  50 patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion  
using ViBone will also be enrolled.  
Subjects  will be followed via the enrolling center’s 
standard of care  for the procedure.    
Data from patients meeting the study criteria will be gathered at baseline, 6 months , and 12 months post-
surgery .

3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Spine Fusion  
Degenerative disorders of the spine can lead to a multitude of clinical problems including pain, 
weakness, numbness, tingling and deformity. When conservative (non- surgical) treatment fails 
after at least a 6- month  period and/or non -operative treatment is not indicated, patients and 
physicians may turn to a surgical solution. Surgical options consist of decompressing nerves, 
correcting and/or stabilizing deformities if required and fusing the segment, depending on the 
clinical sit uation. The "gold standard" for aiding healing in spinal fusion surgeries is the 
harvesting of autograft from the patient's iliac crest and placing it in and around the segments of 
the spine that are intended to be fused. Autograft is considered the "gold standard" because it 
contains the essential elements required for successful bone grafting: osteogenesis, 
osteoconduction, and osteoinduction.  
However, the morbidity of harvesting autograft has been well documented and includes chronic donor -site pain, inf ection, neurologic injury, blood loss, deformity, bowel injury, hernia, and 
prolonged surgical and hospitalization time. There are now a number of products on the market 
to minimize or replace the use of autograft. However, few of these products contain all three 
essential bone- forming elements (osteogenesis, osteoconduction, and osteoinduction) . 
3.2 Viable Bone Allografts  
ViBone  is a human tissue allograft consisting of cryopreserved bone matrix that is aseptically 
processed to preserve native factors  that support bone repair. ViBone is a Human Cellular and 
Tissue Based Product (HCT/P) per 21 CFR Part 1271. It is restricted to homologous use for 
transplant in procedures on a si ngle occasion by a licensed physician or surgeon.  
3.3 Description of ViBone 
ViBone provides all three components  critical for bone regeneration: osteoconductivity,  
osteoinductivity, and osteogenicity. It is a next generation cellular bone matrix that has been 
optimized to preserve the health of native bone cells and yield more readily av ailable bioactive 
agents to enhance new bone formation while ensuring a safe allograft tissue for transplantation. 
 ViBone  is supplied ready to use and must be stored in its original  packaging at - 75°C to - 85°C 
until prepared for use.  It is the responsibility of the transplant facility or clinician to maintain the 
allograft intended for transplantation in the appropriate recommended storage conditions prior to 
transplant.  Refer to the package insert (Appendix 4) for warnings and precautions and usage 
instru ctions.

 4 STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
4.1 Study Purpose 
The purpose of this prospective registry is to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in 
patients who undergo ACDF or lumbar interbody fusion surgery using ViBone.   
4.2 Objectives 
Subjects  will be followed for 12 months post -surgery to determine the incidence of successful 
fusion at 12 months postoperatively. This data will be compared to published and/or 
retrospective data for autograft or other similar products.  
Additional study  objectives include: 
• Incidence of successful fusion measured radiographically at  6 months post -surgery  
• Change from baseline in Oswestry Disability Index  (lumbar interbody fusion patients ) or 
Neck Disability Index ( ACDF patients ) 
• Change from baseline in Visual Analog Scale for back and leg pain 
• Incidence of  ViBone -related serious adverse reactions  
5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Design Summary  
This study is a multi -center, post -market, prospective patient registry  to evaluate the clinical and 
radiographic outcomes o f ViBone  in patients undergoing cervical  or lumbar spine fusion . Data 
will be gathered for up to 50 subjects  undergoing ACDF  surgery  and up to  50 subjects 
undergoing lumbar interbody fusion  surgery  using ViBone. Total enrollment is expected to be 
approximately 200 subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and radiographic 
outcomes in patients who undergo 1-3 level ACDF  or lumbar interbody fusion surgery using 
ViBone. Subjects  will be followed for 12 months post-surgery to determine the number of study 
subjects that are solidly fused at 12 months postoperatively. This data will be compared to 
published and/or retrospective data for autograft or other similar products.  
5.2 Patient Enrollment  
All patients  who sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
and an authorization for Protocol CLP-0001  for use of Protected Health Information (PHI) will be 
assigned a unique screening number consisting of a 4- digit sequential number  assigned by 
Medrio EDC .

 6 PATIENT SELECTION  
6.1 Study Population  
Up to 50  ACDF  and up to 50 lumbar interbody fusion patients from up to twenty  centers in the 
United States will be enrolled. The study population will consist of male and female patients, 18-
80 years of age. Eligible patients should have spondylosis, spondylolisthesis,  degenerative disc 
disease, or herniated nucleus pulposus . Cervical fusion patients shall undergo ACDF surgery 
using ViBone at 1 to 3 contiguous levels between C2 and C7.  Lumbar fusion patients shall 
undergo lumbar interbody fusion  surgery using ViBone at 1 to 3 contiguous  levels between L1 
and S1.   
6.2 Eligibility criteria  
6.2.1  Informed Consent Form 
Each patient will be required to sign an  IRB-approved ICF prior to enrollment  in the study.  
The ICF and product package insert will be used to explain the study and fully disclose known 
risks and benefits. Subjects  will not directly benefit from being in this study ; however, the 
results of this study may help people undergoing spine fusion in the future.  As with 
implantation of all human allograft tissue, risks associated with the implantation of ViBone 
include lack of  response from the recipient (e.g. , lack of fusion  or non- union with adjacent 
tissue). It is also possible for a host site to  beco me infected or the allograft tissue may cause 
an inflammatory  response. Current technologies may not preclude the transmission of 
infectious agents or disease, including hepatitis and HIV. ViBone is preserved in 5% dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 0.9%  sodium chloride solution. Povidone iodine, Dulbecco’s phosphate  
buffered saline, sodium chloride irrigation solution, sodium phosphate, hydrochloric acid and 
hydrogen peroxide are all used for  processing, preservation and storage of the allografts and 
trace amounts of these solutions may be present in the product.  
There are no additional medical risks involved in participating in this study. The only additional 
risk from taking part in this study is that the confidentiality of subject  information may be los t or 
compromised.  
The ICF must include the elements required by the FDA in US 21 CFR 50 and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines . 
Patients will also be required to consent to the use of their PHI according to all applicable health information privacy regulations. This authorization can be part of the ICF or can be a 
separate document.  
Each Investigator participating in the study is responsible for obtaining approval from Aziyo  for 
any consent documents prior to their submission to thei r IRB and prior to their use. Each 
Investigator participating in the study is also responsible for ensuring that a written ICF and 
written authorization for use of PHI are obtained from each patient that they enroll into the 
study at the time of that patient’s enrollment.  Documentation of the informed consent process 
must be completed by research personnel and the patient will receive a copy of the signed ICF. No study -related activities may be performed on any patient and no data may be

 11 SAFETY  
11.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Reactions  
Adverse Reactions  involving a communicable disease and are deemed  related to use of ViBone , 
will be reported  to FDA’s MedWatch  program  and details of the event shall be documented on the 
applicable Serious Adverse Reaction form.2  Per FDA 21 CFR 1271.3 (y), an adverse reaction is  
defined as a noxious  and unintended response  to any HCT/P for which  there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the HCT/P caused the response . 
Per FDA 21 CFR 1271.350 adverse reactions involving a communicable disease related to an 
HCT/P (ViBone) must be investigated and reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days of initial 
receipt of the information.  Adverse reactions are further defined to include the following:  
A communicable disease that:  
1. Is fatal  (report if you suspect the death was an outcome of the adverse event);  
2. Is life threatening  (subject at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event, or use 
or continued use of the device or other medical product might have resulted in the death of the subject;  
3. Results in permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body 
structure ( Report  if the adverse event  resulted in a substantial  disruption  of a person's ability  
to conduct  normal  life functions , i.e., the adverse  event  resulted  in a significant , persistent  or 
permanent  change , impairment , damage or disruption in the subject 's body  function/ structure , 
physical  activities  and/or quality  of life); or 
4. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention, including hospitalization (report if 
hospitalization is the result of an adverse event. Emergency department visits that do not 
result in admission should be evaluated for one of the other outcomes).  
If an adverse reaction involving a communicable disease that is believed to be related to the use of ViBone occurs, a Serious Adverse Reaction form shall be completed. In addition to 
completing the form, Aziyo must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware 
of the event. All fields are required in order to provide Aziyo personnel with the required 
information to evaluate the reaction and complete the required MedWatch report for submission 
to FDA  per the Sponsor’s Medical Device Reporting SOP.

and lumbar  spine  fusion . You will also need to sign other  consent  form(s) for your surgical 
procedure. 
What  is the purpose  of the study ? 
During  your spine fusion  procedure, your doctor  will use ViBone , a human  tissue allograft  that 
is intended to support  bone repair . ViBone  is used in fusion  surgery  to stop motion  between  
two or more  vertebral  bodies . ViBone  and other  bone allografts  may stimulate  new bone 
formation  and may provide a foundation or scaffold  on which  your body  can grow  new bone.   
ViBone  is a human tissue  allograft  consisting  of viable  bone matrix  that is processed in a way 
that preserves  native  factors  that support  bone  repair . ViBone  is regulated by the Food  and Drug  
Administration  as a Human Cellular  and Tissue Based Product  (HCT/P) per 21 CFR Part 1271.   
The pur pose of this study  is to gather  additional  information  on the use of ViBone  when it is used  
in patients  undergoing  cervical or lumbar  spine  fusion . 
How long will the study  last and how many  people  will be in the study ?   
Your  involvement  in this study  will last for approximately  twelve  months . You will have at least  
two routine follow -up evaluations , one at 6 months and another at 12 months  after your 
surgical procedure. Up to 20 U.S. clinical sites will be participating  in the study  and 
approximately  200 patients  are expected to be enrolled.  
What  are the procedures  required by the study  and are there  any extra tests  or 
treatments  required if I participate? 
Your  procedure will be performed per the standard of care by your physician. Although 
participation in the study requires no additional procedures or tests, it is important that you  
comply with standard of care by attending the scheduled follow -up visits as recommended by 
your physician. Your  physician  will provide the following  information from your visits and your 
medical  records : 
• Demographic  information ( age, race, gender )

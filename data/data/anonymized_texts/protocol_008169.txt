30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  30 6. INTRODUCTION 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver 
disease in the world today. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the more advanced form of NAFLD, is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis.
1 NASH is associated with 
increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular -, liver- , and cancer -related deaths.  
 Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of NASH. With the increasing prevalence of o besity and obesity-related diseases, NASH could soon become the leading 
indication for liver transplantation and the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
2 
There is an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapies for NASH.3 
 Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a nonmitogenic hormone that is an important regulator of energy metabolism.
4 FGF21 is a member of a hormone-like subgroup within the 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily. Like other members of this subfamily (i.e., FGF19 and FGF23), FGF21 has low binding affinity for heparin, which allows for transport into the circulation and subsequent action at distant sites. High-affinity binding of 
FGF21 to FGF receptors (FGF-Rs) occurs only in the presence of the FGF- R co-receptor, 
β- Klo tho; the restricted expression pattern of β-Klotho defines the target tissues for FGF21 
activity. FGF -Rs and β- Klotho are co -localized in liver, pancreas and adipose tissue, which 
are responsible for glucose and fat metabolism.
5 Notably, in contrast to FGF19, FGF21 does 
not signal through FGF-R4/β-Klotho6 and, therefore, is not mitogenic, nor does it regulate 
bile acid metabolism.  
 
FGF21 is most abundantly produced in the liver, where it reduces lipogenesis and glucose production and enhances fatty acid oxidation.
7 In adipose tissue, FGF21 promotes glucose 
uptake and stimulates secretion of adiponectin, an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing, anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti- fibrotic activities. Initial studies in mouse models and 
primates suggested that FGF21 administration increased energy expenditure, promoted fat utilization and reduced body weight and hepatic steatosis in high fat diet-induced obese mice, 
and improved lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and glycemia in obese, diabetic rhesus monkeys .
8,9 Increases in adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and 
reductions in levels of triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and insulin have also been reported in a human clinical study with a FGF21 analog.
10 Beneficial 
changes in circulating factors can be used as biomarkers of FGF21 activity, and they suggest that FGF21 mimetics could be attractive candidates for the treatment of NASH and its metabolic complications.  
 Serum concentrations of FGF21 are increased in human patients with NAFLD or NASH as well as the methionine - and choline-deficient (MCD) mouse model of NASH.
11,12,13 FGF21 
administration to FGF21 knock-out mice, however, has been shown to reverse excessive liver fat accumulation and fibrosis in the mouse MCD NASH model.
 13 These data are co nsistent 
with the hypothesis that up-regulation of FGF21 seen in human NASH patients or wild-type mice on the MCD diet may be an insufficient compensatory response, and that administration of exogenous FGF21 to achieve supraphysiologic serum concentrations may ameliorate the steatosis and fibrosis associated with NASH.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  31  
6.1 Background 
BMS -986036, also known by the generic name pegbelfermin, is a polyethylene glycol 
(PEG)ylated FGF21 analog with potent FGF21 signaling activity. BMS-986036 is a slightly 
modified version of human FGF21, where the glutamine amino acid at position 108 has been replaced by a novel para- acetylphenylalanine residue with a linear 30 -kDa PEG attached to 
improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the molecule and a methionine residue has been added to the amino-terminus of the protein to enable expression in Escherichia coli . 
Preclinical and clinical studies with BMS -986036 suggest that BMS-986036 is safe and well 
tolerated, and that it has the ability to increase adiponectin, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce liver fat, reduce liver injury, reduce fibrosis, and improve plasma lipid profiles, making it an attractive candidate for the treatment of patients with NASH who have advanced fibrosis.  
 Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details on BMS-986036. 
 
6.1.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The effects of BMS -986036 treatment have been evaluated in both prevention and 
therapeutic intervention studies in a mouse model of NASH, in which mice develop a fatty

• In the prevention study, 5- week -old mice treated with BMS -986036 had significantly 
reduced body weight, liver weight, liver- to-body weight ratio, plasma TGs, and liver 
TGs. BMS -986036 also significantly decreased histological evidence of hepatic 
perturbations (NAFLD Activity Score, comprising assessments of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning) and significantly reduced fibrosis, demonstrating an anti- fibrotic effect of BMS -986036. Consistent with this observed 
anti-fibrotic effect, BMS -986036 treatment reduced hepatic expression of alpha-
smooth muscle actin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP -1), and type 1 
collagen.  
• In the therapeutic intervention study, 9- week -old mice treated with BMS -986036 had 
statistically significant decreases in liver -to-body weight ratio, blood glucose, plasma 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver lipid content (TG and cholesterol), as well as histological evidence of hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis. 
 BMS -986036 was not genotoxic and had no adverse effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, 
and/or central nervous systems in rats, dogs, and/or cynomolgus monkeys. BMS-986036 was neither embryo-lethal nor teratogenic in definitive rat or rabbit embryo- fetal development 
studies.  In repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and sexually mature monkeys up to 6 months in 
duration, BMS-986036, administered once daily (QD), was clinically well tolerated  and 
evidence of pharmacology was observed at all doses (changes in adiponectin and other metabolic parameters). Effects on bone (decreases in bone mass, size, mineralization, and strength, as well as changes in formation/resorption biomarkers) were observed, and these

overall growth, except at the highest dose tested in monkeys (1 mg/kg/day; 19×  area under 
the concentration -time curve [AUC] multiple).  
 
Expected PEGylated peptide- related effects (injection site inflammation and minimal to 
moderate tissue vacuolation) were also observed. There was also no indication that PEG - related vacuolation was associated wit h any apparent degenerative or functional 
consequences in any cells or tissues, and findings were reversible, except for choroid plexus vacuolation in monkeys at doses ≥ 0.75 mg/kg/day (C- terminal intact BMS -986036 AUC 
multiple of 8 ×). PEG -related -findings were consistent with an adaptive response associated 
with PEG clearance and were not considered adverse.  
 Most of the observed effects in both studies did not substantially progress with extended duration of dosing and were generally reversible.  The no-observed -adverse -effect level AUC exposure multiples for C -terminal intact BMS -
986036 was 0.8×  (males) and 2 × (females) in rats and 2 × in monkeys relative to the highest 
planned dose of 40-mg once weekly (QW) in this study.  Refer to the IB for more details on these studies. 
 
6.1.2 Clinical Studies  
In the first -in-human study ( Study  MB130001), BMS -986036 was administered by 
subcutaneous (SC) injection in single and multiple doses for up to 14 days to 72 obese, 
nondiabetic, healthy adult volunteers.
16 C-terminal intact BMS -986036, the active 
polypeptide, displayed a half-life of approximately 20 - 24 hours and demonstrated a generally linear PK with 2 -fold to 3-fold accumulation following QD dosing. Following 
single dose administration in the range of 1 mg to 60 mg, the drug was slowly absorbed from the SC injection site (abdomen) into the systemic circulation, with median time to maximum concentration ranging from 24 to 33 hours. Following a single weekly dose of 21 mg, the time to maximum concentration was like that of single doses. BMS-986036 in doses of up to 30 mg QD for up to 14 days was well tolerated and safe; adverse events (AEs) were mild and showed no dose-ordered trends. In the multiple-dosing panel s, BMS -986036 increased 
adiponectin levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Adiponectin increased by 41.7% in the BMS -986036 30 mg QD group; in contrast, it decreased by 28.5% in the placebo group. 
Adiponectin has been shown to inhibit hepatic stellate cell proliferation and hepatic fibrosis in vitro,
17 and higher levels of adiponectin have been shown to correlate with improvements 
in fibrosis, as well as steatosis and inflammation.18 It is therefor e likely that an increase in 
adiponectin in response to BMS-986036 would have beneficial anti- steatotic, anti -
inflammatory, and anti- fibrotic effects in NASH patients. BMS -986036 also improved insulin 
sensitivity, promoted favorable lipid changes (decreased TGs, apolipoprotein B, and LDL cholesterol), and reduced body weight compared to placebo.   BMS -986036 was also studied in two Phase 2 studies. Study MB130002 was a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multiple -dose study in obes e participants 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Over 90% of participants had evidence of underlying

BMS -986036 or placebo, SC, for 12 weeks according to one of the following dosing 
regimens: BMS -986036 (1, 5, or 20 mg QD), BMS-986036 (20 mg QW), or placebo (QD). A 
total of 96 participants received at least 1 dose of BMS -986036. BMS-986036 treatment 
improved insulin sensitivity, adiponectin, fasting TGs, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, 
apolipoprotein C3, and N-terminal type 3 collagen propeptide (PRO- C3) (a biomarker for 
type 3 collagen formation, and hence, potentially, fibrosis). Dose- dependent increases in 
adiponectin were observed in all BMS-986036 dose groups. Meaningful changes in body weight were not observed.

 Study  MB130045 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multiple -dose study conducted in participants with biopsy-confirmed NASH who had stage 
1-3 fibrosis according to the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) scoring system . In this 
study, participants self- administered BMS -986036 or placebo, SC, for 16 weeks according to 
one of the following dosing regimens: BMS-986036 (10 mg QD), BMS -986036 (20 mg 
QW), placebo (QD). A total of 50 participants received at least 1 dose of BMS-986036 in the study.
20 Treatment with BMS -986036 for 16 weeks resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in hepatic fat fraction (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), decreases in ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (markers of liver injury), increases in adiponectin, and improvements in lipid profiles. Importantly, treatment with BMS-986036 was associated with imp rovement in fibrosis, as determined by decreases in magnetic 
resonance elastography (MRE) (an assessment of liver stiffness) and decreases in serum PRO -C3. In particular, BMS-986036 treatment was associated with an increase in the 
proportion of patients wi th at least a 15% decrease in MRE -assessed liver stiffness, a 
reduction that has been previously associated with an improvement in liver fibrosis, as observed on liver biopsy.

6.2 Study Rationale 
The current study is designed to confirm and extend the results observed in the Phase 1 and 
2a studies with BMS-986036. Specifically, this study aims to demonstrate in participants with NASH and compensated cirrhosis, the efficacy of BMS-986036 using histological and noninvasive endpoints, and the safety of BMS-986036 as assessed by AEs, lab results and bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring.  The protocol was planned to randomize approximately 100 participants to 1 of 4 treatment groups (approximately 25 participants per group). This protocol amendment (Version 4.0) reflects that upon close of enrollment, approximately 155 participants were randomized to treatment (approximately 38 participants per group). The increased number of randomized participants occurred following: 1) unexpectedly high enrollment rate in the final month of the enrollment period; 2) several participants who had initially been enrolled into FALCON 1 (MB130-068) were determined (based on central pathology biopsy results) to qualify for FALCON 2 (MB130 -069) during the period between the closure of enrollment and 
completion of randomization; and 3) an unexpected decrease in the actual screen failure rate for subjects entered in the final month of enrollment.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  34 Based on the unmet medical need for patients, the benefit/risk assessment discussed in 
Section 6.3, and the strict safety monitoring of all participants, the potential clinical benefit 
outweighs the risks for those who have chosen to participate in this study. No additional revisions are required in Section 9 due to the increased number of randomized participants.  
6.2.1 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Complete details of the study design are provided in Section  8.1.  
 
Participants having a confirmed diagnosis of NASH and compensated cirrhosis will be enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BMS-986036.  NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis have a high unmet medical need for approved therapies and compared to NASH patients with earlier stages of fibrosis, they are more likely to have a favorable benefit/risk profile for treatment with BMS-986036. Compared to NASH patients with stage 1 -3 fibrosis, NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis have worsened 
clinical outcomes and disease- specific mortality .
22,23,24 Moreover, the risk of liver- related 
mortality increases exponentially with each increase in fibrosis stage .25 Demonstration of an 
improvement in fibrosis should be highly predictive of clinical benefit.  NASH grade will be assessed by liver biopsy histology. Fibrosis stage will be assessed by liver histology as well as a number of noninvasive measures. In addition, PRO-C3 levels in participants will be measured during the course of the study in order to collect more data on its potential as a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of fibrosis. The correlation of baseline PRO -C3 levels with response to BMS-986036 will also be assessed. Markers of liver injury, 
metabolic improvements, and other liver- related outcomes will also be examined. Safety, 
including hematology and blood chemistry results, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and other potential safety issues (e.g., gastrointestinal AEs, immunogenicity, injection reactions, and effects on bone), will be monitored throughout the study.  PK profiling of BMS-986036 will be performed on all participants based upon trough sampling prior to dosing at each visit.  
 
 
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be based on the independent histological evaluation of liver biopsy at 48 weeks – a timepoint at which meaningful clinical benefits in 
fibrosis and NASH disease activity are expected in the selected patient population treated with BMS -986036. 
 The design and dose selection of future Phase 3 studies with BMS-986036 will be based upon the totality of the efficacy, safety and PK analyses from this study and from MB130-068, a Phase 2 study of BMS-986036 in participants with NASH and stage 3 liver fibrosis.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  35 6.2.2 Justification for D ose and Regimen  
In the present study, weekly SC administration of BMS-986036 (10, 20 or 40 mg, or placebo) 
will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. Careful examination of the Phase 1 and Phase 2a data, along with insights gleaned from nonclinical studies in animals, support these dosing regimens.  
 In Study MB130045, BMS-986036 dosed as 10 mg QD or 20 mg QW SC for 16 weeks in NASH participants consistently improved multiple biomarkers associated with steatosis, liver injury, and fibrosis. In addition to s ignificantly decreasing hepatic fat fraction in NASH 
participants at both doses, improvement relative to placebo was observed for several biomarkers such as serum PRO -C3, liver stiffness (as measured by MRE), adiponectin, 
hepatic transaminases, and serum l ipids. At 16 weeks, the 10 mg QD dose produced effects 
that were comparable to, albeit modestly higher than, the 20 mg QW dose for several biomarkers (MRI, PRO- C3, LDL cholesterol, and hepatic transaminases).   
 In addition to data from NASH patients in Study MB130-045, PK and PD data from 2 other randomized, and placebo-controlled studies of BMS-986036 in obese healthy volunteers 
(MB130-001) and obese T2DM participants (MB130002) were also included and analyzed 
using population PK- PD analyses.  
 Population PK- PD models were developed that described the PK -PD relationship between 
BMS -986036 and several PD responses across these studies, such as increase in adiponectin, 
reduction of hepatic fat fraction (MRI), reduction of TGs, LDL, and HDL, reduction of liver inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of elevated ALT, and reduction of fibrosis, as noted by improvements in PRO-C3, MRE, and adiponectin. Direct or indirect response PK- PD 
models were used to describe the relationship between PK and PD. These models we re then 
used to predict biomarker responses at various candidate weekly dosing regimens of BMS -986036.
16,19,20 
 Given that only modestly higher PD responses were observed with 10 mg QD dosing relative to the 20 mg QW dose in Study MB130-045, and the consideration that a QW SC dosing regimen is likely to be more acceptable to participants than a daily dosing regimen, and therefore be associated with better compliance, 3 weekly doses were identified -i.e., 10 mg, 
20 mg, and 40 mg QW, that are expected to achieve clinically meaningful responses for key biomarkers of NASH, and can be administered in up to 2 injections. Model- predicted percent 
change from Baseline in  key biomarkers for typical NASH study participants are noted in 
Table 4  below.

The safety and PK of 20 mg QW and 40 mg QW dosing regimens for 3 weekly doses has been recently characterized in a Phase 1 study in obese healthy Japanese participants. Preliminary results show that exposure is generally dose proportional between 20 mg and 40 mg QW, and the 40 mg QW dose was safe and well tolerated (refer to IB for additional details). The 40 mg QW dose is hypothesized to provide increased efficacy compared to that of the 20 mg QW dose, but with lower overall BMS-986036 exposure than that of the 10 mg QD dose. Additionally, compared to 10 mg QD, the 40 mg QW dose is expected to provide a higher margin relative to the exposure associated with nonclinical bone- related AEs, and it 
also provides a lower burden of PEG. Evaluation of the 10 mg QW and 40 mg QW dose regimens is expected to facilitate a more complete evaluation of the dose-response profile of BMS -986036. 
 
6.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
6.3.1 Summary of Potential Benefits  
In obese participants with T2DM (many of whom had underlying fatty liver), treatment with 
BMS -986036 for 12 weeks improved several metabolic factors (insulin sensitivity, 
adiponectin, and serum lipids) and led to a reduction in PRO-C3. In participants with NASH, treatment with BMS -986036 for 16 weeks resulted in statistically significant reductions in 
hepatic fat fraction (measured by MRI), decreases in hepatic transaminases (markers of liver injury), significant increases in adiponectin, significant reductions in PRO-C3, reductions in 
liver stiffness (measured by MRE), and improvements in lipid profiles. 
 Thus, clinical data suggest that BMS-986036 has the ability to increase adiponectin, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce liver fat, reduce liver injury, reduce fibrosis, and improve plasma lipid profiles, making it an attractive candidate for the treatment of patients  with NASH who 
have advanced fibrosis. Together, these data support further development of BMS-986036 for the treatment of patients with NASH with compensated cirrhosis.  
 
6.3.2 Summary of Risks 
6.3.2.1 Gastrointestinal Events  
In Phase 2a studies, the frequency of gastrointestinal AEs in participants treated with 
BMS -986036 (72%) was higher than that reported in the placebo group (28%). The most 
frequent gastrointestinal AEs were diarrhea, nausea, aphthous ulcer, constipation, dyspepsia, frequent bowel movements, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal pain. When they

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  37 occurred, these AEs were of generally mild or moderate intensity; none of these AEs were of 
severe intensity. There were no discontinuations due to gastrointestinal AEs.  A total of 69 events of diarrhea, nausea, frequent bowel movements, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain upper were reported in participants on both placebo and BMS -986036 treated arms. Among the 69 events, 55 events were reported in participants 
treated with BMS -986036 and 14 events were reported in the placebo group: 
• Among the 55 events, there were 3 events for which AE duration was not available for calculation. Therefore, event duration was calculated for 52 events. 
• The majority (80.7% [42/52]) of the events were of mild seve rity (Grade 1), were 
judged by the investigator to be not related, were resolved in a mean of 6 weeks, and did not require any treatment. 
• A smaller percentage (19.2% [10/52]) of the events were of moderate severity; 8 of the moderate grade events (5 events  of diarrhea and 1 event each of abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and frequent bowel movements) did not require any treatment and were resolved quickly (within a mean of 8.7 days). These events were reported as not related by the investigator, except for frequent bowel movements. The remaining moderate severity events (2 events of nausea; 1 related and 1 not related) required treatment and were resolved in a mean of 31 days.  
 At this time, these events are not explained by the known biological mechanism of PEG -FGF21. Of note, there was no evidence of gastrointestinal AEs in nonclinical models 
with BMS -986036.  
 
6.3.2.2 Immunogenicity 
BMS -986036 is a modified version of human FGF21 and has the potential to be 
immunogenic; however, the potential safety liability of antibody formation in humans is 
considered to be low. Most human protein therapeutics can induce a rapid and strong anti-drug antibody (ADA) response in animals, although the presence of ADAs in these species does not necessarily predict immunogenicity in humans.   In the Phase 1 study MB130001, 3 of 72 participants (4%), who received any dose of BMS -986036, developed antibodies to FGF21 and BMS-986036 by the end of the study. An 
initial assay titer increase was observed, followed by stabilization or decrease in titers, during additional post-study immunogenicity testing over the next 6 months. No participant had persistent positive functional neutralizing ADAs during the Follow-Up Period, although one participant tested positive at 2  nonconsecutive time points. Plasma exposure of BMS-986036 
in these 3  participants did not differ from that of other treated participants during the period 
in which the concentration was detectable. Immunogenicity was not associated with an increased incidence of overall AEs or immunogeni city-related AEs, such as rash or fever, or 
with altered PK or PD effects.  
 In Study MB130002, up to Study Discharge (Day 126), anti- BMS -986036 and anti-FGF21 
antibodies were detected in 68% and 70%, respectively, of the participants treated with BMS -986036; however, antibody titers were generally low (12.2% and 37%, respectively, 
had titers ≥ 64), and only 2 participants had neutralizing antibody responses to endogenous

assoc iated with immune -related AEs or injection site reactions. BMS -986036 exposures were 
similar in participants with ADAs compared with participants without ADAs. During the 
Follow-Up Period, antibody titers were observed to be either stable or declining in t he 
overwhelming majority of participants, and no participant had neutralizing antibodies.  In Study MB130045, up to Study Discharge (Day 142), anti- BMS -986036 and anti-FGF21 
antibodies were detected in 62.5% and 62.5%, respectively, of the participants tre ated with 
BMS -986036 20 mg QW; however, antibody titers were generally low (among participants 
who received BMS-986036 20 mg QW, 4/24 and 0/24, respectively, had anti- BMS -986036 
and anti-FGF21 titers ≥ 64). Furthermore, titers were not associated with immune- related 
AEs or injection site reactions.  
 
6.3.2.3 Injection Reactions 
Injection site reactions have been monitored in completed and ongoing studies using the 
Draize scale, which rates erythema and edema at the injection site on a scale ranging from “none” to “severe.” In Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies, injection -related AEs were generally 
mild, transient, resolved without intervention, and did not lead to discontinuation.  In the single ascending dose portion of Study MB130001, 2 participants (5.6%) who received BMS -986036 and 0 participants in the placebo group developed injection site erythema. In 
the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, the proportion of participants who developed erythema was well balanced between treatment groups (BMS-986036 at any dose versus placebo). Eleven participants developed injection site erythema (8 participants [22.2%] across all BMS-986036 groups and 3 participants [25.0%] in the placebo group). No participants developed injection site edema.  
 In Study MB130002, injection site erythema and/or injection site edema were reported in 4 of 96 participants (4.2%) who received BMS-986036 and in 1 of 24 participants (4.2%) who received placebo. One injection site reaction (20 mg QD) was of severe intensity, and the remaining 3 inj ection site reactions were rated as mild in intensity. Concurrent ADAs were 
present in 1 participant (10 mg QD) of the 5 participants with injection site erythema and/or edema.  
 In Study MB130045, injection site erythema was reported in 3 (4.0%) participants, and injection site edema was reported in 1 (1.3%) participant. All AEs of injection site erythema and injection site edema were mild or moderate in intensity. Concurrent ADAs were present in 2 (20 mg QW and 10 mg QD) of the 3 participants with injection site erythema and/or edema.  
 
6.3.2.4 Effects on Bone 
In the multiple ascending dose portion of Study MB130001, conducted in healthy 
participants, all dose panels had a decrease in bone formation markers (bone- specific alkaline 
phosphatase [BSAP] and N- terminal p ropeptide- of type 1 procollagen [ P1NP ]) that was 
reversible after administration of BMS -986036 had ended. The bone marker values remained

BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  39 did not differ between treated participants and the pooled placebo group. Similarly, there was 
no significant change in bone resorption markers in any BMS-986036- treated participants 
compared to the pooled placebo group.  Analyses from Phase 2 studies (MB130002 and MB130045) in participants with T2DM and in participants with NASH suggest that BMD, as measured by bone densitometry, was not affected by 12 or 16 weeks of dosing with BMS-986036. There were no meaningful differences in population mean BMD change from Baseline at the end of dosing or at 
6-months follow-up.  
Additionally, in both studies, BMS-986036 had no clinically meaningful impact on 
biomarkers of bone turnover (BSAP, P1NP, or C- terminal telopeptides type I collagen  [CTX -
1]) during 12 or 16 weeks of treatment. 
 Overall, the results from Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies have demonstrated that BMS-986036 was clinically well tolerated in obese participants, in obese participants with T2DM, and in participants with NASH with stage 1 -3 liver fibrosis and has an acceptable safety profile to 
support continued clinical development.  
6.3.3 Safety Monitoring 
Safety monitoring will be in place during the entire study allowing early detection of any 
safety signals. Participants will undergo safety evaluations at each clinic visit an d the 
investigator will conduct a thorough safety evaluation before dosing. Safety assessments will be regularly performed and will include assessments for AEs, focused symptom- directed 
physical examinations, and laboratory measurements.  Study results will be monitored by an independent DMC. The scope of responsibility for the DMC will be comprised of safety monitoring by masked treatment group however, the DMC may request treatment codes and/or efficacy summaries if indicated for safety/benefit assessment  (see Appendix 1).  
 In addition to the DMC, the sponsor (blinded to treatment assignment) will monitor safety. All reported AEs will be assessed, including events of special interest for BMS-986036 (see Section  8.5.3.7). The sponsor has developed a list of events of special interest for the 
BMS -986036 program based on the known biologic class effects, the mechanism of action, 
and data from unblinded clinical studies. These will include injection site reactions, gastrointestinal events, and bone-related events. Additionally, BMD and immunogenicity (anti-BMS -986036 and anti-FGF21 antibodies) will be monitored (see Section  8.5.3.6 and 
Section  8.5.3.8). AEs on or around the time of development of anti- BMS -986036 and/or anti-
FGF21 antibodies will be carefully evaluated.  
6.3.4 Overall Conclusion  
Based on nonclinical data and results available from Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies, the

8.1 Overall Study Design 
This will be a multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, parallel-group 
study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BMS-986036 in the treatment of participants 
with NASH and compensated cirrhosis. The procedures and assessments to be conducted at each study visit are outlined i n the Schedules of Activities tables ( Table 1 , Table 2 , and Table 
3 in Section  1) provided at the beginning of this protocol.  
 A schematic of the study design is in Figure 1 (Screening to Week 52/Post- Treatment 
Follow-up [PTFU]) and Figure 2 (follow- up visits after the Week 52/PTFU Visit) below.  
 The study will consist of 4 periods: 
• A Screening Period of up to 8 weeks in duration (this period may be extended to a total of up to12 weeks upon discussion with the medical monitor) 
• A 48 -week, Double-Blind Treatment Period, during which the participants will receive 
blinded study medication (BMS-986036 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg QW or matching placebo QW)  
• A 4-week PTFU Period  
• A Follow-Up Period of up to 14 months (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after 
the Week 52/PTFU Visit for the collection of an additional dual-energy X- ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) assessment (in all participants), samples for potential 
immunogenicity testing (in all participants) as well as plasma and serum for 
biomarkers (in all participants ) at 6 months (± 14 days) Post Week 52/PTFU. 
Subsequent visits at 9, 12, and 14 months after Week 52 or PTFU will be performed in participants for whom Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow- Up Visits are required. See 
Section  8.5.3.6 
 At the end of the Screening Period, participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will enter the Double -Blind Treatment Period.  
 Participants will be enrolled and randomized via interactive response technology (IRT) to receive BMS -986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 20 mg QW, BMS- 986036 40 mg QW or 
matching placebo QW in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. A liver biopsy will be performed during Screening (if necessary) and at Week 48 in all participants. A total of approximately 100 participants was planned to be randomized (approximately 25 participants per arm). The final number of 
participants randomized was approximately 155 (see Section 6.2).  
 Arm 1:  BMS -986036 (10 mg QW) 
Arm 2:  BMS -986036 (20 mg QW) 
Arm 3:  BMS -986036 (40 mg QW) 
Arm 4:  Placebo  
 Participants will be stratified at randomization by country (Non -Japan/Japan). Participants in 
countries other than Japan will be stratified at randomization  according to T2DM status 
(yes/no). Japanese participants will not be further stratified.

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  43  
Randomized participants will receive their assigned double-blind study medication for a total of 48 weekly doses. The treatment will be administered by SC injection of 2 pre- filled 
syringes of study medication in the abdomen according to their assigned treatment arm (see Section  8.4.2) . During the Double- Blind Treatment Period (Table 2  in Section  1), participants 
will be evaluated for safety and efficacy every 4 weeks (± 5 days) through Week 24 and every 8 weeks (± 5 days) after Week 24 through Week 48.   Participants will then return at Week 52 (± 5 days) for a PTFU Visit. Participants wh o 
discontinue study medication earlier than Week 48 will have an Early Termination (ET) Visit at the time of study medication discontinuation and will return for a PTFU Visit 4  weeks 
(± 5 days) after the ET Visit.  
 Participants will return 6 months (± 14 days) (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after the Week  52/PTFU Visit for DXA to assess BMD and for collection of samples for potential 
immunogenicity testing as well as serum and plasma biomarker samples (see  Table 3  in 
Section  1). Participants at the  Week 52/PTFU Visit  may need to return at 9 months, 12 
months, and 14 months (± 14 days) (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after the Week 52/PTFU Visit if required for immunogenicity testing, as described in Section  8.5.3.6 (see

8.3.6 Dietary and Lifestyle Counseling  
During Screening, after r eceiving the signed ICF, sites will provide all participants with the 
following dietary and lifestyle counseling: 
• Reduce body weight (if obese or overweight) through diet and exercise 
• Follow a balanced diet  
• Increase physical activity  
• Avoid alcohol as much as possible. However, if alcohol is consumed, do not consume 
≥ 30 g/day (males) or ≥  20 g/day (females) of alcohol during the study. This is equal 
to approximately 2 alcoholic drinks per day for males, and approximately 1.5 
alcoholic drinks per day for females. One alcoholic drink is equal to 12 ounces 
(355 mL) of 5% ABV beer, 5  ounces (148 mL) of 12% ABV wine, or 
1.5 ounces (44.4 mL) of 40% ABV distilled spirits 
 
8.3.7 Concomitant Medication Restrictions  
Anti-diabetic, anti -obesity, and anti- dyslipidemic medications are allowed if participants 
have been on stable dosing regimens for at least 3 months (12 weeks) (6 weeks for statins 
prior to and during the Screening Period. The investigator may contact the medical monitor regarding the stability of a participant's regimen when determining eligibility for study participation.  
 During study treatment, participants should refrain from using cannabinoid products.  Vitamin E is allowed; however, vitamin E doses ≥ 800 IU/day are allowed only if participants have been on stable doses for at least 6 months (26 weeks) prior to and during the Screening Period and if vitamin E treatment (≥ 800 IU/day) was not initiated after the qualifying liver biopsy was performed.  Vitamin D and calcium supplementa tion are permitted per local standard of care. Use of 
bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, estrogen, or teriparatide for treatment of osteoporosis is permitted if participants have been on stable doses for at least 6 months (26 weeks) prior to and during the Screening Period.   Any change in dose of these medications should be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Consult with the medical monitor if medications which could impact bone density assessments are to be added during the Double-Blind Treatment Period or during the first 6 months after the Week 52 / PTFU Visit.  
 Medical or surgical treatments for obesity should not be initiated while the participant is participating in the first 52 weeks of the study (i.e., from the time of informed consent until 
the participant completes the Week 52/PTFU Visit or discontinues participation in the study, 
whichever comes first).  
 Concomitant medications and medical and surgical treatments will not be limited after the Week 52/PTFU Vi sit.

8.3.8 Screen 
Failures and Rescreening  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to take part in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious AEs (SAEs).  
8.3.8.1 Retesting During Screening 
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in the Screening procedures (Table 1  in Section  1) may be repeated during the Screening Period in an effort to find all 
possible qualified participants. Consultation with the medical monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular parameter is clinically relevant.  
 The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current clinical state.  
 
8.3.8.2 Rescreening  
This study will permit the rescreening of a participant who has discontinued the study as a 
pre-treatment failure (i.e., the participant has not been randomized/has not been treated). 
Consultation with the medical monitor may be needed to identify whether rescreening is clinically relevant. If rescreened, the participant must sign a new ICF.  
 
In the event that histologic evaluation of the biopsy of an otherwise qualified participant results in a diagnosis of NASH with stage 3 fibrosis, that individual is not eligible for the present study (MB130-069) but may be considered for enrollment under protocol

8.3.9 Withdrawal of Participants 
8.3.9.1 Discontinuation of Study Medication 
Participants MUST  discontinue investigational product (IP) (and non-investigational product 
[non- IP] at the discretion of the investigator ) for any of the following reasons. 
• Participant’s request to stop study medication. Participants who request to discontinue 
study medication will be expected to complete an ET (Week 48/ET) Visit and subsequent 
follow-up visits/procedures per the Schedule of Activities (e.g., Week 52/PTFU; Section  1). The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to provide this information. Participants’ withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study medication only or also from study procedures and/or Week 48/ET, Week 52/PTF U Visit, etc. (see Section  8.3.9.2)  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness, which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the participant 
• The participant experiences a major bone fracture or is diagnosed with osteoporosis that requires treatment  
• Abnormal liver tests as defined in Section  8.5.3.1  
• On 2 consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart), a participant has an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m

• The participant becomes  pregnant (study medication must be discontinued immediately) 
In the case of pregnancy (see Section  8.5.3.1), the investigator must immediately notify 
the medical monitor or designee of this event. In the event a participant becomes pregnant during a clinical study, the study medication must be discontinued immediately. In most cases, the study medication will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner. The medical monitor should be contacted within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy  
• Termination of the study or program by the sponsor 
• If a participant loses more than 10% of their total body weight, the investigator should contact the medical monitor. The investigator, together with the medical monitor, will then determine whether the participant should continue to take study medication 
 If study medication is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason for the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the appropriate eCRF page. The discontinuation should also be reported via the IRT. As indicated, appropriate follow- up and/or alternate medical care must be arranged for 
the participant. Please notify the medical monitor as soon as possible when discontinuation of study medication is being considered.  See Section  8.4.6 for details regarding dose modification and/or treatment interruption. 
 Participants who prematurely discontinue study medication will be expected to complete an ET Visit and subsequent follow-up visits/procedures per the Schedule of Activities, including a Week 52/PTFU Visit ( Table 2  in Section  1), DXA and Immunogenicity Follow- Up Visit(s) 
(Table 3  in Section  1) (see Section  8.5.3.6) . The only exception to this requirement is when 
consent is withdrawn for all study procedures or the participant loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). Participants who discontinue study medication will not be replaced (see Section  8.3.9.4).  
 
8.3.9.2 Discontinuation from Study Participation 
When a participant (o r caregiver as applicable) requests to discontinue study participation, 
the participant will undergo an ET Visit as described in Table 2  in Section  1. 
 
The only exception to this requirement is when consent is withdrawn for all study procedures 
or the participant loses the ability to consent freely (e.g., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).

8.4 Treatment  
Study medication is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo 
or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study randomization or treatment allocation.  
 Each study medication must be listed as either an IP or non- IP. 
 Study treatment includes both IP and non-IP and can consist of the following: 
• All products, active or placebo, being t ested or used as a comparator in a clinical 
study.  
• Study required premedication 
• Other drugs administered as part of the study that are critical to claims of efficacy (e.g., background therapy, rescue medications) 
• If specific criteria are required for treatment in a given phase of the study (e.g., extension phase), provide detailed criteria in this Section  
• Diagnostic agents: (such as glucose for glucose challenge) given as part of the protocol requirements must also be included in the dosing data collection. 
 An IP, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.  Study medication includes both BMS-986036 and placebo and is described in Table 5  below. 
 Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non- IPs.

8.4.2 Study Medication Administration 
Participants should be instructed to make every effort to administer study medication on 
the same day each week at approximately the same time of day. Each weekly 
administration will consist of 2 SC injections.  
 On Day 1 and at the Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, and 40 Visits, study medication will be self-administered by the participant or administered by their designee at the study site as part 
of the participant’s scheduled study visits. At those visits, study medication dosing should be held until all study- related assessments, including participant questionnaires, 
vital signs, ECG, AE evaluation, physical examinati ons, and laboratory sample 
collection (including trough [predose] PK) have been completed.  
 
If a study visit occurs on a day 
that is not a planned dosing day, the participant should continue to administer the medication on the planned dosing day; all study- related assessments will continue to be performed at the 
planned study visit (in- clinic admin istration of study drug would not occur).  
 
 
 Study medication is blind ed and is supplied in a pre- filled syringe. Each participant will be 
dispensed a treatment kit containing 2 smaller boxes (for each weekly administration). Each smaller box will contain 1 prefilled syringe of the medication. Both syringes will be administe red in the abdominal area at different locations per training guidelines. Study 
medication will be assigned by the IRT system.

Guidance and training on administration should be given to the participant (or caregiver, if 
applicable) prior to the first administration. At a minimum, the first administration should be done by the participant under the supervision of qualified site personnel. Training may be 
repeated as necessary at any study visit at the discretion of the investigator to maintain treatment compliance.  When injections are administered at the site during study visits, site 
staff may observe the injection to ensure proper technique is being employed. Participants will be required to capture the date, time, and location of each injection on the supplied study medication administration card.  
 Specific instructions for study medication administration as well as training materials for participants (or caregivers, if applicable) are in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 
8.4.3 Method of Treatment Assignment  
After receiving  the signed ICF but before any other study- related procedures are performed, 
the investigative site will access the enrollment option of the IRT system for assignment of a 
participant number (including participants not subsequently randomized or treated). This number is assigned sequentially by the system and will be unique across all sites. If a potential participant is rescreened, a new identification number will be used.  
 Randomization will be conducted in the following manner: 
• Eligible participants will be randomized by the IRT using a prespecified schedule in a 
double-blind manner to 10 mg BMS-986036, 20 mg BMS-986036, 40 mg BMS-986036, or placebo arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio based on the stratification factors specified in Section  8.1 
• The IRT will provide study medication kit numbers that contain the appropriate study medication (BMS -986036 or placebo) for dispensation to that participant 
 At subsequent study visits as listed in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1), the investigator 
or designee will access the IRT to receive the corresp onding kit numbers assigned to the 
participant for the purpose of dispensing study medication.   
8.4.4 Blinding of Study Medication 
8.4.4.1 Maintaining the Blind  
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using the IRT. All syringes and syringe 
contents (BMS-986036 10 mg/mL, BMS -986036 20 mg/mL, and placebo) are identical in 
appearance. Investigative site staff, sponsor and designee personnel, and participants and their families will remain blinded to treatment assignments. Study medication will be administered in a double-dummy manner as described in Section  8.4.2 in order to maintain 
the blind.  Sponsor and designee personnel may be unblinded once all participants have completed the 
Week 52/PTFU Visit and all data have been collected through that time point to facilitate 
analyses. Designated sponsor staff may be unblinded (obtain the randomization codes) prior to 
database lock to facilitate the bioanalytical analysis of PK samples and immunogenicity. A

external central bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to (may obtain) the randomized 
treatment assignments in order to minimize unnecessary bioanalytical analysis of samples.  
 
8.4.4.2 Circumstances for Unblinding 
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant where 
knowledge of the study medication is critical to the participant’s medical management, the blind for that participant may be broken by the investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment, the investigator should determine that the unblinded information is necessary (i.e., that it will alter the participant’s immedia te management). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not 
related to the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant is receiving active product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the medical monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate authority for the decision to unblind. The actual TASK of unblinding can be delegated by the investigator to a designee assigned the task on the Delegation of Authority. The principal investigator or appointed designee should only call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to unblind the participant has been documented.  For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT system. In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted access to randomization information via IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify the medical monitor and/or study director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT Manual. Participant and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the blind being broken must be recorded on the appropriate study status page of the eCRF.  
 In cases of accidental unblinding, the site should contact the medical monitor and ensure every attempt is made to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a participant for 
nonemergency purposes should be discussed with the m edical monitor.  
 
8.4.5 Study Medication Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability 
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility 
of the investigator to ensure that IP is dispensed only to study participants. The IP must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  
The product should be stored in a refrigerator (2° C through 8°C [35.6°F through 46.4°F]) and 
protected from light. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study medication 
arise, the study medication should not be dispensed, and the sponsor should be contacted immediately.

IP documentation must be maintained. This includes documentation of all processes required to ensure drug is accurately administered, drug storage, administration, and, as applicable, storage temperatures, and use of required processes.  
 Further details on accountability of study medication are in the Pharmacy Manual.  Further guidance and information on final disposition of unused and returned study medication and study supplies is provided in Appendix 1.   
8.4.6 Dose Modification 
8.4.6.1 Modification of Dose 
No dose reductions or modifications are allowed. If a participant interrupts treatment due to 
an AE, study medication may be restarted after consultation with the medical monitor.  
 
8.4.6.2 Dose Interruption 
If a participant has abnormal laboratory test  result(s) and/ or clinical  AE(s) that, in the 
judgment of the investigator, could place the participant at risk, study medication 
administration should be interrupted,  and the investigator should notify the medical monitor. 
Participants may receive further study medication when the AE or abnormal laboratory 
finding is resolved.  
 
8.4.6.3 Missed Doses 
If a participant misses a dose according to the protocol-outlined schedule, the participant (or 
caregiver, as applicable) should administer the dose as soon as possible and continue on t he 
original schedule with the exception that 2 doses of medication should not be administered less than 48 hours apart.  
8.4.7 Treatment Compliance 
Study medication compliance will be monitored periodically using standard drug 
accountability procedures. Drug acc ountability will be reviewed by the site study staff at each 
visit to confirm treatment compliance. If a participant misses 2 consecutive doses (not related to an AE/SAE), site staff will discuss discrepancies with the participant at each on -treatment 
study visit and counsel the participant of the importance of compliance with the assigned regimen. Participants and/or caregivers (as applicable) may be re-trained in study medication administration, if necessary to address study medication compliance issues. If the participant 
misses 2 more consecutive doses during the study, the investigator should consult with the medical monitor to determine the appropriate course of action for the continued treatment of the participant, which may include withdrawal of study medication.  
8.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All medications taken from within 3 months (12 weeks) before the Screening Period until the 
Week 52/PTFU Visit must be recorded on the eCRF. In addition, medications administered between the Week 52/PTFU Visit and the 6 Month Post PTFU Visit that could potentially

approved or investigational, will be recorded on the eCRF.  Prior medications are defined as medications taken prior to the first dose of study medication and discontinued before the first dose of study medication. Concomitant medications are defined as any medication taken after the first dose of study medication until the Week 52/PTFU Visit. Concomitant medications (e. g., prescription, over- the-counter, or herbal) 
should be administered during the study only if they are prescribed for treatment of specific clinical events.  
 Restrictions and prohibitions on prior and concomitant medications are described in Section  8.3.7. 
 
8.4.9 Treatment After the End of the Study  
At the end of the study, the sponsor will not continue to provide sponsor-supplied study 
medication to participants/investigators unless the sponsor chooses to extend the study. The investigator should ensure that each participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study.  The sponsor reserves the right to terminate access to sponsor-supplied study medication if any of the following occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns or other reasons; b) the development of BMS-986036 for treatment of NASH or other indications is terminated for other reasons, including but not limited to lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives; c) the participant can obtain medication from a government-sponsored or private health program. In all cases, the sponsor will follow local regulations.  
8.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables 
Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1). 
Waivers or exemptions from protocol-required evaluations are not allowed. 
 
8.5.1 Efficacy Assessments  
Every effort must be made to ensure that the same evaluator(s) complete the assessment for 
each participant. If the evaluator(s) is unable to complete the evaluation, then a qualified individual with overlapping experience may perform the evaluation. Documentation of who performed the evaluation is to be recorded in source documents. Assessments should be performed at approximately the same time of day throughout the duration of the study. Baseline assessments m ust be performed prior to dosing with study medication. Procedures 
not specified in the protocol that are part of standard care may be performed if they do not interfere with study procedures; any data arising from such procedures are not to be reported in the eCRF.  
 All efficacy assessments will be completed prior  to study medication administration . 
Participant questionnaires will be administered electronically, and information gathered

8.5.1.1 Liver Biopsy 
A liver biopsy will be performed at Screening if no liver biopsy specimen collected within 
6 months (26 weeks) prior to informed consent is available and readable by the Central Pathologist.   The on-treatment liver biopsy should be performed within ± 7 days of the Week 48 Visit. However, if a biopsy cannot be scheduled within the window specified above, the biopsy should be performed as close to schedule as possible.  For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication, liver biopsy will be performed at the ET Visit if the participant has completed at least Week 20. If a participant discontinues study participation prior to Week 20 they should consider having a liver biopsy at ET.  Histological assessment of the tissue sample will be conducted by a blinded Central Pathologist. The central reader will be a medical doctor, board certified in pathology, with experience in liver pathology in a clinical study setting.   The on- treatment liver biopsy results will remain blinded to site personnel until after the 
study database is locked; incidental findings of potential clinical relevance (as determined by the medical monitor)  from the central pathologist will be provided to the investigator. 
 Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the objectives of the study should be evaluated and handled by the investigator per the site’s standard of care and clinical ju dgment. 
 Liver tissue should be collected using a 16 gauge (or larger) cutting needle (e.g., Bard, Microvasive, or TruCut) whenever possible. Use of suction needles (e.g., Menghini, Jamshedi, or Klatskin) are allowed, but may cause fragmentation of fibroti c specimens and 
impede the evaluation of fibrosis, and should therefore be avoided, if possible. At least 2 cm length of tissue should be obtained.  Additional details on the acquisition, quality requirements, histological preparation, and shipping of hist ological samples are in the Central Laboratory Manual and the Central 
Pathology Manual.

NASH CRN  
For associated primary and secondary endpoints, the NASH CRN system27 will be used to 
score the histologi c samples and  results ar e reported as t he NAFLD A ctivity S core (NAS) 
and the NASH CRN Fibrosis Score. The NASH CRN system is based on the concept that 
necroinflammatory lesions and stage of fibrosis should be evaluated separately; it assesses 
liver biopsie s for degree of steatosis ( 0-3), lobular inflammation (0- 3), he patocellular 
ballooning (0-2), and fibrosis (0-4). 
NAS 
The 3 categories of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning scores are added together 
in an unweighted fashion to determine the NAS, which ranges from 0 to 8 (see Table 7 
below ).  
The NAS shoul

There is considerable intra- and inter-individual variation of hepatopathologist assessment of 
fibrosis stage on liver biopsy. Assessment of CPA is a method by which the amount (perc entage) of collagen in stained tissue Sections  is analyzed using morphometric image 
analysis. This allows for a quantitative assessment of fibrosis. Percentage of fat in stained tissue Sections  is also analyzed using morphometric image analysis. These morphometric 
assessments will be performed by a blinded Central Pathologist. Additional details on these morphometric assessments are in the Central Pathology Manual. 
 
Assessment of NASH and Fibros is Using Digital Pathology  
Liver  biopsy samples  will be evaluated  using digital pathology, which  may include automated  
techniques .29 
 
8.5.1.2 Noninvasive Scores of Hepatic Fibrosis 
The ELF, FIB4, APRI, and NAFLD Fibrosis Score are composite indices that have been correlated with fibrosis stage in NASH study participants.
23  
 
 
 ELF assay, FIB4, APRI, and NAFLD Fibrosis Score use a variety of algorithms combining a number of physical attributes and biochemical and hematologic test values to determine the 
level of the participant’s liver fibrosis (see  Appendix 10) . The s cores will be calculated by a 
computerized system based on laboratory values and nonlaboratory parameters entered into 
the eCRF by personnel at the site. The sites will not be required to calculate scores.  
 Details on the collection, processing, and shipping of samples for fibrosis scoring are in the 
Central Pathology Manual. 
• ELF assessment combines hyaluronic acid, procollagen 3 amino terminal peptide, and 
TIMP -1. A proprietary algorithm is used to evaluate each of these m arkers by 
immunoassay, to create an ELF Score 
• FIB4 scores fibrosis by combining participant age, ALT, AST, and platelet count. The formula used to calculate the FIB4 score is provided in Appendix 10  
• APRI scores fibrosis by combining AST and platelet count. The formula used to calculate the APRI Score is provided in Appendix 10

8.5.1.3 Imaging  
All participants will have imaging performed unless imaging is contraindic ated (see 
Section  8.3.4). Participants for whom imaging is contraindicated may still participate in the 
study. 
 
Magnetic Resonance Elastography 
MRE  is a noninvasive medical imaging technique that measures the stiffness of soft tissues 
by introducing shear waves  and imaging their propagation using MRI. In NASH patients, 
MRE is reproducible,33 and it has a higher interobserver agreement for staging fibrosis 
compared to histopathology.34 Additionally, an improvement in MRE has been associated 
with an improvement in liver fibrosis, as observed on liver biopsy.33,34 
 
Images will be collected by the site and submitted to a central imaging vendor for evaluation. Sites  should be trained and qualified before collecting study images. 
 Detailed instructions on the conduct of the MRE, and the acquisition and submission of MRE data to the central imaging vendor will be provided in the Imaging Manual.  The on- treatment MRE results will remain blinded to site personnel until after the study 
database is  locked . Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly 
associated with the objectives of the study should be evaluated and handled by the investigator per the site’s standard of care and clinical judgment.  For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication prior to Week 24, MRE should be conducted at the ET Visit if the date of discontinuation is more than 4 weeks from the date of the previous MRE. For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication after Week 24, MRE should be conducted at the ET Visit if the date of discontinuation is more than 8 weeks from the date of the previous MRE.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
Hepatic MRI is a noninvasive and accurate biomarker utilized for liver fat quantification. In 
NASH patients, MRI -PDFF accurately classifies grades and changes in hepatic steatosis ,31 
and a ≥ 29% reduction in MRI -PDFF has been associated with histological NAS 
improvement .32 
 Images will be collected by the site and submitted to a central imaging vendor for evaluation. Sites should be trained by the imaging vendor before collecting images.  Detai led instructions on the conduct of the MRI, and the acquisition and submission of MRI 
data to the central imaging vendor will be provided in the Imaging Manual.

8.5.1.4 Fibroscan
® Elastography 
Fibroscan® is a noninvasive device that assesses the ‘hardness’ (or stiffness) of the liver  via 
the technique of transient elastography. Liver hardness is evaluated by measuring the velocity 
of a vibration wave (also called a ‘shear wave’) generated on the skin. Shear wave velocity is determined by measuring the time the vibration wave takes to travel to a particular depth inside the liver. Because fibrous tissue is harder than normal liver, the degree of hepatic fibrosis can be inferred from the liver hardness.  With the participant lying supine, an ultrasound-like probe is placed on the skin over the liver area, typically in the right mid -axillary line. The participant will feel a gentle ‘flick’ each 
time a vibration wave is generated by the probe. Investigators and site personnel should refer to the equipment manufacturer’s information for deta iled instructions.  
 A minimum of 10 valid readings, with at least a 60% success rate of all measurements taken and an interquartile range of ≤ 30% of the median value, are taken with the results expressed in kilopascals (kPa).

olic Assessments  
Physical Metabolic Marker Assessments  
Body weight, waist circumfere nce, and BMI will be monitored as metabolic assessments.  
 
Weight must be recorded using a calibrated scale, preferably the same scale at each clinic visit. The participant should remove shoes and heavy clothing before standing on scale. 
 Waist circumference will be measured at the natural waist (smallest waist circumference). If 
there is no natural waist, the measurement should be made midway between the iliac crest and the bottom of the rib with the measuring tape horizontal all the way around the waist. Measurement should be made at the end of normal inspiration with the participant standing. 
The waist measurement reported on the eCRF should represent the average of at least 2 measurements. The average measurement should agree within 1 cm. If not, additional measurement(s) should be taken.  BMI is used as an index of obesity and is a method of defining normal body weight and excess body fat. It correlates in a population with percent body fat. BMI is determined by weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.  Note: All analysis calculations for BMI will be derived internally by the sponsor using height 
at Screening and weight at the specified time point.  
Laboratory Metabolic Assessments  
Blood will be drawn according to the Schedule of Events in Section  1 for the following 
laboratory metabolic marker assessments. Participants should fast for at least 8 hours prior to collection of the blood samples for t hese assessments.  
• Fasting lipids, including LDL, HDL, and TGs. The HDL/LDL ratio will be calculated using the results of these assessments 
• Glucose homeostasis markers including fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and hemoglobin A1c

The Child-Pugh Turcotte Score assesses the severity of cirrhosis, and has been shown to be 
an accurate measure across a broad spectrum of liver disease. It employs numerical scores of 5 measures of liver disease: total bilirubin, serum albumin, INR, ascites, and encephalopathy 
and is scored according to the scheme in Appendix 5. The sum of scores from each component is the final score.  Blood samples will be collected for the total bilirubin, serum alb umin, and prothrombin time 
assessments used to calculate the Child -Pugh Turcotte Score as part of the hematology and 
serum chemistry assessments conducted at each visit. The same laboratory will be used for each evaluation. Evaluations of ascites and encep halopathy should be conducted by the same 
site personnel at each visit wherever possible.  
8.5.1.8 MELD Scoring  
MELD scoring (see  Appendix 10) is a formula for assessing the severity of chronic liver 
disease that does not include subjective variables such as ascites and encephalopathy. It 
employs the participant’s bilirubin, serum creatinine, and INR.   Blood samples will be taken for bilirubin, serum creatinine, and prothrombin time as part of the hematology and serum chemistry asses sments conducted at each visit. The same 
laboratory will be used for each evaluation. The central laboratory will calculate the MELD Score based on the laboratory values and communicate the score to the site. MELD Scores will be determined at each visit th rough Week 52/PTFU. 
 All components of the MELD score should be completed on the same day. If any individual component needs to be repeated on another day, all other components must be repeated as well.  
 
8.5.1.9 Liver -Related Clinical Outcome Events  
Participants will be evaluated for the following liver -related clinical outcome events at each 
visit from Day 1 through Week 52/PTFU: 
o All-cause mortality  
o MELD Score ≥ 15 (with at least a 2- point increase from Baseline)  
o Liver transplant 
o Ascites requiring medical intervention  
o Hospitalization (≥ 24 hours) for onset of variceal bleed 
o Hospitalization (≥ 24 hours) for hepatic encephalopathy 
o Hospitalization (≥ 24 hours) for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
o HCC  
 
If a participant experiences one of the above events, the investigator should contact the 
medical monitor within 48 -72 hours to discuss further participation in the study.  
 
Liver -related clinical outcome events will also be reported as AEs/SAEs, as applicable, as per 
Section  8.5.3.1 and Appendix 9.

8.5.1.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes (Health -Related Quality -of-Life Questionnaires)  
HRQoL questionnaires will be completed electronically by the participant and data 
transferred as source. Due to potential bias, the questions should not be read to the participant. Participant questionnaires will be assessed at specific visits throughout the study. See Section  1 for details.  
 The EQ -5D-3L questionnaire (see  Appendix 7 ) is a general quality -of-life instr ument that 
consists of 2 components, health state description and evaluation. The health state description component measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Participants will rate their level of impairment in each dimension using a 3-level scale. In the evaluation component, participants evaluate their overall health status 
using a visual analog scale.  The SF -36 questionnaire (see  Appendix 6) is a commonly used patient- reported outcome 
instrument used to assess quality of life. The SF-36 is a 36-question instrument, which assesses 8 health concepts: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well- being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because 
of emotional problems; 7) vitality ( energy and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions. 
Each question has 5 answers scored 1 (unable to) to 5 (no difficulty). The scale score of each domain is calculated based on the summed score across items included in the domain and is rescaled to 0 t o 100. Version 2 of the SF-36 questionnaire will be used in the study. 
 The CLDQ -NAFLD questionnaire  
30 (see Appendix 8) is a disease- specific quality -of-life 
instrument for NAFLD and NASH. The CLDQ-NAFLD consists of 36 items in 6 domains: 
abdominal symptoms, activity, emotional function, fatigue, systemic symptoms, and worry. Each item is on a Likert scale with 1 representing the most impairment and 7 representing the least impairment.  
 The questionnaires should be administered prior to dosing and before any other study assessments are conducted.  
 
8.5.2 Exploratory Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of exploratory biomarkers as described in 
Table 8  in Section  8.5.4. Exploratory biomarkers will include the collection of serum, breath, 
plasma,  and whole blood, which will be used to assess markers of fibrosis and associated diseases and pathways (including cardiovascular disease, inflammation, diabetes, and liver disease as well as kidney disease and bone). Work may also include studies on the FGF21 pathway and mechanism of action as well as pathways impacted by BMS-986036. The goal is to better under stand NASH and associated diseases/syndromes and the effects of 
BMS -986036. These studies may include, but are not limited to, assessments listed in Table 8  
in Section  8.5.4.

Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1). All urgent safety concerns must be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or aw areness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.  
 Safety will be assessed using incidence of all AEs; the incidence of SAEs; the incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal of study medication; the incidence of AEs of special interest, immunogenicity, laboratory data, ECG monitoring, physical examinations, and monitoring of BMD via DXA.  
 
8.5.3.1 Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 9. 
 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant’s legally authorized representative).  
 The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious, considered related to the study medication or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue before completing the study.  For weight change (increase or decrease) to be considered an AE, the change should be 10% or more from Baseline that cannot be explained by lifestyle modifications alone.  Contacts for SAE reporting are specified in Appendix 9.  
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB represent the Reference Safety Information to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.  The collection of nonserious AEs should begin at initiation of study medication and continue until the Week 52/PTFU Visit ( Section  1).. 
 Following the participant’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study medication, must be collected, including those considered by the investigator to be related to study medication or protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs will be collected through the Week 52/PTFU Visit and will be reported as described in Appendix 9.   The investigator must report any SAE occurring after the Week 52/PTFU Visit that is believed to be related to study medication or a protocol- specified procedure.  
• Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study medication but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the appropriate Section  of the eCRF

indicated in Appendix 9  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of this information being available 
 Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study medication or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  The method of evaluating intensity and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 9.  
Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when collecting AEs and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgment in the context of known AEs, when appropriate for the program or protocol.  
Follow-Up and Recording of AEs and SAEs 
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious (see Appendix 9 ) 
• Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study medication and for those present at the end of study medication, as appropriate 
• All nonserious AEs and SAEs must be recorded and described on the corresponding 
pages of the eCRF. Completion of supplemental eCRFs may be requested for 
AEs/SAEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study 
 After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and nonserious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section  8.5.3.7)  will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, 
until the event is otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined 
in Section  8.3.9.3).  
 Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 9.  
 
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs

 Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and IRB/ECs according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A suspected unexpected ser ious adverse reaction is a 
subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.  
Pregnancy  
Urine or serum samples will be collected at each visit through the Week 52/PTFU Visit for 
pregnancy testing for WOCBPs. A negative serum pregnancy test is required during Screening. After the Screening Period, urine pregnancy testing will be conducted instead of serum testing at any site where it is allowed by  the IRB/EC overseeing study conduct at that 
site. 
 Investigators shall counsel WOCBPs on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy. Investigators shall advise on the use of highly effective methods of contracep tion (i.e., those that have a failure rate of < 1% when used 
consistently and correctly as discussed in Appendix 2).  
 If, following initiation of the study medication, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 5 half -lives after product administration (5 days) plus 30 days (duration of 
ovulatory cycle) for a total of 35 days after the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period, the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor medical monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to the sponsor designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 9.  The study medication will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please call the sponsor medi cal monitor within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Fo rm (Appendix 2).  
 Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to sponsor or designee during at least 5 half -lives after product administration (5 days) plus 
30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 35 days after the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period. In order for the sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of

• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study 
medication discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy  
 
It is expected that wherev er possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory ab normalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Appendix 9 for reporting 
details).  Repeat laboratory te sting may be performed locally , and the results should be 
promptly communicated to the investigator site.  
 For the purpose of evaluating a potential DILI, the Baseline value is defined as the mean of the test results from anal ysis of samples collected during Screening and on Day 1. 
 Note that the evaluation processes below do not replace SAE reporting per defined criteria in Appendix 9.  
Evaluation of Participants with New Elevations of Aminotransferases and/or Total Bilirubin  
Repeat  laboratory testing (including ALT, AST, fractionated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) 
and physical examination should be performed  within  48-72 hours when:  
 
• Participants with normal Baseline aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) values 
develop elevations greater than 3× the ULN based upon the central lab, or  
• Participants with elevated Baseline aminotransferase values experience additional increases greater than 2× the Baseline (with concomitant elevations of total bilirubin > 2× ULN) AND ALT and/or AST is > 200 U/L. 
 If the new elevations in aminotransferases persist and the participant is symptomatic, 
then  the drug  should be  discontinued, and the participant should be evaluated for other 
causes of liver injury or disease. The medical monitor should be contacted within 48- 72 
hours.  
 If the participant is  asymptomatic,  the participant should be placed under “close observation”, 
defined as physical  examination  and laboratory evaluation 2 -3 times per week.

If close observation is not possible, study medication should be discontinued. The frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study medication has b een discontinued and the participant is asymptomatic.  
 
Discontinuation or Temporary Interruption of Study Medication 
 
In addition to the reasons for discontinuation described above, study medication should be discontinued or temporarily interrupted if either  of the 2 following scenarios occur: 
 
1) Aminotransferases  (ALT and/or  AST) > 2× Baseline and aminotransferases > 3 × ULN  and 
either : 
 
i. the increase  is accompanied  by a concomitant increase  in total bilirubin  to 
> 2× Baseline OR the INR concomitantly increases by > 0.2; 
 OR 
 
ii. there are concomitant signs and symptoms  of new -onset fatigue, nausea,  
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness,  fever,  rash,  and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%).  
 
2) Total bilirubin increases to > 2 × ULN AND: 
i. there are concomitant signs and symptoms  of new-onset fatigue nausea,  
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain  or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%) 
 If the above rule is met, a  potential DILI work  up for competing etiologies (e.g., alcohol 
use, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, autoimmune liver disease)  must be performed,  and 
a complete  liver profile  including INR must be repeated
 within  48-72 hours. The medical 
monitor should be contacted within 48 -72 hours. Study  medication  can be restarted  only 
if an alternative  etiology is definitively  identified  and liver tests (aminotransferases, total 
bilirubin and/or INR) have returned  to Baseline.  
 
Other Safety Considerations 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical exams, ECGs, or any other potential safety assessments required or not required by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious AE or a serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. ECGs will be read and interpreted at the site or by a local reader.

4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF  
 
8.5.3.3 Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or equivalent, or 
someone who is authorized to perform the examinations by training and has been delegated this task by the principal investigator.   Full examinations and abbreviated examinations will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1).  
 A full examination will include general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, 
thyroid, chest/lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and body weight.   Abbreviated examinations will includ
e an abdominal exam and symptom-focused 
assessments. An abbreviated examination may note any changes in the participant’s condition 
(body systems) since the last assessment and does not preclude examination of any of the other body systems as clinically indicated. Every effort should be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the examination for each participant at all visits throughout the study. Documentation of who performed the examination is to be recorded in source notes.  
8.5.3.4 Vital Signs  
Schedules for vital sign collection are provided in Section  1. Vital signs will include heart 
rate, respiratory rate, sitting SBP and DBP (to be taken after at least 5 minutes sitting at rest), 
and oral temperature.  
 
8.5.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve- lead ECGs should be collected at similar times during Baseline and on -treatment 
visits. ECGs may be collected at any time prior to study medication dosing or PK sample 
collection. ECGs should be recorded after the participant has been supine for at least 5 minutes. ECG parameters, including QTcF, will be collected on the eCRF.  If a participant has a QTcF > 480 msec during the Screening Period, it should be confirmed by repeat ECG 30- 60 minutes after the initial ECG. If the QTcF is confirmed to be 
> 480 msec, the participant should not be allowed to participate in the study.

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  79 If a participant has a QTcF>480 msec at an on -treatment visit, it should be confirmed by 
repeat ECG 30 -60 minutes after the initial ECG. If  the QTcF is confirmed to be >480 msec, 
the medical monitor should be contacted. 
 
8.5.3.6 Immunogenicity 
Throughout the study, the potential for immunogenicity of BMS-986036 will be monitored as 
indicated in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1). In participants that experience 
immunogenicity, neutralizing activity and exposure- efficacy relationship will be assessed for 
evidence of a clinical impact on safety and efficacy.  
 
Immunogenicity Assessment Methodology 
Participants will be monitored for antibodies to BMS -986036 (drug) using an ADA 
homogenous bridge assay with electrochemical luminescence detection. Samples will first be screened for potential positive anti- BMS -986036 responses. Then, the samples with positive 
anti-BMS -986036 responses will be confirmed for specificity using an immunodepletion 
format with BMS -986036 and nonPEGylated drug. The reactivity of confirmed positive 
responses will be characterized as “BMS -986036” (specific to the FGF21 region) or “PEG” 
(specific to the PEGylated region) based on the immunodepletion specificity. Additionally, samples with confirmed positive responses will be titrated to determine the relative positive response.  Participants will also b e monitored for antibodies to FGF21 using recombinant Met-FGF21 in 
a homogenous bridge assay with electrochemical luminescence detection. Samples will first be screened for potential positive anti-FGF21 responses. Then the samples with positive antiFGF21 r esponses will be confirmed for specificity using an immunodepletion format with 
wild-type sequence FGF21. Samples with confirmed positive anti-FGF21 responses will be 
titrated to determine the relative positive response.  
 Samples positive for anti- BMS -986036 antibodies or positive for anti-FGF21 antibodies will 
be tested for neutralizing activity in a functional cell based neutralizing antibody assay. The assay measures the ability of an anti -BMS -986036 or anti-FGF21 antibody to inhibit or block 
Erk1 activation that is induced when FGF21 or drug binds to the β-Klotho and FGF- Rs. 
 
Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow- Up 
All participants will have samples collected for immunogenicity at 6 months (± 14 days) after the Week 52/PTFU Visit. Samples collected from participants may not be analyzed if: 1) participant is not on active drug, 2) participant is negative for anti-drug and/or anti- FGF21 
antibody titers at the Week 52/PTFU Visit, or 3) participant has evidence of stable or decreasing antibody titers for 2 visits prior to the 6- month posttreatment visit.  
 Participants with positive anti-drug and/or anti-FGF21 antibodies at the Week 52/PTFU Visit and without evidence of 2 consecutive stable or decreasing antibody titers will be followed for up to 14 months after the Week 52/PTFU Visit (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) until antibody titers decrease for 2 consecutive visits (these additional visits will be conducted at approximately 9 months and 12 months after the Week 52/PTFU Visit).

a participant has an increasing titer (compared to the previous titer), an additional follow-up 
visit will be performed at approximately 14 months (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after the Week  52/PTFU Visit; at this visit, anti-drug and anti-FGF21 antibodies, as well as 
additional laboratory assessments (basic metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1c  
), will be collected. 
 Participants who discontinue from the study prior to the Week 48 Visit will be offered additional Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits, as above. For these participants, prior immunogenicity results will be used  to determine whether the participant should be 
offered Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits beyond the 6- month posttreatment 
assessment. Additional Long-Term Immunogenicity Follow-Up Visits should occur approximately 9, 12, and 14 months, if applicable (1 month is defined as 4 calendar weeks) after their last study visit.  
 Refer to the decision tree in Appendix 11 for more details regarding Long- Term 
Immunogenicity Follow -Up Visits.  
 
8.5.3.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The sponsor has developed a list of AEs of Special Interest for the BMS-986036 program 
based on the known biologic class effects, the mechanism of action, and clinical study data. These will include the following: 
• Injection site reactions 
• Gastrointestinal events  
o Diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain 
• Bone- related events  
o Osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone and joint injuries, fractures (except tooth fracture), 
endocrine abnormalities of gonadal function not elsewhere classified (NEC), hyperparathyroid disorders, hypoparathyroid disorders, parathyroid disorders NEC, parathyroid analyses, metabolic bone disorders, vitamin D abnormal, vitamin D decreased, vitamin D deficiency, and miscellaneous events related to bone density 
 
8.5.3.8 Bone Safety by DXA 
Potential effects of BMS -986036 on BMD will be evaluated by DXA scans of the hip 
(including femoral neck) and spine that will be performed during the Screening Period and at 
the Week 48 Visit (or ET, i f applicable) as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section  1). 
Participants will return for a follow -up DXA assessment 6 months (1 month is defined as 4 
calendar weeks) after the Week 52/PTFU Visit.  DXA may be performed within a window of 
± 7 days of the scheduled Week 48/ET Visit and within a window of ± 14 days of the scheduled 6-month follow-up visit. DXA scans will be evaluated by central reading. Acquisition guidelines, instructions on calibration and the handling and submission of DXA scans are included in the Imaging Laboratory Manual. Note that at least one of the requested anatomic sites (hip [including femoral neck] or spine) must be evaluable for participants to be eligible for the study (See  Section  8.3.2).

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  81 For participants prematurely discontinuing study medication DXA scans should be conduc ted 
at the ET Visit only if the participant has completed at least the Week 16 Visit. If a 
participant has not completed at least Week 16, the follow-up DXA scan at 6 months after PTFU Visit should also not be performed.  
8.5.4 Laboratory Assessments 
Participant s should not administer study medication on the days of clinic visits until after all 
laboratory samples have been collected (see Table 8  below). Blood samples will be collected 
according to the schedule in Section  1. In addition, a number of hematology and blood 
chemistry values collected as part of the safety laboratory assessments will also be used to 
determine FIB4 index, APRI, and NAFLD Fibrosis Scores according to the schedule in Section  1. 
 Safety (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), efficacy, and exploratory laboratory assessments to be conducted during the study are listed in Table 8  below. The schedule for 
collection of samples for each assessment is in Section  1. Laboratory assessments will be 
conducted by central or specialty laboratories. Additional details on the collection, processing, and submission of samples for laboratory assessments are in the Study Laboratory Manual. If clinica lly indicated, repeat laboratory testing may be performed at a 
local lab.  
 Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. A central laboratory will perform the safety analyses and will provide reference ranges for these tests. Results of clinical laboratory tests performed during Screening must be available prior to dosing.  In addition to those detailed assessments outlined in Table 8  below, serum, plasma and urine 
may be assayed for exploratory markers associated with liver, fibrosis,  or 
metabolic syndrome disease including markers associated with the BMS-986036 target pathway or with organs or pathways impacted by FGF21.   Urine or serum samples will be collected for pregnancy testing for WOCBPs. A negative serum pregnancy test is required during Screening. After the Screening Period, urine pregnancy testing will be conducted instead of serum testing at any site where it is allowed by the IRB/EC committee overseeing study conduct at that site. Women who are considered postmenopausal will have follicle -stimulating hormone testing performed during Screening. 
 Urine samples to test for drugs of abuse will be collected during Screening.  Repeat assessments for any laboratory assessment will be permitted according to the investigator’s clinical judgment.

9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with a ≥ 1-stage improvement 
in fibrosis (as defined by NASH CRN Fibrosis Score) without worsening of NASH (as defined by the NAFLD Activity Score) at Week 48, as determined by liver biopsy.  It is planned to randomize approximately 100 participants to 1 of the 4 treatment groups (approximately 25 participants per group), BMS-986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 20 mg QW, BMS -986036 40 mg QW or matching placebo QW in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
 A Cochran -Armitage trend test of proportions, with an estimated response rate of 15% for the 
primary endpoint for placebo and response rates for BMS-986036 10 mg QW, BMS-986036 20 mg QW, and BMS-986036 40 mg QW of 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, would provide at least 70% power at a 1- sided α = 0.05 (based on original sample size estimate of 
approximately 100 participants) . The final sample size was approximately 155 participants 
(see Section  6.2).  
 
9.2 Populations for Analyses 
The following populations are defined for analysis purposes:  
 
Population Description  
Enrolled  All participants who sign informed consent.  
Randomized  All participants  who are randomized, analyzed as per 
randomized treatment.  
Modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT)  All participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 
dose of study medication, analyzed according to randomized 
treatment. All primary efficacy analyses will be conducted 
using this population. 
As treated (Safety)  All participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 
dose of study medication, analyzed according to treatment actually received. This population will be essentially the same 
as the mITT unless a participant received an incorrect 
treatment, i.e., a treatment different from what he/she was 
randomized to. All safety analyses will be conducted using this 
population. 
 
9.3 Stratification  
Randomization of participants will be stratified by country (Non- Japan/Japan). For 
participants in countries other than Japan, the randomization will be further stratified 
according to T2DM status (yes/no).

The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who achieve a ≥ 1-stage improvement 
in fibrosis (as defined by NASH CRN Fibrosis Score) without worsening of NASH (as 
defined by the NAFLD Activity Score) at Week 48, as determined by liver biopsy.  For th is protocol, improvement in fibrosis is defined as a decrease of fibrosis by ≥ 1 point, as 
determined by the NASH CRN Fibrosis Score. Worsening of NASH is defined as an increase of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) by ≥ 1 point (see Section  8.5.1.1).  
 A Cochran -Armitage trend test with a one -sided 0.05 level of significance will be used to 
examine the linear trend among the proportions across treatment groups. Also, 95% confidence intervals for the odds-ratio of each BMS treatment group to placebo will be provided.  A sensitivity analysis using an extended Cochran Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) correlation test
37 
will be used to assess the trend among the proportions for treatment groups with an adjustment to strata. A two -sided 0.10 level of significance will be used. 
 Since this is a Phase 2 study, no adjustment for multiplicity will be applied.  
 
All participants who prematurely discontinue from treatment without a biopsy at Week 48 (or ET, if applicable) or otherwise have a missing Week 48 (or ET, if applicable) biopsy result will be considered nonresponders for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. In addition, a completer analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed excluding particip ants without a Week 48 biopsy. 
 
9.5.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using methodology consistent with that of the primary 
endpoint unless otherwise specified in the SAP.  Further details of the primary and secondary analyses, any additional sensitivity analyses and data handling details regarding issues such as missing data will be provided in the SAP.  
9.5.2.3 Methods for Handling Treatment Discontinuations and Other Causes of Missing 
Data  
Participants who prematurely discontinue study medication will be expected to complete an Early Termination visit (Week 48/ET) and must continue to be followed for follow -up 
visits/procedures per the Schedule of Activities (e.g., Week 52/PTFU; Section  1).  
 Primary efficacy analyses will include all data that are collected on a participant during the study even after treatment discontinuation. All primary efficacy analyses will be performed with the mITT population, analyzed according to randomized treatment.

Additional details for handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  
9.5.3 Safety Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed using the As Treated population. For analysis, all 
treatment -emergent (i.e., occurring after the first dose of study medication) AEs, SAEs, and 
AEs of special interest will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment. Vital signs, immunogenicity, BMD, and laboratory data will be summ arized by 
treatment. ECG abnormalities, physical examination abnormalities, if present, will be summarized.  
 Responses of anti- BMS -986036 antibodies and anti-FGF21 antibodies will be listed and 
tabulated by treatment and study day.  
 
 
9.5.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Trough BMS-986036 serum concentrations (in all participants at all visits)  
 
will be summarized by 
treatment and visit.  
 
The PK data obtained in this study may be combined with data from other studies of BMS -986036 to develop a population PK/PK-PD model. This model will be used to evaluate 
the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic (if applicable) covariates (e.g., immunogenicity and renal function) on the PK of BMS-986036 and to determine measures of individual exposure (such as peak, trough, and time- averaged concentration following a single dose) of BMS-986036. 
Model determined exposures will be used for exposure- response analyses of selected efficacy 
and safety endpoints, as appropriate. Details of the planned population PK and exposure-response analyses will be covered in a separate pharmacometric analysis plan and the results of the population PK and exposure- response analyses presented in a pharmacometric report, 
separate from the clinical study report.  
 
9.5.5 Analyses of Exploratory Endpoints 
Analyses for the exploratory efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP, which will 
detail the derivation of the endpoints and associated statistical methods and models.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  99 Appendix 1  Study Administrative Considerations  
The term ‘participant’ is intended to refer to a person who has consented to participate in the 
clinical research study.  
 
Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
 
Good Clinical Practice  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
• GCP guidelines 
• as defined by ICH guidance 
• in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 
2001/20/EC 
• United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
• applicable local requirements  
 The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opinion by IRB/EC, and regulatory authorities according to applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study. All potential serious breaches must be reported to sponsor or designee immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity o f the participants of the study or the scientific value of the study. 
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
 
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
 Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/EC for the protocol, consent form, participant recruitment materials (e.g., advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to participants. The investigator or sponsor should also provide the IRB/EC with a copy of the IB or product labeling information to be provided to participants and any updates.   The investigator, sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/EC with reports, updates and other information (e.g., expedited safety repor ts, amendments, and administrative letters) 
according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  100 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions  
 
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/EC (and 
if applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study participants.   If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as soon as possible to: 
• IRB/EC 
• Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations (per national requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB/EC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to the sponsor.  If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB/EC(s) for review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from participants currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new participants prior to enrollment.  If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB/EC(s).  
 
Financial Disclosure  
 Investigators and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statemen ts to the appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
Informed Consent Process  
 Investigators must ensure that participants are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate.  
 In situations where consent cannot be given to participants, their legally accept able 
representatives (as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate.   The sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., global or local) sample ICF which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP, and applicable

origin in the Dec laration of Helsinki.  
 
 Inv
estigators must: 
• Provide a copy of the ICF and written information about the study in the language in which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be nontechnical and easily understood 
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative to inquire about the details of the study 
• Obtain an ICF signed and personally dated by the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion 
• Obtain the IRB/EC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF and any other information to be provided to the participants, prior to the beginning of the study, and 
after any revisions are completed for new information  
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.  Revise the ICF whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the participant’s consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.   The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the participants’ signed ICF and, in the United States, the participants’ signed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Authorization.

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  102 The consent form must also include a statement  that the sponsor and regulatory authorities 
have direct access to participant records.  
 
Participants unable to give their written consent (e.g., those with stroke or severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally accepta ble representative. The 
participant must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she should personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a participant who is unable to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be considered by the investigator.  The rights, safety, and well-being of the study participants are the most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
Source Documents  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, contemporaneous, original, and attributable, whether the data are hand-written on paper or entered electronically. If source data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, o r transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/or any other 
kind of electronic devices) as part of regulated clinical study activities, such systems must be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatures. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/health records, AE tracking/reporting, protocol-required assessments, and/or drug accountability records.  When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy having all of the same attributes and information as the original.   
Study Medication Records  
 The study personnel will account for all study medications dispensed to and returned from the participant . Study site personnel will account for all unused study medications a t the site, 
and unused study medication will be destroyed at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee for appropriate destruction, depending on circumstances. Records for study medications (whether supplied by the sponsor, its vendors, or the site) must substantiate study medication integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, and through destruction or return. Records will be reconciled with existing study medication by a study monitor prior to destruction of the product. Certificates of destruction should be signed 
and will be included in the Trial Master File. Records must be made available for review at 
the request of sponsor/designee or a health authority.

does not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
 
Case Report Forms  
 
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance understanding of product safety. eCRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported or identified during the course of the study.  For sites using the sponsor or designee electronic data capture (EDC) tool, eCRFs will be prepared for all data collection fields with the exclusion of data collection associated with pregnancy, which will be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study- specific eCRF completion guidelines 
provided by sponsor or designee.  The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).

Each individual electronically signing electronic eCRFs must meet sponsor or designee training requirements and must only access the study EDC tool using the unique user account provided by sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals.  
Monitoring  
 The sponsor or designee r epresentatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues 
to determine a schedule of on -site visits for targeted review of study records. 
 Representatives of the sponsor or designee must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodicall y to assess the data quality and study integrity. On site, they will review study 
records and directly compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable. Certain eCR F pages 
and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents.  In addition, the study may be evaluated by the sponsor or designee internal auditors and government inspectors who must be allowed access to case report forms, source documents, other study files, and study facilities. The sponsor audit reports will be kept confidential.  The investigator must notify the sponsor promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to sponsor or designee.  
 
Records Retention  
 The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for the period specified by the sponsor or designee, whichever is longer. The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact the sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with the study.  The sponsor or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) when the study records are no longer needed.  If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, study site, IRB/EC). Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to the sponsor or designee.

If …  Then  
Study medications supplied by the sponsor 
(including its vendors) Any unused study medications supplied by 
the sponsor can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible study monitor unless study medications containers must be immediately destroyed as required for safety, or to meet local regulations (e.g., cytotoxics or biologics). 
If study medications will be returned, the return will be arranged by the responsible study monitor. 
 
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept. The following minimal standards must be met: 
• On-site disposal practices mu st not expose humans to risks from the drug 
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances 
• Written procedures for on -site disposal a re available and followed. The procedures must 
be filed with the site’s standard operating procedures and a copy provided to the sponsor 
upon request 
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the date 
disposed, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal (e.g., incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor) must be documented 
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up- to-date, and available for the study 
monitor to review throughout the clinical study period  
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers.  
If conditions for destruction cannot be met, the responsible study monitor will make arrangements for return of study medications provided by the sponsor (or its vendors). Destruction of nonstudy medications sourced by the site, not supplied by the sponsor, is solely the responsibility of the investigator or designee.

A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBPs:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40  mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
 
Note:  Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a 
physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT 
used. The duration of the washout periods below are suggested guidelines and the 
investigators should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels.  
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels) 
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products 
• 8 week minimum for oral products 
 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum 
FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be 
considered postmenopausal. 
Contraception Guidance for Female Participants of Child Bearing 
Potential  
At minimum, one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below is required 
during study duration and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, as defined in 
Section  8.3.1.

Clinical Protocol  
BMS-986036 (pegbelfermin)  Study MB130-069 
30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  108 Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception 
methods (e.g., one highly effective method plus another method). 
Contraceptive Methods Classified as Highly Effective  
User Dependent Methods  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationb  
− oral  
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
− oral  
− injectable  
User Independent Methods  
• Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation b 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c  
• Intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS)c 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
 
• Sexual abstinence   
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
medication. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBPs who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP chooses to forego complete abstinence.

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  109 NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study medication, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, 
alternative methods of contraception should be utilized.  
c Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness.  
 
Contraceptive Methods Not Classified as Highly Effective  
User Dependent Methods  
Failure rate of > 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide. Male and female condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously 
• Diaphragm with spermicide 
• Cervical cap with spermicide  
• Vaginal Sponge with spermicide 
• Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action  
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception  
• Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptother mal, post -ovulation methods)  
• Withdrawal (coitus interruptus). 
• Spermicide only 
• Lactation amenorrhea method  
Methods of Contraception Not Considered Effective in Japan  
• Diaphragm with spermicide* 
• Cervical cap with spermicide*  
• Vaginal Sponge with spermicide*  
• Male condom with spermicide* or male condom without spermicide or male condom 
applied spermicide

Diagnostic Criteria for Psychoactive Substance 
Dependence  
A maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or 
distress as manifested by 3 (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-
month period: 
1. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: 
a) A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or 
desired effect,  
b) Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. 
2. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: 
a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance, 
b) The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal 
symptoms. 
3. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.  
4. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful eff orts to cut down or control substance use. 
5. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (e.g., chain -smoking) or 
recover from its effects.  
6. Impor tant social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced 
because of substance use.  
7. The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurring physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by 
the substance (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine -induced 
depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption.) 
 
Criteria for Severity of Psychoactive Substance Dependence:  
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the 
symptoms result in no more than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual 
social activities or relationships with others.  
Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe”. 
Severe: Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
markedly interfere with occupational functioning or with usual social activities or 
relationships with others. 
In Partial Remission: During the past 6 months, some use of the substance and some symptoms of dependence.

neglect of children or household). 
2. Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use). 
3. Recurrent substance- related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substanc e-related 
disorderly conduct). 
4. Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights). 
B. The symptoms have never met the criteria for substance dependence for this class of 
substance.

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  131 Appendix 9  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: Definitions 
and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -Up 
and Reporting  
Adverse Events  
Adverse Event Definition:  
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition in a clinical investigation participant after initiation of study medication 
(BMS -986036 or placebo) and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study medication. 
 
Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer  to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)  
NOTE:  
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in sponsor clinical studies:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event) 
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for Baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
• Medical/surgical admiss ion other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above); examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meet ing the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  
Potential DILI is defined as: 
• ALT or AST > 3× ULN  
 AND  
• Total bilirubin > 2× ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase) 
 AND  
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT or AST elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic 
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via the study medication is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential DILI are not always serious by 
regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. 
Evaluating AEs and SAEs  
Asses sment of Intensity  
The intensity of AEs is determined by a physician and will use the following level:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities 
• Moderate:  An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities

30 January 2020  BMS Confidential  133 • Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an even; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
Assessment of Causality  
The causal relationship to study medication is determined by a physician and should be 
used to assess all AEs. The causal relationship can be one of the following: 
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study medication administration and the AE. 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study medication 
administration and the AE.  
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited  information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow- up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study medication or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 
24 hours to the sponsor (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
Reporting of SAEs to Sponsor or Designee 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study medication, and pregnancies must be 
reported to  Drug Safety within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form. For studies capturing SAEs through 
EDC, electronic submission is the required method for reporting. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.  
Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:

Method of BMI Calculation: 
 
• Use actual height and wei ght collected on the same day. Whenever possible, body weight 
should be measured using the same scale throughout the study. 
• To calculate BMI:  
o Convert weight pounds to kg (kg = pounds/2.2) 
o Convert height inches to centimeters (cm = inches × 2.54) 
o BMI = (weight in kg)/(height in cm/100)2

Planned Total Number of Study Cente rs and Location(s) :
Approximately 45investigative centers in North America.
Study Population :
Male and female subjects 18 years of age or older who are de novo, living or deceased donor kidney 
recipients and have biopsy -proven primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( pFSGS)
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/ Randomized :
60 (30 subjects in each arm [Arm 1: S OCregimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and 
MMF)] and [Arm 2: Bleselumab regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and
bleselumab )])
Study Design Overview:
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, open -label, active control, multi -center study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of bleselumab in p reventing the rFSGS in de novo kidney transplant subjects.
The study will consist of the following periods:
Screening (days -21 to -1)
Transplant (day 0 [zero])
Post-transplant (day 0/post -skin closure through 12 months post -transplant)
Prior to any study -related assessments, the Informed Consent Form (ICF)/Authorization will be 
signed by the subject (visit 1). All subjects will enter into a screening period (days -21 to -1 prior to 
transplant), undergo a transplant (day 0), and are then to be followed for up to 12 months in the post -
transplant period (day 0/post -skin closure through 12 mon ths post -transplant) for efficacy and safety.
Randomization can occur up to 4 days prior to or on day 0 (prior to transplant). Subjects will be 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by previous kidney transplant status (no or yes) to open -label 
treatment of 1of 2arms as follows:
Arm 1 -SOC regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and MMF).
Arm 2 -Bleselumab regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and bleselumab ).
All subjects will receive induction therapy with basiliximab (Sim ulect® [the first dose as a 20 mg 
bolus injection prior to transplantation or intra -operativ ely before revascularization, and the second a 
20 mg bolus injection on day 3 or 4 or 5 post -transplant]).
For subjects randomized to Arm 2, bleselumab 200 mg will be given intravenously over 30 minutes 
on day 0, to be initiated intra -operatively prior to revascularization of the allograft, and then at 
200mg per infusion on days 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 90/month 3, and once per month through 
month 12.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Statistical Methods
Sample size justification
The primary variable is rFSGS defined by nephrotic range proteinuria with protein -creatinine ratio 
(≥3.0 g/g) through 3 months post -transplant. Death, graft loss or lost to follow -up will be imputed as 
rFSGS.
This proof -of-concept study will provide an estimate of the effect size for the difference in the rFSGS 
between the standard of care and the experimental group and provide estimates of the recurrence rates 
for each treatment group. The estimate of the effect size will be needed to plan a future study.
The following table provides a subset of estimates and the 95% confidence interval for the FSGS 
recurrence rate with 30 subjects per treatment group. The width of these confidence intervals varies 
between 17 and 36% indicating the limit of the precision for the estimate.
Proportion ( %) 95% Confidence Interval with 30 Subjects (%)
3.3 (1/30) 0.1 -17.2*
16.7 (5/30) 3.4 -30.0
33.3 (10/30) 16.4 -50.2
50.0 (15/30) 32.1 -67.9
66.7 (20/30) 49.8 -83.6
83.3 (25/30) 70.0 -96.6
96.7 (29/30) 82.8 -99.9*
*Exact binomial confidence interval using Clopper -Pearson (exact method based on the Beta 
distribution); for all others the normal approximation was used to calculate the intervals.
It has been estimated from the literature that the expected FSGS recurrence rate for the SOC group i s 
between 30 and 50% following a first kidney transplant and up to 80% for re -transplant with most 
occurring by three months post -transplant. In the previous study with these same treatments in kidney 
transplant patients, there were 3 of approximately 50 patients who experienced death, graft loss, or 
loss to follow -up in each of the two planned treatment arms. Thus, imputing death, graft loss or lost -
to-follow -up as rFSGS is not expected to have a sizeable and differential impact on the rFSGS 
estimates. Lit erature estimates of FSGS recurrence were used to examine the precision provided with 
30subjects per treatment group.
Bleselumab was assumed to decrease the recurrence rate in the experimental arm by 20 to 60% 
relative to SOC. The following table provides the difference in the observed rates and the associated 
2-sided 95% confidence interval with 30 subjects per group. The width of the confidence interval for 
the difference between the two treatment groups ranges between 47 and 57%. The width of the 
confid ence interval provides the precision of the estimate for the difference in recurrence between the 
two groups.

General Considerations
For an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), previous kidney 
transplantation (no, yes) will be included as a factor in the model if there is a sufficient number of 
patients with more than one kidney transplantation. Endpoints analyzed with Fisher’s Exact te st may 
be analyzed with a CMH test stratifying by previous kidney transplant status (noor yes ) if there is a 
sufficient number of patients with more than 1kidney transplantation. For time -to-event endpoints, 
Cox regression will be used comparing the 2treatment groups and will include previous kidney 
transplantation (no, yes) in the model provided there are sufficient multi -transplant patients.
Efficacy
The percentage of subjects who have a rFSGS, defined by nephrotic range proteinuria or death, graft 
loss or loss to follow -up, by 3, 6 and 12 months will be computed along with a 95% CI for each 
estimate and the treatment difference (Arm 2 –Arm 1). Simila r summaries will be created for the 
biopsy -proven rFSGS by a blinded, central read at 3, 6 and 12 months. Treatment differences (Arm 2 
–Arm 1) in BPAR incidence (T -or B-cell) through 3, 6 and 12 months will be calculated. A 2-sided 
95% confidence interva l will be constructed for the treatment differences
Efficacy failure, defined as BPAR, death, graft loss or lost to follow -up will be analyzed as described 
for rFSGS.
The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value based on MDRD criterion at 12 months 
will be compared between the control and experimental groups using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as a factor and the week 4 value as a covariate.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Graft survival is defined as an absence of all of the following: subject death, r e-transplant, 
nephrectomy, or return to permanent dialysis (> 30 days). Incidence of graft survival will be provided 
and compared between the treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. A 95% CI will be constructed 
for the treatment difference (Arm 2 –Arm 1) in incidence of graft survival at one year. If there are 
subjects with an unknown outcome, they will be treated as having a graft loss in one analysis and 
excluded in the second analysis. Patient survival will be analyzed in a like manner.
Kaplan -Meier estimates of FSGS recurrence, biopsy -confirmed FSGS, BPAR, efficacy failure rate, 
graft survival, and patient survival at one year will be calculated. The treatment difference will be 
computed as Arm 2 -Arm 1. A positive difference indicates a higher failure rate in the test group and 
a negative difference indicates a higher failure rate in the standard of care arm. A 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be constructed for the treatment difference from the normal approximation 
using Greenwood’ s formula. A Wilcoxon test will be used to compare survival curves. In kidney 
transplant studies efficacy failure tends to occur early and the Wilcoxon test is a more powerful test in 
detecting differences early in time. Recurrence of FSGS generally occurs early post -transplant.
Subjects with unknown outcome, if they exist, will be treated as having the event in one analysis and 
will be counted as censored in a second analysis.
There will be no adjustment for multiplicity in this proof -of-concept study.
Theurine protein -creatinine ratio, albumin -creatinine ratio will be summarized over time. The 
urine -protein creatinine ratio and the urine albumin -creatinine ratio collected up to week 4 will be 
analyzed with an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a factor and the post -transplant value as 
the covariate. The urine -protein creatinine ratio and the urine albumin -creatinine ratio after week 4 
will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and the week 4 value as a covariate.
The eGFR at 3, 6 and 12 m onths, the change from week 4 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA with 
the week 4 value at the covariate.
Auto -anti-CD40 antibodies (present or absent), antibody level and change from baseline will be 
summarized by treatment group.
For the EuroQol -5 dimension s-5 levels (EQ -5D-5L), the percentage of patients in each treatment arm 
who report problems (dichotomized to no, yes) for each of the 5dimensions ( mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) will be tabulated and graphic ally displayed. For 
each dimension, the percentage of patients who respond with no issue, slight issue, moderate issue, 
severe issue, and unable to function will be provided. The percentage of patients who report ‘yes’ for 
each of the EQ -5D-5L dimensions w ill be compared between the treatment groups at each visit using 
Fisher’s Exact test. The change from baseline for the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score, part of the 
EQ-5D-5L, will be analyzed by using an ANCOVA with treatment group as a fixed factor and t he 
baseline VAS score as a covariate.
The change from baseline in the Kidney Transplant Questionnaire (KTQ) score for each of the 
5domains (physical symptoms, fatigue, uncertainty/fear, appearance, and emotional) at 3 and 
12months will be analyzed using an ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline as a covariate.
QualityMetric will calculate SF -36v2 scale scores, and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and 
Mental Component Summary (MCS). By -treatment group summaries of the 8t domains and the PCS 
andMCS will be provided at each visit using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, sd, min and 
max). Between -group comparisons of the scores will be completed with an ANOVA with treatment 
group as the factor.

Leading to the permanent discontinuation of study drug
Descriptive statistics for each laboratory test (e.g., hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) and its 
change from baseline (month 1 for renal tests) and vital signs will be tabulated by treatment group and 
scheduled time point.
Presence of CMV, EBV and BKV and the viral load data for each, if present, will be summarized by 
scheduled visit and treatment grou p.
Interim Analysis
An interim analysis is planned once all subjects have completed the 3 months post -transplant follow -
up to assess treatment differences for rFSGS. The purpose of this analysis is to support strategic 
decision making for future project de velopment and study design. The result will aid in determining if 
this compound will continue development for rFSGS.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 21 INTRODUCTION
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS )is an important cause of glomerular disease in 
children and adults where approximately  40 to 60% of subjects will progress to ESRD in 10 to 
20 years [Cravedi et al, 2013]. I n the US, primary  focal segm ental glomerulosclerosis ( pFSGS )
is the leading glomerular disease in dial ysis subjects. I n pFSGS subjects who receive kidney  
transplants, the rate of developing recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (rFSGS) 
ranges from 6 to 55% [Trachtman et al, 20 15]and patients with rFSGS who are re -transplanted
experience disease recurrence with a higher frequency  [Delville, et al, 2014] . With no 
approved pharmacologic therap y and limited effectiveness with other treatment options such as 
plasmapheresis, man y subjects with rFSGS suffer the consequences of the recurrence within 
3months in the form of nephrotic s yndrome and its sequelae [Canaud et al , 2010].
1.1 Back ground
Although the pathogenesis of FSGS is not fully  understood, cluster of differentiation ( CD)40 is 
reported to overexpress on podocy tes from rFSGS subjects [Delv ille et al, 2014]. I n addition,
anti-CD40 autoantibodies are present in the serum of rFS GS subjects ; and pre -transplant
elevation of anti -CD40 antibody  is reported to correl ate with the risk of rFSGS post -transplant.
Bleselumab , a fully  human immunoglobuli n (Ig G)4 anti -CD40 antagonistic monoclonal 
antibody , may  block the interaction of the ant i-CD40 autoantibodies with CD40 expressed on 
podocy tes, thereby  reducing antibody -mediated cytotoxicity . Alternativel y, in an adriam ycin-
induced FSGS animal model, an increase in CD40 expression was observed in the podocy tes, 
and renal injury  was reduced by  the adminis tration of the murine anti -CD40 ligand monoclonal 
antibody  MR1; the authors suggest th at MR1 might have inhibited the interaction of CD40
ligand (CD154, CD40L) expressing inflammatory  cells wit h CD40 present on the podocy tes
thereb y reducing renal damage [Kairaitis et al, 2003]. Whi chever mechanism is responsible for 
renal injury  in FSGS, bleselu mab could have a therapeutic effect by  either preventing the
binding of CD40 autoantibodies to the podocy tes or by  blocking the interaction of CD40L
expressing inflammatory  cells with the podocy tes.
1.2 Non-clinical and Clinical Data
1.2.1 Mechanism of Action
Blesel umab is a fully  human anti -CD40 monoclonal antibody  (IgG4) antagonist that inhibits 
both humoral (immunoglobulin production) and cellular immune responses by  blocking the 
CD40/CD154 interaction between T cells, B cells, and antigen -presenting cells.
Blesel umab inhibits peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation, up -regulation 
of B cell activation marker, and dendritic cell cy tokine production ( interleukin [ IL]-12 and 
tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ]-alpha) induced b y soluble CD154 ( sCD154 ). Collectiv ely, these 
results suggest that bleselumab will have an immunosuppressive effect.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 21.2.2 Summary of Nonclinical Pharmacology
An in vitro flow cy tometry  study  confirmed that bleselumab binds to CD40 on human and
monkey  B lymphocy tes (Study  7163 -PH-0001). Geometric mean half -maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC 50) values for human and cy nomolgus monkey  B cells were 18.1 and
43.8 ng/mL, respectivel y.
Two pilot and one pivotal in vitro validation studies were performed to determine the effect of 
varying conce ntrations of bleselumab in human whole blood on CD40 surface antigen
occupancy  (Studies 7163 -PH-0002 [pilot], 7163 -PH-0014 [pilot] and 7163 -PH-0015 [pivotal]). 
All three studies showed that the level of cell surface CD40 antigen occupancy  onhuman B 
cells (CD20+ cells) was concentration dependent. I n the pivotal validation study ,the mean 
IC50was determined to be 22.2 ng/mL.
The results from in vitro studies with cy nomolgus monkey  B cells were very  similar to those
seen with human B cells, suggesting that the cy nomolgus monkey  is the most appropriate
species for further investigation of bleselumab. The pharmacod ynamics of bleselumab in the
monkey  was related to the serum bleselumab concentration.
Bleselumbab monotherapy  in a kidney  transplantation model in cynomolgus monkey s showed
that the mean survival time (MST) for the minimum dose level (1 mg/kg twice weekl y)during 
the induction phase of the study  was 54.7 day s compared to a MST of 6.0 day s for the control 
group (Study  7163 -PH-0005). These results toge ther with the results from the delay ed-type

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2hypersensitivity  model (Study  7163 -PH-0011) suggest that the minimum effective dose of 
bleselumab is 1 mg/kg. When bleselumab was used alone or in combination with other 
immunosuppressants in a cy nomolgus monkey  kidney  transplantation study, bleselumab 
prolonged median survival time in a dose -dependent manner, and showed an additive effect 
when combined with tacrolimus (FK506; 1 mg/kg) or my cophenolate mofetil (MMF; 
15mg/kg) plus steroid (Study  7163 -PH-0004). In a kidney transplantation study  in cy nomolgus 
monkey s evaluating the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacody namics, 
bleselumab serum concentrations and antigen occupancy  were correlated, with high antigen 
occupancy  dependent on high serum blese lumab concentrations (Study 7163 -PH-0017).
1.2.3 Summary of Toxicology
A single -dose intravenous toxicity  study  of bleselumab was conducted in cy nomolgus monkey s 
(Study  7163 -TX-0001). Seven animals per group were administered intravenous bleselumab at 
doses of 0 (saline or vehicle), 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg. There were no deaths or toxicologic 
findings related to bleselumab administration. I mmunophenoty pic and histopathologic changes 
related to the pharmacologic effect of bleselumab were noted. CD40+CD45+cell counts 
decreased over time, most noticeably  at 10 and 100 mg/kg. A decrease in CD3-CD20+cells 
was noted in 1 male at 100 mg/kg. Atroph y of the germinal center in the spleen was noted with 
all doses. Atroph y of the germinal center in the mesenteric lymph node was observed at 10 and 
100mg/kg, and occurred in the submandibular lymph node only at the 100 mg/kg dose level . 
No anti -bleselumab antibody  was detected in any  animal. 
A 4-week intermittent repeated dose toxicity  study  of bleselumab with a 4 -week recovery  
period was conducted in the cy nomolgus monkey  (Study  7163 -TX-0002). Bleselumab was 
evaluated in groups of 3 males and 3 female monkey s at dose levels of 0 (control), 1, 10 and 
100mg/kg per week for 4 weeks. An additional 3 male sand 3 females were added to each 
treatment group to assess the reversibility  of findings during the recovery  period. There were 
no deaths and no toxicological changes related to bleselumab administration with respect to 
clinical observations, body  weight, food consumpt ion, hematology , immuno phenoty ping, 
blood chemistry , urinaly sis, organ weights, gross pathology , ophthalmology, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), blood gas analy sis, respiration rate and body  temperature [I nvestigator Brochure, 
2016].No anti -bleselumab antibodies were detected in any  animal at any  time point.
Changes in histopathology  and immunohistochemistry  related to the pharmacological effect of 
bleselumab were noted at all dose levels of bleselumab . Histopathology  findings included 
atrophy  of the germinal cent er of the spleen, submandibular and mesenteric ly mph nodes, and 
Peyer’s patches. Corresponding to these histopathologic findings, weak reaction to anti -CD20 
antibody  was observed in the germinal center area of the spleen and l ymph nodes in 
immun ohistochemi stry evaluations. These findings were almost completely reversed at the end 
of the 4 -week recovery  period in the 1 mg/kg treatment group and were partially  reversed in 
the 10 mg/kg dose group. The 100 mg/kg dose group showed no attenuation in the findings at 
the end of the 4 -week recovery  period.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2A 13 -week intermittent repeated dose toxicity  study  of bleselumab with a 13 -week recovery  
period was conducted in the cy nomolgus monkey  (Study  7163 -TX-0005). Bleselumab was 
administered intravenously  once weekly  for 4 weeks and once every  2 weeks, thereafter, from 
the 6th dosing, for a total of9 dose administrations , at dose levels of 0 (control), 1, 10, and 
100mg/kg to 3 male and 3 female cy nomolgus monkey s per group in order to investigate its 
toxicity . Three males and three females were added to each group in order to assess the 
reversibility  of any  toxicity  observed during the dosing period in a subsequent 13 -week 
recovery  period. The animals in the control group re ceived bleselumab placebo. Sy stemic 
exposures to bleselumab and anti -bleselumab antibody  production were also evaluated. Clinical 
signs, bod y weight, food consumption, body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 
electrocardiograph y, ophthalmology , urinal ysis, hematology , immunophenoty ping, blood 
chemistry , serum cy tokine, gross pathology , organ weights, and histopathology  were conducted. 
A progressive decline in ery throcy te count was noted in 1 female in the 100 mg/kg group from 
week 9 of dosing, an d reticulocy te ratio also decreased. Ery throcy te count continued to decline 
and the animal was sacrificed in a moribund state on recovery day 47.Histopathology  of the 
bone marrow showed only  slight hematopoietic cell degeneration; however, electron 
microscop y showed presence of virus -like particles . It was hy pothesized that the death of this 
female was due to an infectious process, possibl y viral, secondary  to the immunosuppressive 
activity  of the test article.
The histopathology  changes described below during or after the dosing period were considered 
to be results of a pharmacological effect. In the 1 mg/kg group, atroph y of the germinal center 
was observed in the spleen in 1 male and in the submandibular ly mph nodes in 1 other male . In 
the 10 mg/kg group, atrophy  of the germinal center was observed in the spleen, submandibular, 
and mesenteric ly mph nodes in all males and females, and in the Pey er’s patches in 2 males 
and 2 females . In the 100 mg/kg group, atroph y of the germinal center was observed in the 
spleen, submandibular and/or mesenteric l ymph nodes, and in the Pey er’s patches in all males 
and females . These histopathology  changes were comp letely  reversed by  the end of the 
13week recovery  period.
Immunophenot ypic changes were observed in both male and female monkeys administered 
bleselumab at the 10 or 100 mg/kg dose levels. At the 10 mg/kg dose level, CD3-CD20+cell 
count decreased b y more than 50% in 4 males and 1 female at weeks 9 and/or 13 of dosing. 
Two of the four male animals showed CD3-CD20+cell counts that were below the lower limit 
of the predose level. At the 100 mg/kg dose level, CD3-CD20+ cell count decreased b y more 
than 50% i n 5 males and 2 females at Weeks 5, 9 and/or 13 of dosing. In addition, one male 
and three females had CD3-CD20+cell counts that were below the lower limit of the predose 
level.
In toxicokinetic studies, C max showed a dose -proportional increase, but incre ases in AUC 0-168h
and AUC 0-336h tended to be greater than dose proportional at the higher dose levels. C max
increased gradually  with weekl y dosing until the fifth dosing, but then gradually decreased 
after changing the dose interval to bi -weekly  administra tion and appeared to reach a stead y 
state after the seventh dose. No sex difference was noted in t he serum bleselumab profile.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2At 1mg/kg, anti -bleselumab antibody  was detected in 1 male and 3 females, and these animals 
showed a decrease in bleselumab exposure.
The no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) was established (excluding the intended 
pharmacologic effect) for the 13 -week repeated dose toxicity  study  was determined to be 
10mg/kg.
A 52 -week intermittent repeated dose toxicity  study  of bleselu mab with a 13 -week recovery  
period was conducted in the cy nomolgus monkey  (Study  7163 -TX-0006). Bleselumab was 
administered intravenously  once weekly  for 4 weeks and once every  2 weeks, thereafter, from 
the 6th dosing, for a total of29dose administration s, at dose levels of 0 (control), 1, 10, 30, and 
100 mg/kg to 4male and 4female cy nomolgus monkey s per group in order to investigate its 
toxicity . Two males and two females were added to each group in order to assess the 
reversibility  of any  toxicity  observed during the dosing period in a subsequent 13 -week 
recovery  period. The animals in the control group received bleselumab placebo. Sy stemic 
exposures to bleselumab and anti -bleselumab antibody  production were also evaluated. Clinical 
signs, bod y weight, food consumption, body  temperature, respiratory  rate, blood pressure, 
electrocardiograph y, ophthalmology , urinal ysis, hematology , immunophenoty ping, blood 
chemistry , serum cy tokine, gross pathology , organ weights, and histopathology  were conducted.
At the 100 mg/kg and the 30 mg/kg dose levels, 3 males (100 mg/kg) and 4 males (30 mg/kg)
were euthanized in a moribund state near the end of the dosing period or in the earl y stage of
the recovery  period. Hematologic findings indicate that at least 4 of 6 male animals in the 
30mg/kg group and 3 of 6 male animals in the 100 mg/kg group developed anemia as defined 
as a > 15% decrease in red blood cells ( RBCs )compared to basel ine. These findings became 
apparent on or after 39 weeks and eventuall y animals required termination for moribundity . 
Immunophenot ypic changes were observed in both male and female monkeys administered 
bleselumab at the 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg dose levels. At the 10 mg/kg dose level, CD3-CD20+
cell count decreased b y more than 50% in 4 of 6 mal es on both weeks 27 and 39 while 3 
females showed a 50% decrease in CD3-CD20+cells on week 27 and 4 females at 39 weeks. At 
the 30 mg/kg dose level, 3 to 4 males and the same number of females showed 50% decreases 
in CD3 -CD20 +cells on weeks 27, 39, and/o r 53. Finally , at the 100 mg/kg dose level, CD3 -
CD20 +cells declined b y more than 50% in 3 to 4 males on weeks 9 through 53, while a similar 
decline was observed in 4 to 5 females on weeks 13 through 53 .
The following changes were considered related to a pharmacological action of bleselumab :
decreased CD3 -CD20+ cell count and CD40+CD45+ cell count in peripheral blood at 10 mg/kg 
and greater ;homogeneous immunohistochemical reaction to anti -CD20 antibody  inthe follicles 
in the spleen and/or l ymph nodes and disappearance of immunohistochemical reactivity  to anti -
CD3 and anti -CD4 antibodies in the germinal center area of the spleen at 1 mg/kg and greater ;
germinal center atroph y in the spleen and/or l ymph nod e; basophilic change in the follicles in the 
spleen at 1 mg/kg and greater ;and follicular hy pertrophy  in the spleen, l ymph node and/or 
Peyer’s patches at 10 mg/kg and greater. After the 13 -week recovery  period, changes due to the 
pharmacological effects o f bleselumab recovered. Some histopathological changes remained 
after the recovery  period, but the extent of the changes was reduced.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2In toxicokinetic studies , Cmax and AUC 0-168h increased dose -proportionally . After the fifth dosing,
Cmax tended to be grea ter and AUC 0-168h was greater than after the first dosing. Except for some 
animals at 1 mg/kg, the C max, AUC 0-168h , and AUC 0-336h were constant from the fifth dose until 
the final (29th) dosing. No sex difference was noted in the serum bleselumab profile. bleselumab
non-binding cell ratio in B -cells and mean fluorescence intensity  (MFI)of labeled -bleselumab -
binding B-cells decreased at 1 mg/kg group and greater. At 1 mg/kg, anti -bleselumab antibody  
wasdetected in 1 male and 3 females. These animals also s howed decreases in bleselumab 
systemic exposure and in the bleselumab non-binding cell ratio and MFI.
The NOAEL was established (excluding the intended pharmacologic effect) for the 52-week 
repeated dose toxicity  study  was determined to be 1 mg/kg.
The ran ge and t ype of genotoxicity  studies routinely  conducted for pharmaceuticals are not 
applicable to biotechnology -derived pharmaceuticals. There is no indication that bleselumab
would require a special approach to evaluate genotoxicity .
No carcinogenicit y studies of bleselumab have been conducted.
A reproductive toxicity  study  of bleselumab (embry o-fetal development) in cy nomolgus 
monkey s was performed ( Study  7163 -TX-0003). Bleselumab was administered intravenously  
once weekl y over 6 week s, to 12 pregnant cy nomolgus monkey s per group at dose levels of 0, 1, 
10, and 100 mg/kg during the organogenesis period (on days 20, 27, 34, 41, 48, and 55 of 
gestation). No dam died in any  group. No significant differences were noted in body  weight or 
food consumption in any  group. No significant differences were noted between groups in fetal 
sex, fetal or placental weight, external or placental measurement parameters, amniotic fluid 
volume, organ weights, number of vertebral centrum, length of ossified l ong bone, or external, 
placental, visceral or skeletal findings. Embry o-fetal loss was not seen in the 0 (control) or 
1mg/kg bleselumab dose groups. In the 10 and 100 mg/kg bleselumab dose groups embry o-fetal 
loss was seen in 2 of 12 and 3 of 12 animals, respectively . Based on these data, the NOAEL for 
in the dams was 100 mg/kg while the NOAEL for embry o-fetal loss was 1 mg/kg. The historical 
average rate of embry o-fetal development at the facility  that performed the embry o-fetal 
toxicology  study  is 8.6% w ith a range of 0 to20%.
Anti-bleselumab antibody  was detected in 3 dams in the 1 mg/kg group on treatment day 55 of 
gestation and/or at cesarean sectioning. Serum bleselumab concentrations in these dams were 
decreased and/or disappeared b y repeated dosing. No anti -bleselumab antibody  was detected in 
the other dams or in an y fetus in the 1 mg/kg group, or in an y dam or fetus in the 100 or 
10 mg/kg group.
In toxicokinetic studies, C max and AUC of bleselumab in dams increased with ascending dose, 
and on treatment day 55 of gestation were higher than on treatment day 20 of gestation in all 
test article groups. On the day  of cesarean sectioning, serum bleselumab concentrations were 
detected for all dams and fetuses in the 100 mg/kg group, and for 4 dams and 2 fe tuses in the 
10 mg/kg group; however, bleselumab concentration was not detected for any  dam or fetus in 
the 1 mg/kg group.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Local tolerance of bleselumab was assessed as part of the 4 -week and 13 -week repeated dose 
toxicity  study  in cy nomolgus monkey s (Stud ies 7163 -TX-0002 and 7163 -TX-0005). No 
noteworth y findings were noted in the animals dosed with bleselumab following macroscopic 
and histopathologic examination of the injection site. Based on these findings, the local 
tolerance NOAEL was determined to be 100 mg/kg.
1.2.4 Clinical Data
1.2.4.1 Study 7163 -CL-0101
Study  7163 -CL-0101 was a first -in-human (FIH) phase 1, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study  of single intravenous doses at escalating dose levels in 108 healthy  
subjects with 36 subjects receiving placebo and 72 subjects receiving bleselumab in 12 dose 
groups (0.00003, 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg). 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported b y 47.2% (17/36) of subjects in
placebo and 52.8% (38/72 ) of subjects who received an y dose of bleselumab . The most 
common TEAEs were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and dermatitis 
contact . There were no clinically  significant drug -related ECG abnormalities or safet y 
laboratory findings in any  of the dose groups. No subjects experienced cy tokine release 
syndrome.
For bleselumab dose levels between 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, AUC infand cmax increased more than dose 
proportionality . The maximal concentration of bleselumab (tmax) was achieve dat 
approximately 1.5 hours after administration while the t 1/2 increased with increasing dose levels
of bleselumab , which was approximately  8 day s at dose levels ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg.
The primary  pharmacod ynamic variable was B cell CD40 occupancy  over time (binding of 
bleselumab -biotin to B cells). At dose levels ranging from 0.03 to 10 mg/kg, the percent 
change from baseline (i.e., percent occupancy ) ranged from approximately  67% to 85% 
starting at 0.5 hours aft er dosing. B cell CD40 occupancy  was sustained above 50% for 1 day  
at 0.1 mg/kg bleselumab , for 4 day s at 0.3 mg/kg bleselumab , for 7 day s at 1 mg/kg 
bleselumab , for 29 day s at 3 mg/kg bleselumab , and for 60 day s at 10 mg/kg bleselumab . No 
meaningful perce nt change from baseline was noted for total l ymphocy te counts or peripheral 
lymphocy te subsets ( CD16, CD1 9, CD3, CD4, CD8).
Over the course of the study , a total of 5 subjects in the bleselumab 1 mg/kg group and 
1subject in the bleselumab 10 mg/kg group s eroconverted from anti -bleselumab antibody  
negative to anti -bleselumab antibody  positive. No coagulation abnormalities were noted.
1.2.4.2 Study 7163 -CL-0103
Study  7163 -CL-0103 was a phase 1b, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, 
placebo -controlled, single -dose, pharmacokinetic, pharmacod ynamic, safety and tolerability  
study  of bleselumab in de novo k idney  transplant recipients . A total of 46 subjects were 
randomized and received study  drug in one of 5 treatment groups: placebo (n = 8), 
bleselumab 50 mg (n = 1 0), bleselumab 100 mg (n = 9), bleselumab 200 mg (n = 10) or 
bleselumab 500 mg (n = 9).

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 100% of subjects. I ncidences of 
TEAEs were not bleselumab dose dependent. BK infection occurred in 12.5% of placeb o, 
40.0% of bleselumab 50 mg, 0.0% of bleselumab 100 mg, 10.0% of bleselumab 200 mg and 
22.2% of bleselumab 500 mg treatment groups. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurred in 
a single subject in each of the placebo, bleselumab 100 mg and bleselumab 500 m g treatment 
groups. There were no thromboembolic events, my ocardial infarctions or malignancies 
reported in the subjects receiving bleselumab. Serious adverse events (SAE) occurred in 37.5% 
of placebo, 60.0% of bleselumab 50 mg, 11.1% of bleselumab 100 mg, 0.0% of bleselumab 
200 mg and 33.3% of bleselumab 500 mg treatment groups. No subjects experienced cy tokine 
release sy ndrome.
Both AUC and C max increased more than dose proportionally  suggesting that bleselumab
showed nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Mean maximal B cell CD40 receptor occupancy  (>85%) 
was achieved initially  in all dose groups, except the 500 mg dose group (> 70%). In general, 
there was a dose dependent duration of maximum B cell CD40 receptor occupan cy.
Only  one subject had treatment emergent anti -bleselumab antibodies formation. This subject 
was on bleselumab 50 mg treatment group. No adverse events ( AEs)attributable to anti -
bleselumab antibodies were reported.
1.2.4.3 Study 7163 -CL-0107
This was a phase 2a, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, sequential 
dose group, multiple -dose escalation intravenous dose study  to evaluate the safet y, efficacy , 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacod ynamics of bleselumab administered in subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The subjects were randomized to receive multiple doses 
of either placebo or ASKP1240 at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetics showed 
AUC 336 and C max increased more than dose proportionally , suggesting bleselumab
demonstrated nonlinear pharmacokinetics after single and multiple doses in the dose range 
tested in subjects with psoriasis.
Although the stud y was not powered to demonstrate statistical differences in bleselumab
treatment from placebo, there was evidence of pharmacologic activity  at the 3.0 mg/kg 
bleselumab dose relative to placebo as measured by  classic and linear PASI score.
There were no clinicall y significant infusion reactions and no cy tokine release sy ndrome or 
thromboembolic events. Reversible elevated liver function tests ( LFTs )were observed but 
only in the high dose bleselumab cohorts (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg). In general, a favorable safety  
profile with bleselumab was observed.
1.2.4.4 Study 7163 -CL-0108
The 7163 -CL-0108 Study  is a phase 2a, randomized, open -label, active control, multi -center 
study  to assess the efficacy  and safet y of bleselumab in de novo kidney transplant recipients. 
A total of 139 subjects were randomized and received study  drug in one of 3 treatment groups : 
standard of care (SOC; Tacrolimus [Tac] + MMF + steroids), calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2avoidance (bleselumab + MMF + steroids), and CNI minimization -MMF avoidance 
(bleselumab + reduced Tac (rTac) + steroids). 
The primary  study  duration of 7163 -CL-0108 is 6months after kidney  transplantat ion, 
followed b y a long term extension period of up to 3years. The results showed bleselumab 
+rTac regimen demonstrated similar efficacy  for the prevention of acute rejection at the 
pre-specified 6-month end point and at the previously  unplanned 12 -month anal ysis (4/44, 
9.1%; 4/44, 9.1%) compared to SOC (3/48, 6.3%; 6/48, 12.5%), respectively . The difference 
(bleselumab + rTac –SOC) with the 95% CI  at 6 and 12 months was 2.8% [-8.1%, 13.8%] and 
-3.4% [ -16.0%, 9.2%]. The upper limit of the non -inferi ority margin was less than 20%, the 
pre-specified limit, indicating similar efficacy .
The bleselumab + MMF group did not achieve non -inferiorit y compared to SOC at both the 
6-and 12 -month anal yses with the incidence of biopsy -proven acute rejection (BPAR) in 
bleselumab + MMF group statistically  higher than SOC. Subjects and graft survival were 
similar in all three treatment groups.
The higher rate of AEs in the bleselumab + MMF group in the various categories is 
predominantly  driven by  the higher rate of a cute rejection in that group. Other AEs were 
generall y consistent with those seen in renal transplant subjects. The elevated LFTs were 
observed in all three groups but the subjects in the ASKP1240 + rTac group had higher 
incidences of elevated transaminase s or total bilirubin than the SOC and ASKP1240 + MMF 
groups; however, the elevated LFTs seemed transient and reversible regardless of whether the 
subjects discontinued or continued ASKP1240 treatment.
BK virus (BKV) infection occurred more commonly  in the bleselumab + rTac group (27.3%) 
compared to SOC (10.2%) and bleselumab + MMF (15.2%) groups . Also BK virus 
associated nephropath y (BKVAN) occurred at 6.8% in the bleselumab + rTac group 
compared to SOC (4.1%) and bleselumab + MMF (4.3%) groups. No subject had graft loss 
due to BK infection/nephropathy  by 12 months. Cy tomegalovirus (CMV) infection was 
reported in all three treatment arms as follows, SOC (4.1%), bleselumab +MMF (6.5%) and 
bleselumab + rTac (6.8%). By  month 12, the accumulated occurrence of CM V infection was 
reported for SOC (6.1%), bleselumab +MMF (10.9%) and ASKPK1240 + rTac (13.6%) 
treatment arms.
During the six month study  period, three malignancies were reported; one renal cell 
carcinoma and one squamous cell carcinoma in bleselumab + MMF. A single subject in 
bleselumab + rTac had a squamous cell carcinoma of skin. Between the 6to 12 month period, 
there were two more malignancies reported, both in bleselumab + rTac, one basal cell 
carcinoma and one pol ycythemia vera. There was no case of p ost-transplant 
lymphoproliferative (PTLD) reported during the study  to-date.
Two subjects died during the six month study  period. A death was reported in the bleselumab 
+ rTac group on day  45 primarily  due to sepsis following an inadvertent injury  tothe 
appendix during the transplant procedure. Another death reported in the bleselumab + MMF 
group on day  4 was due to cardiac arrest and was considered not related to any  of the study

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2drugs. During the 6to 12 months study  period, one additional subject in the bleselumab + 
rTac group was reported dead at home on day  420 due to unknown reason.
Two subjects experienced graft loss during the six month study  period. One subject in SOC 
group underwent allograft nephrectom y on day 18 due to thrombosis. The second sub ject in 
the bleselumab + rTac treatment arm underwent placement of a donor kidney  that was 
immediately  removed due to poor perfusion. During the same procedure the mate donor 
kidney  was then implanted and continues to function well. The first donor kidney  has been 
counted as a graft loss. There was no graft loss during the 6to 12 months follow -up period.
Overall, the stud y showed bleselumab + rTac regimen demonstrated similar efficacy in the 
prevention of acute rejection at both six months end point and 12 months analy sis. A
favorable safety  profile with ASKP1 240 was consistently  observed in the subjects with 
kidney  transplantation.
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Cross -reactivity  studies of human tissues demonstrated specific binding of bleselumab to 
lymphocy tes in l ymphoid tissues as well as binding to infiltrating ly mphocy tes in 
non-lymphoid human tissues. Non -lymphoid staining of bleselumab was seen in membranes of 
sinusoidal lining cells in the liver and in glandular epithelium in the prostate, thy roid, kidney  
and parath yroid. Bleselumab also specifically  stained human ly mphocy tes, monocy tes, and 
platelets in peripheral blood.
Bleselumab inhibited sCD154 -induced IL -12 and TNF -alpha release from dendritic cells. 
bleselumab inhibited human and cy nomolgus monkey  PBMC proliferation induced by  sCD154 
in a concentration -related manner. A correlation was observed between serum concentration of 
bleselumab and % binding to CD40 on B cells. Bleselumab did not inhibit collagen -induce d 
platelet aggregation.
In non -human primates (NHP) , bleselumab inhibited delay ed type h yper-sensitivity  reaction 
and antigen -specific antibody  production at a dose of ≥ 1 mg/kg. Bleselumab exhibited a 
potent immunosuppressive effect and prolonged renal al lograft survival when administered as 
induction and/or maintenance therap y in the cynomolgus monkey.
Further examinations of the effects of bleselumab on major phy siologic s ystems were 
examined in a 4 -week, 13-week and 52 -week toxicity  studies in the monke y. No treatment -
related effects were noted on the cardiovascular, respiratory , renal, or central nervous s ystems. 
Anemia has been noted in 1animal in the 13 -week repeat dose toxicology  study  and in 4 of 5 
animals beginning at the 39 -week time point of the 52-week toxicology  study .In the 52 -week 
study  some animals were euthanized due to moribundity  in the 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg dose 
groups . Histologic change in ly mphoid organs has been observed following repeated dose 
administration of bleselumab to cy nomo lgus monkey s. Specificall y in the nonhuman primate 
studies of bleselumab , germinal centers ( GC)were shown to be either small or they could not 
be observed. Signs of toxicity  (degeneration, necrosis, and apoptosis) were not observed in the 
follicular tissu e with small or absent GC . No toxicological changes were observed in the cells 
or tissue in the regions other than the GC atroph y of follicle. These findings indicate an

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2impairment of B cell maturation to be the primary  cause of the GC atrophy . This would be 
consistent with the mechanism of action of bleselumab . The findings were reversible following 
cessation of drug administration. Decreases in peripheral blood CD3-CD20+B cells also 
occurred and are considered to reflect the pharmacological action of bleselumab on B cell 
maturation in ly mphoid tissues. The decreased peripheral circulatory  Bcell counts were also 
reversible on cessation of drug administration. Given the coincidence of the reformation of 
GC, the peripheral blood B cell counts may  be a corre late of alterations in the germinal center 
morphology .
Reproductive toxicity  studies are completed. Effects of bleselumab may result embry o-fetal 
loss at doses higher than 1 mg/kg.
The FIH health y volunteer study (Study 7163 -CL-0101) described above showed that a single 
dose of bleselumab was well tolerated. No evidence of cy tokine release s yndrome was seen. 
Activation of the coagulation cascade was not seen. Drug infusions were relatively  well 
tolerated with a single occurrence of a drug related skin rash suggest ingthat cutaneous 
reactions may  be seen following administration of bleselumab . Over the course of the stud y, a 
total of 6subjects in bleselumab dose groups seroconverted from anti -bleselumab antibody  
negative to anti -bleselumab antibody  positive .
Study  7163 -CL-0103 described above showed that a single dose o fbleselumab was well 
tolerated b y de novo renal transplant subjects . No evidence of cy tokine release was seen and 
there were no thromboembolic events observed. One subject in the bleselumab 50mg 
treatment group developed treatment emergent anti -bleselumab antibodies.
Study  7163 -CL-0107 in subjects with psoriasis and study  7163 -CL-0108 in de novo renal 
transplant subjects also showed multiple doses of bleselumab was well tolerated with no 
evide nce of cy tokine release and no thromboembolic events observed .
The CD40 -CD40L interaction has been targeted in humans previously  [Pree and Wekerle, 
2006; Kirk et al, 2001]. Two humanized anti -CD40L  antibodies have been investigated in the 
setting of variou s autoimmune disorders and renal transplantation. Anti -CD40L  antibody  
(hu5C8, monoclonal antibody  against CD154 [ligand for CD40]), was effective in NHP sin 
preventing renal allograft rejection and prolonging survival [Kirk et al, 1999] but was 
associated with thrombotic events in humans [Kirk et al, 2001]. The other agent, IDEC -131, 
was evaluated in a variety  of autoimmune disorders, and treatment was complicated by  a 
thromboembolic event in a patient with Crohn’s Disease [Pree and Wekerle, 2006]. The 
thromboembolic events involved both venous and arterial vasculature. The exact mechanisms 
for these events are not clear at present and may  represent effects on platelets and/or vascular 
endothelium [Sidiropoulos and Boumpas, 2004; Kirk et al, 2001]. The absen ce of CD40L has 
been shown to affect the stability  of ex vivo -generated thrombi in high shear flow conditions 
and arterial thrombi in in vivo nonclinical models. Animals and platelets deficient for CD40 
had a phenot ype similar to wild ty pe in these studies [Andre et al, 2002].
Antagonistic and agonistic anti -CD40 antibodies have been administered clinically  [Hussein et 
al, 20 10;Advani et al, 2009; Vonderheide et al, 2007; Kasran et al, 2005]. For example, an

02 Feb 2018 Astellas Page 46of 116
Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2antagonistic anti -CD40 IgG1 was administered to subjects with non -Hodgkin’s ly mphoma 
[Hussein et al, 20 10; Advani et al, 2009 ]. Although well tolerated clinically  in the 16 subjects , 
depletion of B cells was noted. An antagonistic anti -CD40 IgG4 was also administered to 
subjects with moderate -to-severe Crohn’s disease and single -dose administration was clinicall y 
well tolerated [Kasran et al, 2005]. Transient decreases of B cells were also noted.
Although bleselumab is not a CD40 agonist, it is important to note that the administration of 
agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibodies has also been performed. Vonderheide et al [2007] 
reported that following the administration of an agonistic anti -CD40 IgG2 to subjects with 
various advanced solid organ tumors, cy tokine release s yndrome occurred in 16 of 29 subjects ;
however, the cy tokine release s yndrome was generally mild and resolved within 24 hours 
following dosing. Ly mphocy topenia, thrombocy topenia, and dose -related transient elevations
in serum liver transaminases were also noted. Hy persensitivity  or antibody -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity  was not considered to be involved. To date, no subjects have experienced cy tokine 
release sy ndrome in any  previous clinical studies.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
Results from nonclinical studies with bleselumab have not identified significant safet y issues 
that would preclude clinical development of bleselumab . As noted above anemia has been 
observed in NHPs dose with bleselumab 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg for more than 4 weeks. 
Histologic change in ly mphoid organs and reductions of CD3-CD20+cell counts have also 
been observed in NHPs dosed at 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. Whether these findings 
constitute an unacceptable risk to subjects in the study  is unclear. GC atrophy , including severe 
lymphoid depletion, has also been observed pre-clinically  with a number of commercial 
products (e.g., rituximab, belimumab, atacicept, methotrexate and abatacept )in association 
with vary ing degrees of reduction in peripheral CD3-CD20+cells.
In populations of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis an d/or SL E where comparative data is 
available, abnormalities of germinal center histology  alone do not result in an incremental risk 
of infectious complications. Moreover, neither isolated profound peripheral blood total B cell 
depletion nor depletion of sp ecific subsets of B cells are associated with clinically  meaningful 
differences in incidence of infection.
The results of the FIH study  (7163 -CL-0101) indicated that a single dose of bleselumab was 
well tolerated. Anemia and reductions in CD3 -CD20+ cell co unts were not observed following 
a single dose of bleselumab at an y dose . In addition, bleselumab has been evaluated following 
a single dose in kidney  transplant recipients ( Study 7163 -CL-0103) .Although the study  was 
not designed to assess efficacy blesel umab showed mean maximal B cell CD40 receptor 
occupancy  (> 85%) achieved in all dose groups and was found to be well tolerated. In the 
ongoing 3 -year long multiple -dose study  in kidney transplant recipients ( Study 7163 -CL-
0108), the 6 -month and 12 -month pr eliminary  results showed that bleselumab was found to be
well tolerated and bleselumab +Tac group also showed non -inferiority  to the SOC in the 
prevention of rejection.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2There is a known r isk of cy tokine release s yndrome, characterized by rapid induction o f 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines and accompanied by  headache, m yalgias, nausea, diarrhea, 
erythema, vasodilatation, and hy potension, with subsequent life -threatening lung injury , renal 
failure, and disseminated blood clots [Suntharalingam et al, 2006] followin g administration of 
monoclonal antibodies in man. I mmunoreactivity  appears to be related in part to Fc receptor 
(FcR) binding and antibody  dependent cellular cy totoxicity  and/or complement dependent 
cytotoxicity . Bleselumab is an IgG4 isoty pe that has been geneticall y modified with the intent 
to decrease binding to FcR, thereb y reducing antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  
potential. I n addition, IgG4 has lower complement activating potential than other IgG isot ypes. 
Additionally  in the nonclinical stud ies, bleselumab related cy tokine release was not observed in 
vivo in cy nomolgus monkey s at doses up to 100 mg/kg or in vitro in human blood at 
concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL. Finally  cytokine release s yndrome was not observed in the 
FIH ( Study  7163 -CL-0101) single dose study  or the single dose study  in kidney  transplant 
recipients ( Study  7163 -CL-0103), as well as the multiple dose study  in kidney  transplant 
recipients (Study  7163 -CL-0108).
Most biologic therapies elicit some level of antibody  response whic h may  contribute to AEs or 
loss of efficacy  of the therapeutic agent. As bleselumab is a fully  human antibody , the potential 
for human anti -human antibodies is relatively  low. Treatment emergent antibodies to bleselumab 
following single doses have been see n in 6.9 to 11.1% of subjects receiving bleselumab; however 
less events were reported in the 7163 -CL-0108 study  where other immunosuppressants were 
concomitantly  used. There have been no AEs attributed to anti -bleselumab antibodies reported.
Bleselumab is intended to be an immunosuppressive agent and, therefore, the potential to 
increase the risk of infection and reactivate latent, chronic infections is expected.
Animal reproduction studies are not alway s predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, the risk to the development 
of the fetus in humans is unknown. Women who are able to become pregnant must use 
contraception during treatment with bleselumab and during an y protocol -defined treatment 
period . If a woman becomes pregnant, while taking bleselumab , she should be informed of the 
potential hazards to the fetus and bleselumab treatment must be discontinued immediately . If a 
man impregnates his partne r while taking bleselumab , both parties should be informed of the 
potential hazards to the fetus. Additionally , sperm donation is prohibited during and for 
90 day s post-last study  drug dosing .
Subjects will be closely  monitored by  the Principal I nvestigat or for signs and sy mptoms of 
anemia, infection, cy tokine release, and thromboembolic events. In addition to being closel y 
monitored by  the Investigator, the Sponsor Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Medical Safety  
Pharmacovigilance physician/designee will pe riodically  review the safet y data. A full range of 
safet y data will be assessed, including but not limited to, hematology, biochemistry, vital signs, 
and AEs.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2rejection compared to SOC in renal transplant subjects. Two important identified risks are 
hepatic toxicity  and viral infections. The blood chemical findings in preclini cal studies showed 
isolated elevations of alanine phosphatase (SGPT) ( ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) 
(AST), alkaline aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehy tdrogenase (LDH) that were not dose -
related and in some cases returned to lower values with continued dosing; in phase I completed 
studies TEAEs related to abnormal LFTs (e.g., ALT) were not clinicall y significant. In both 
phase II studies (one complete and one ongoing) elevated liver chemistries are transient and 
reversible regardless of blesel umab continuation or discontinuation and have not been associated 
with significant clinical findings. The occurrences of BK infection are of concern but have not 
resulted in significant impairment of renal survival and n o graft loss .
The Sponsor is continu ously  monitoring safet y in the ongoing clinical study and has instituted 
mitigating measures for this study . The Sponsor believes that the risks recognized with 
bleselumab are acceptable and do not preclude further clinical investigations. A DMC that will 
be responsible for the evaluation of data is to be organized and meet periodically .
There is no approved pharmacologic therap y and limited effectiveness with other treatment 
options such as plasmapheresis . Many subjects with rFSGS suffer the consequences o f the 
recurrence in the form of nephrotic s yndrome and its sequelae . Based on this unmet medical 
need and the safet y and efficacy  results from previous and ongoing clinical studies with 
bleselumab, the Sponsor believes bleselumab may have potential benefit in the prevention of 
rFSGS.

2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, open -label, active control, multi -center study  to assess the 
efficacy  and safet y of bleselumab in preventing the rFSGS in de novo kidney  transplant subjects.
The study  will consist of the fol lowing periods:
●Screening (days -21 to -1)
●Transplant (day 0 [zero])
●Post-transplant (day 0/post -skin closure through 12 months post -transplant)
Prior to any  study -related assessments, the informed consent form (ICF)/authorization will be 
signed b y the sub ject ( visit 1). All subjects will enter into a screening period ( days -21 to -1
prior to transplant) , undergo a transplant (day  0), and are then to be followed for up to 
12months in the post-transplant period (day 0/post -skin closure through 12 months 
post-transplant) for efficacy  and safet y.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Only  subjects in Arm 2 are to provide pharmacokinetic samples. On day 0, pharmacokinetic 
samples are to be collected within 30 minutes or less pre-initial, and post -initial, intraoperative ,
bleseluma badministration. Two single, pharmacokinetic samples are to be collected at each 
subsequent 30 minute ,intravenous infusion :one within 30 minutes or less prior to the infusion 
(trough concentration) , and the other at the end of the infusion (peak concent ration) up through 
the day  28 visit. After that only  trough concentrations (within 30 minutes or less pre -infusion) 
are to be collected up through day  90/month 3, and months 6, 9 and 12/EOS visits.
All subjec ts who have not had a biopsy  with a diagnosis of recurrent FSGS (rFSGS) by 3 months 
post-transplant will have a protocol -defined biopsy  at the day  90/month 3 visit. There are no 
other protocol -defined biopsies. Biopsies other than the protocol -indicated one at day  90/month 
3 will be considered ‘for cau se’ onl y.
All episodes of kidney  dysfunction based on clinical signs and s ymptoms will be evaluated for 
possible BPAR and/or rFSGS .All subjects should have a biops y confirmation of a rejection 
episode prior to the initiation of treatment for rejection ,orwithin 48 hours of initiation of 
treatment for acute rejection. BPAR (T-or B-cell) will be determined via local review at the 
study  center using the 2007 Banff criteria.
All images for electron microscop y (EM) and slides for light microscop y (LM)utilize d for local 
pathological review for evaluation of possible BPAR and/or rFSGS are to be forwarded for a 
blinded, central review by an independent pathologist to assess (via EM and L M) rFSGS .
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be responsible for data eva luation and will meet 
as defined in the DMC charter.
If bleselumab is permanently discontinued ,subjects in Arm 2 can continue to receive 
study -supplied Prograf through 12 months post -transplant as previously  assigned ; however, 
any alternate therap y(ies) will not be provided by  the Sponsor . Furthermore, subjects that 
permanentl y discontinue or replace bleselumab , tacrolimus or MMF in the post -transpl ant 
period will be considered to have reached end of treatment (EOT) and are to continue with 
the protocol -defined visit schedule ( Table 1, Schedule of Assessments) for the collection of 
safet y and clinical assessment information.
If a subject declines to be followed upon permanently  discontinuing bleselumab, tacrolimus 
or MMF, the end of study  (EOS , visit 21/m onth 12) procedures are to be completed within 
30days post -last treatment.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
Although the pathogenesis of FSGS is still not fully  understood, literature suggests that 
auto-anti-CD40 antibody is potentially  associated with rFSGS. I n cultured human podocy tes, 
a monoclonal CD40 -blocking antibody  partiall y reversed the podocy te depolarization and 
shrinking seen after treatment with purified anti -CD40 antibody  from the sera of subjects
who developed rFSGS, indicating that blocking the interaction of the CD40 auto -antibody  
with the CD40 on podocytes may  be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of rFSGS.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Bleselu mab, a fully  human IgG4 anti -CD40 antagonistic monoclonal antibody , could have a 
therapeutic effect for the prevention of FSGS following renal transplantation by  either 
preventing the binding of CD40 autoantibodies to the podocy tes or by  blocking the 
interaction of CD40L expressing inflammatory  cells with the podocy tes. None of the 
6subjects from the 7163 -CL-0108 study  with a medical history  of FSGS treated with 
bleselumab (6 subjects, 5 treated with bleselumab + MMF and 1 treated with bleselumab + 
rTac) had a rFSGS while the SOC arm had recurrence in 2 of 2 subjects.
The dosing regimen proposed in this study  is as same as the 7163 -CL-0108 study , which 
demonstrated efficacy  in preventing acute rejection with manageable safet y profiles. The 
dosing rationale for this study  is to ensure the sufficient immunosuppression to prevent acute 
rejection and to assess the efficacy  in the prevention of rFSGS.

4.4 Blinding
This section is not applicable as this is an open label study .
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
All subject numbers will be assigned using the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) 
starting at screening. All subjects will have a unique, ten -digit subject id. The first 5digits of 
this number will be the site’s protocol -specific number. The second 5digits assigned will 
represent the subject’s accession number. This will be the number that identifies a subject 
during the course of the study .
All baseline procedures will be performed prior to Randomization. Only  subjects who meet 
all inclusion criteria and exhibit none of the exclusion criteria (Section 3, Study Population) 
will be randomly  assigned to one of the t wotreatment arms in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by 
previous kidney  transplant status (noor yes). There will be a central randomization with 
treatment assignments balanced between the 2study  arms and previous kidney  transplant .
Randomization is to be performed via IRT. If a patient is assigned a subject number and 
transplanted , but does not receive the assigned treatment regimen , the subject number will not 
be used again . If a patient is assigned a s ubject number but not transplanted nor receive sthe 
assigned treatment regimen within the screening period , the subject may be rescreened and is 
to receive a new subject number.
Patients that are randomized (assigned a subject number), but are not transpla nted and not
dosed per assigned regimen will be replaced to ensu re that 60 evaluable subjects are dosed.
The randomization schedules that determine subject treatment will be computer -generated b y 
Astellas Pharma US Research Data Science department (or desi gnee) before the beginning of 
the study .
Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are contained in the study -specific 
IRT manual.
The Randomization list will be maintained in the IRT.

The last value prior to the first study  drug dose will be used as the baseline to which post -
study  drug dos ing values will be compared.
5.3.1 Efficacy
5.3.1.1 Recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
The p rimary  efficacy  variable rFSGS is defined as nephrotic range proteinuria with a protein -
creatinine ratio (≥ 3.0 g/g) through 3 months post -transplant . Death, graft loss or lost to 
follow -up will be imputed as rFSGS.
This definition and imputation rule will be used to define the secondary  variables and the 
rFSGS through 6 and 12 months post -transplant.
5.3.1.2 Blinded ,Central Read for Recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulos clerosis
All episodes of kidney  dysfunction based on clinical signs and s ymptoms will be evaluated 
by a biops y at the local pathological laboratory  for recurrence of FSGS and for possible 
rejection. The same slides and images of the biopsy  will also be sen t to a central pathology  
lab and read b y an independent pathologist to determine r ecurrence of FSGS. The central 
pathology  lab will not be provided the su bject’s treatment regimen. 
Subjects who have not had a biopsy  with a diagnosis of recurrent FSGS by 3months post -
transplant will have a protocol -defined biops y at the day  90/month 3 visit. There are no other 
protocol -required biopsies. All other b iopsies conducted will be ‘for cause’ only .
5.3.1.3 Biopsy -proven Acute Rejection
All episodes of kidney  dysfunction based on clinical signs and s ymptoms will be evaluated for 
possible rejection. All subjects should have biopsy confirmation of rejection before treatment 
is begun or within 48 hours of initiation of treatment for acute rejection. The pathologist at the 
clinical site will grade all biopsies using the 2007 Banff criteria (Appendix 12.8, Grading of 
Acute Kidney  Allograft Rejection ).Biops y-proven acute rejection (BPAR, T-or B-cell) will 
be determined b y local review. All biopsies should be evaluated for presence of C4d.
Subjects who receive immunosuppressive medications for the treatment of suspected or 
biopsy -confirmed acute rejection are considered to have a clinical ly-treated acute rejection. 
The rejection treatment start date will be used to denote the start for the clinically  treated 
acute rejection. If the subject has an acute rejection, allowable rejection therapy  may  include, 
but is not limited to, steroid pulse , thymoglobulin, basiliximab, OKT3, or alemtuzumab.

5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y dru g 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AEcan therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
All AEs wi ll be recorded in the eCRF from the time of consent through 30 day s post-last 
dose. For ALL subjects this is to conclude at the month 12/EOS visit. (The transplant that 
occurs on day  0 is not considered an AE or an SAE).
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the eCRF accordingl y.
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
investigator.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 25.5.1.1 Definitions of Specific Adverse Events
5.5.1.1.1 Infection
Bacterial, fungal and viral infections are to be reported as an AE or an SAE.
Except for CMV, EBV and BK, infection is d efined as an y of the following:
●Treatment with a antimicrobial agent for a specific clinical sy ndrome (not prophy laxis)
●Positive cultures, pathologic identification of microbial agents or significant serological 
changes related to clinical sy mptoms
●Typical clinical presentation documented by  investigator or appropriate consultant
●Other infectious hepatitis to b e considered as differential diagnosis in case of LFT 
abnormalities
5.5.1.1.2 Definition of Cytomegalovirus
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV )active infection:
●Replicative infection can be diagnosed b y growing the virus in vitro , finding evidence of 
viral infection b y intra -cytoplasmic or intra -nuclear inclusions or b y antibody -based 
staining techniques for CMV in histopathologic sections or finding evidence of replication 
using nucleic acid based assay s or antigenemia studies.
CMV disease :
●CMV disease is defined by  evidence of CMV infection with attributable symptoms. CMV 
disease can be subclassified into CMV viral sy ndrome or tissue invasive disease. 
Definitions are listed in Appendix 12.6,Definition of CMV Disease in Solid Organ 
Transplant Recipients.
5.5.1.1.3 Definition of Epstein -Barr Virus
Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV) infection:
●Active, as ymptomatic EBV infection is defined by  the presence of a detectable EBV 
viral load as measured b y a nucleic acid amplification assay . Asy mptomatic infection 
may also be identified in ly mphoid rich histopathologic specimens.
EBV disease:
●EBV disease is defined by the presence of active EBV infection with sy mptoms or signs 
attributable to the virus. 
5.5.1.1.4 BK Virus Infe ction
BK virus (BKV) infection (replicative infection) defined as quantitative BK viral DNA load, in 
blood or urine above the detection threshold for the given laboratory 's assay . BK infection 
should be classified as either BK viruria or BK viremia or both . While the presence of deco y 
cells in urine on cy tology is suggestive of BK infection, confirmation with a specifi c test (e.g., 
polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) is required.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 25.5.1.1.5 BK Virus Associate Nephropathy
Proven BKVAN is defined by  evidence of BK Vinfection and the presence of:
●Renal biopsy  associated with:
oan acute tubular necrosis -like picture or
ointerstitial nephritis mimicking acute rejection or
ochronic allograft nephropathy  with confirmation of the presence of BK Vby 
electron microscop y, immun ohistochemistry  or in-situhybridization for BK V. 
Although intra -nuclear viral inclusions are usuall y seen, their presence is not 
mandatory  for a diagnosis of BKVAN. 
For purposes of this study, subjects with presumptive BKVAN diagnosed in the presence of 
renal allograft d ysfunction and a positive BKV DNA PCR result from blood in a subject with 
no viral inclusions at light microscopy  and negative immunohistochemistry /in-situ
hybridization should be classified as BK V infection (i.e. , BK viremia rather than B KVAN).
5.5.1.1.6 Malignancy
All malignancies are to be captured as AEs.
5.5.1.1.7 Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder
Diagnosis of PTLD should be made following review of tissue specimens. The anatomic staging 
of PTL D will be captured, specificall y if the allograft or if the central nervous sy stem ( CNS )is 
involved. PTL D will be classified according to the criteria in Appendix 12.7  Additionally , if 
available, ancillary  pathologic information related to cell phenoty pe, clonality , presence of EBV 
in the tissue specimen, and donor vs. recipient origin will be collected.
Tissue samples should be interpreted b y a hematopathologist or pathologist who is familiar with 
the histopathologic features of PTLD. If as a matter of the subject’s routine medical evaluation 
tissues are examined for t he presence of EBV b y in situ hybridization, the cell of origin (B, T, 
null, mixed) is determined or radiographic evaluation is performed to document the extent of 
disease (e.g., computed tomography scans) this informati on will be captured on the eCRF.
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events)
An AEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it results 
in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening ( an AEis considered “life- threatening” if, in the vi ew of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
● Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
● R esults in congenital anomaly, or birth defect

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2●Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/ob servation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; o r development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Special situation events on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evalua tion include, but are not limited to:
●Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
●Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or withou t subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)
All of the special situation events noted abo ve should be recorded on the e CRF. Any  situation 
involving these special situation events that also meets the criteria for an SA E should be
reported as an SAE, recorded on the AE page of the e CRF and marked ‘serious’ on the SAE 
worksheet.
All the special situation events will be recorded from the time of consent through 30 day s 
post-last dose.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they classify  as “alway s serious” events. I f an AE is 
reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “alway s serious ,” additional 
information on the event may  be requested , those events should be reported as an SAE .
If a subject or a subject’s partner becomes pregnant during the stud y, this should be reported as 
if it were an SAE (Section 5.5.8 , Procedure in Case of Pregnancy ).
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "AEs 
whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out." Relationship to study  drug will 
be assessed using th e following criteria:

02 Feb 2018 Astellas Page 74of 116
Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Causal relationship to 
the study drugCriteria for ca usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and /orin which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unli kely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on re -administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
Adverse even ts, including abnormal clinical laboratory  values, will be graded using the NCI
CTCAE guidelines (Version 4.03). The items that are not stipulated in the NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.03 will be assessed according to the criteria below and entered into the eCRF:
Grade Assessment Standard
1 -Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations noted; 
intervention not indicated.
2 -Moderate Local or noninvasive intervention indicated.
3 -Severe Medically significant but not immediately life threatening, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization.
4 -Life Threatening Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated.
5 -Death Death related to AE.
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
SAEs will be captured for all subject s from the time the subject signs the informed consent. If 
a subject signs the informed consent but never receives stud y drug or is deemed a screen 
failure, an y SAEs reported from the time of consent until determination of screen failure 
should be reported to the Sponsor via an SAE worksheet and followed until resolution. For 
subjects who are randomized , SAEs will be captured from the time of consent 30 day s post -
last dose. For ALL subjects this is to conclude at the month 12/EOS visit.
In the case of a SAE , the Investigator must contact the Sponsor by  telephone, faxor email
immediately  (within 24 hours of awareness).
The Investigator should complete and submit an SAE Worksheet containing all information 
that is required b y the Regulatory Authorities to the Sponsor by fax or email immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness). If the faxing of anSAE Worksheet is not possible or is not 
possible within 24 hours, the local drug safet y contact should be informed by phone.

5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
Common SAEs are anticipated to occur in the stu dy population independent of drug 
exposure. SAEs classified as “common” are provided in Appendix 12.3, Common Serious 
Adverse Events . The list does NOT change your reporting obligations or prevent the need to 
report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to 
alert you that some events reported as SAEs may not require expedited reporting to the 
regulatory  authorities base d on the classification of “common SAEs” as specified in 
Appendix 12.3  The Sponsor will monitor these events throughout the course of the stud y for 
any change in f requency .Any changes to this list will be communicated to the participating 
investigational sites. Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as stated 
in Section 5.5.5 , Reporting of Serious Adverse Events.
5.5.8 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study dosing 
period or within 30 day s from th e discontinuation of dosing, the Investigator should report the 
information to the Sponsor as if it isanSAE . The expected date of delivery or expected date of 
the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, estimated contraception date, pregnancy  result and
neonatal data etc., should be included in this information.
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother ,as well as the fetus ,as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y (including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the Investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAE s. 
Additio nal information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is categorized as an 
SAE ) is mentioned below:
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as " possible "by 
the Investigator
●In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth
●Unless a congenital anomaly  isidentified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination .

All patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures will be completed b y the subject via 
computerized administration on a sponsor -sourced, vendor -provided electronic device.
If a subject is not able to provide an answer to the question(s), it is not a requirement to 
complete the rest of the ePRO assessment(s) at the respective visit.
5.7.1.1 Short Form 36-Item Health Survey Score
The Short Form 36 -Item Health Survey  Score ( SF-36s, version 2.0, Appendix 12.9) is a 
measure of health status. The SF -36 provides scores for each of the 8health domains and 
psychometricall y-based phy sical component summary  (PCS) and mental compo nent 
summary  (MCS) scores.
The 8 domains are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each domain is 
directly  transformed into a 0 -100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal 
weight. Lower scores indicate greater disabilit y. The higher the score the less disability  (i.e.,

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability  and a score of 100 is equivalent to no 
disability ).
The SF -36s is a multipurpose health survey  that measures overall health status, functional 
status, and h ealth -related quality  of life. It is a generic measure and its use is not restricted to 
a single disease state. Using an 8-scale profile of phy sical and mental health summary  
measures, the SF -36s is a valid and reliable tool that allows comparisons between and within 
clinical and general populations.
Subjects will complete this self -assessment at screening , days14and 90/ month 3, and 
months 6and 12/EOS visits.
5.7.1.2 European Quality of Life –5-Dimensions -5Levels
The European Qualit y of Life –5-Dimensions –5 Levels ( EQ-5D-5L, Appendix 12.10 )is an 
international standardized non -disease specific (i.e. ,generic) instrument for describing and

5.7.1.3 Kidney Transplant Quest ionnaire
The Kidney  Transplant Questionnaire (KTQ, Appendix 12.11 ) is a 25 -item questionnaire that 
includes 5domains or subscales (i.e., ph ysical symptoms [based on 6items], fatigue [based on 
5items], uncertainty /fear [based on four items], appearance [based on four items], and 
emotional [based on six items].
A mean score ranging from 1 to 7 is reported for each of the 5subscales, with higher scores 
representing better functioning, well -being, or fewer problems [Laupacis et al, 1993].
Subjects are to complete this self -assessment at screening, day s 14 and 90/m onth 3, and

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 27 STATISTICAL METHODOLO GY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of APGD. A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures (TLFs) to be produced. The SAP will be 
finalized prior to the interim data anal ysis of the 3 -month primary  endpoint, rFSGS. Any  
changes from the anal yses planned in the SAP will be justified in the clinical study report 
(CSR).
Prior to database lock, a final meeting will be held to review data and tables, listings and 
figures (TLFs) to verify  the data that will be used for anal ysis set classification. I f required, 
consequences for the statistical analy sis will be discussed and documented. A meeting to 
determine analy sis set classifications may  also be held prior to database lock.
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and ma ximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints. There will be no adjustment for 
multiplicity  in this proof -of-concept study .
7.1 Sample Size
The primary  aim of this study  is to assess the rFSGS defined as nephrotic range proteinuria 
with protein -creatinine ratio (≥ 3.0 g/g) through 3 months post -transplant . Death, graft loss or 
lost to follow -up will be imputed as rFSGS.
This proof of concept s tudy will provide an estimate of the effect size for the difference in the 
rFSGS between the standard of care and the experimental group and provide estimates of the 
recurrence rates for each treatment group. The estimate of the effect size will be needed to 
plan a future stud y.
The following table provides a subset of estimates and the 95% confidence interval for the 
FSGS recurrence rate with 30 subjects per treatment group. The width of these confidence 
intervals varies between 17 and 36% indicating the limit of the precision for the estimate.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2It has been estimated from the literature that the expected FSGS recurrence rate for the SOC 
group is between 30 and 50% with most occurring by  3months post -transplant . In the 
previous study  with these same treatments in ki dney  transplant patients, there were 3 of
approximately  50 patients, who experienced death, graft loss or lost to follow -up, in each of 
the two planned treatment arms. Thus, imputing death, graft loss or lost to follow -up as 
rFSGS is not expected to have a sizeable and differential impact on the rFSGS estimates. 
Literature estimates of rFSGS were used to examine the precision of the treatment difference 
provided with 30 subjects per treatment group.
Bleselumab was assumed to decrease the recurrence rate in the experimental arm by  20% to 
60% relative to SOC. The following table provides the difference in the observed rates and 
the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval with 30 subjects per group. The width of the 
confidence interval for the difference be tween the two treatment groups ranges between 47 %
and 57%. The width of the confidence interval provides the precision of the estimate for the 
difference in recurrence between the two groups.

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 27.2 Analysis Set
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be specified in Classification Specifications and 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock.
7.2.1 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized ,receive at least 
one dose of stud y drug and receive a transplanted kidney. This will be the primary  anal ysis 
set for efficacy  anal yses.
7.2.2 Per Protocol Set
No per protocol set ( PPS)is planned for this study ; however, exploratory  analy ses including 
certain subjects may be performed if clinicall y meaningful.
7.2.3 Safety Analysis Set
TheSafet y Analysis Set (SAF)consists of all subjects who took at least one dose of stud y
medication, and will be used for safet y anal yses.
7.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
The Pharmacokinetic Analy sis Set (PKAS) will consist of subjects from the SAF who have at 
least one measureable pharmacokinetic concentration. The PKAS will be used for summari es 
and explo ratory  anal ysis of the pharmacokinetic data.
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by  treatment group 
for age, sex, race, ethnicity , height, weight, donor ty pe (living [related/nonrelated] or deceased 
donor), donor and recipient serology , donor demographics, panel reactive antibody  and total 
ischemia time.
Continuous variables will be summarized by  descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, 
and minimum, median, maximum). The means will be compared among treatment groups 
using an anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) or analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment 
group as a factor.
Discrete variables will be summarized by  number/percentage of subjects in each ca tegory . A 
2-sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed for the treatment differences.
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy
General Considerations
For an anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) or analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA), previous 
kidney  transplantation (no, y es) will be included as a factor in the model if there is a 
sufficient number of patients with more than one kidney  transplant. Endpoints analy zed with 
Fisher’s Exact test may  be anal yzed with a CMH test stratify ing by  previous kidney  
transplant status (no or yes) if there is a sufficient number of patients with multiple kidney  
transplants. For time -to-event endpoints, Cox regression will be used comparing the

Fisher’s Exact test will be used to anal yze all count data , unless otherwise specified . An 
ANOVA or ANCOVA will be used to analy ze continuous data.
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the percentage of subjects who have rFSGS defined as 
nephrotic range proteinuria with protein -creatinine ratio (≥ 3.0 g/g) through 3 months 
post-transplant . Death, graft loss or lost to follow -up will be imputed as rFSGS.
The percentage of subjects who have rFSGS will be computed, along with a 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for each of the treatment groups. The difference betwe en the two 
groups will be given and a 2-sided 95% CIwill be constructed for the treatment differences 
using the normal approximation. As a secondary  analy sis, Fishers’ exact will be used to te st 
for treatment differences.
7.4.1.2 Subgroup Analysis
For each treatment group, incidence of rFSGS at three months will be calculated for the 
following subgroups: age (<65, ≥ 65), gender, race (African -American vs Others), donor 
types (deceased donors vs others), and donor relationship (related vs non -related).
7.4.2 Analys is of Secondary Endpoints
7.4.2.1 Recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis through 6 and 12 Months
The percentage of subjects with rFSGS through 6 and 12 months post -transplant will be 
computed along with a 2-sided 95% CI  for each of the treatment groups and for the treatme nt 
difference (Arm 2 -Arm 1). As a secondary  anal ysis, Fishers’ exact will be used to test for 
treatment difference . Death, graft loss orlost to follow -up will be imputed as rFSGS .
7.4.2.2 Biopsy -Proven Acute Rejection determined by Local Revi ew
By-treatment group summaries will be provided for the incidence of BPAR (Banff Grade ≥ 1, 
local read) through 3, 6 and 12 months post-transplant . A 2-sided 95% CI will be constructed 
for each of the treatment groups and for the treatment difference . Sub jects with an unknown 
outcome prior to each of the defined time points (3, 6 or 12 months post transplant), if any, 
will be counted as a BPAR in a secondary  anal ysis. A 2-sided 95% CIwill be constructed for 
the treatment differences using the normal appro ximation .

7.4.2.4 Biopsy -Proven Recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis through 3, 
6 and 12 Months determined by Central Blinded Review of the Biopsy Slides
Biopsy -proven rFSGS will include only  those for whom slides are reviewed by  the 
independent pathologist who will be the blinded, central reader. All subjects are required to 
provide a biops y either after the appearance of s ymptoms for rejection or rFSGS, or at the 
day 90/month 3 visit, if there has not been a previous biopsy  indicating rFSGS in the 
transplanted kidne y. The blinded, central reader will objectively assess podocyte changes to 
identify  those with rFSGS. S ubjects who drop out of the study  and do not provide a biops y 
for slide review will not be included in the analy sis of biopsy -proven r FSGS.
Any “for-cause ”biopsies after 3 months post -transplant will be reviewed b y the blinded, 
central reader for r FSGS.
Summaries of biopsy -proven rFSGS will be provided by  treatment group and the results for 
the comparison of the two treatment groups using all provid ed biopsies will be provided for 3, 
6 and 12 months post -transplant.
The percentage of subjects who have rFSGS will be computed along with a 2-sided 95% CI 
for each of the treatment groups and for the treatment difference ( Arm 2 -Arm 1 ).

7.4.3.1 Graft and Patient Status (Graft and Patient Survival)
Summaries by  treatment group (and a 2 -sided 95% CI  for each) for graft and patient status 
through 12 months’ post -transplant will be given. Subject status is defined as alive or 
decease d. Graft status is defined as graft loss determined by  subject death, re -transplant, 
nephrectom y, or return to permanent dial ysis (> 30 day s) or graft survival determined as the 
absence of an y of the above. The treatment difference and a 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference will be provided.
For each treatment group, Kaplan -Meier estimates will be used to estimate graft and subject 
survival at one year. An y drop -outs prior to one -year will be censored at the time of drop -out. 
The treatment difference will be c omputed as Arm 2 -Arm 1 . A 2-sided 95% CI  will be

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 27.8 Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinu ation of the Clinical Study)
An interim anal ysis is planned once all subjects have completed the 3 months post -transplant 
follow -up to assess treatment differences for rFSGS. The purpose of this analy sis is to 
support strategic decision making for future project development and study  design. The result 
will aid in determining if this compound will continue development for rFSGS.
7.9 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data wi ll be done. Exceptions are the start 
and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication. The imputed dates will be used to 
allocate the concomitant medication and AEs to a treatment group, in addition to determining 
whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent . Listings of the AEs and concomitant 
medications will present the actual partial dates; imputed dates will not be shown.

8.1.6 Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is generall y an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as a s ystematic change. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, saf ety, and welfare of subjects. The Investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects.
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a requ est from an Investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any subject who:
●Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria
●Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and not withdrawn
●Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose
●Received ex cluded concomitant treatment
When a deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the Investigator or 
designee must ensure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor will follow -up with the Investigator, 
as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y and/or efficacy of the 
subject to determine subject continuation in the study .
If a deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the Investigator must cont act the Sponsor 
immediately .
The Investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authorities will be pr ovided to the 
Sponsor and maintained within the Trial Master File (TMF).
NOTE: Other deviations outside of the categories defined above that are required to be 
reported b y the IRB/IEC in accordance with local requirements will be reported, as 
applicable.

should be repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. 
Subjects should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Complete phy sical examination searching for sign or symptoms of hepatitis such as:
● fever, scleral icterus (Jaundice), darkening of the urine, pale or clay -colored stools
● fainting, weakness, fatigue
● altered mental status
● hepatomegal y
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3×ULN Or > 2×ULN
Severe* > 3×ULN and > 2×ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any  of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 x ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and (TBL > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5 x UL N)
●ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)
The Investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitorin g 
and follow -up.
*Hy’s Law or rule is based on the combined evidence of hepatic injury , decreased hepatic 
function and the absence of disease related damage. 
Subjects with all 4 of the below criteria areconsidered Hy’s Law cases:
1.Increased rate (compared to control) of aminotransferase elevation to ≥ 3 x ULN 
indicating hepatocellular injury ,greater elevation cause greater concern, but alone do not 
predict severe toxicity
2.Total BIL > 2x UL N(or INR > 1.5 × ULN ),if the change is clinically  significant in the 
absence of obstruction
3.Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) close to normal
4.No other good explanation for the liver injury  (viral excluded ,alcohol ingestion, 
congestive heart failure )

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Exclusion of alcoholic hepatitis:
Heav y alcohol use is a prerequisite for t he development of alcoholic hepatitis. The history  is 
usually  apparent; however, in some subjects, alcohol use may  be covert.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtain ing appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the L iver Abnormalit y 
Case Report Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal 
liver functio n testing should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 -3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a SAE. The 
Sponsor should be contacted immediately  and informed of all Investigators and subjects for 
whom severe hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are 
observed.
In order to distinguish if bleselumab is likely  to cause DILI or have a low potential for 
causing severe liver injury ,subjects will be evaluated and closel y monitored .
For further detection, assessment, mitigation and reporting of abnormal hepatic laboratory  
findings, the Investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Symptoms 
and new onset -diseases sho uld be recorded as ‘adverse events ’on the AE page of the
eCRF . Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease t hatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is s een in obese h yper-lipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic subjects
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. Gilbert’s syndrome 
which characterized by  fluctuating elevation of serum bilirubin. The Investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepat ic function.
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, specific 
toxic insults such as Amanita sp. (mushroom ), and special diets. Medications should be 
entered on the concomitant medicat ion page of the eCRF . Information on alcohol, other 
substance use, and diet should be entered on the L A-CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .

Version 3.1Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 212.4 Retrospective P harmacogenetic Sub-Study
INTRODUCTION
Pharmacogenetic research aims to provide information regarding how naturally  occurring 
changes in a subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what 
treatment options are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of pharmacogenetic 
by technologies such as genoty ping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association Studies (GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, 
efficacy  or toxicity  may  be better understood. As many  diseases may  be influ enced b y one or 
more genetic variations, pharmacogenetic research may  identify  which genes are involved in 
determining the way  a subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The pharmacogenetic research that may  be conducted in the future with acqu ired blood 
samples is exploratory . The objective of this research will be to anal yze or determine genes 
of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be possible to predict an indiv idual subject’s response 
to treatment in ter ms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATION
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may  participate in this 
pharmacogenetic sub-study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide s eparate written 
consent prior to providing an y blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic 
analysis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide one 4mLtube of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by  the unique subject number 
(first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly  from 
site or via a central labo ratory  as directed by  Astellas.
PHARMACOGENETIC ANAL YSIS
Details on the potential pharmacogenetic analysis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  
initiate the pharmacogenetic analysis in case evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be 
influencing the drug’s ki netics, efficacy  and/or safety .
DISPOSAL OF PHAR MACOGENETIC SAMPLES/ DATA
All pharmacogenetic samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 y ears following 
study  database hard lock. If there is no requirement for anal ysis, the whole blood sample will 
be destro yed after the planned storage per iod. The subject has the right to withdraw consent 
at an y time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the pharmacogenetic sample

to its withdrawal will be retained at Astellas indefinitely .
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO THE SUBJECTS
Exploratory  pharmacogenetic analysis may  be conducted following the conclusion of the 
clinical study , if applicable. The results of the genetic anal ysis will not be provided to any  
investigators or subjects, nor can the results be requested at a later date. Any  information that 
is obtained from the pharmacogenetic analysis will be the propert y of Astellas.

Synopsis  
 
Introduction  
Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  is a medical  device company focused on infant monitoring . The Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart 
Sock V. 2  device is a non-invasive home care device for use with infants .  The Smart Sock V. 2  is a portable device 
that uses pulse oximetry technology to enable oxygen saturation and heart rate monitoring in infants . 
 
Objectives of the Clinical Investigation Plan  
The purp ose of this clinical study  is to validate  the SpO 2 accuracy of Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2 , during 
non-motion conditions over the range of 70 -100% SaO 2 as compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO -
Oximetry .  The end goal is to provide supporting documentation for the SpO 2 accuracy validation of the  Owlet 
Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2 .

Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in 
everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. In general, pulse oximeters use two wavelength 
absorption spectrophotometry to measure  oxygen saturation. The wavelengths are selected to provide the best 
separation of absorbencies of oxy -hemoglobin (O 2Hb) and deoxy -hemoglobin (RHb) states. The ratio of the two 
absorbencies is used to calculate the oxygen saturation (SpO 2) value. Because a n arterial sample of blood is not 
required to make the measurement, the pulse oximeter can provide continuous non -invasive real time 
information. The clinical use of pulse oximeters has reduced the frequency and necessity of invasive arterial blood 
samplin g, and has helped to improve patient safety by providing continuous information to clinicians about 
patients’ oxygenation status.  
  
The Smart Sock V. 2  is a non -invasive home care device for use with infants.  The Smart Sock V. 2 monitor s the 
oxygen saturat ion, heart rate and other parameters of infants.   An adult population will be used to study the pulse 
oximetry parameter for this study.  
  
Although these devices may be technically investigational, devices without regulatory clearance, they are  currently  
available  commercially .  All product safety testing has been previously completed.  
 
Summary Overview  
The SpO 2 accuracy performance of Smart Sock V. 2  will be evaluated during non -motion conditions over the range 
of 70 -100% SaO 2 and compared to a rterial blood samples assessed by CO -Oximetry. A minimum of 10 healthy adult 
subjects, ranging in pigmentation from light to dark, will be enrolled in the study to meet the study design 
requirements defined by ISO 80601 -2-61:2011  and by the FDA’s Guidance for Pulse Oximeters (March 4, 2013). 
The subjects will have an arterial catheter placed in the radial artery to allow for simultaneous blood samples 
during stable plateaus of induced hypoxic levels. The investigational devices will be placed on both  thumbs  for the 
test sites . Simultaneous data collection will be set up for each of the systems under test.  This protocol will be 
focused on the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2 pulse oximeter intended to provide continuous oxygen 
saturation measurement of humans.  
 
For analysis  of the data;  the control oximeter will be used to assess the stability of each data point. Data that is 
found to be unstable will be removed prior to the comparative analysis. The CO -Oximeter data will be reviewed to

make sure it does not contain any anomalous values such as elevated, low or inconsistent  COHb, MetHb , tHb  data. 
Anomalous values will be removed from the analysis prior to pairing of the SpO 2 and SaO 2 data. The statistical 
analysis is performed on a minimum of 200 data points collected from  at least 10 subjects for the range of 7 0% to 
100% SaO 2 with allowance of ± 3% of the target range . Functional SaO 2 as measured by Reference CO -Oximetry will 
be used as the basis for comparison. The Accuracy Root Mean Squar e (A RMS) calculation is used to determine the 
SpO 2 accuracy performance. Success will be achieved with an A RMS of 3 or better showing equivalence to the Gold 
Standard Reference CO -Oximetry providing documentation to support SpO 2 accuracy claims for the inv estigational 
device (s).

Objectives of the Clinical Investigation Plan  
The purp ose of this clinical study  is to evaluate the SpO 2 accuracy performance of the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart 
Sock V. 2  during non -motion conditions over the range of 70 -100% SaO 2 as compared to arterial blood samples 
assessed by CO -Oximetry .  The end goal is to provide supporting doc umentation for the SpO 2 accuracy validation 
of the  Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2 . 
 
It is required  that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) performance of the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2  
SpO 2 will meet a specification of 3 or better in no n-motion conditions for the range of 70 – 100% SaO 2 thereby 
demonstrating an acceptable SpO 2 accuracy performance specification.  
 
Identification and Description of the Investigational Device  
An oximeter is a device used to transmit radiation at a known wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the 
blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. Pulse oximetry monitoring is 
considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in everyday situati ons to estimate 
arterial oxygen saturation. Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement, the 
pulse oximeter can provide non -invasive real time information. The clinical use of pulse oximeters has reduced the 
frequency and ne cessity of invasive arterial blood sampling, and has helped to improve patient safety by providing 
continuous information to clinicians about patients’ oxygenation status.  
  
The device used in this investigational study is the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart S ock V. 2 , with specific emphasis  on 
its pulse oximetry  accuracy .  The Smart Sock V. 2  is a commercially available device . The Smart Sock V. 2  is a non -
invasive home care device for use with infants .  
 
The Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2  is baby monitoring product that measures a baby’s oxygen levels and  
heart rate via a sensor embedded in a sock (smart sock). The monitor comprises a wireless  pulse oximeter sensor 
that sends the acquired information to a base station within the  baby's roo m. The base station optionally relays 
the information to the caretaker’s  smartphone for display of pulse rate and blood oxygen levels via the Owlet Baby 
Care, Inc.  app.

Preliminary Investigations and Justifications of the Study  
As part of the product development and validation phase s for the  Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock  V. 2, studies 
were  conducted at Shenzen Laboratories in 2015 . The purpose was to conduct an initial  hypoxia study using a 
Nellcor  Reference Pulse Oximeter Transfer Standard  and a Radiometer OSM 3 hemoximeter  to evaluate  the SpO 2 
accuracy of  the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2 .   
 
In review of the literature, the FDA Guidance Document for Pulse Oximeters and ISO 80601 -2-61 clearly define the 
accepted guideline for evaluation and documenting the SpO 2 accuracy in humans.  
 
See Section: Reference Doc uments, below.  
 
Risks and Benefits of the Investigational De vice and Clinical Investigation  
Currently the FDA defines pulse oximeters as Class II devices which transmit radiation at a known wavelength(s) 
through blood and to measure the blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered 
radiation and may be used alone or in con junction with a fiberoptic oximeter catheter. All oximeters being used in 
this study work by transmittance of radiation at known wavelength(s) through tissue to measure blood oxygen 
saturation based on the amount of reflected and scattered radiation. The d evices under test and this study 
procedure  are considered Non-Significant Risk (NSR) .

The device and use of the device under test does not meet the definition of significant risk device under 21 CFR 
812.3(m)  
 
For the purpose of this study:  
• It is not int ended as an implant.  
o Pulse oximetry sensors are applied to the surface of the site (su ch as forehead, ears, and fingers ) and 
are removed following data collection , less than 1 day.   
o Sensors may be warm to the touch but are not expected to overheat during normal operations  
o The pulse oximetry systems along with the other finger clip sensors, reusable sensors , and the 
forehead headband which may exert a small amount of pressure with mild discomfort  
o Adhesives may cause some skin irritations.  
• It is not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life, nor does it present a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
o Pulse oximeters are monit ors and are not used to support or sustain human life.  
• It is not for use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise 
preventing impairment of human health  
o Pulse oximeters are Class II devices used to mea sure the blood oxygen saturation.  They are not used 
to diagnose, cure mitigate or treat disease. These devices are typically labeled with a general 
indication for non -invasive measurement of blood oxygen saturation.  
• The device as used in this investigatio n does not present a serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
o See below for discussion of risk associated with the device and use of the device.  
 
Invasive Laboratory Testing on Healthy Volunteers  
The risk determination is based on the u se of the device in an investigation in addition to the device itself. 
Generally, the FDA believes pulse oximeters as addressed in the FDA Guidance Document for Pulse Oximeters 
(March 4, 2013) are non -significant risk devices. Further, the recommendation i s to conduct the study in 
accordance with Clause 201.12.1.101.2 and Annex EE.2 of ISO 80601 -2-61:2011, where Annex EE.2 describes the 
procedure for invasive laboratory testing on healthy volunteers.  
 
Controlled Desaturation Study  
Desaturation of the subjec t involves the administration of oxygen/nitrogen mixtures that are less than that of 
normal air, i.e., less than 21% oxygen.   The minimum percentage of oxygen to be delivered is 9% which results in 
blood oxygen saturation levels similar to those that are seen in healthy individuals who are at a 14,000 to 17,000 
feet elevation.  Potential symptoms include air hunger, dizziness, faster breathing, higher pulse rate, and tingling in 
the hands or feet or loss of consciousness. Vision changes such as ‘starring’ or ‘tunnel vision’ can also occur.  In the 
event of any of the above symptoms the subject can be returned to room air or given high levels of oxygen.  All of 
these symptoms, if they occur, reverse within minutes of discontinuation of the testing.  During t he test, the subject 
is closely monitored and constant communication regarding the subjects comfort and sense of well -being is 
assessed. The ECG, pulse oximetry saturation, inspired and expired oxygen, and exhaled carbon dioxide are 
monitored.  Since 1983 Clinimark has  performed these types of tests in this and other laboratories where we 
conducted approximately 8,900 desaturation tests with no significant negative events.   
 
The mask allows gas for maximum delivery. The mask is made of soft flexible plastic so as to minimize the 
discomfort level as much as is reasonably possible. Materials may cause some skin irritations.  
 
Radial Arterial Line  
Radial Arterial Line placement i nvolves introduction of a standard arterial catheter or angiocath into the radial 
artery.  Since the arterial catheter is placed into the artery using a needle, there will be mild to moderate

discomfort.  The total amount of blood drawn during the procedur e is less than 150cc.  The possible risks from the 
arterial catheter include: pain, hyperventilation, pressure, muscle/artery spasm, fracture of the catheter under the 
skin (which may require an additional procedure for catheter retrieval)  with insertion; discomfort with saline flush 
(cool, burning, or tingling sensation distal to the arterial line site, especially in the finger tips), or pain, hematoma 
(bruising), clotting, and scar formation.  All precautions to minimize discomfort will be taken, includin g a small 
injection of Lidocaine (a numbing medicine) under the skin at the insertion site.  A vascular assessment will be 
conducted prior to cannulation of the artery to verify the presence of adequate collateral blood flow to the hand.  
The risk of radia l arterial catheterization is believed to be minimal.   
 
Lidocaine  
The risks associated with use of Lidocaine as a numbing medicine may include discomfort or pain (burning or 
stinging) with injection; allergic reaction to medication; transient numbness in finger(s) . 
 
Pulse Oximetry Sensor  
Pulse Oximetry Sensor placement involves positioning pulse oximetry sensors on the volunteer subject in the same 
manner that is used on hospitalized patients.  For the purposes of this study; the Smart Sock V. 2 will be placed on 
the thumbs of the adult population.  The sensors may be warm to the touch. Under normal operating conditions, 
(no fault conditions), the sensors are not expected to overheat. If the sensors are too warm, they will be removed 
immediately .  Clip on and soft reusable sensors exert a minimal amount of pressure. They should not cause 
discomfort. Sensor retention headband for the forehead sensor exert a minimal amount of pressure and may 
cause a headache if on for extended periods of time. If the sensors are too uncomfortable, they will be removed 
immediately.  Adhesive sensors or tape may cause some irritations to the skin in some subjects. Every effort will be 
made to minimize products with natural rubber or latex. Products containing natural  rubber or latex will be 
identified.  The risk in the use of pulse oximetry sensors is believed to be minimal . 
 
ECG Electrodes  
Materials (such as the adhesive and/or gel contact) used in the electrodes may cause some skin irritations in some 
subjects. Typ ical skin irritations present with redness of skin and in some cases of sensitivity is an allergic reaction. 
Because the adhesive is aggressive on the ECG pads, it may cause pulling of the skin or hair upon removal. 
Biocompatibility testing for surface con tact electrodes is a requirement of the International Standards Organization 
(ISO) 10993 – Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices. The risk in the use of ECG electrodes is believed to be 
minimal.  
 
Ultrasound  
Ultrasound utilizes high frequency sound waves  to produce images of internal body structures. There are no 
anticipated risks.  The ultrasound will be used to detect the radial artery in screening and assist in placement of the 
arterial catheter before data collection.  The placement of the arterial li ne will be performed under sterile 
conditions.  Ultrasound gel  will not be used on subjects with known allergies .   
 
Blood Pressure Cuff  
The reported risks associated with NIBP include A) slight discomfort upon inflation of the cuff, B) possible bruising, 
C) petechial rash and D) discoloration of the skin beneath the cuff. In rare instances the reported risks associated 
with NIBP include A) peripheral nerve injuries B) skin tear, and C) compartment syndrome (swelling of muscles in 
the limb causing  the reduction of the blood supply to the muscle).  
 
More than 3,946 adults, children, and newborn babies have had their blood pressures taken repeatedly in 104 
studies using similar equipment.  In these previous studies, the complications of taking repeate d blood pressures 
were temporary and involved either bruising/rash; for example, petechiae rash (less than 2.2%), skin redness/lines 
(0.8%), or tingling/discoloration in the extremity wearing the cuff while the cuff is inflated (0.1%).

It is possible that  the test subject may experience an allergic reaction to the material in the cuff.  However, cuffs 
used in this trial for screening utilize standard material that has undergone skin sensitivity testing.   
 
 
Heating Pad / Hot Water Bottles  
A heating pad or hot water bottles may be used on the arm to improve the circulation to the finger site. Mild 
discomfort can be expected if it is too warm. To minimize the discomfort, the subject will be asked about comfort 
level. If the heating is too warm, it will be tur ned on the lowest level possible, removed or additional separation 
will be used between the heater and the site for comfort.  
 
Perfusion Index Ulnar/Ulnar+Radial Ratio test  
During the Perfusion Index Ulnar/Ulnar+Radial Ratio test for assessment of sufficie nt collateral circulation, the 
wrist is squeezed for less than 1 minute. This may cause minimal discomfort.  
 
There are no anticipated risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are no contraindications for use in 
the proposed study / study popu lation. There may be other risks to the subject associated with the device or 
procedure that are unforeseeable at this time.  
 
Benefits  
The benefits to the study are to the advancement of non -invasive medical devices  by improving accuracy and 
performance of pulse oximeters  and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) devices . There are no direct benefits to the 
subjects participating in this study  other than being a paid volunteer. The only alternative to this study is to NOT 
participate.  
 
Design of the Clinical Investigation  
 
Method  
This study is a comparative, single -center, non -randomized study in  up to 3 separate sets of  10 to 15 subjects  each . 
Each subject test is expected to take approximately 1.5 to 2  hour s. The overall data collection process for each  10-
15 subject  set will occur over a 3 -5 day period.  
 
Subjects will be provided an IRB approve d Informed Consent which covers the essential information in the 
protocol, ISO 14155  (as reference only)  and applicable regulatory requirements for a non -significant risk medical 
device investigation. Subjects will be provided sufficient time to review the informed consent and have all 
questions answered regarding their participation before enrollment or con duct of study specific procedures. As 
applicable, subjects will be told about any new information that might change their decision to participate.  
 
Subjects who have completed (signed and dated) the informed consent and health questionnaire form, and meet  
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. If the Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
is amended/updated throughout the life -cycle of the study, a determination will be made as to whether the 
subjects who have completed t he study need to re -consent by reviewing, signing and personally dating the 
updated ICF.  
 
Qualified healthy volunteers will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will recline for the study. A Control Pulse 
Oximetry sensor will be placed on each subject to monitor the real time SpO 2 levels . Shield material may  be used 
between any adjacent finger sensors to prevent optical crosstalk.   
 
Simultaneous data collection will be set up for devices under test. The data from the test devices will be collected 
by the s ponsor  or trained Clinimark Study staff . Data will be collected for 1 second intervals data analysis. The SpO 2 
accuracy of the test devices will be evaluated over the oxygen saturation range between 70 -100%.

Endpoint / Comparator  
The primary objective of this study is to validate  SpO 2 accuracy performance of the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart 
Sock V. 2  by an Accur acy Root Mean Square ( Arms) value.  Reference CO -Oximetry, will be used as the basis for 
comparison for the investigational device SpO 2 readings. The study population will include 10 to 15 subjects. The 
data for analysis will have approximately 200 data points equally distributed across the range of 70 -100% by 
decade. All data will be used for the analysis unless a rational is provided for its removal. Possible reasons for data 
removal include , but are not limited to, unstable control, dashed or z ero values, poor perfusion at the site, 
inconsistent or invalid CO -Oximetry  values.  Data that is found to not be  useable will be removed prior to the 
comparative analysis. For the statistical analysis, the Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) calculation is us ed to 
determine the SpO 2 accuracy performance providing documentation for the SpO 2 accuracy for the device under 
test during non -motion conditions.  
 
There are no deviations expected from this investigation plan, should deviations be needed, discussions wi ll be 
conducted with the sponsoring company and reported to the reviewing IRB per standard operating procedures .

Duration of Clinical Investigation  
Each subject, and therefore use of the d evice, is expected to take 1.5-2 hours. Data collection will occur over a 3 -5 
day period for this study population.   
 
Criteria for Study Termination  
The study will be terminated if any of the following conditions occurs:  
• The subject may stop the study for any reason without prejudice  
• The clinician or gas controller may terminate the study at his/her discretion  
• Unable to obtain vascular access  
• Initial blood draw values of, COHb >3%, MetHb > 2%, and tHb <10g/dl   
• Development of any cardiac arrhythmia, exc ept sinus arrhythmia <120 bpm  
• Development of clinically significant ST or T segment changes in the ECG  
• Sustained sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm  
• Onset of PVCs  
• The lowest target is 7 0% SpO 2. Due to unpredictable human physiology, the subject may drift below 67%. 
Should this occur, an attempt will be made to increase the oxygen saturation level by increasing the FiO 2 level 
to achieve a SpO 2 in the 67-73% range or a decision is made to increas e the FiO 2 to a new SpO 2 range or 
terminate the study.   
 
Any data collected to the point of a decision to terminate the study will be reviewed for inclusion to the analysis 
prior to generation of the final results. Data excluded from the analysis will be documented with justifications.  
 
Procedure  
1. Complete Equipment checkout list prior to starting study. Calibrate / check FiO 2 monitor(s).    
2. Set the  clocks to sync data collection between the Sponsor and Clinimark systems.  
3. Explain the procedure to the subject. Have them read the Informed Consent Form, and review the information 
answering all questions. Once all questions have been answered, have the subject sign the form. Have the 
subject complete the Health Assessment Form and verbally question the subject about their health history. 
Each subject will be asked if they want a copy of the consent form prior to release. Female subjects will take a 
urine pregnancy test.  
4. Apply Finger sensor to thumb where the arterial line placem ent is intended.  Record perfusion index (PI) value 
from 3900 TT+ Pulse Oximeter. Perform a modified Allen’s test to ensure sufficient blood flow to the hands. 
Occlude both radial and ulnar arteries until there is no plethysmographic waveform and the PI is essentially 
zero. Release the ulnar artery holding the radial artery firm. Record the PI level. The ratio of the ulnar artery PI 
measurement to the starting PI level should be greater than or equal to 0.4 to qualify for the study. This is a 
safeguard to en sure there is a sufficient blood flow supply to the hand should the flow from the radial artery 
become altered.  
5. Take subject’s blood pressure and record values.  
6. Apply ECG leads to the subject, review for normal sinus rhythm.  
7. Based on the responses to the  Health assessment form, record accepted or declined from the study. Continue 
if accepted into the study.  
8. A qualified clinician will use local anesthesia and then place the arterial catheter in the radial artery of the 
non-dominate hand (preferred). The ar terial line is then secured with tape to the subject’s arm.  
9. Setup and verify communication between the devices and data collection system.  
10. Record device information for tracking. (manufacturer, model #, serial or lot, hardware / software control 
info).  
11. Record subject information. Subject number and demographics information for subject description.  
12. Have subjects recline.

will be delivered to induce hypoxia in a stair stepped manner.  Data collection will be evenly distributed by 
decade over the oxygen saturation range.   
21. The clinician monitors and records the following information periodically. SpO 2, pulse rate, EtCO 2, respiration 
rate, relevant information on the ECG rhythm, FiO 2. The clinician will monitor the arterial line and subject’s 
well-being throughout the test confirming that the subject is doing “ok”. Subject will be advised during the 
study that he/she may stop the test at any time.  
22. While breathing room  air, collect baseline arterial samples and measure on the CO -Oximeter. The method for 
sampling will be:  
• Mark data for start of stability period hold ~30 seconds to 1 minute  
• Draw waste or leader blood sample prior to draw, mark data  
• Draw arterial blood sam ple marking data  
• Wait ~15 to 30 seconds, draw waste or leader blood sample prior to draw  
• Draw additional arterial blood sample marking data  
• If a closed arterial blood collection system is used then the leader blood will be returned. Flush the 
line with ste rile saline.  
• Change to next gas level  
Note timing may vary based on the subject’s stability.  
23. Should the initial COHb reading be out of range (>3%) as measured by Reference CO -Oximetry, then a 
determination will be made as to the viability of blowing off th e COHb levels through an exercise of 
hyperventilation and elevated levels of oxygen being administered to the subject. If this is the case, blood 
samples will be drawn to monitor the COHb level until it is acceptable or a determination is made to withdraw 
the subject.  
24. Multiple plateaus will be achieved throughout the range from 100% to 70%.  
25. The clinician monitors and records the following information periodically. SpO 2, pulse rate, EtCO 2, respiration 
rate, relevant information on the ECG rhythm, FiO 2. The c linician will monitor the subject’s wellbeing  
throughout  the test confirming that the subject is doing ok.  
26. Subject will be advised during the study that he/she may stop the test at any time.  
27. The gas controller monitors the gas delivery and data collection  system to ensure proper functionality. 
Performance of the test devices may be noted on the form as well.  
28. The test may be stopped at any time by the subject, the clinician, the gas controller. The test will also be 
stopped if the SpO 2 level goes below the minimum SpO 2 or the FiO 2 goes below 9%.  
29. Arterial blood sampling will be repeated at each stable plateau. Method used will be same as described in step 
#22 above.

Goal is to collect 20 – 34 data points per subject with  an equal distribution of data by decade. The stable plateaus 
will allow for data to be collected in the following ranges 95 -100, 90 -95, 85 -90, 80 -85, 75 -80, 67 -75. In general, 4 to 
8 discrete points will be collected at each of the levels such that the ov erall data of the population is evenly 
distributed by decade and the minimum number of points is met for the data analysis. A fewer number of data 
points are expected on some subjects that are unable to tolerate the duration of the lower hypoxic levels.  
 
30. Once the lowest level SpO 2 has been achieved and data collection has been completed, the subject will be 
given a gas mixture returning him/her to baseline levels.  
31. The subject may be re -saturated to above 80% SpO 2 for a recovery period  and additional data m ay be taken at 
higher SpO2 ranges .  The subject then may reattempt the lower SpO 2 levels.  
32. The breathing circuit is disconnected and the subject is monitored for a few minutes to ensure he/she 
maintains normal baseline levels.  
33. All equipment will be removed  from the subject.  
34. The arterial line will be removed and a pressure bandage will be applied to the subject for approximately 15 
minutes or until bleeding has stopped.  
35. The clinician will review any final questions with the subject and ask if there were any effects from the study. 
The subject will be given final instructions for care of the wrist which had the arterial line. The subject will be 
provided with phone numbers for questions pertaining to participation in this study or research -related injury 
or re action post the study. The subject will be informed of the follow up procedure post the study.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
This study is intended to validate  SpO 2 accuracy c laims  of the Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  Smart Sock V. 2  SpO 2 Sensor 
during non-motion conditions over the range of 70 -100% SpO 2 in comparison to a Reference CO-Oximeter. Data 
analysis may  occur in the following manner:  
 
Data analysis will follow ISO80601 -2-61, Annex EE and the FDA Guidance Document for Pulse Oximeters (March 4, 
2013). The reference guidance documents clearly define the study, number of subjects, data points needed for the 
analysis and handling of missing data or data that is removed from the analysis. This is achieved through a 
minimum of 200 paired observations o f Test and Reference values equally distributed over the specified SpO 2 
accuracy range (70 -100%) of the device under test. The data will be collected on a minimum of 10 healthy adult 
volunteer subjects who range in age, gender and skin tone with 2 of the s ubjects or 15% of the subject pool 
(whichever is larger) having deep skin pigmentation tones. An Accuracy Root Mean Square (A RMS) calculation is 
used as a means to define the SpO 2 Accuracy. The controls of the study will be provided in the following manner . 
The control oximeter will provide the real time oxygen saturation level of the subject for determination of plateau 
levels and safety. Additionally, the oxygen saturation values (SpO 2) of a control oximeter will be used to assess the 
stability of the pla teaus for data collection. There are no provisions for an interim analysis. For the v alidation , the

SpO 2 accuracy of test pulse oximetry system is compared to the Gold Standard  measurement of blood SaO 2 by a  
CO-Oximet er. Data analysis & demographics will be presented in the final report.  
 
Control oximeter stability criteria  
The control oximeter will provide the real time oxygen saturation level of the subject for determination of 
plateau levels and safety.  
The data points are considered u nstable and removed from the analysis:  
• if the Control Oximeter SpO 2 value varies by >2% during the simulated draw time  
• if the combined minimum and maximum deviations of the Control Oximeter SpO 2 value are > 3% during 
the review period of 20 -30 sec prior to  draw period through the draw as defined by ISO 80601 -2.   
 
CO-Oximeter Data  
The CO -Oximeter data is reviewed for outliers or anomalous readings from which these plateaus are subject to 
removal. The functional oxygen saturation value will be used for the b asis of comparison to SpO 2 value 
collected from the pulse oximeter. Draws with COHb values >3% or MetHb values >2% or tHb <10 g/dl will be 
excluded from the data. When multiple CO -Oximeters are used, data that presents outliers from the other CO -
Oximeters will be removed from the average of all CO -Oximeters. Outliers are defined as a CO -Oximeter SO 2 
values (functional oxygen saturation) that are >2% from the other CO -Oximeter’s values. In the case where 2 
CO-Oximeters are used, the data will be averaged unl ess the difference between the 2 CO -Oximeters is >2%. 
When the 2 CO -Oximeters deviate by >2%, the tHb, COHb, MetHb values will be reviewed for consistency to 
the other draws for this subject. If those values are found to be similar in readings for a given subject, then it is 
determined that the true reference value is unstable and the point will be removed from the analysis. If the 
finding is that one of the CO -Oximeter’s has an SO 2 value offset due to tHb, COHb or COHb values that are not 
similar for a giv en subject, then the offending CO -Oximeter value will not be used and the other 1 CO -
Oximeter SO 2 value will be used as the reference for comparison.  
 
Draws with CO -Oximeter data that are < 67% will be removed.  
  
Test SpO 2 Data Removal:  
• The test S pO 2 values recorded as 100% will be removed prior to the analysis.  
• Zero values  or no reading  (drop outs in  SpO 2 or pulse rate) will be excluded from the calculations for SpO 2. 
 
A rationale will be provided for any data that is excluded from the data analysis .  
 
The data will be plotted and analyzed through the following statistics, using the Reference CO-Oximetry S aO2 
value for the x value and the Test Devices SpO 2 value for the y value.  
 
Ref = Reference CO-Oximetry S aO2 
DUT = Device Under test SpO 2  
 
SpO 2 accuracy will be evaluated for root -mean -square (rms) difference between the DUT and the reference for 
the specified SpO 2 ranges (70 -100%) and by SpO 2 decade (90 -100%, 80<90%, 70 -<80%). The number of data 
points will be included for each statistic.

• Ask if they would like to take part in the study  and if so explain that they may sign and date the form.  
• Once the subject has signed and dated the informed consent, the principal investigator or authorized designee 
will sign and date the form.  
• Give a copy of the informed consent to the subject.  
• No procedure may be performed before the informed consent is signed by the subject  
 
If an investigator uses a device without obtaining informed consent, the investigator shall report such use to the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB within 5 working days after th e use occurs.  
 
Safety  
Investigators  
All experimenters must review the protocol prior to test and sign that they read and understood the contents.  
 
Subject  
Equipment is checked out for proper functionality prior to being placed on the subject.  
The Clinima rk Desaturation Fixture does not require maintenance. At the start of each day of the study, the 
fixture is calibrated with calibration gas. A secondary monitor independent of the fixture is used to measure 
and document the FiO 2 delivered at 3 levels. The measurement is expected to be within ± 1 of the FiO 2 setting 
for the fixture.  
 
There are three steps used to ensure safe gas mixture delivery. The fixture implores continuous monitoring of 
gas flow and mixtures. Should the measurements drop below a predete rmined level either the primary O 2 
and/or N 2 flow valves are adjusted or a secondary O 2 delivery system is switched on. Error messages and 
status messages are displayed. Second, the gas controller directly observes the monitoring status and gas 
delivery displays of the fixture. Third, a clinician directly observes the subject and other monit ors independent 
of the gas delivery fixture to ensure the subject’s well -being during the test.  
    
The subject will review and sign the informed consent following a discussion of the test procedure and when 
all questions regarding the study have been answ ered and prior to start of any study procedures. The subject 
will complete the health assessment questionnaire and disclose any pertinent issues that may affect his/her 
health during the test. The subject may withdraw from the study at any time. The subjec t may be withdrawn 
per the Procedure section below.   
 
A clinician will be present to monitor the subject at all times. Safety monitoring includes, SpO 2, pulse rate, 
relevant information on ECG rhythm, FiO 2, EtCO 2, respiration rate, direct observation and communication with 
the subject.

Adverse Event Definitions  
The definitions for adverse event, adverse device effect, serious adverse event, serious adverse device effect, 
unanticipated adverse device effect, and their classifications are provided below (I SO 14155, 21 CFR 812.3).  
• Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  Adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device 
resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, installation, 
the operation, or any malf unction of the investigational medical device or from error use.  
• Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward 
clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons  whether or 
not related to the investigational medical device or investigational procedure  
• Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (ASADE):  ASADE is an effect which by its nature, 
incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis r eport.  
• Mild:  a mild adverse event is one in which the subject is aware of the event, but it is easily tolerated 
without intervention.  
• Moderate:  a moderate adverse event is one that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with usual 
activities.  
• Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE): adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event  
• Seriou s Adverse Event (SAE):  a serious adverse event is an adverse event that results in death, 
inpatient hospitalization, severe or permanent disability, a life threatening illness or injury, fetal 
distress, fetal death, a congenital abnormality, a birth defect , or medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent permanent impairment to body or structure.  
• Severe:  a severe adverse event is one that results in the inability to perform usual activities.  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  serious adverse device  effect which by its nature, 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis 
report.  
 
Management of Adverse Event Reporting  
Should the subject experience an adverse or non -typical event, assessment of the situation is first initiated and a 
determination will be made of appropriate actions. The Medical Director and Principle Investigator will be 
contacted as appropriate. Adverse Events are reported through standard Clinimark Procedures, IRB requirements 
and per Owlet Baby Care, Inc. ’s SOPs.   
 
Records of Adverse events will be recorded in the Case Report Form  
The following information will be obtained:  
• Type of effect (ADE, AE. ASADE, SADE, SAE, UADE)  
• Date of onset and resolution  
• Intensity (mild, moderate, sev ere) 
• Serious (yes/no)  
• Relationship to device (unknown, not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related)  
• Anticipated (yes/no)  
• Treatment given and / or action taken (procedure stopped, withdrawn from study, no action)  
 
 
 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and / or UADE  
All SAE’s, SADE, ASADE and UADE will be reported in writing to the Principal Investigator, Medical Director, 
Sponsor and IRB within 72 hrs of knowledge of the event.

Withdrawal, Early Termination or Suspension of the Investigation  
Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any point. If a subject 
official ly withdraws from the study, the laboratory staff will document the reason for withdrawal in the case 
report . 
  
It is recognized that some subjects may not be able to tolerate the lowest hypoxia levels in a stable manner. These 
subjects will be moved to hi gher SaO 2 levels for final data collection if needed. This is not considered to be a 
withdrawal or discontinuation of the subject and therefore will not be reported as such. These subjects are 
considered to have completed the study procedure without incide nce or any adverse events.  
 
Participation in the study may also be stopped at any time by the principal investigator or by the Sub -investigators 
or sponsor.  
• The subject’s failure to cooperate fully (as determined by the investigator in his or her sole disc retion) with the 
required conduct of this study.  
• The subject’s development of an illness as determined by the investigator in his or her sole discretion.

• A determination by a Clinimark representative (in his or her sole discretion), for whatever cause, tha t the 
study should be discontinued.  
• A determination by the sponsor (in his or her sole discretion), for whatever cause, that the study should be 
discontinued  
 
The collection of data for study subjects will cease in the following cases:  
• Subject completes a ll study requirements  
• Subject withdraws consent  
• Investigator’s decision that it is in subject’s best interest to be discontinued from the study  
• Subject death  
• Adverse event other than death requiring withdrawal of the subject from the study  
• Determination that the subject was ineligible for the study.  
 
There will not be any follow -up procedures for withdrawn or discontinued subjects required, unless a follow -up is 
required a t the Investigator’s discretion . 
 
Consideration for early termination or suspension of the investigation is tied to unanticipated equipment failure or 
a decision by the sponsor or the site. Both  Owlet Baby Care, Inc.  and Clinimark reserve the right to discontinue the 
study at any time for administrative or other reasons. Wri tten notice of study termination will be submitted to the 
investigator in advance of such termination. Termination of a specific site can occur because of, but not limited to, 
inadequate data collection, low subject enrollment, or non -compliance with the p rotocol or other research 
requirements.  
 
Early termination results when the study is  closed prior to the end of the study. A study suspension is  a temporary 
postponement of the study activities related to enrollment. Both are possible for the study.  
 
If the study is terminated or suspended, no additional enrollment will be allowed unless otherwise informed by the 
sponsor. The current subjects will be followed according to the protocol.  
 
If the study is terminated prematurely or suspended by the sponsor/in vestigator, the sponsor /investigator will 
promptly inform the regulatory authorities (if required) of the termination and the reason(s). IRB/IECs will also be 
promptly informed and provided with the reason(s) for termination or suspension by the sponsor/ investigator. 
The investigator will promptly inform the subjects and assure appropriate follow -up for the subject.  
 
If the investigator (or IRB/IEC) terminates or suspends the investigation the investigator will promptly inform the 
institution (if required ) and the IRB/IEC, and provide a detailed written explanation of the termination or 
suspension. The investigator will promptly inform the subjects and assure appropriate therapy and follow -up for 
the subjects. The sponsor will inform the regulatory authori ties (if required).  
 
Withdrawal of IRB approval shall be reported to the sponsor by the investigator within 2 working days.  
 
In case of early termination of the study, all study subjects should be followed until the resolution of any pending 
adverse event( s).

Invitation
We invite you to take part in a research study about how the injection of numbing 
medication in a targeted area prior to surgery may improve pain control after surgery. 
We are inviting you because you are scheduled for a surgery where the block may be 
beneficial. 
The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you need to decide 
whether to be in the study. It also explains how health information will be used for this 
study and requests your authorization (permission) to use your health information.  Ask 
questions about anything in this form that is not clear. If you want to talk to your family 
and friends before making your decision, you can. Once we have answered all your 
questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study.  This process is called 
“informed consent.”  
What is the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this research study is to understand if the injection of numbing 
medication (bupivacaine) injected in the area by your pectoral and rib muscles may 
improve your pain control after surgery. This injection procedure is called a pecto-

indicating that this block may reduce pain experienced after different surgical 
procedures in the same area of the body and we want to study how it may affect 
recovery after a sternum incision. This research must be conducted to understand if the 
block can help improve pain control after surgery. Its use in this study is considered 
experimental.
This study is being conducted at University Hospital with funding from the UW 
Department of Anesthesiology. We plan to include 100 participants in this study.
What will happen in this study ?
If you decide to participate in this research study you will be randomly assigned (like 
flipping a coin) to one of two groups. You will have an equal chance of being assigned 
to either of the two groups:
 Group 1: have the nerve block performed with bupivacaine injections.
 Group 2: have the nerve block performed with placebo (saline solution) 
injections
If you are in group 1, you will have the nerve block performed with bupivacaine and 
liposomal bupivacaine (shorter and longer acting numbing medications) on both sides of 
your chest before surgery. This will be performed after you are asleep under general 
anesthesia before they start your surgery. An ultrasound machine will be used to see 
the muscles of your chest and a bupivacaine mixture will be injected through a small 
needle in the correct location. We believe the numbing medication injected may help 
provide additional pain control after your surgery so you do not require as much pain 
medication. You will receive pain medication as needed after surgery to ensure you are 
comfortable, just as you would if you did not participate in the study. 
If you are in group 2, you will have the nerve block performed with saline instead of any 
numbing medication. This will occur after you are asleep under general anesthesia 
before they begin your surgery. An ultrasound machine will be used to see the muscles 
of your chest and saline will be injected through a small needle in the correct location. 
We do not expect this group to have any benefit associated with your recovery after 
surgery. You will receive pain medication as needed after surgery to ensure you are 
comfortable, just as you would if you did not participate in the study. 
You will not know which group you were randomly selected to. Your involvement in the 
study will not impact the anesthesia or surgery you receive in the operating room. After 
the operation you will receive standard care.
If you elect to participate in the study, you will be contacted by telephone approximately 
ninety days following your surgery and will be administered a brief pain survey over the

using pain medications at this time following your operation. Following this phone call 
and survey, your participation in the study will be complete. 
Protected health information (PHI) used in this study
Protected health information, also called PHI, is information about your physical or 
mental health that includes your name or other information that can identify you, like 
your date of birth or medical record number. From your medical records, health records, 
and/or billing records kept by the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics we will 
collect the following:
 Age, date of birth, medical record number, height, weight, body mass index, 
gender, which procedure you are scheduled for, date of procedure, creatine 
levels, time it takes your blood to clot (an INR test), your platelet count, 
anticoagulation levels, your left ventricle ejection fraction, your right ventricular 
function, if you have scarring on your liver or have a liver disease diagnosis, any 
opioid use prior to surgery, your baseline pain score, pro ICU and hospital length 
of stay and clinical data from your surgery and recovery such as opioid use 
during and after the surgery, pain scores, time until rescue pain medication is 
used, time until bowel function returns, and your answers to a pain questionnaire 
90 days after surgery.
How long will I be in this study?
You will receive the nerve block while you are asleep in your surgery. Your medical 
record will be used to follow the clinical data from your surgery and your recovery for 72 
hours after your operation. You will then receive a follow up call and pain survey 90 
days after your procedure. Following completion of this survey, your participation in the 
study will end. 
The researchers may take you out of the study, even if you want to continue, if
 Any health change where the study is no longer in your best interest
 The study is stopped by the researchers.
Could taking part in the study help me?
You are not guaranteed to benefit directly from participating in this study. If you are 
randomized to receive the block with the bupivacaine injections you may have improved 
pain control after surgery. If you receive the block with the placebo injections, we do not 
expect you to have any direct benefit from the study. Even if the study does not help 
you directly, your participation in this research study may benefit other people in the 
future by helping us learn whether there is a clinical difference with the addition of the 
nerve block.

Page 4 of 10How is being in this study different from my regular health care?
We do not routinely administer this nerve block for this surgery. If you take part in the 
study you will have the nerve block performed with either the bupivacaine injections or 
saline injections while you are asleep under anesthesia just prior to your surgery. You 
will also be contacted via telephone at approximately 90 days following your operation 
for a survey. The remainder of your care will be unchanged.  
Do I have to be in the study?  What if I say “yes” now and change my 
mind later?
No, you do not have to be in this study. Taking part in research is voluntary.  This 
means that you decide if you want to be in the study.  If you decide now to take part, 
you can choose to leave the study at any time.  
If you decide to be in the study, the researchers will tell you about new information or 
changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the 
study.
Let the researchers know if you choose to leave the study. If you decide not to take part 
in the study, or if you choose to leave the study, your choice will not affect any treatment 
relationship you have with healthcare providers at UW-Madison, UW Health or any 
affiliated organizations, or any services you receive from them.  No matter what decision 
you make, and even if your decision changes, there will be no penalty to you. You will 
not lose medical care or any legal rights.
What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study?
If you decide not to take part in the study, you may undergo the surgery with regular 
care without the additional study procedures. Regular care would involve no nerve 
blocks or injections and no telephone survey at 90 days. 
Are there any side effects or risks to me?
There are a few risks to this study that apply to all subjects. First, your study 
information could become known to someone who is not involved in performing or 
monitoring this study. A breach of confidentiality could result in damage to your 
reputation, but the chances of this happening are very small.
Nerve block injection risks (for both groups) include: bleeding, infection, nerve injury, 
injury to blood vessels, and the possibility your lung may collapse. These risks are 
very low and we will use an ultrasound machine during the injections to help reduce 
the chance of these risks occurring.

Page 5 of 10Potential adverse drug reactions for bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine include:
Numbness around your lips, tingling in your face, ringing in your ear, restlessness, 
anxiety, dizziness, seizure, coma, slowing of your heart rate, changes to the rhythm 
of your heart, decreased heart function, low blood pressure, allergic reactions. The 
reactions that could affect your nerves/brain and/or your heart/blood pressure are 
very rare and tend to result in the event of an overdose, inappropriate injection of the 
medicine into a blood vessel or due to your body not breaking down the medication 
appropriately. 
Specific to liposomal bupivacaine (10% or more): nausea, vomiting, constipation
Whenever an ultrasound is done, there is the chance of finding something unexpected. 
Unexpected findings can have clear clinical significance, or uncertain clinical 
significance. Clear clinical significance means that the ultrasound shows a problem 
that may be treatable and we generally know what the risks are of not treating the 
problem. Uncertain clinical significance means that the imaging shows something 
unusual in the spine, but we do not know if it might affect your health, and treatment 
may not be appropriate or possible. On this study, you will be informed of any findings 
of clear clinical significance that may be discovered during the imaging procedure, but 
you will not be informed if there are findings of uncertain clinical significance. In order 
to assist us in interpreting incidental findings in the ultrasound, we are also seeking 
your permission to review your medical records if you are or have been a patient at this 
hospital. 
There may be benefits to learning such results (such as early detection and treatment 
of a medical condition), but there are risks as well (such as problems with getting 
insurance or a job, or feeling worried about a finding for which no treatment is required 
or appropriate). The ultrasound we are using in this research study is used for 
guidance for the purpose of performing a block and is not meant as a diagnosis tool. If 
you believe you are having symptoms that may require clinical imaging, you should 
contact your primary care physician. 
You may also choose to have your physician informed of any findings of clear clinical 
significance that we report to you by checking the box below. Please note, however, 
that if you choose to have your physician informed of findings of clinical significance, 
that report will likely be placed in your medical record. Please indicate your preference 
by checking the appropriate box:
____     Yes, please inform my doctor of findings of clinical significance 
OR 
____     No, please do not inform my doctor of findings of clinical significance

 5.0 INTRODUCTION  
 Background  
Pain after cardiac surgery via median sternotomy occurs as a direct result of surgical manipulation and 
tissue trauma. Acute pain is typically an inflammatory response and may be related to the surgical incision, 
pericardiotomy, retraction, suturing, and/o r chest tube placement, among other causes. Acute pain after 
cardiac surgery has historically been treated with intravenous opioids, however significant side effects may 
limit their use and efficacy. A subset of patients experience  severe acute postoperative pain, which may 
increase length of stay, morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs1. In addition, 30 -50% of patients report 
chronic pain (lasting at least 2 months) after coronary bypass surgery2, and the greatest  predictor of 
chronic post -surgical pain is poorly controlled acute postoperative pain2.  
Over the past decade, with the emergence of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for cardiac surgery 
programs, cardiac anesthesiologists have been exploring unique options for ma intenance of anesthesia 
and management of postoperative pain in place  of high -dose opioids. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques 
have been used and studied extensively in this context, and while they appear safe and may even improve 
outcomes4-6, persistent conc ern over the rare, yet devastating, risk of spinal or epidural hematoma during 
full heparinization has limited their use in cardiac surgery. In addition, paravertebral blocks have shown 
comparable analgesic effects after cardiac surgery compared to thoraci c epidural blockade7, however 
similar concerns over epidural hematoma exist.  
The anteromedial chest wall, including the sternum, is innervated by the anterior cutaneous branches of 
the intercostal nerves. One option to target these nerves is the transvers us thoracic plane (TTP) block, 
described by Ueshima et al, where local anesthetic is injected in the fascial plane between the transversus 
thoracic and internal intercostal muscles just lateral to the sternum8. However, the internal mammary artery 
(IMA) is  located in the same plane, which could lead to devastating complications if this block is used for 
coronary bypass surgery involving the IMA.  
The pecto -intercostal fascial plane block (PIFB)  aims to block the anterior cutaneous branches of the 
intercosta l nerves as they ascend in the parasternal region between the pectoralis major and external 
intercostal muscles. This block is superficial to the TTP and therefore should decrease the risk of injury to 
the IMA as well as  the risk of pneu mothorax . This bloc k has been described by several different names in 
the literature, including the subpectoral interfascial plane block, the parasternal intercostal plane block, and 
the anterior thoracic medial block. Case reports and case series have demonstrated success i n using th is 
fascial plane block for acute post -sternotomy pain9-10, sternal fracture s or anterior rib fractures11-14, and as 
an adjunct for coverage of medial breast procedures15-18. Two recently published randomized controlled 
trials have supported this block as safe and effective for reducing visual analog scale pain scores19 and 
postoperative opioid requirements using standard bupivacaine injection within this fascial plane20. 
In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of Exp arel© liposomal 
bupivacaine formulation for surgical site infiltration and field blocks. It has been marketed for local nerve 
infiltration, hemorrhoidectomy, bunionectomy and fascial plane blocks. In 2018, the FDA expanded its 
indication to include intersc alene brachial plexus blocks following further evidence of its efficacy and safety. 
One downside of single shot peripheral nerve blockade is the duration of analgesia can be relatively short 
lived. Exparel© uses the multivesicular liposomal formulation of bupivacaine to deliver an extended -release 
effect of local anesthetic. This extended -release action may offer the benefit of long -lasting opioid sparing 
effects of regional analgesia without the need for perineural catheters or repeat single -shot injection s, 
which may be time -consuming, increase wound infection risk, and place the patient at risk of requiring 
repeat procedures. To that end, the use of liposomal bupivacaine in fascial plane blocks for colorectal 
surgery ERAS protocols has found advantages ov er single -shot techniques with standard bupivacaine21 
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon

 and similar efficacy with less opioid use compared to a catheter/epidural -based analgesic approach22. The 
use of liposomal bupivacaine for cardiac surgery and median sternotomy has been limited with mix ed 
results to date23-24, with no studies to our knowledge evaluating its use in the PIFB.  
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral pecto -intercostal fascial plane blocks with liposomal 
bupivacaine in the setting of a multimodal perioperative a nalgesic regimen in elective cardiac surgery 
patients requiring median sternotomy.  
 Rationale   
Thousands of heart surgeries are performed every day in the United States25. Unattenuated perioperative 
pain has been shown to contribute to increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and healthcare costs. 
Practice guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesiologists recommend pre -incision 
techniques to reduce perioperative pain26, however in cardiac surgery, there are no commonly used 
techniques  to follow this recommendation. The PIFB is a newly described fascial plane block and existing 
literature supports the safety and efficacy of the PIFB in cardiac surgery patients. However, there are no 
randomized controlled trials evaluating this technique  with a long -acting depot local anesthetic.  
The purpose of this study is to determine whether bilateral pecto -intercostal fascial plane blocks with 
liposomal bupivacaine decrease pain and opioid requirements in patients undergoing cardiac surgery via 
medi an sternotomy compared to controls (sham blocks with saline). Our primary hypothesis is that patients 
receiving effective regional anesthesia with liposomal bupivacaine via PIFB will demonstrate a clinically 
significant (25%) reduction in total daily opioi d consumption through 72 hours postoperatively compared to 
patients receiving standard of care without effective regional anesthesia (saline only via PIFB).

 Vulnerable  Populations  
Prisoners  
Due to the complexity of state and federal requirements governing the participation of prisoners in 
research, patients who are prisoners will not be considered for participation in this trial. In the unlikely event 
that a subject beco mes a prisoner while participating in this trial, study procedures will stop and the subject 
will be returned to the clinical mode used prior to the intervention period or, if desired, an alternative mode 
requested by the clinical care team.  
 
Pregnancy  
Patients who are known to be pregnant will be excluded from participation.  
 Subject Identification  
A member of the research team will review the surgery schedule at least one week in advance and identify 
patients who appear to be candidates for the study. T he study team will work with the perioperative care 
team (including the assigned anesthesia staff and surgeon) to confirm eligibility criteria and potential 
participation. All protected health information used during the screening process of a potential su bject will 
be the minimum necessary for the conduct of this study.  Any protected health information recorded for 
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon  
  
 
Version #: 1.0  Version Date: 11/20/2020  Page 11 of 27 
 screening will be destroyed for ineligible patients  once they are deemed ineligible by a study team member  
aside from the reason  for exclusion . Any protected health information recorded for an eligible patient who 
declines study participation and is not enrolled in the study will immediately be destroyed.  
 Subject Recruitment  and Informed Consent  
When potential participants are identified and approved by the teams involved, a member of the study team 
will call the patient prior to the day of surgery and determine their interest in participating. On the day of 
surgery, potential participants will proceed through the usual preoperative process. A member of the study 
team will meet with the  patients the morning of surgery. In order to ensure the candidate’s privacy and 
confidentiality, the cubicle’s curtain or room door will be closed. In a tone of voice insufficient for others to 
overhear the conversation and in the presence of only those i mmediately accompanying the patient and 
those who are directly involved with the patient’s care, the candidate’s  eligibility, the study purpose, 
procedures, risks, benefits and alternatives will then be discussed. The written information about the study 
provided to the candidate at the time of their check -in will be reviewed and they will be instructed to take as 
much time as needed to consider their participation. Any questions that the candidate may have will be 
answered. Undue coercion will be prevented by stressing that the potential subject does not have to agree 
to participation and that the future care of the potential subject will not change regardless of the decision to 
participate. If the candidate has no further questions and would like to partici pate, they will be asked to sign 
the written informed consent document . The research subject will be given a copy of the signed and dated 
informed consent form. The original signed informed consent form is kept in a locked office in the 
Department of Anest hesiology . 
 Enrollment  
A research subject will be defined as “enrolled” in the study when they meet the following criteria:  
• The subject has been consented by study staff  and has agreed to participate .  
• The subject and study staff have completed all screenin g documentation.  
• The PI has verified that the subject meets all of the inclusion criteria.  
• The PI has verified that subject meets none of the exclusion criteria.  
• The subject has been assigned to the protocol by study staff.  
• The subject has been randomized . 
• The subject has received the study intervention.  
 Early Termination and Withdrawal  
At any point prior to or during the intervention period, the patient’s clinical care team or a study physician 
may decide that the subject should be withdrawn from the stud y. In addition, at any point, a patient may 
elect to withdraw themselves from the study. If a patient is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
patient will then be followed according to standard of care follow -up. In the event that a subject is 
withdrawn from the study prematurely, the reason for withdrawal will be documented on a case report form.  
9.0 PROCEDURAL INTERVENT ION  
 Study Procedural Intervention (s) Description   
The intervention portion of this study is the randomized assignment (1:1) to receive 25mL of saline or 15mL 
of 0.25% bupivacaine mixed with 10mL of liposomal bupivacaine (133mg) as a single -shot injection into the 
pecto -intercostal fascial plane bilaterally. All studied volumes are well within the acceptable range for 
pecto -interco stal nerve blocks described previously. All patients will be treated intraoperatively according to 
our institutional enhanced recovery after surgery for cardiac patients, including the use of 
dexmedetomidine and ketamine infusions with as -needed fentanyl i ntravenous dosing.

 Method  for Assigning to Treatment Groups  
After consent is obtained, participants will be randomized to an intervention group. Randomization will be 
accomplished using an online service ( www.randomizer.org ) and prefilling sealed envelopes determining 
each subject’s intervention group. Randomization will occur immediately prior to the intervention. All 
subjects will receive the standard of anesthesia care appropriate for their surgery or procedure as 
determine d by the primary anesthesia team caring for the subject, regardless of randomization group. Each 
study subject as well as the OR anesthesia team, cardiac surgery team, cardiothoracic ICU team, and 
nursing staff caring for the patient will be blinded to the  study drug the patient received. However, the 
anesthesia provider performing the block (separate from the provider caring for the patient in the operating 
room) will not be blinded to the study drug injected and will have access to all monitors deemed 
appropriate by the primary team caring for the subject. In order to maintain blinding during the procedure, 
the medication syringe will be covered by a towel after being drawn up and during injection to prevent the 
intraoperative teams from visualizing the co ntents being injected. The ultrasound will also be turned such 
that only the anesthesiologist performing the procedure can see, as Exparel has a distinct sonographic 
appearance on injection. Specific individuals who were involved in the block placement wil l not perform any 
follow -up assessments or evaluations of the study patients for the remainder of the study.  
 Unblinding  Procedure s 
To minimize the safety risk associated with blinding, the anesthesiologist performing the block will be 
available to be conta cted by other caregivers for unblinding in the situation where that becomes necessary 
for patient safety. The anesthesiologists, surgeons, intensivists and nursing staff will be aware that the 
patient is enrolled in a study and may have received bupivacain e with liposomal bupivacaine injections.

Study Activities  
1. Surgery clinic education form explaining the study will be provided to the patient . 
2. Anesthesia schedule will be screened by a member of the research team at least one week  in advance 
to identify prospective study participants . 
3. One of the study team  member s will call the patient prior to the day of surgery,   confirm eligibility to 
participate, explain the study,  review the study material s and obtain verbal consent  from pati ent prior to 
the DOS . 
4. Prospective patients will be added to Anesthesia Block List with a note about the study  after written 
consent is obtained from the patient . 
5. On the day of surgery, the patient will  proceed through the usual preoperative process. A memb er of 
the study team will meet the patient, evaluate the patient for interval changes in their health, and obtain 
written informed  consent to participate in the study.  
6. Randomization will occur the morning of surgery. The patient will be randomized to recei ve 15mL of

liposo mal bupivacaine v ersus saline after induction of general anesthesia in the operating room.  
8. The patient, in -room anesthesia team, surgical team, and ICU team will be blinded to randomization 
status. The block team will not be blinded given the need to draw -up medications immediately prior to 
block placement and the distinct sonographic appearance of liposomal bupivacaine . The medication 
syringe will be covered by a towel after being drawn up and during injection to prevent blinded parties 
from visualizi ng the contents being injected. The ultrasound will also be turned such that only the 
anesthesiologist performing the procedure can see.  
9. All patients participating in the study will receive wrist bands indicating the possible use of liposomal 
bupivacaine t o avoid additional local anesthetic or regional intervention for at least 96  hours following 
the nerve block or sham procedure . 
10. All patients participating in the study will receive a standardized intraoperative analgesic protocol 
according to our local ins titutional cardiac ERAS protocol.  
11. A member of the anesthesia block team (who was not involved in the block procedure) will see the 
patient on postoperative day ( POD ) 1 to monitor for any complications of the block . 
12. The remainder of data collection will occ ur electronically . 
13. A member of the research team will call the patient 90 days  after surgery to administer a Brief Pain 
Inventory  Short  Form.  
14. All medications  taken for analgesia at home regularly, prior to arrival on the day of surgery, and 
perioperatively  (until 72 hours postoperatively) will be recorded.

 data will be retained for 7 years per UW -Madison best practices. For statistical analysis, de -identified 
data will be sent to biostatistician via email as a password protected encrypted zip file.  
11.1.2  Data Management Software System(s)  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and solicited events data) and clinical laboratory 
data will be entered into the following data management software system(s) to ensure consistent data 
entry and data quality. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
 
OnCore  
The Online Collaborative Research Environment (OnCore) Clinical Trial Management Software (CTMS) 
will be used for this study.  
 
OnCore is a web -based data management system that: a) ensures secure, easy data entry at multiple 
sites; b) integrates mu ltiple data sources; c) provides controlled, secure access to sensitive data using 
role-based access control; d) provides workflow automation; and e) allows export and reporting of data 
for Data (and Safety) Monitoring Committee(s) and statisticians. This software provides protocol and 
subject management functions (e.g., subject scheduling; screening; data organization), maintains 
updated forms, addresses budget development, billing and fiscal management, generates summary 
reports, and provides essential li nks with research administration and electronic medical records 
systems. The OnCore system eases the burden of the individual researcher and unifies protocol 
management within research programs and across research sites, enhancing protocol integrity and 
regulatory compliance efforts.  
 
The OnCore Support Team works with the investigator, statistician, and study team to ensure the 
relevant, applicable study data are collected and managed in a secure web -based system with 
restricted access using the software e lectronic case report forms (eCRFs). The OnCore Support Team 
will work with the study team to ensure the appropriate data is exported for analysis, but will not 
perform the analysis.

12.0 STUDY ANALYSIS  
 Statistical Hypotheses  
12.1.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate lower total opioid use during the initial 
72 hours postoperatively compared to patients in the s ham-control group.  
12.1.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will have a decreased intraoperative opioid 
requirement compared to patients in the saline -control group.  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will have lower maximum and mean  pain scores 
during the first 72 hours postoperatively  and at 90 d ays postoperatively compared to patients in the 
saline -control group.  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate lower daily opioid use during the 
initial 72 hours postoperatively compared to patients in the sham -control group.  
 
• Patien ts who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significant reduction in time to 
extubation  compared to patients in the saline -control group .  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significantly decreased time to 
return of bowel function  compared to patients in the saline -control group .  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significantly reduced rate of 
postoperative delirium  compared to patients in the saline -control group .  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significantly decreased ICU length 
of stay  compared to patients in the saline -control group.  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significantly decreased hospital 
length of s tay compared to patients in the saline -control group .  
• Patients who receive local anesthetic via PIFB will demonstrate a significantly decreased persistent 
use of opioids at 90 days postoperatively  compared to patients in the saline -control group .  
 Sample Size Justification  
We conducted a retrospective chart review on prior single valve and CABG procedures utilizing a median 
sternotomy over a two -month period at our institution to characterize opioid consumption in our current 
patients. We found the average  total opioid consumption in the first 72  hours following sternotomy was 245 
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon  
  
 
Version #: 1.0  Version Date: 11/20/2020  Page 18 of 27 
 MME (morphine milligram equivalents) +/ - 87mg. We concluded that a 25% reduction in postoperative 
opioid requirements would be clinically significant, which is in line with what p rior studies have utilized27. 
Therefore, using a type 1 error rate of 0.05, power of 90%, and a sampling ratio of 1:1 between study arms, 
we calculated a sample size of 86 patients (43 patients per group). To compensate for potential dropouts 
and incomplete data, a total of 100 patients (50 patients in each group) will be targeted for enrollment.  
 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT): all randomized subjects  
• Safety Analysis Dataset: all randomized subjects who received the required study intervention.  
• Protocol -compliant Population: all randomized subjects who received the required study intervention.  
 Statistical Methods  
The primary endpoint is total postoperative opioid requirement within 72 hours. Total opioid  requirement  will be 
measured in morphine equivalents,  presented as mean +/ - standard deviation,  and compared between study groups 
using a two -tailed  independent samples t -test. Secondary outcomes (total intraoperative opioid requirement, mean 
and maximum 72 -hour postop erative pain scores , and pain score 90 days postoperatively) will also be presented as 
mean +/ - standard deviation and compared using independent samples t -tests. Daily postoperative opioid use and 
mean pain scores on POD1, POD2, and POD3 will also be comp ared separately with Holm -Bonferroni correction. For 
pain scores, we will compare mean VRS and average each patient’s score within each day before averaging across 
days. We recognize the debate in the literature about how to analyze pain scores. In the pre viously referenced 
randomized controlled trials19,20, the authors used mean scores so we will do so as well.  
 
Continuous secondary outcomes that we expect will not be approximately normally distributed (duration of 
mechanical ventilation, time until return  of bowel function, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay) will be 
presented as median with interquartile range and compared using Mann -Whitney tests. Categorical variables 
(delirium, chronic opioid use) will be presented as counts or as percentages and will be compared using Fisher's 
exact test. For all planned comparisons with parametric tests, non -parametric equivalents will be substituted if the 
assumptions of parametric testing are found to be violated before testing.  
 Handling of Missing Data  
Guidelines promulgated in the National Research Council report on handling of missing data will be 
followed.28,29. 
13.0 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT 
 Known Potential Benefits to the Subjects  
Possible benefits of participating in this research study include improved post operative analgesia, 
decreased opioid requirements and related side effects, shorter intensive care unit and hospital length of 
stay, and a decreased risk of developing chronic pain related to the surgery.  
 Known Potential Risks  
PIFB risks  
Possible risks of a pecto -intercostal fascial plane block include bleeding, infection, failed block, vascular 
injury, or pneumothorax30. However, compared to the transversus thoracic muscle plane block, the PIFB is 
more superficial and thought to be safer due to the increased distance between the fascial plane and the 
pleura and internal thoracic vessels31. No serious block related compli cations have been reported with the 
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon

 PIFB19,20. Reactions to bupivacaine are characteristic of those associated with other amide -type local 
anesthetics. A major cause of adverse reactions in this group of drugs is related to excessive plasma levels 
due to o verdosage, unintentional intravascular injection  or slow metabolic degradation. Central nervous 
system reactions as a result of these may include  restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, 
or tremors may occur, possibly proceeding to convu lsions , drowsiness, unconsciousness and respiratory 
arrest. Other central nervous system effects may be nausea, vomiting, chills, and constriction of the pupils. 
The incidence of convulsions associated with the use of local anesthetics varies with the proc edure used 
and the total dose administered . Cardiovascular system reactions  from high doses or unintentional 
intravascular injection may lead to high plasma levels and related depression of the myocardium, 
decreased cardiac output, heartblock, hypotension,  bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, including 
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest. Allergic -type reactions are rare and 
may occur as a result of sensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients , such as the 
antimicrobial preservative methylparaben contained in multiple -dose vials or sulfites in epinephrine -
containing solutions. These reactions are characterized by signs such as urticaria, pruritus, erythema, 
angioneurotic edema (including laryng eal edema), tachycardia, sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, 
syncope, excessive sweating, elevated temperature, and possibly, anaphylactoid -like symptomatology 
(including severe hypotension). Neurologic effects following  procedures  may include persisten t anesthesia, 
paresthesia, weakness, paralysis, all of which may have slow, incomplete, or no recovery.   
In clinical trials utilized for FDA approval of Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine), the most common adverse 
reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, 
constipation, and vomiting. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2% to less 
than 10%) following EXPAREL administration were pyrexia, dizziness, edema peripheral, anemia, 
hypoten sion, pruritus, tachycardia, headache, insomnia, anemia postoperative, muscle spasms, 
hemorrhagic anemia, back pain, somnolence, and procedural pain. The less common/rare adverse 
reactions (incidence less than 2%) following EXPAREL administration were chil ls, erythema, bradycardia, 
anxiety, urinary retention, pain, edema, tremor, dizziness postural, paresthesia, syncope, incision site 
edema, procedural hypertension, procedural hypotension, procedural nausea, muscular weakness, neck 
pain, pruritus generalize d, rash pruritic, hyperhidrosis, cold sweat, urticaria, bradycardia, palpitations, sinus 
bradycardia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, hypertension, 
pallor, anxiety, confusional state, depression, agitatio n, restlessness, hypoxia, laryngospasm, apnea, 
respiratory depression, respiratory failure, body temperature increased, blood pressure increased, blood 
pressure decreased, oxygen saturation decreased, urinary incontinence, vision blurred, tinnitus, drug 
hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity.  
 
Risks associated with loss of confidentiality  
There is a risk that information recorded about subjects will be shared with people who would not normally 
have access to this information.  
 
Unknown risks  
This study may involve risks to the subject which are currently unforeseeable. We will inform subjects as 
soon as possible if we discover any information that may affect the subject's health, welfare, or decision to 
be in this study.  
 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
PIFB:  
The risk  of infection will be minimized by using the standard of care for regional anesthesia including a 
mask and sterile gloves for the provider, sterilizing the field of the block, and using sterile equipment. The 
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon  
  
 
Version #: 1.0  Version Date: 11/20/2020  Page 20 of 27 
 risk of bleeding will be minimized by adhering to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia evidenced -
based guidelines for regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy32. 
Despite not being a neuraxial technique, we will use the more conservative guidelines specific for neuraxial 
techniques to further minimize the risk of significant bleeding. Performing the procedure under ultrasound 
guidance allows us to identify all important adjacent structures to avoid injury to surrounding tissues and 
blood vessels.  
Blinding:  
All of the patients enrolled in the study will receive wrist bands indicating the possible use of liposomal 
bupivacaine in order to avoid the use of any additional local anesthetic or regional intervention for 96 hours. 
To minimize the risk associat ed with blinding, the co -principal investigators will be available to be contacted 
by other caregivers for unblinding in the situation where that becomes necessary for patient safety.      
Failed block:  
The risk of a failed block and inadequate analgesia will be minimized by the availability of supplemental 
oral and intravenous analgesics.  
 
In light of the mitigation strategies described above we believe the risk -to-benefit ratio is acceptable.   
14.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 Adverse Event  (AE) Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject 
enrolled in this study, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
PIFB or other study procedure that appears or worsens during the study or study follow -up period. AEs 
may be anticipated (i.e. redness or soreness at the injection site) or unanticipated (i.e. bleeding, infection, 
allergic reaction). Adverse event informati on will be collected throughout the entire study, and through 
resolution of the AE if present.  
Study staff will monitor for AEs by following up with the patient on post -operative day (POD) 1 and POD 90, 
electronic chart review, and with additional follow -up as needed related to any concerns for AEs from the 
primary care teams. All AEs will be recorded on a study data sheet and in the electronic database by a 
study investigator or study staff. In the event of an unanticipated AE, the primary anesthesia or i ntensive 
care unit team caring for the subject will intervene as deemed appropriate.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Definition  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse event that meets one of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization  
• Results in significant or persistent disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Classification of an Adverse Event  
14.3.1  Severity of Event  
The severity of all adverse events will be assessed according to the following scale:  
PIFB and Recover y After Cardiac Surgery   Meyer & Simon  
  
 
Version #: 1.0  Version Date: 11/20/2020  Page 21 of 27 
 • Mild: not requiring treatment or intervention  
• Moderate: resolved with treatment/intervention  
• Severe: inability to carry on normal activities and required professional medical attention  
14.3.2  Relationship to Study, Study Procedure(s) and/or Study Intervention(s)  
A co-principal investigator will determine the relationship of any adverse events to the research 
intervention using the following scale:  
• Definite: AE is clearly related to the study pr ocedures  
• Probable: AE is likely related to the study procedures  
• Possible: AE is possibly related to the study procedures  
• Unlikely: AE is doubtfully related to the study procedures  
• Unrelated: AE is clearly not related to the study procedures  
 Reporting AEs  and SAEs  
Non-serious adverse events will be recorded if they occur from the time the study procedure begins to the 
patient’s hospital discharge. All serious adverse events will be recorded if they occur from the time that the 
subject provides informed co nsent through and including the 90-day follow -up phone call. All adverse 
events will be communicated to and between the co -principal investigators.  
 
Given the minimal risk associated with the use of PIFB, no serious adverse events are anticipated. If a SAE  
occurs, the study co -principal investigators will be immediately notified and further enrollment in the study 
will be halted until a full explanation of the cause of the event and its relationship to the PIFB and/or study 
procedure is understood. The IRB will be notified and re -initiation of study enrollment will not occur until 
approved by the IRB.  
 Unanticipated Problems  
An unanticipated problem (UP) is defined as an event that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in severity, nature, or freque ncy given the research procedures and the characteristics of 
the subject population  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research study : 
 
The investigator will report UPs to the reviewing IRB and lead Principal Investigator (PI). The UP report will 
include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for deter mining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents 
an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol, informed consent documents, or other corrective actions 
that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  
 
• Report UPs within the timeframe(s) specified by the IRB(s) of record.  
 
 Other Reportable Events  
Reporting timeframes begin when the site learns of the occurrence of the event.

 Breach of 
confidentiality  The exposure of any study information or 
communications directly related to a study 
subject to anyone not named as study staff 
or the release of a study subject’s 
identifiable information to study staff who 
were not specified to receive such 
information in  the protocol or IRB 
application.  Treat as major deviation 
(below)  
Protocol 
deviation  A deviation is an incident involving a 
departure from the IRB -approved protocol in 
the actual conduct of the study. Deviations 
may result from the action of the participant, 
investigator, or staff.  See below  
Major 
deviations  Deviations are considered major when the 
unapproved change(s) in previously 
approved research activities, implemented 
without IRB approval, may potentially 
adversely affect subjects’ rights, safety, 
welfare, or willingness to continue 
participation, or affect the scientific design of 
the study and/or the integrity of the resultant 
data.  Treat as an Unanticipated 
Problem (above)  
Minor 
deviations  Deviations are considered minor when the 
unappr oved change(s) in previously 
approved research activities, implemented 
without IRB approval, do not adversely 
affect subjects or the integrity of the study 
data.  Sites are to report cumulative 
events to AE Coordinator at 
time of continuing review.  
Protoc ol 
violation  An incident involving an intentional deviation 
from the IRB -approved protocol that was not 
implemented in response to an emergency 
situation and that may impact a subject’s 
rights, safety, and/or welfare, makes a 
substantial alteration to risk s to subjects, or 
affects the scientific design of the study 
and/or the integrity of the resultant data. 
Violations may also be repeated deviations 
(major or minor) of the same nature. 
Violations can represent serious or 
continuing non -compliance with the federal 
regulations and guidelines for ethical 
conduct of human subject research.  Treat as an Unanticipated 
Problem (above)  
Protocol 
Exceptions  A protocol exception is an IRB -approved 
deviation for a single subject or a small Protocol exceptions must be 
approved by local IRB prior 
to implementation.

 Safety Oversight  
After 15 subjects have been recruited, the study data will be reviewed by an independent anesthesiologist, 
blinded  to study arm assignment, to ensure that no safety concerns exist. In the unlikely event that there is 
a safety concern, study recruitment will be halted and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC), consisting of a minimum of three qualified  practitioners, will be convened to evaluate the safety 
concern and make recommendations regarding changes to the study methods or termination of the study.  
Provided that no safety concerns exist after 10 patients, the independent anesthesiologist will per iodically 
monitor the data through the end of the study.

TITLE: Variable Perceptions of Cutaneous Stimuli  PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Bryan Carroll, MD, PhD  CO-INVESTIGATORS: Rashek Kazi, MD, PhD; Panayiota Govas, M.D., M.Sc.Med NCT: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Protocol Date: 05/21/2018   
Scientific Background  Previous work has quantified the effects of using non-noxious stimuli, specifically vibration, in reducing the pain of procedures. Work from the project PI Bryan Carroll (1) as well as Kenneth Beer (2) have detailed the ease and practical use of handheld vibration devices during in office procedures. Several other studies have also noted improved patient comfort with noxious stimulation after applying brief vibration. This has been studied in in office lip filler injection (3), botulinum toxin (4), and lip augmentation (5). Further, these studies have shown that not only does the approach provide significant analgesic control, patients opt to repeat use of vibration in future procedures at a rate of over 90% (5).   Mechanistically, the basis for this approach lies in the "gate-control of pain" theory. Established by Melzack and Wall, gate-control theory postulates that non noxious stimuli such as vibration are detected by a specific subset of cutaneous nerve fibers known as a-beta fibers. This signal is rapidly transferred to the central nervous system and processed. By activating these fibers, there is a second set of signals which inhibits the activation of another set of cutaneous nerve fibers known as A-delta and C fibers. These fibers normally transmit painful signals, both acute and chronic. Through this activation-inhibition model, we intend to effectively limit the degree to which noxious stimuli is felt in the outpatient procedural setting (6).  1. Gresham, Katherine A.

Study Objectives  Determine how patients in an out-patient surgical setting interpret non-noxious stimulation, specifically focusing on vibration.   Perception of cutaneous stimuli is critical in the diagnosis and treatment of many dermatological diseases. However, there is little understanding of how global sensations varies across populations.   Specific aim 1: Variable perception and interpretation of a non-noxious stimulus. Hypothesis: Different patient populations will show subtle, if any, difference of non-noxious stimulation.  Rationale: Historically, there is evidence citing differences in perception of acute noxious stimuli across age, history of exposure to pain, and gender. Little information is available regarding non-noxious stimuli. In previous work from our group and validated by other researchers, patients are largely able to tolerate the non-noxious stimulation of vibration. Our aim here is to determine whether this tolerability and interpretation shows any difference across cohorts, specifically those in an outpatient surgical setting.   Specific aim 2: Variable perception and interpretation of a noxious stimulus following a non-noxious stimulus Hypothesis: Different populations will show a significant difference in perception of noxious stimulation Rationale: As previously cited, different cohorts of humans has a wide variety in how pain, both acute and chronic, is perceived. In this aim, we can identify how the noxious stimulus of an injection of anesthetic varies across populations in an out-patient surgical setting. Further, it is known that the application of vibration prior to needle injection significantly reduces the pain felt by the patient. This aim can determine how this change varies across different patient cohorts.      
Study Design and Methods  This is a DESCRIPTIVE, RANDOMIZED, partially blinded study.  Study design  A randomized, partially-blinded, parallel-group clinical study of perception and interpretation of a non-noxious vibration stimulus compared to placebo (vibratory device in “off” mode) during syringe-mediated local cutaneous infiltration of anesthetic was performed. The protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (PRO17110134) and conforms to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.  Participants All adults (18+) presenting for MMS, surgical excision, and/or other cutaneous cancer removal surgery at Falk Dermatologic Surgery Clinic affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) were eligible for inclusion. Subject enrollment occurred during a 90-day period from April to June 2018. Eligible subjects were informed of the study 24-72 hours before treatment via phone call.  Patients with expressed interest in the study were given more information on the day of study, including the risks and benefits of participating. Any subsequent questions were answered at this time. All participants were given a pre-procedural questionnaire and provided written informed consent. A follow-up phone call was conducted post-procedure. Participant Training  Participants underwent a training session to answer trial questions (“What is your pain level?”) using the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) as well as descriptive adjectives of sensation (“Can you describe the sensation you felt on your skin?”). The vibratory anesthetic device (VAD) was placed on a ‘training site’ approximately 5 cm away from their treatment site 
in the OFF mode for 15s (Figure 1). Participants were then asked to describe the sensation they felt on their skin as well as the NRS pain level experienced. This process was repeated with the VAD in the ON mode.  During this time, patients who were unable to discern between the VAD ON and OFF modes, expressed NRS>0, could not communicate effectively, had a language barrier or were unable to follow instructions were excluded (Figure 2).  Intervention The VAD is a 10cm, handheld, battery-operated device by Finever. When ON, the device oscillates at a continuous frequency of 100Hz. It is non-experimental and available for purchase over-the-counter. The device was customized by positioning a cotton ball at the tip with subsequent placement into a nitrile glove.  The VAD, anesthetic injection and infiltration, and surgical procedure were all performed by a single, board-certified dermatologic surgeon (BTC). The anesthetic used in all cases was lidocaine hydrochloride 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000 and buffered with 8.4% bicarbonate 1:10 (Hospira Inc.). The anesthetic was prepared and administered in a 3 ml syringe with a 30-gauge needle. Anesthetic was prepared the day of the procedure.  Outcome measures Subjects’ pain was assessed using the validated 11-point NRS (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable). Pain level was evaluated at multiple time-points; pre-anesthetic injection with stimulus (VAD ON/VAD OFF) at 0s and 5s; the timepoint of anesthetic injection at 15s (NRS) with stimulus (VAD ON/VAD OFF); and 5s post-infiltration with no stimulus present. Patients communicated their pain level verbally at the above timepoints. Relative change in NRS was calculated with the below: 
𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒	𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒=100∗𝑁𝑅𝑆3456578−𝑁𝑅𝑆:5478𝑁𝑅𝑆3456578 From the findings of Olsen et al., MCID and SCID was defined as a relative change of 22-56% and >57%, respectively.    
CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY  TITLE: Variable Perceptions of Cutaneous Stimuli  PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Bryan Carroll, MD, PhD CO-INVESTIGATORS: Rashek Kazi, MD, PhD; Panayiota Govas, M.D., M.Sc.Med.  Contact Information: (412) 864-2660   Why is this research being done?  The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a vibration tool immediately before injection of anesthetic alters your feeling of pain during an injection.   You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a patient of Dr. Carroll’s who has been diagnosed with a skin cancer and are scheduled for excisional or Mohs surgery for treatment.   If you decide to participate a study investigator will give you a questionnaire to provide baseline information about your medical history, it can be completed in the waiting room in under 20 minutes. As part of your normal care you will be prepared for your surgical procedure. The only change to normal care would be right before you receive your anesthetic injection we will randomize (like the flipping of a coin) you to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive a small vibration with a handheld device that is applied to the skin for about 15 seconds Group 2 will have the device applied without vibration. During your procedure we will ask you to rate your pain level about 6 times. We will call you about 6 hours after the procedure and ask a short questionnaire, in addition to our normal postoperative questions.   This is a very low risk study, but you should be aware of risks. There are standard risks with surgery. These will be explained to you along with your consent for surgery.   There is also a risk of mild discomfort from the handheld vibration anesthetic device, however there is no evidence of this being the case. If at any point the vibration becomes intolerable, you can ask us to stop.   The questionnaire will ask questions about your overall health, level of pain tolerance, and your use of pain medication, including opiates. This has a risk of being potentially embarrassing in terms of the social stigma related to such medications and expectations of pain tolerance. As a reminder, all answers will remain confidential.   Any time information is collected, there is a small risk of breach of confidentiality. Your research data will be identified by a unique study number rather than your name and all measures allowed by law to protect your confidentiality will be taken by the research staff. This data will be protected behind a password protected firewall on UPMC servers. It will only be accessible to the above investigators.   This study may not have any direct benefit for you today however the information will be used to understand which populations of patients may require additional support to reduce the pain associated with minor surgical procedures.   
Previous research has shown that some patients find a reduction in the pain of injection when the vibration tool is used. However, there is no guarantee that this will be the case for you. You will not be paid for participating in this study nor will your insurance company be billed for the research procedures if you agree to participant in this study. Research use of the data collected may lead to new inventions or products, but you will not receive any money or compensation from any inventions or products that might be developed in the future. There are no current plans to share the research data however if we decide to share data in the future the data will be de-identified and your identity will not be shared.

 Statistical Considerations  Unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test was used for univariate analysis of all variables for comparison of NRS means. A threshold for significance was set at p < 0.05. All values collected were analyzed to report mean values ± standard error from the mean.   Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to compare categorical variables (age, sex, and treatment site). Multivariate analysis of the overall cohort identified p<0.2 for age, sex, and treatment site. All further subgroup analysis was performed using multivariate analysis with a threshold for significance set at p<0.05. All statistical analyses were calculated by RK with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, version 8) and STATA (StataCorp, version 13) software and confirmed with a consulting statistician (KMR).

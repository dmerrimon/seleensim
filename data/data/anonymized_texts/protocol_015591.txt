PicoRev Sample Size Rationale  
The primary objectives of this study include establishing treatment parameters, assessing safety of the 
treatment, and comparison of the PicoSure laser to the RevLite laser.   Due to the wide variety of 
treatment parameters to be assessed it was decided to outline up to 10 different treatment subgroups 
to help further identify subjects based on subject demographics, tattoo characteristics, and additional 
parameters that may need to be established but are not currently identified.   If we assume we a 
treatment  effect of a score of 2 on the tattoo clearance grading (0 -3) which corresponds to 50% 
identifies a treatment effect, with a set power of 95% and a two sided significance level of 0.05, it results 
in a required study population of 6 subjects for each treat ment subgroup.   To account for subjects 
withdrawing or potential lost -to-follow ups due to the extended timeframe of up to 10 treatments every 
six weeks, it was decided to enroll up to 10 subjects in each group.   With a potential of 10 total groups, it 
is determined that up to 100 subjects may be enrolled in  the study.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of zilebesiran administered subcutaneously (SC) as an add-on therapy in patients with hypertension despite tr eatment with a 
standard of care antihypertensive medication. A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1.  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized to receive open-label therapy with olmesartan (40 mg orally once 
daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the United States (US) or Australia, consistent with local labeling for 
olmesartan]), amlodipine (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as 
their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks.  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria after the Run -in period will be randomized 1:1 
to receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB treatment period as add-on therapy to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication.  
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive medications”) may be added to the patient’s protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure. 
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may have be en eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran 
open-label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reached Month 6 prior to availability 
of the separate OLE study, they may have receive d open- label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once 
every 6 months for up to 30 additional months during the OLE period until the separate OLE 
study wa s open and then transition. Upon implementation of Amendment 3, the OLE period will 
be closed because a separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 6-month DB period will continue their planned visits  through the end of the 6-month DB period and then enter 
the Safety Follow-up period. Patients will not receive a dose of study drug at Month 6. Patients 
who are already in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of study drug. Patients 
should complete all planned assessments at Months 7, 8, and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete end of treatment ( EOT ) assessments in lieu of their scheduled visit 
assessments and enter the Safety Follow -up period. 
Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period. 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive, at time of initial informed consent) with 
untreated hypertension or on stable therapy with up to 2 antihypertensive medications. Patients 
should have a 24- hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg by 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) after at least 4 weeks of run-in on protocol-

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 specified background antihypertensive medication. Patients with secondary hypertension or 
orthostatic hypotension will be excluded. 
Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Zilebesiran is an SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) -conjugated small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive zilebesiran will be administered 600 mg SC once during the 6-
month DB treatment period. Before Amendment 3, patients who entered the OLE period 
received 600 mg zilebesiran SC at Month 6 after all predose assessments were conducted and 
once every 6 months during the OLE period. Upon implementation of Amendment 3, patients in the 6 -month DB period will continue their planned visits through the end of the 6-month DB 
period but will not be eligible to enter the OLE period and receive a dose of study drug at Month 6. Patients in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of study drug. 
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo (phosphate- buffered saline for SC administration) will be administered at the same 
dosing interval and volume as the study drug during the 6-month DB period. Protocol- specified Background Antihypertensive Medication, Dose, and Mode of 
Administration  
Patients will be randomized to 1 of the following protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications to be administered orally once daily during the Run-in and 6-month DB periods: 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg (or 20 mg for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or Australia, consistent with local 
labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 
mg olm esartan once daily may initiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and then 
uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks. 
• Amlodipine: 5 mg  
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg  
Duration of Treatment and Study Participation 
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on study 
for each  patient is up to approximately 45 months, including up to 75 days in the Screening and 
Run-in periods, up to 36 months of treatment, and up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug in the Safety Follow-up period. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period. Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline

filtration rate (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2). 
For the primary endpoint, assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 
24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2-
sided significance level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add-
on to olmesartan; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo 
as add -on to indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the 
following difference between zilebesiran versu s placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add-on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by-treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of 
zilebesiran and have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment. 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit. 
For the analyses of the 6-month DB period, the analysis population used to evaluate efficacy will be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

 Notes:  
• When scheduled at the same time points and where feasible, the assessments of vital signs and blood sample collections for RAAS biomarkers (renin, aldosterone, and Ang I/II) should be performed before physical examinations and 12 -lead ECGs.  
• Run-in Visit 2 should occur at least 4 weeks after Run- in Visit 1.  
• Patients may  have  been eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study upon completion of the Month 6 predose assessments. If an individ ual 
patient reached Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may have  received open- label zilebesiran beginning at the Month 6 visit 
and continue for up to 30 additional months  during the OLE period until the separate OLE study was open and then transition. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 3, the OLE period will be closed because a separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 6- month DB period will continue their 
planned visits through the end of the 6- month DB period and then enter the Safety Follow -up period. Patients will not receive a dose  of study drug  at 
Month 6. Patients who are already in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of study drug. Patients should complete all planned assessments at Months 7, 8, and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete EOT assessments in lieu of the ir scheduled visit assessments 
and enter the Safety Follow -up period.  
• Patients will be asked to perform Safety Follow -up visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% 
of their individual mean baseline level (if known) or 12 months after the last dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier. During this Follow -up period, 
HBPM monitoring may continue at the discretion of the Investigator. The ADA sample should only be collected at the first Foll ow-up visit during the 
Follow -up period.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/ET assessments should be performed.   
Footnotes:  
a All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection (Table  2), are to be performed prior to administration of protocol -specified background 
antihypertensive medications (including Run- In Visit 1) and study drug (as applicable).   
b When applicable, pregnancy test results must be known prior to dosing with study drug at dosing visits.  
c Laboratory assessments at Day 1 do not need to be repeated, per Investigator discretion, if they were collected within 7 days  before Day 1 at Run -in Visit 2.  
d Office blood pressure must be measured before the patient takes oral antihypertensive medications or study drug (as applicabl e).  
e ABPM recordings associated with study drug dosing visits should be obtained within 7 days before the visit and results reviewed before dosing.  
f HBPM should be measured at least 3 times during the week prior to the second randomization to establish baseline. After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week in the morning upon waking and may be increased at the Investigator’s discretion i f more frequent measurement is warranted. HBPM is not 
required on days when ABPM is being assessed. In the Safety Follow -up period, the frequency of HBPM assessments can be reduced after the first Safety 
Follow -up visit per Investigator judgement.  
g Neurological evaluation will also be performed as part of the full physical examination.  
h ABPM should only be performed as part of ET assessments if the patient discontinues the study prior to Month 12 and has not had an ABPM within the last 3 
months. ABPM should not be performed at Month 36.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 1. INTRODUCTION 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developing zilebesiran (ALN- AGT01), a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
ligand, which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. 
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -003 (KARDIA -2) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment 
with a standard of care antihypertensive medication. Patients will be randomized to run-in on 1 of 3 protocol-specified antihypertensive medications open- label for at least 4 weeks (olmesartan, 
amlodipine, or indapamide). At the end of the Run-in period, patients with uncontrolled blood 
pressure will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo as add -on therapy to the 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication for 6 months during the double-blind 
(DB) period. After completion of the 6-month DB period, patients may have be en eligible to 
participate in a separate zilebesiran open -label extension (OLE) study. Patients will discontinue 
their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication at Month 6. If an individual patient reached Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may have received 
open-label zilebesiran (600 mg once every 6 months) for up to 30 additional months during the OLE period of this study (ALN- AGT01 -003) until the separate OLE study was open and then 
transition.  Upon implementation of Amendment 3, the OLE period of this study will be closed 
because a separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 6-month DB period will continue their planned visits  through the end of the 6-month DB period and then enter the Safety 
Follow-up period. Patients will not receive a dose of study drug at Month 6. Patients who are 
already in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of study drug. Patients should complete all planned assessments at Months 7, 8, and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete end of treatment ( EOT ) assessments in lieu of their scheduled visit assessments 
and enter the Safety Follow-up period. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), from baseline to 
Month 3, relative to placebo. Secondary and exploratory objectives of the study include evaluating the add-on efficacy of zilebesiran on other measures of blood pressure response 
(including longer treatment durations, eg, up to 36 months) and evaluating the PD effect of 
zilebesiran, including reduction in circulating AGT concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section 3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to 
hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapies achieve target blood pressure in only a minority of patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despite the availability of multiple efficacious agents, current rates of control are low, and the global burden of death and disability-
adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; 
Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension and to overcome the limitations of current therapies is a key unmet need. [Dzau 2019; McClellan 2019 ; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developing zilebesiran, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally occurring cellular 
mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of siRNA to its 
complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. Zilebesiran contains an siRNA 
targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing ligand to facilitate delivery to the 
liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, zilebesiran is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic 
synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 2017; Romero 2015] Because 
hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, zilebesiran has been developed to 
reduce blood pressure by decreasing circulating AGT levels and the downstream effects of angiotensin II (AngII).  
Zilebesiran is being studied in the ongoing Phase 1 Study ALN- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension as single ascending doses of 10 to 800 mg (Part 
A), as a single dose of 800 mg under low-salt or high-salt conditions (Part B), as 2 doses of 
800 mg administered every 3 months in obese patients (Part D), and as a single dose of 800 mg co-administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan (Part E). Preliminary data are available from 
Parts A, B, and E. Dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT were observed after single SC doses of zilebesiran, accompanied by clinically significant reductions in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Sustained reductions in serum AGT were observed for up to 6 months following a single dose of zilebesiran.  
Most adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically 
significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium. No patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations have been observed in patients who received zilebesiran doses as high as 800 mg. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minority of patients and were all mild and 
transient events that resolved without intervention. 
Because most patients with hypertension eventually progress to require treatment with more than 
1 antihypertensive class,[ Williams 2018 ] it is anticipated that zilebesiran may be used together 
with other standard of care antihypertensive medication. This Phase 2 study will further quantify 
the antihypertensive effects of zilebesiran as add -on therapy in patients with hypertension not 
adequ ately controlled by a standard of care antihypertensive medication. The consistent and

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  26 durable PD effect of zilebesiran is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour 
blood pressure lowering with infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of zilebesiran is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study 001 indicate that zilebesiran may offer the benefit of sustained blood pressure reduction to patients with hypertension with infrequent administration (ie, once every 3 months or once every 6 months). The mean SBP reduction observed after single 
zilebesiran doses of 100 mg or higher exceeds 10 mmHg, which is comparable to the effect of 
conventional antihypertensives.[ Abraham 2015; Materson 1993] The blood pressure of patients 
will be closely monitored, and after Month 3, escape antihypertensive medications will be added as needed to control blood pressure. 
Given the mechanism of action and mode of administration of zilebesiran, potential theoretical 
risks include liver transaminase elevations and ISRs. Like any antihypertensive therapy, there is 
also a theoretical risk of hypotension with zilebesiran. Based upon the disease population, there 
is also a risk of blood pressure elevation. Because eligible patients have mild to moderate primary hypertension, the likelihood of disease progression during the course of the study is low. 
This study has exclusion crite ria intended to minimize these risks, as well as frequent monitoring 
for laboratory and blood pressure abnormalities. Furthermore, the duration of the placebo period 
is limited, and escape antihypertensive medications are permitted to manage uncontrolled blood 
pressure following 3 months of add-on treatment with zilebesiran. Detailed guidance is provided 
to Investigators for potential liver transaminase elevations (Section  5.2.4), hypotension 
(Section  5.8.1), hypertension (Section 5.8.2), renal dysfunction (Section 5.8.3), and 
hyperkalemia (Section  5.8.4). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
and ensure the safety of study participants (see Section 3.6).  
Based on available data from Study 001, zilebesiran has an acceptable safety profile in patients 
with hypertension as a monotherapy or with the addition of conventional antihypertensives in 
patients who were inadequately controlled on zilebesiran alone. This experience supports that the theoretical risks of treatment are low and can be managed through the proposed monitoring and 
safety mitigations. In addition to study drug, each patient will receive a protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide). These agents 
are approved standard medications that will be dosed in accordance with local labeling. 
While zilebesiran is designed to inhibit the RAAS, its site of action (AGT) in the RAAS is 
unique, and its tissue specificity for the liver is hypothesized to improve its renal safety profile relative to conventional RAAS blockade,[ Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] both in the context of 
monotherapy and when used together with a conventional RAAS blocker such as olmesartan. In the latter setting, zilebesiran is hypothesized to add antihypertensive benefit when added to a conventional RAAS blocker without the increased incidence of RAAS inhibitor- associated renal 
adverse effects that have been observed in prior trials of conventional dual RAAS blockade.[ Makani 2013] Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

3.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and PD of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with 
hypertension despite treatment with a standard of care antihyper tensive medication. A schematic 
of the study design is provided in Figure 1.  
Run-in Period  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized as described in Section  3.4 to receive open -label therapy with 
olmesartan (40 mg orally once daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine 
clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US and Australia, consistent 
with local labeling for olmesar tan]), amlodipine (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg 
orally once daily) as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a 
Run-in period of at least 4 weeks. Prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) will be 
disco ntinued upon the start of this Run-in period (Run- in Visit 1).  
Patients who do not tolerate run- in treatment or who do not meet eligibility for randomization at 
Day 1 will be withdrawn from the study and returned to their prior medication regimen in coordination with their usual health providers.  
DB Period  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive 600 mg 
zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB period as add-on therapy to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or 
indapamide). Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), 
baseline blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening eGFR (<60 or 
≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive medications”) may be added to the patient’s protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure as described in Table 4.  
OLE Period  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may have be en eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE 
study. If an individual patient reached Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, 
they may  have received open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 
30 additional months during the OLE period until the separate OLE study was open and then 
transition. Upon implementation of Amendment 3, the OLE period will be closed because a separate OLE study will not be conducted. Patients in the 6-month DB period will continue the ir 
planned visits  through the end of the 6-month DB period. Patients will not receive a dose of 
study drug at Month 6. Upon completion of predose assessments at the Month 6 visit, patients will enter the Safety Follow -up period. Patients who are already in the OLE period will not 
receive any additional doses of study drug. Patients should complete all planned assessments at 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 Months 7, 8, and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete EOT assessments in 
lieu of their scheduled visit assessments and enter the Safety Follow-up period. 
During the OLE period of this study, Investigators will use escape antihypertensive medications 
as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure monitoring. 
Patients will be considered as completing study drug if they received a dose of study drug at 
Day 1 and completed the Month 6 visit. 
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients will be asked to complete Safety Follow -up visits once every 6 months after their last 
dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level 
(if known) or 12 months after the last dose of study drug, whic hever comes earlier. During the 
Safety Follow-up period, patients should return to their pre- study medical care (usual care).  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) 
through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study, and an 
independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee will review suspected renal events to adjudicate whether they meet criteria for acute kidney injury.  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period.  
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on study 
for each patient is up to approximately 45 months, including up to 75 days in the Screening and 
Run-in periods, up to 36 months of treatment, and up to 12 months after the last dose of study 
drug in  the Safety Follow-up period. 
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with 
hypertension despite treatment with a standard of care antihypertensive medication.  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM, from baseline to Month 3, relative to placebo. 
Patients with hypertension often require treatment with multiple antihypertensive drugs to reach 
target blood pressure,[ Williams 2018 ] and it is anticipated that zilebesiran may be administered 
to individuals on a background of other antihypertensive medications. Therefore, this study 
evaluates the effects of zilebesiran relative to placebo in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequat ely controlled despite treatment with 1 of the 3 major drug classes recommended for 
initial treatment of hypertension by all clinical guidelines: RAAS inhibitors (ie, angiotensin 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor blockers, or a direct renin 
inhibitor), diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs).[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] 
Studying coadministration with olmesartan will assess if the synergistic antihypertensive effects 
recently observed in rodents treated with both an ARB and an AGT- targeting GalNAc -siRNA 
will translate into clinically significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients given zilebesiran as an add -on to conventional RAAS inhibition.[ Uijl 2019] In addition, it will examine 
the safety and tolerability of liver -specific AGT targeting during treatment with a conventional 
RAAS blocker (olmesartan). The newer -generation ARB olmesartan was selected because of its 
high potency relative to early- generat ion RAAS inhibitors,[ Ojima 2011; White 2011] enabling a 
robust test for added efficacy when combined with zilebesiran. The maximum dose of 
olmesartan permitted per local labeling will be used to further increase the rigor of this efficacy 
evaluation. The thiazide- like diuretic indapamide was selected in accordance with recent 
guidelines that highlight the greater potency and durability of thiazide-like diuretics over other 
diuretics. [Burnier 2019] The long-acting dihydropyridine CCB amlodipine was selected given its 
extensive use in clinical practice and randomized controlled trials. [Dahlof 2005; Jamerson 2008; 
Julius 2004]  
During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both automated office blood pressure 
measurements and outpatient 24-hour ABPM (EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). In 
addition to having greater precision, ABPM can assess short-term blood pressure variability and 
circadian patterns (including potential restoration of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dipping pattern that is lost in 24% to 35% of hypertensive patients). More frequent (at least once per 
week) measurements will be collected through a third method, oscillometric home blood 
pressure monitoring (HBPM), to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic.  
As recommended by current guidance (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the 6-month DB 
period is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. To adhere to best ethical standards for the treatment of patients with hypertension, the use of oral antihypertensive 
medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood pressure within target is permitted 
starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the remainder of the study (see Table 4). The term “escape antihypertensive medication” is used to refer to any oral antihypertensive 
medication initiated to control blood pressure after Day 1. Separate from these treat- to-target 
modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or 
office DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated with escape antihypertensive medication regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration. 
If a patient requires treatment with an oral escape antihypertensive medication before Month 6, a 
CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic (whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication) should be added beca use there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS.  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication 
(olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued, and patients may have be en 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reached 
Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may have received open- label 
zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 30 additional months during the OLE 
period until the separate OLE study was open and then transition. Because many patients would 
have received zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and serum 
chemistries were monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 9. Upon implementation of Amendment 3, the OLE period will be closed because a separate OLE study will not be 
conducted. Patients in the 6-month DB period will continue their planned visits  through the end 
of the 6-month DB period and then enter the Safety Follow-up period. Pati ents will not receive a 
dose of study drug at Month 6. Patients who are already in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of study drug. Patients should complete all planned assessments at Months 7, 8, 
and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete EOT assessments in lieu of their scheduled visit assessments and enter the Safety Follow-up period. 
During the OLE period, Investigators may use escape antihypertensive medications of permitted 
classes as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure monitoring and following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Olmesartan, 
amlodipine, and indapamide will be discontinued as protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during the OLE period; however, patients may continue to receive amlodipine or indapamide as escape antihypertensive medication at the Investigator’s discretion. 
The use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as 
escape antihypertensive agents for high blood pressure should be avoided throughout the study. 
While the tissue specificity of zilebesiran for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012].  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The dose of zilebesiran in this study (600 mg once every 6 months) was selected on the basis of data from the Phase 1 Study 001, in which single zilebesiran doses up to 800 mg were found to have an acceptable safety profile, and dose-dependent, clinically significant placebo -corrected 
reductions in mean SBP >10 mmHg by 24- hour ABPM were observed at doses as low as 
100 mg. An acceptable safety profile was also observed for a single zilebesiran dose of 800 mg under low- salt/high -salt conditions or co- administered for 2  weeks with 300 mg irbesartan once 
daily. The selected dose of 600 mg is predicted to result in a median serum AGT reduction of 94.9% at trough (Month 6), translating to a median SBP reduction of 11.6 mmHg as monotherapy. 
The protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications are standard agents 
recommended in international and regional hypertension guidelines, and the selected regimens are standard doses used for their approved indication of hypertension.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] Indapamide will be dosed at 2.5 mg orally once daily, and amlodipine will be dosed at 5 mg orally once daily. The dose regimens for indapamide and amlodipine used in this study were selected on the basis of their common use in clinical care (when used both individually and 
combined with other classes of antihypertensives) and their expected efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. Olmesartan will be dosed at the maximum dose allowed per local labeling: 40  mg

at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or Australia; Olmetec Product Information, 
September 2020).[ von Bergmann 2001] 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and 
patient identification number. After the patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) and before 
proceeding with screening procedures, the Investigator or designee should contact the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to obtain a patient identification number. 
The Investigator or designee will contact the IRT to randomize the patient at Run-in Visit 1 and 
again at Day 1 after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at each visit.  
At Run -in Visit 1, patients with screening eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine 
≥300mg/g will be assigned to receive olmesartan. To avoid over -enrollment, patients with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300 mg/g will be excluded from the study after 
100 such patients are randomized to study drug on Day 1.  
All other patients will be randomized 10:7:4 to run-in open-label on 1 of 3 protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide), with targeted 
sample sizes across cohorts as described in Section  7.1. If 1 cohort completes enrollment first, 
this cohort will be deactivated for future randomization. The remaining 2 cohorts will be 
randomized using the original ratio. After the second cohort completes enrollment, all subsequent patients will be assigned to the last cohort.  
At Day 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo as an add-on to their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication using the IRT. Randomization at 
Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baselin e blood pressure (24-hour mean 
SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening eGFR (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel and patients will be blinded to study drug treatment through 
Month 3 of the 6-month DB period. After the interim analysis  at Month 3 is complete, Sponsor 
staff members who will not have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites may be unblinded to the analysis results according to the prespecified blinding plan. Site personnel, patients, and Sponsor staff members who have direct roles or responsibilities in 
interacting with study sites will remain blind ed to both Month 3 interim analysis results and 
treatment assignment until after the analysis of Month 6 data is complete. All Sponsor and site 
personnel and patients will be blinded to any clinical laboratory result that could potentially unblind them (eg, AGT levels) until treatment assignment unblinding. 
Zilebesiran and placebo will be packaged identically. Because zilebesiran may be slightly 
visually distinguishable from placebo, the vials will be masked in such a way as to hide the 
identity of the study drug contained within. For administration, syringes will be masked by a site 
pharmacist or delegate prior to withdrawing the study drug from vial. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional details. The study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator (see Section  5.2.2).

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  34 3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact th e Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within 1 working day after 
the unblinding event. Unblinding information should be limited to the fewest number of people 
on a need -to-know basis. A record of when the blind was broken, who was unblinded, who broke 
the blind, and why it was broken, will be maintained in the electronic trial master file (eTMF).  
Refer to the IRT instructions for details on unblinding. 
3.6. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study. The DMC will operate under the rules of a charter that will be reviewed and approved at the organizational meeting of the DMC. Details are provided in the DMC Charter. 
3.7. Clinical Event Adjudication Committees  
An independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee of 2 or more nephrologists will review the suspected renal events blinded to treatment assignment to adjudicate whether they meet diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury and, if so, their potential staging and contributing factors. Details are provided in the Renal Event Adjudication Committee charter.  
3.8. Definition of End of Study for an Individual Patient  
A patient is considered to have reached the end of the study if the patient has completed the Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section  3.1.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best 
interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stopping of the patient’s participation in the 
study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section 4.3.1, 
while the stopping of a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited medication (as defined in Section  5.9.1) per Investigator discretion 
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by the Sponsor 
If possible, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section 6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience is captured in the final analyses.  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the 
patient’s medical records.  
If a patient has an AE, including SAEs, and/or laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of 
the investigator, taking into account the patient’s overall status, requires interruption or 
discontinuation from treatment with study drug, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be 
recorded in the eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6-month DB period (defined as the time the 
first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 6 
assessments) will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (excluding pharmacokinetic [PK] assessments) through Month 6. They will also be asked to complete Safety 
Follow-up visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow-up 
schedule (see Table 1 ) until PD recovery or 12 months after the last dose of study drug 
(whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug during the OLE period will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete EOT/ET assessments and complete Safety Follow -up visits once 
every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months after the last dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation  
4.3.2.1. Patient Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient considering stopping 
participation in the study before Month 6 should be informed that the patient can discontinue 
study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit and complete Safety Follow-up visits as described in 
Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient 
consents. If a patient still chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation in all follow-
up prior to the completion of the 6-month DB period, every effort should be made to conduct the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time (see Table 1 ). 
A patient considering stopping participation in the study during the OLE period should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT/ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process the patient’s personal data (see Section  4.3.2.2), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law.  
4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally require d. Also, where allowed by local 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 law, the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of the patient’s personal data, 
informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally 
required. In both cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time 
of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study  assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6. 
4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, 
including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions 
must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a r equired study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the patient wishes to continue in the study, and/or should 
continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or loc al 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after the second randomization at Day 1.

5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied by the 
Sponsor for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must 
not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication that have been dispensed and returned unused must not 
be re-dispensed. 
5.2. Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of zilebesiran SC and placebo SC is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.2.1. Description  
Zilebesiran will be supplied as a sterile solution for SC injection. See the Pharmacy Manual for 
further details of solution concentration and fill volume. 
The control drug for this study will be a placebo (phosphate-buffered saline for SC 
administration). Placebo will be provided by the Sponsor; it will be packaged identically to zilebesiran.  
5.2.2. Dose and Administration 
During the 6-month DB period, patients will be administered a single dose of 600 mg zilebesiran or placebo, at the same volume, as SC injection on Day 1. Before Amendment 3, patients who 
entered  the OLE period received 600 mg zilebesiran SC at Month 6 after all predose assessments 
were conducted and once every 6 months during the OLE period. Upon implementation of 
Amendment 3, patients in the 6 -month DB period will continue their planned visits through the 
end of the 6-month DB period but will not be eligib le to enter the OLE period and  receive a dose 
of study drug at Month 6. Patients in the OLE period will not receive any additional doses of 
study drug. 
Study drug injections will be administered by qualified clinical study center staff under the 
supervision of the Investigator or designee. The injection site may be marked and mapped for later observation. Injections may be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the side or back of 
the upper arms. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. 
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
To maintain the blind, the syringes are to be masked by the site pharmacist or designee prior to 
study drug withdrawal from the vial. A full description of the blinding procedure is included in 
the Pharmacy Manual.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of study drug within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered up to 85 days before the next scheduled dose. Thereafter, the dose will be considered missed and not administered.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 If a patient misses a dose of study drug, the Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor 
whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see also Section  4.3).  
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
The definition of study drug overdose, follow-up procedures, and reporting requirements are 
provided Section 6.5.6.8. 
5.2.3. Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications of study drug are not permitted. 
If a study drug- related AE occurs in a patient that the Investigator judges as presenting a 
potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the study drug dose may be held at the discretion 
of the Investigator, and the Medical Monitor should be contacted.  
5.2.4. LFT Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring and Stopping Study Drug Dosing  
1. Dosing decisions may be made based on the most recently available liver function test 
(LFT) results from a central laboratory (Table 6 ). 
2. For any ALT or AST elevation >3×ULN, central laboratory results should be used to guide subsequent monitoring as detailed in Table 3 . 
3. For any ALT or AST elevation >3×ULN: 
a. If local laboratory results are obtained, confirm with a central laboratory as soon as 
possible, ideally within 2 to 3 days, but no later than 7 days. 
b. If an alternative cause is found, provide appropriate care. 
c. If an alternative cause is not found, perform assessments per Table 6  and Table 7 . 
4. For any ALT or AST elevation >3×ULN with
 out alternative cause  that is accompanied 
by clinical symptoms consistent with liver injury (eg, nausea, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, jaundice) or elevated bilirubin to ≥2×ULN or INR ≥1.5, permanently 
discontinue dosing. 
5. For confirmed ALT or AST elevations >3×ULN witho ut alternative cause  and not 
accompanied by symptoms or elevated bilirubin ≥2×ULN or INR ≥1.5, see Table 3 .

­ Hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation per Table 6  
• Monitor at least every 2 weeks (LFT and coagulation per Table 6 ) 
• If elevation persists for ≥2 months, must discuss with the Medical 
Monitor before continuing dosing 
>5× to 8×ULN • Hold study drug dosing until recovery to ≤1.5×ULN or baseline; may resume dosing after discussion with the Medical Monitor 
• Evaluate the initial elevation in LFT per the following assessments  
­ Table 7  (all assessments to be performed once)  
­ Hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation per Table 6  
• Monitor at least weekly: LFT and coagulation per Table 6  until ALT 
and/or AST is declining on 2 consecutive draws, then may decrease 
monitoring to biweekly  
• If ALT or AST rises to >5×ULN following resumption of dosing, 
permanently discontinue dosing 
>8×ULN  Permanently discontinue study drug dosing after confirmation of the transaminase value at the central laboratory.  
Abbreviations: ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; LFT=liver function test(s); 
ULN=upper limit of normal.  
Notes: In addition to these criteria, other assessments or evaluations may be performed per Investigator discretion, as appropriate. 
5.2.5. Neurological Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring, and Stopping Study Drug 
Dosing  
Clinically significant events that may be consistent with potential decreased proprioception 
(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by the 
Medical Monitor. 
5.3. Protocol -specified Background Antihypertensive Medications  
All patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 following standard of care oral 
antihypertensive medications during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks and will continue this

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication through Month 6. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications will be supplied by the Sponsor. 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with 
creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or Australia, consistent with local labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan once daily may initiate treatment at 
20 mg once daily and then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks (in this case, the patient must take the full olmesartan dose of 40 mg once daily for at least 4 weeks prior to reassessment at Run -in Visit 2).  
• Amlodipine: 5 mg orally once daily 
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg orally once daily 
Protocol-specified antihypertensive medications may be downtitrated or temporarily 
discontinued per Investigator judgement for low blood pressure (see Section 5.8.1). At the 
Investigator’s discretion, oral antihypertensive agents, including protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, may be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume 
depletion. Additional information on the protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications, including side effects, drug-drug interactions, and other important prescribing information can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparing zilebesiran or placebo doses 
and dispensing protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the safe handling of study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication are required. 
Study drug will be stored at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose preparation. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication will be stored according to the storage instructions on 
the label. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the 
Sponsor and use of the affected study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee, as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication and additional storage will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.5. Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug and protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice 
specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug and protocol -specified 
background antihypertensive medication labels and external packaging will include all 
appropriate information as per local labeling requirements. Additional details will be available in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 5.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied for this 
study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept of when and how much study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication is dispensed 
and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol 
dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs and 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. Used, partially used, and unused 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.7. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.7.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at 
which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typically 
nonmedical in nature; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with 
an AE. Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical label, damaged vial, empty vial, and contamination of study drug. 
5.7.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using the 
process outlined in the Pharmacy Manual. CPCs that may be associated with an AE must be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.8. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.8.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly with HBPM to ensure 
the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, manage ment decisions will be 
based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Patients who experience low blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should 
promptly seek medical evaluation at the clinical study site or another hospital setting. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of 
orthostatic blood pressure (supine to standing).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or interruption of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg). Oral antihypertensives 
should be downtitrated/interrupted in reverse order to how they were added (ie, 
interrupt escape antihypertensive medications before protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general 
medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by the 
Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to 
facilitate this physician -to-physician communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) should be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement as outlined above.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and laboratory monitoring (serum electrolytes and creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent b lood pressure measurements have been normal. 
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as 
fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.8.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
office blood pressure. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure.  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg 
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Until double- blind data are generated that demonstrate acceptable safety 
and added antihypertensive efficacy of zilebesiran when combined with olmesartan, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE 
inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout the study.  
• If added, escape antihypertensives must be used per their labeled 
instructions and in accordance with current clinical guidelines.[ Whelton 
2018; Wi
lliams 2018 ] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of zilebesiran, interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by hypertensive 
symptoms should be evaluated by the clinical study site. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospital setting within 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically 
significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic 
(whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified background 
antihypertensive medication) as an escape antihypertensive medication.  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like  diuretic 
(whichever agent is not already a protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication):  
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may be added as 
an escape antihypertensive medication if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by ABPM. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling 
clinical reason to wait, the rationale for except ion should be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, other escape antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in SBP above 
recommended target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135  mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 
mmHg). [Williams 2018]

Month 6 to End of 
Study (OLE period)  Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued.  
• Patients who continued into the OLE period initiate d open -label treatment 
with 600 mg zilebesiran once every 6 months. As many patients would have receive d zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and 
serum chemistries will be carefully monitored monthly from Month 6 to 
Month 9, and Investigators will be prepared to downtitrate or interrupt 
escape
 antihypertensive medications if low blood pressure develops (see 
Section  5.8.1).  
• If the Month 6 ABPM is in target (daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg), escape 
antihypertensive medications (if taken) may be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement to determine if the patient’s blood pressure 
remains within target on zilebesiran tr eatment alone.  
• During the OLE period, oral antihypertensive medications may be added 
per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target per treatment guidelines (eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 mmHg). [Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ]

5.8.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial zilebesiran PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
the Sponsor, and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypovolemia 
− Hypotension 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeats tests, look

creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.8.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of zilebesiran PD). The guidelines in Table 5 apply for potassium elevations detected by laboratory monitoring.[ McMurray 2016; 
Parving 2012]

participating study sites. These potassium-binding drugs are indicated for the treatment of 
hyperkalemia and have been shown to safely reduce serum potassium levels and to maintain long-term normokalemia in chronic kidney disease patients receiving background conventional RAAS inhibitor therapy.[ Georgianos 2018; Weir 2015] 
5.9. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals. Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF. 
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted. However, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. For other permitted 
concomitant medications administered SC, do not administer in same in jection site area as the 
study drug for at least 4 days after each dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low -dose aspirin (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least 30 days prior to 
screening and during the study treatment period are allowed. Occasional use of other systemic 
over-the-counter NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased blood 
pressure, they should be avoided when possible and for at least 2 days prior to ABPM and office 
blood pressure assessments, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at the 
lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period. 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment 
period. 
Patients receiving stable doses of tamsulosin, alfuzosin, or silodosin for at least 30 days prior to 
screening are allowed.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by local or regional regulatory authorities. 
Use of cannabis or delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC)-containing substances (including by 
smoking, vaping, dabbing, or ingesting/edibles) should be avoided when possible and for at least 2 days prior to ABPM and office blood pressure assessments. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator, except as described in Section 5.9.1 and after consulting the Pharmacy Manual, which contains information on drug-drug interactions and other important prescribing 
information for the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications. However, it is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 5.9.1. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors), except for olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication 
during the 6-month DB period  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than zilebesiran)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities 
or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics (eg, clozapine, olanzapine), diet pills (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine 
hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride), unless individually approved by both the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by both the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-2 inhibitors, trimethoprim and 
trimethoprim-containing combination products, mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists, Noni juice, alfalfa, dandelion, horsetail, nettle, milkweed, lily of the 
valley, Siberian ginseng, and hawthorn ber ries. 
All concomitant medications must be reviewed and approved by the Investigator, with particular attention to avoiding drugs that may affect blood pressure. 
5.10. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study staff. Compliance with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be assessed through pill count by study staff. 
5.11. Other Requirements  
5.11.1. Contraception  
Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of 
contraception from 14 days before the first dose of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1) 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal 
range.  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by males of contraception 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section 6.5.5.3). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  6.5.5.3).  
5.11.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study.

Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including, but not limited to, snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 
minutes prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
5.11.4. Dietary Recommendations  
All patients will receive educational materials on diet with recommendations to limit sodium 
consumption to approximately 2.0 g per day from screening through the end of the Treatment 
period. This direction should be provided at the start of the Screening period, and treatment-naïve patients should follow these recommendations for at least 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. This is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European 
Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection (Section  6.5.5.1).  
5.11.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood collection for 
clinical laboratory tests and from any exercise for 30 minutes prior to office blood pressure 
measurements.  
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 . Study visits should be scheduled for 
the morning. All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection, are to be performed prior to dosing with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug. Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the study manuals.  
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine sampl es, measurement of vital 
signs (including blood pressure assessments), performing pill counts of protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications, and collection of weight (at the discretion and 
oversight of the Investigator). See further details in Section  10.3. 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC must be signed (in paper or electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards) by the patient before the screening procedures are initiated. All patients will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. Rescreening of patients once is permitted with agreement of the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Run- in Visit 1 will be updated 
prior to administration of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening or Run- in laboratory abnormalities are likely to 
be transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated. The Investigator’s rationale must be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening and once during the Run-in period provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the 
allowed Screening and Run-in periods. Retesting of office blood pressure at Run- in Visit 1 is 
permitted once if in the Investigator’s ju dgement, the result is not accurate due to a transient 
condition. Retesting of ABPM at Run- in Visit 2 is permitted once if the first ABPM is invalid. A 
valid ABPM recording must be obtained within 7 days prior to randomization for all patients. If 
a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion exceeds the 7-day window prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM assessment is permitted, with no option for retesting in 
case of an invalid reading. Eligibility is assessed by the most recent ABPM result obtained. If a 
valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion is not obtained within the 7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run- in failure.  
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to return once for rescreening following agreement with the Medic al Monitor. A patient will be re -
consented if rescreening occurs outside of the Screening period. In this case, all screening procedures must be repeated. Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria after Run -in Visit 1 
will not be rescreened.  
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) using the standardized equipment provided 
by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in Section 10.2. Office blood pressure 
assessments and ABPM initiation must be performed before administration of any oral 
antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable).  
Patients taking oral antihypertensives prior to screening should discontinue these medications at 
Run-in Visit 1. The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure measured at Run- in Visit 2 must 
be taken within 7 days before Day 1. An HBPM unit will be provided before Run- in Visit 2 to 
establish the HBPM baseline, and HBPM should be collected at least 3 times during the last 
week prior to Day 1. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by appropriately trained individuals, as detailed in 
the ABPM Investigator Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood 
pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained 
remotely using the methods described in Section 10.2. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.8.1 and Section  5.8.2, respectively.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  55 6.2.1. ABPM  
The ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of oral antihypertensive medication. 
Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per day) and 
use of cannabis or THC-containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to 
ABPM measurements.  
Validity will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during the study, the patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the recording. During the Run-in period, if a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criter ion exceeds the 7 -day window 
prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM assessment is permitted, with no option for retesting in case of an invalid reading. Eligibility is assessed by the most recent ABPM result obtained. If a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion is not obtained within the 7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run- in failure.  
See further details in Section  10.2 and the ABPM Investigator Manual. 
6.2.2. Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured in triplicate using the automated blood pressure device 
provided by the Sponsor at trough (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and should be at 
approximately the same time of day for each assessment; therefore, vi sits should be scheduled at 
approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per 
day) and use of cannabis or THC-containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days 
prior to blood pressure measurements.  
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.2 and the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual.  
6.2.3. HBPM  
The HBPM should be measured in the morning upon waking, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral antihypertensive medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The patient should be seated comfortably with the back suppor ted and the feet 
flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.2 and the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). In addition, blood samples for determination of RAAS biomarkers 
(plasma renin concentration, AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected only for patients randomized to receive olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 Blood samples for PD assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days 
when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing 
(on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical laboratory by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. Biomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shipping, and 
storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of zilebesiran or guide clinical management and will not 
be shared with sites until after study unblinding. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and its primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for 
PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shipping, 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination will be recorded. 
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and include 
office blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are to be 
collected prior to administration of oral antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable). When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs 
should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be 
measured in the seated position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 5 minutes. Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, forehead, or 
axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, 
and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height, and Morphometrics 
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at Day 1 only. 
Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the 
first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by positioning the measuring tape 
over the elastic tape. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant 100 g of tension is recommended. Measurements 
should be obtained with the tape positioned parallel to the floor and performed using the same 
procedure throughout the study. 
The reading is taken to the nearest centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a study drug dosing visit, it 
should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological evaluation (see the Recommended Neurological Assessments for All Physical 
Examinations document for further details on the assessments to be performed as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of changes in symptoms, 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurological evaluation should be performed during all symptom- directed physical examinations regardless of whet her neurological 
symptoms have been experienced by the patient.  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval, and Fridericia- corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supine for at least 10 
minutes before each ECG is obtained. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all single 12- lead ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the 
eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection for RAAS biomarkers (renin, aldosterone, and Ang I/II) occur at the same visit and where feasible, blood sample collection should occur first. ECGs should be performed at least 30 minutes after phlebotomy or other stres sful assessments.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section 5.2.4. For any other unexplained 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately 
explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the clinical situation may be requested. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6  and will 
be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in Table 6  that are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. In patients randomized to receive olmesartan as the protocol -
specified background antihypertensive medication, blood samples for RAAS biomarkers should 
be collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after blood pressure 
measurements and before any assessments collected in the supine position). Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected after the completion of blood pressure assessments. 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

Blood samples for fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid panel (including total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein [HDL-C], non- HDL -C, low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and 
triglycerides), and HbA1c will be collected at the time points listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection for 
fasting glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
6.5.5.2. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
6.5.5.3. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients who become 
pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see 
Section  6.5.6.7 for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see 
Section  5.11.1 for definition of postmenopausal state). 
6.5.5.4. Additional Liver Function Assessments  
Additional laboratory assessments will be performed in patients who experience any LFT 
abnormalities as outlined in Section  5.2.4. Following the occurrence of elevated liver 
transaminases or other LFT abnormalities per central laboratory, all assessments in Table 7  will 
be performed 1 time, as well as hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation assessments 
from Table 6 , and other assessments or evaluations per Investigator discretion, as appropriate.  
Monitoring, including criteria for dose modification or withholding the study drug, is described in Section  5.2.4.

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
6.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest:  
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of zilebesiran. 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section 6.5.6.2 and Section  6.5.6.3, respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
OR death related to an adverse event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
The relationship of each AE to the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication 
should also be assessed by the Investigator. 
6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s health since the 
last visit. The patient should also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, 
used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and 
over-the-counter). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient saf ety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study treatment during the Run-in period 
regardless of their relationship to the study treatment through the end of study. Study treatment is defined as protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug (zilebesiran 
or placebo). Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Events occurring after 
signing of the ICF and before the Run -in period will be captured as medical history (see 
Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study treatment, and baseline events that worsen after 
study treatment, must be recorded as AEs. 
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study 
treatment through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until 
baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be related. Each AE must be described in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  64 detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study treatment, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected. Refer to eCRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom[s], injection site location, follow-up actions taken). 
6.5.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 6.5.6.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  6.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee immediately and no later than 24 hours from the time that clinical study 
center staff first learns of the event. All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study treatment.  
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study treatment, and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Immediately and no later than 24 hours after receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using the Investigator’s best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be followed by 
the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the study 
drug that occurs after a patient withdraws from the study, the Investigator shall report the SAE to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first awareness of the event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  65 If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the study 
drug that occurs after the end of the study in a patient, the Investigator shall report the SAE to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of first awareness of the event using the paper SAE form. 
6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic 
system according to Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR), and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements. Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow- up (see Section  3.1), 
the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being 
notified of the pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form. The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy, the possible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after 
the last dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section 6.5.6.4. 
6.5.6.8. Reporting of Overdose and Other Special Situations  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by the 
participant that is >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, or 
CPC associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact the Medical Monitor and Sponsor within 24 hours using the contact information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  66 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or 
a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of reporting instructions for overdose and other special situations will be outlined in 
the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the 
well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of zilebesiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ). These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be

investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before  study unblinding for the analysis of the 
primary endpoints and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3. The plan will detail the 
implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the 
protocol. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  67 7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 630 patients will be randomized to receive either zilebesiran or placebo with 
sample sizes in each of the patient cohorts with protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication as follows:  
• Olmesartan cohort: 300 patients  
• Amlodipine cohort: 210 patients 
• Indapamide cohort: 120 patients 
Assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2- sided significance 
level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add-on t o olmesartan; 
zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo as add-on to 
indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add-on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The power is assessed by simulation based on the Mixed Model with Repeated Measurements 
(MMRM), with change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM at Month 3 as 
response variable and treatment, time, treatment- by-time as fixed factors and corresponding 
baseline value as a covariate.  
7.2. Statistical Methodology  
All analyses will be performed within each of the 3 protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication cohorts. The statistical and analytical plans presented below are 
brief summaries of planned analyses. More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP. Changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical study report. For information on study endpoints, see Section 2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by-treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of zilebesiran and 
have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  68 • PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients 
who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit. 
For the analyses of the 6-month DB period, the analysis population used to evaluate efficacy will 
be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis 
Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
7.2.2. Examination of Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. Detailed methodology will be 
provided in the SAP. 
7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data 
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations 
Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized.  
In general, baseline will be defined as the average of all assessments, including unscheduled 
assessments, between Run -in Visit 2 and prior to the first dose of study drug. Details of the 
definition will be specified in the SAP.  
7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at Month 3 in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by ABPM. The primary hypothesis of the add-on effect of zilebesiran compared to placebo in 
patients receiving each of 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide) will be tested separately at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.05 using MMRM. The MMRM model will include treatment, time, treatment-by-time, and race (black or all other races) as fixed factors and basel ine 24-hour mean SBP assessed by 
ABPM and screening eGFR as covariates.  
The key secondary endpoints are: 
• Change from baseline at Month 3 in office SBP 
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed 
by ABPM 
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in office SBP  
• Proportion of patients with 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM <130 mmHg 
and/or reduction ≥20 mmHg without escape antihypertensive medication at Month 6

hierarchical order.  
Details of the analysis method for primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.6. Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Pharmacodynamic analyses will include the evaluation of changes in levels of serum AGT and 
other exploratory biomarkers of the RAAS pathway. Descriptive statistics for observed levels and the relative change from baseline for all measured biomarkers will be presented for each of the postdose time points. 
Statistical comparison of the biomarker levels (absolute and/or change from baseline) across 
treatment groups may be explored. Details of the analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
Population PK/PD analysis may be conducted to evaluate the dose-response relationships for PD 
reduction after zilebesiran treatment. Additionally, the relationship between lowering of serum AGT and blood pressure may be explored within a modeling framework. If conducted, these 
analyses will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be presented in a 
separate report.  
7.2.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and its metabolite AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Population PK analysis may be conducted on the PK data from this study. If conducted, the analysis methods will be described in a pharmacometrics analysis plan and results will be presented in a separate report.  
7.2.8. Safety Analyses 
The primary parameter is the frequency of treatment -emergent AEs (hereafter referred to simply 
as AEs). Safety parameters also include vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments and physical exams. Extent of exposure will be summarized.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary. Results will be tabulated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System and Preferred Term (PT).  
Adverse events will be classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Term [by dose level and overall]. AEs, SAEs, 
related AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and AEs leading to death will be 
summarized by System Organ Class and PT for each treatment arm. By patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. Adverse events collected during the Run- in period will be summarized . 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory parameters, ECG, and vital signs summarizing the observed values and changes from baseline over time. Laboratory shift tables 
from baseline grade (or category) to worst post-baseline grade (or category) will be presented for

All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the ABPM Investigator Manual and the HBPM 
and OBPM Investigator Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
ABPM Investigator Manual. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs (other than 
aspirin ≤100 mg per day) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided 
for at least 2 days prior to ABPM measurements. ABPM should be started prior to the morning 
dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory 
state. ABPM recordings that are associated wi th dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the 
visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  78 readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by their side while 
the device is inflating for a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are 
not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained). If the ABPM recording is invalid (either during the Run-in Period or after the second randomization), the 
patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the study within 7 days from the end time of the 
invalid ABPM. During the Run-in period, if a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion exceeds the 7 -day window prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM 
assessment is per mitted, with no option for retesting in case of an invalid reading. Eligibility is 
assessed by the most recent ABPM result obtained. If a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion is not obtained within the 7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run -in 
failure.  
Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by the Sponsor and the arm selected during screening. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medications, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by circadian changes, study visits should be scheduled for a consistent 
timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior 
to measuring blood pressure. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per day) use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at 
least 2 days prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last 30 minutes. If necessary, 
delay blood pressure assessment to meet these requirements. Because a full bladder can impact 
blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For
  seated measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
pat
ient’s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by palpation). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  79 • Follow the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual to initiate the automated blood 
pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a 5 -minute 
period of rest, followed by 4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1- minute 
intervals. The seated blood pressure for the visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The 
blood pressure device works best when you are at rest and without any distraction, so 
the staff will avoid interacting with you during this assessment. This assessment will 
include a 5 -minute period of rest, followed by about 5 minutes of the device inflating 
to measure your blood pressure”. 
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed ar
m bent slightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Measure standing blood pressure 1 to 3 minutes after standing using the automated blood pressure device’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-
headedness when standing and record their response. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute 
“remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel. If a home visit is not possible, a “remote visit blood pressure 
measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by appropriately trained study staff, following the 
instructions detailed in the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual. Results and the remote 
method used will be recorded. 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1- minute intervals. The seated blood pressure for the 
visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM 3 times during the week prior to the 
second randomization.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week and may be increased at the 
Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measurement is warranted. Patients may select the day of the week that is most convenient for their personal schedule.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  80 10.3. Procedures for Optional Home Healthcare Visits  
Home healthcare may be allowed where applicable country and local regulations and 
infrastructure for home healthcare allow and will follow procedures that are in compliance with 
relevant local regulations and guidelines (eg, General Data Protection Regulation [EU no 2016/679], ICH E6[R2], and the Declaration of Helsinki). The use of home healthcare is optional 
and will not be utilized for visits at which study drug is administered or for visits that are 
required to be performed at the site (see Table 1 ).  
The option for home healthcare aims to improve patient diversity, participation, engagement, and 
retention in the study by reducing patient burden and minimizing study- related travel to the site, 
allowing flexibility in the study visit schedule.  
For clinical study sites where home healthcare is utilized, the Investigator will retain responsibility for oversight, patient safety, and conduct of the trial, and will be responsible for 
reviewing the qualifications of and approving each home healthcare professional, delegating responsibilities to the home healthcare professional in the site delegation log, providing 
instructions for home healthcare visits, communicating with the home heal thcare professional at 
home visits as needed, and reviewing the source data files collected during the home healthcare 
visit. The home healthcare professional will be trained on the protocol and other relevant study 
documents and procedures and will be responsible for conducting vital sign assessments 
(including blood pressure assessments), collecting blood and urine samples, collecting weight, performing pill counts of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications, and 
documenting and notifying the site study team of any suspected or potential AE symptoms or 
changes to concomitant medications. The home healthcare professional will be responsible for providing source documentation of the visit to the study site. 
10.4. Amendment History 
10.4.1. Amendment 3 Summary of Changes  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to close the OLE period of the study, and to provide 
instructions for patients to complete the study. Patients who completed the 6-month DB period 
may have been eligible to enter a separate OLE study to continue to receive zilebesiran. If the separate OLE study was not yet available at the time patients completed the 6 -month DB period, 
they could have entered the optional OLE period of the study to continue receiving zilebesiran uninterrupted and then transition to the separate OLE study when it opened. The Sponsor has made the decision not to conduct a separate OLE study; therefore, the OLE period is no longer 
needed. Upon implementation of this amendment, patients in the 6-month DB period will enter 
safety follow-up following completion of the 6-month DB period. Patients will not receive a dose of study drug at Month 6. Patients who are already in the OLE period will not receive any 
additional doses of study drug. Patients should complete all planned assessments at Months 7, 8, 
and 9. For visits at Month 12 or later, patients should complete EOT assessments in lieu of their scheduled visit assessments and enter the Safety Follow-up period.

10.4.2. Amendment 2 Summary of Changes  
10.4.2.1. Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purposes for this protocol amendment are to extend the duration of the study to allow patients to continue to receive zilebesiran until a separate open -label extension study is 
initiated and to increase the number of patients randomized into the Run-in period to 1800. 
Several additional changes are being implemented as outlined below.  
• Allowed for patients with a valid ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at 
Run- in Visit 2 that meets inclusion criteria to repeat ABPM once if the assessment

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  82 was obtained outside the 7-day window prior to randomization into the Double-blind 
period. 
• Clarified that the inclusion criterion for ABPM is inclusive of 130 mmHg 
• Revised the timing of repeat ABPM measurements from 4 days to 7 days 
• Clarified that retesting of office blood pressure at Run- in Visit 1 is permitted once if 
the Investigator believes that the result is not accurate due to a transient condition  
• Revised the serum potassium cutoff in the recommended interventions for hyperkalemia to align with the normal range of potassium 
• Increased the number of clinical study centers  
• Clarified timing of age determination for eligibility  
• Clarified the timing of blood sample collections for renin -angiotensin- aldosterone 
system (RAAS) biomarkers in relation to electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Added exclusion criterion for patients placed in an institution on the basis of an official or court order to align with local requirements in some countries 
• Removed references to legal guardian throughout the protocol because inclusion 
criterion 7 requires that the patient provide written informed consent 
• Revised the duration of rest required before vital sign collection to align with 
automated processes on the machines used to collect this information 
• Removed the reference that ECG recordings will be archived because these are not being archived 
• Clarified that creatinine clearance is required during screening only to determine the dose of olmesartan for patients enrolled at sites outside of the US and Australia who 
are randomized to receive olmesartan as protocol -specified background 
antihypertens ive medication  
• Clarified that home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is not required on days when 
ABPM is being performed 
• Clarified that medications, supplements, or other substances that may be associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities may be used as needed after approval by the Investigator and Medical Monitor 
• Specified the titles of study manuals  
• Added forehead scan as a method of temperature collection to reflect site standard practice  
• Clarified that patients should return to their usual care during the Safety Follow-up 
period

Purpose: Extended the duration of the study. 
The primary change occurs in Section 3.1, Study Design 
Revised text:  OLE Period  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will be discontinued, and patients may be 
el
igible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate 
OLE study, they may receive open-label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 12 30 additional months until the 
separate OLE study is open and then transition. Once the separate OLE study is open for enrollment, eligible patients may rollover 
into that OLE study at Month 6, 12, or 18, 24, 30, or 36 (first visit after the separate OLE study is open). 
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 18 36 months. The estimated total time on study for patients who rollover to the 
separate OLE study is up to approximately 2039 months, including up to 2 months 75 days  of the Screening and Run-in periods, and 
up to 18 36 months of treatment.  For all patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety 
Follow-up period is up to 12 months  after the last dose of study drug .

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  94 10.4.3. Amendment 1 Summary of Changes  
10.4.3.1. Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose for this protocol amendment is to reduce patient burden by removing or 
modifying procedures that are not considered necessary for analysis of primary or secondary 
efficacy endpoints or for safety; and by providing clarifications and updates to inclusion/exclusion criteria and concomitant medications to better take into account common characteristics of patients with mild -to-moderate hypertension. 
Changes to Procedures:  
• Clarified that 3 measurements are sufficient to establish baseline for home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM).  Removed the requirement to consider patients who do 
not establish baseline HBPM as run -in failures because evaluation of change in 
HBPM is an exploratory endpoint. Revised the frequency of HBPMs after 
randomization to at least once per week and clarified that they may be increased at the Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measure ment is warranted.  
• Removed 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at Month 18 and during the safety follow-up period because office blood pressures and HBPM will be sufficient to monitor safety  
• Removed 24-hour urine samples for assessment of sodium status  
• Clarified the extended hepatic panel required in patients who experience elevated transaminases  
• Clarified that patients did not have to avoid over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before laboratory assessments 
Changes to Eligibility Criteria and Concomitant Medications: 
• Removed limitations on the allowable classes and doses of prior antihypertensive medication because these were not meant to be limiting, and patients will be 
discontinuing their prior antihypertensives and starting the protocol specified 
background antihypertensive 
• Clarified that patients who are currently taking beta blockers may be enrolled if beta blockers can be discontinued prior to the Run-in period 
• Clarified that over -the-counter NSAIDs are permitted because low -dose aspirin is 
commonly used in this population as a cardioprotectant and should not have an additional effect on blood pressure. Doses of aspirin ≤100 mg daily are not expected to have a si gnificant effect on blood pressure. In addition, the period in which patients 
should avoid NSAIDs before office blood pressure and ABPM assessments was revised to 2 days because the effects of these medications are expected to be washed out within 2 days. 
• Clarified that patients are allowed to be on sodium- glucose co -transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors as long as patients are on a stable dose prior to and during the study 
treatment period. This change was made because SGLT2 inhibitors may be 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 (zilebesiran)  
Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  95 commonly used in this population, and stable doses of SGLT2 inhibitors are not 
expected to have an additional appreciable effect on blood pressure. 
• Revised and simplified the exclusion criterion for diabetes mellitus as this is not expected to have a significant effect on blood pressure  
• Clarified that patients with mild -to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea are eligible if 
they are on continuous positive airway pressure therapy because these patients would not be expected to have spikes in nighttime blood pressure 
• Clarified that patients who are in follow -up for a coronavirus -19 vaccine study for 
approved or investigational agents are allowed to be enrolled because follow-up procedures for these studies are not expected to impact patient safety in this study 
• Removed exclusions on cannabis use and clarified that use of cannabis or delta-9-
tetrahydrocannibinol-containing substances should be avoided when possible and for 
at least 2 days before ABPM and office blood pressure measurements  
• Removed the exclusion criterion for being unable or unwilling to perform HBPM as specified as it is redundant with the inclusion criteria specifying that the patient is willing and able to comply with the study requirements, which includes procedures 
• Clarified that physicians should refer to recommended target per treatment guidelines when considering the addition of oral antihypertensive medication for persistent elevations in blood pressure 
• Clarified the duration of medication restrictions during the study 
Several additional changes are being implemented as outlined below.  
• Defined key secondary and other secondary endpoints to account for the implementation of a hierarchical testing procedure in this study. Modified exploratory endpoints to better reflect the objectives of the study 
• Modified analysis sets to better reflect the analysis methods of the study  
• Increased number of clinical study centers worldwide to approximately 120 
• Clarified dosing of study drug during the study to be consistent with other parts of the protocol 
• Corrected the definition of permanent sterilization  
• Clarified that analysis of urinalysis measures protein, which includes albumin

ised text:  
Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study  • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure.  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately 
treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Until double -blind data are generated that demonstrate acceptable safety and added antihypertensive efficacy of zilebesiran when 
combined with olmesartan, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape 
antihypertensive agents for high blood pressure will be avoided throughout the study.  
• If added, escape antihypertensives must be used per their labeled instructions and in accordance with current clinical 
guidelines. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018]  
Day 1 to Month 3  Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation:  
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of zilebesiran, interventions for asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased >10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that 
persists for ≥24 hours on 2 consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by hypertensive symptoms should be evaluated by the clinical study site. Severely symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospital setting within 24 hours.  
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems  it to be 
a clinically significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of the Investigator using a CCB and /or a 
thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic (whichever agent is not already the protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication) as 
an escape antihypertensive medication.  
Months 3 to 6  Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like  diuretic (whichever agent is not already a protocol -specified 
background antihypertensive medication):  
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic mayshould be added as an escape antihypertensive medication if the 
daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by ABPM. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling clinical reason to wait, the rationale 
for exception should be documented in the eCRF.

Amendment 3, 20 July 2023  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  102 Study Period  Intervention  
• After Month 3, other escape antihypertensive medications may also be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevatio ns 
in SBP above recommended target  per treatment guidelines  (eg, target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 mmHg). [Williams 2018]  
Month 6 to End of 
Study (OLE period)  Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, protocol -specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be 
discontinued.  
• Patients who continue into the OLE period will initiate open -label treatment with 600 mg zilebesiran once every 6 months. As 
many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and serum chemistries will be car efully  
monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 9, and Investigators will be prepared to downtitrate or interrupt escape 
antihypertensive medications if low blood pressure develops (see Section 5.8.1).  
• If the Month 6 ABPM is in target (daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg), escape antihypertensive medications (if taken) may be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement to determine if the patient’s blood pressure remains within target on zilebesiran tr eatment alone.  
• During the OLE period, oral antihypertensive medications may be added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in 
blood pr
essure above recommended target  per treatment guidelines  (eg, target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP 
<135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 mmHg).[Whelton 2018; Williams 2018]

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo -controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of zilebesiran administered  
subcutaneously ( SC) as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with a 
standard of care antihypertensive medication. A schematic of the study design is provided in 
Figure 1.  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized to receive open-label therapy with olmesartan (40 mg orally once 
daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening  
enrolled at sites outside of the U nited S tates (US)  or Australia , consistent with local labeling for 
olmesartan]), amlodipine (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks.  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria after the Run -in period will be randomized 1:1 
to receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB  treatment period as 
add-on therapy to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication.  
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive medications”) may be added to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure. 
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran open -label 
extension ( OLE ) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the 
separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months 
for up to 30 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and then transition.  
Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period. 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive , at time of initial informed consent) with 
untreated hypertension or on stable therapy with up to 2 antihypertensive medications. Patients 
should have a 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) after at least 4 weeks of run -in on protocol-
specified background antihypertensive medication. Patients with secondary hypertension or orthostatic hypotension will be excluded. 
Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Zilebesiran is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) -conjugated small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 Patients randomized to receive zilebesiran  will be administered 600 mg SC once during the 6-
month DB treatment period; all patients will receive 600 mg SC once every 6 months during the 
OLE  period. 
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo ( phosphate-buffered saline for SC administration) will be administered at the same 
dosing interval and volume as the study drug during the 6-month DB period. 
Protocol- specified Background Antihypertensive Medication, Dose, and Mode of 
Administration  
Patients will be randomized to 1 of the following protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications to be administered orally once daily during the Run-in and 6-month DB periods: 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg (or 20 mg for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or Australia, consistent with local 
labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan once daily may initiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks. 
• Amlodipine: 5 mg  
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg  
Duration of Treatment and Study Participation 
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 39 months, including up to 75 days of the Screening and Run-in period s, and up to 36 months of treatment. F or all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB 
period. Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline 
blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening estimated glomerular 
filtration rate  (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
For the primary endpoint, assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2-sided significance level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add-
on to olmesartan; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo 
as add -on to indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the 
following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add-on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  8 The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by-treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of 
zilebesiran and have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment. 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit. 
For the analyses of the 6-month DB period, t he analysis  population used to evaluate efficacy will 
be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis 
Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  15 Notes:  
• When scheduled at the same time points and where feasible, the assessments of vital signs and blood sample collections  for RAAS biomarkers (renin, 
aldosterone, and Ang I/II)  should be performed before physical examinations and 12 -lead ECGs.  
• Run-in Visit 2 should occur at least 4 weeks after Run- in Visit 1.  
• Patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study upon completion of the Month 6 predose assessments. If an individual patient 
reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open- label zilebesira n beginning at the Month 6 visit and continue for 
up to 30  additional months until the separate OLE study is open and then transition at Month 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 ( first visit after the separate OLE 
study is open). Patients who rollover at Month 6 should complete all assessments scheduled for the Month 6 visit except for study drug administration. 
Patients who rollover at Month 12 should complete the EOT visit instead of the assessments scheduled at Month 12.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug at any time during the study or do not enroll in the separate OLE study will be asked to perform Safety Follow -up 
visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of thei r individual mean baseline level (if known) or 
12 months  after the last dose of study  drug, whichever comes earlier. During this Follow -up period, HBPM monitoring may continue at the discretion of 
the Investigator. The ADA sample should only be collected a t the first Follow -up visit during the Follow -up period.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/ET assessments should be performed.   
Footnotes:  
a All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection (Table  2), are to be performed prior to administration of protocol -specified background 
antihypertensive medications (including Run- In Visit 1) and study drug (as applicable).   
b When applicable, pregnancy test results must be known prior to dosing with study drug at dosing visits.  
c Laboratory assessments at Day 1 do not need to be repeated, per Investigator discretion, if they were collected within 7 days  before Day 1 at Run -in Visit 2.  
d Office blood pressure must be measured before the patient takes oral antihypertensive medications or study drug (as applicabl e).  
e ABPM recordings associated with study drug dosing visits should be obtained within 7 days before the visit and results reviewed before dosing.  
f HBPM should be measured  at least 3 times during the  week prior to the second randomization  to establish baseline . After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at 
least once per week  in the morning upon waking and may be increased at the Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measurement is warranted. HBPM is not 
required on days  when ABPM is being assessed. In the Safety Follow -up period, the frequency of HBPM assessments can be reduced after the first Safety 
Follow -up visit per Investigator judgement.  
g Neurological evaluation will also be performed as part of the full physical examination.  
h ABPM should only be performed as part of ET assessments if the patient discontinues the study prior to Month 12 and has not had an ABPM within the last 3 
 months. ABPM should not be performed at Month 36 .

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 1. INTRODUCTION 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developing zilebesiran ( ALN- AGT01) , a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
ligand, which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. 
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -003 (KARDIA -2) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment 
with a standard of care antihypertensive medication. Patients will be randomized to run- in on 1 
of 3 protocol-specified antihypertensive medications open- label for at least 4 weeks (olmesartan, 
amlodipine, or indapamide). At the end of the Run-in period, patients with uncontrolled blood 
pressure will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo as add -on therapy to the 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication for 6 months during the double-blind 
(DB) period. After completion of the 6-month DB period, patients may be eligible to participate 
in a separate zilebesiran open -label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches 
Month 6 prior to availability of the OLE study, they may discontinue their protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication and receive open- label zilebesiran (600 mg once every 
6 months) for up to 30 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean systolic blood 
pressure ( SBP), assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ), from baseline to 
Month 3, relative to placebo. Secondary and exploratory objectives of the study include 
evaluating the add -on efficacy of zilebesiran on other measures of blood pressure response 
(including longer treatment durations, eg, up to 36 months) and evaluating the PD effect of zilebesiran, including reduction in circulating AGT  concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapies achieve target blood pressure in only a minority of 
patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despite the 
availability of multiple efficacious agents, current rates of control are low, and the global burden of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
and to overcome the limitations of current therapies is a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developing zilebesiran, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, 
for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally occurring cellular 
mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent 
suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. Z ilebesiran contains an siRNA 
targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing ligand to facilitate delivery to the 
liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, zilebesiran is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 2017; Romero 2015] Because 
hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, zilebesiran has been developed to 
reduce blood pressure by decreasing circulating AGT levels and the downstream effects of 
angiotensin II (AngII).  
Zilebesiran is being studied in the ongoing Phase 1 Study ALN- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension as single ascending doses of 10 to 800 mg (Part A), as a single dose of 800 mg under low-salt or high-salt conditions (Part B), as 2 doses of 
800 mg administered every 3 months in obese patients (Part D), and as a single dose of 800 mg 
co-administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan (Part E). Preliminary data are available from 
Parts A, B, and E. Dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT were observed 
after single SC doses of zilebesiran, accompanied by clinically significant reductions in SBP and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Sustained reductions in serum AGT were observed for up to 6 
months following a single dose of zilebesiran.  
Most adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically 
significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium. No patient has required intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevations have been observed in patients who received zilebesiran doses as high as 800 mg. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minori ty of patients and were all mild and 
transient events that resolved without intervention. 
Because most patients with hypertension eventually progress to require treatment with more than 
1 antihypertensive class, [Williams 2018 ] it is anticipate d that zilebesiran may be used together 
with other standard of care antihypertensive medication. This Phase 2 study will further quantify 
the antihypertensive effects of zilebesiran as add -on therapy in patients with hypertension not 
adequately controlled by a standard of care antihypertensive medication. The consistent and 
durable PD effect of zilebesiran  is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour 
blood pressure lowering with infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of zilebesiran is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  26 1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study 001 indicate that zilebesiran may offer the benefit of sustained  
blood pressure reduction to patients with hypertension with infrequent administration (ie, once 
every 3 months or once every 6 months). The mean SBP reduction observed after single zilebesiran doses of 100 mg or higher exceeds 10 mmHg, which is comparable to the effect of 
conventional antihypertensives.[ Abraham 2015; Materson 1993] The blood pressure of patients 
will be closely monitored, and after Month 3, escape antihypertensive medications will be added 
as needed to control blood pressure. 
Given the mechanism of action and mode of administration of zilebesiran, potential theoretical 
risks include liver transaminase elevations and ISRs. Like any antihypertensive therapy, there is also a theoretical risk of hypotension with zilebesiran. Based upon the disease population, there 
is also a risk of blood pressure elevation. Because eligible patients have mild to moderate 
primary hypertension, the likelihood of disease progression during the course of the study is low. This study has exclusion crite ria intended to minimize these risks, as well as frequent monitoring 
for laboratory and blood pressure abnormalities. Furthermore, the duration of the placebo period is limited, and escape antihypertensive medications are permitted to manage uncontrolled blood pressure following 3 months of add- on treatment with zilebesiran.  Detailed guidance is provided 
to Investigators for potential liver transaminase elevations (Section  5.2.4), hypotension 
(Section  5.8.1), hypertension (Section 5.8.2), renal dysfunction ( Section  5.8.3), and 
hyperkalemia (Section  5.8.4). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
and ensure the safety of study participants (see Section 3.6).  
Based on available data from Study 001, zilebesiran has an acceptable safety profile in patients 
with hypertension as a monotherapy or with the addition of conventional antihypertensives in 
patients who were inadequately controlled on zilebesiran alone. This experience supports that the 
theoretical risks of treatment are low and can be managed through the proposed monitoring and safety mitigations.  In addition to study drug, each  patient  will receive a protocol -specified 
background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide). These agents are approved standard medications that will be dosed in accordance with local  labeling . 
While zilebesiran is designed to inhibit the RAAS, its site of action (AGT)  in the RAAS is 
unique, and its tissue specificity for the liver is  hypothesized to improve its renal safety profile 
relative to conventional RAAS blockade,[ Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] both in the context of 
monotherapy and when used together with a conventional RAAS blocker such as olmesartan. In 
the latter setting, zilebesiran is hypothesized to add antihypertensive benefit when added to a 
conventional RAAS blocker without the increased incidence of RAAS inhibitor- associated renal 
adverse effects that have been observed in prior trials of conventional dual RAAS 
blockade.[ Makani 2013] Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 
<45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300mg/g will be exclusively assigned to the 
olmesartan cohort to ensure that patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease or diabetes continue the RAAS inhibition standardly recommended for their renal indication throughout the 
study. 
This study’s monitoring plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of 
conventional RAAS inhibitors.[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] The risk of renal safety events is 
further mitigated in this study by its eligibility criteria, which exclude patients who are at highest

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 Run-in Period  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized  as described in Section 3.4 to receive open -label therapy with 
olmesartan  (40 mg orally once daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine 
clearance ≤ 60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US and Australia , consistent 
with local labeling for olmesartan] ), amlodipine (5  mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg 
orally once daily) as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a 
Run-in period of at least 4 weeks. Prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) will be 
discontinued upon the start of this Run-in period (Run-i n Visit 1).  
Patients who do not tolerate run- in treatment or who do not meet eligibility for randomization at 
Day 1  will be withdrawn from the study and returned to their prior medication regimen in 
coordination with their usual health providers.  
DB Period  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive 600 mg 
zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB period as add -on therapy to their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or 
indapamide). Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or  all other races) , 
baseline blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or 
≥60 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive 
medications”) may be added  to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication  per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure as described in Table 4.  
OLE Period  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. 
If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may 
receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 30 additional months 
until the separate OLE study is open and then transition. Once the separate OLE study is open for 
enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into th at OLE study at Month 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 
(first visit after the separate OLE study is open ). 
During the OLE period of this study, Investigators will use escape antihypertensive medications  
as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure 
monitoring. 
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients who discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the separate zilebesiran OLE study will 
be asked to complete Safety Follow-up visits once every 6 months after their last dose of study 
drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if known) or 
12 months after the last dose of study drug, whichever comes earlier.  During the Safety Follow-
up period, patients should return to their pre- study medical care (usual care).  
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration)

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment 
(EOT)/ early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study, and an independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee will review  suspected  renal events to 
adjudicate whether they meet criteria for acute kidney injury.  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 1800 patients to be randomized into the Run-in period and approximately  630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period.  
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 36 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 39 months, including 
up to 75 days of the Screening and Run-in period s, and  up to 36 months of treatment. For all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. 
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with 
hypertension despite treatment with a standard of care antihypertensive medication.  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM, from baseline to Month 3, relative to placebo. 
Patients with hypertension often require treatment with multiple antihypertensive drugs to reach 
target blood pressure,[ Williams 2018 ] and it is anticipated that zilebesiran may be administered 
to individuals on a background of other antihypertensive medications. Therefore, this study evaluates the effects of zilebesiran relative to placebo in patients whose blood pressure is not adequat ely controlled despite treatment with 1 of the 3 major drug classes recommended for 
initial treatment of hypertension  by all clinical guidelines: RAAS inhibitors (ie, angiotensin 
converting enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitors, angiotensin II- receptor blockers , or a direct renin 
inhibitor), diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs).[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] 
Studying coadministration with olmesartan will assess if the synergistic antihypertensive effects recently observed in rodents treated with both an ARB and an AGT- targeting GalNAc -siRNA 
will translate into clinically significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients given 
zilebesiran as an add -on to conventional RAAS inhibition.[ Uijl 2019] In addition, it will examine 
the safety and  tolerability of liver -specific AGT targeting during treatment with a conventional 
RAAS blocker (olmesartan). The newer -generation ARB olmesartan was selected because of its 
high potency relative to early-generation RAAS inhibitors,[ Ojima 2011; White 2011] enabling a 
robust test for added efficacy when combined with zilebesiran. The maximum dose of 
olmesartan permitted per local  labeling will be used to further increase the rigor of this efficacy 
evaluation. The thiazide- like diuretic indapamide was selected in accordance with recent 
guidelines that highlight the greater potency and durability of thiazide-like diuretics over other diuretics. [Burnier 2019] The long-acting dihydropyridine CCB amlodipine was selected given its

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 extensive use in clinical practice and randomized controlled trials. [Dahlof 2005; Jamerson 2008; 
Julius 2004]  
During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both automated office blood pressure 
measurements and outpatient 24-hour ABPM (EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on 
Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). In 
addition to having greater precision, ABPM can assess short-term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dipping 
pattern that is lost in 24% to 35% of hypertensive patients). More frequent (at least once per 
week) measurements will be collected through a third method, oscillometric home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic.  
As recommended by current guidance (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the 6-month DB period is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. To adhere to best 
ethical standards for the treatment of patients with hypertension, the use of oral antihypertensive 
medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood pressure within target is permitted 
starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the remainder of the study (see Table 4). The 
term “escape antihypertensive medication” is used to refer to any oral antihypertensive 
medication initiated to control blood pressure after Day 1. Separate from these treat -to-target 
modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or 
office DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated with escape antihypertensive medication 
regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration. 
If a patient requires treatment with an oral escape antihypertensive medication before Month 6, a 
CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic (whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication) should be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS.  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol- specified background antihypertensive medication 
(olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to 
participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to 
availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC 
once every 6 months for up to 30 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and 
then transition. Because many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, 
office blood pressure and serum chemistries will be monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 
9.  
During the OLE  period, Investigators may use escape antihypertensive medications  of permitted 
classes  as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure 
monitoring and following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Olmesartan, 
amlodipine, and indapamide will be discontinued as p rotocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication during the OLE period; however, patients may continue to receive 
amlodipine or indapamide as escape antihypertensive medication  at the Investigator’s discretion . 
The use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for high blood pressure should be avoided throughout the study.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 While the tissue specificity of zilebesiran for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012].  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The dose of zilebesiran in this study (600 mg once every 6 months) was selected on the basis of data from the Phase 1 Study 001, in which single zilebesiran doses up to 800 mg were found to have an acceptable safety profile, and dose-dependent, clinically significant placebo -corrected 
reductions in mean SBP >10 mmHg by 24- hour ABPM were observed at doses as low as 
100 mg. An acceptable safety profile was also observed for a single zilebesiran dose of 800 mg under low- salt/high -salt conditions or co -administered for 2  weeks with 300 mg irbesartan once 
daily . The selected dose of 600 mg is predicted to result in a median serum AGT reduction of 
94.9% at trough (Month 6), translating to a median SBP reduction of 11.6 mmHg as monotherapy. 
The protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications are standard agents 
recommended in international and regional hypertension guidelines, and the selected regimens are standard doses used for their approved indication of hypertension.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] Indapamide will be dosed at 2.5 mg orally once daily, and amlodipine will be dosed at 5 mg orally once daily. The dose regimens for indapamide and amlodipine used in this study were selected on the basis of their common use in clinical care (when used both individually and 
combined with other classes of antihypertensives) and their expected efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. Olmesartan will be dosed at the maximum dose allowed per local  labeling: 40 mg 
orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min 
at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or Australia ; Olmetec Product Information, 
September 2020).[ von Bergmann 2001] 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. After the patient signs the informed consent form ( ICF) and before 
proceeding with screening procedures, the Investigator or designee should contact the Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) to obtain a patient identification number. 
The Investigator or designee will contact the IRT to randomize the patient at Run-in Visit 1 and 
again at Day 1 after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at each visit.  
At Run -in Visit 1, patients with screening eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine 
≥300mg/g will be assigned to receive olmesartan. To avoid over -enrollment, patients with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300 mg/g will be excluded from the study after 
100 such patients are randomized to study drug on Day 1.  
All other patients will be randomized  10:7:4 to run-in open- label on 1 of 3 protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide), with targeted 
sample sizes across cohorts as described in Section  7.1. If 1 cohort completes enrollment first, 
this cohort will be deactivated for future randomization. The remaining 2 cohorts will be

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  33 randomized using the original ratio. After the second cohort completes enrollment, all 
subsequent patients will be assigned to the last cohort.  
At Day 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo  as an add -on to  their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication using the IRT. Randomization at 
Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline blood pressure (24 -hour mean 
SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or ≥60 m L/min/1.73m2). 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel and patients will be blinded to study drug treatment through Month 3 of the 6-month DB period. After the database lock to support the analysis of the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3 is complete, Sponsor staff members who will not have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  will be unblinded to 
the analysis results according to the prespecified blinding plan. Site personnel, patients, and Sponsor staff members who have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  
will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after the analysis of Month 6 data is complete.  
All Sponsor and site personnel and patients will be blinded to any clinical laboratory result that could potentially unblind them (eg, AGT levels) until unblinding. 
Zilebesiran and placebo will be packaged identically. Because zilebesiran may be slightly  
visually distinguishable from placebo, the vials will be masked in such a way as to hide the 
identity of the study drug contained within. For administration, syringes will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate prior to withdrawing the study drug from vial. See the Pharmacy Manual 
for additional details.  The study drug will be administered under the supervision of the 
Investigator (see Section  5.2.2).  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact the Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within 1 working day after 
the unblinding event. Unblinding information should be limited to the fewest number of people 
on a need -to-know basis . A record of when  the blind was broken, who was unblinded, who broke 
the blind, and why it was broken, will be maintained in the electronic trial master file ( eTMF).  
Refer to the IRT instructions for details on unblinding. 
3.6. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study. The DMC will operate under the rules of a charter that will be reviewed and approved at the organizational meeting of the DMC. Details are provided in the DMC Charter. 
3.7. Clinical Event Adjudication Committees  
An independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee of 2 or more nephrologists will review the suspected renal events blinded to treatment assignment to adjudicate whether they meet

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their 
continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue study drug or stop a 
patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest . Any discontinuation of treatment or the stopping of the patient’s participation in the 
study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stopping of a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.9.1) per Investigator discretion  
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 • Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by the Sponsor 
If possible, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section  6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience is captured in the final analyses .  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient has an AE, including SAEs, and/or laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the patient’s  overall status, requires interruption or 
discontinuation from treatment with study drug, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be 
recorded in the eCRF . Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive 
treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6-month DB period (defined as the time the 
first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 6 
assessments) will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (excluding pharmacokinetic [ PK] assessments) through Month 6. They will also be asked to complete S afety 
Follow-up visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) until PD recovery  or 12 months after the last dose of study drug 
(whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug during the OLE period will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete EOT/ ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-up visits once 
every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months after the last dose of study drug (whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation  
4.3.2.1. Patient Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient may stop participation in the study at any time . A patient considering stopping 
participation in the study before Month 6 should be informed that the patient can discontinue 
study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit and comple te Safety Follow -up visits as described in 
Section  4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient 
consents. If a patient still chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation in all follow-up prior to the completion of the 6-month DB period, every effort should be made to conduct the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time (see Table 1 ). 
A patient considering stopping participation in the study during the OLE period should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT/E T visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process the patient’s  personal data (see 
Section  4.3.2.2), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases ) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law.  
4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . Also, where allowed by local 
law, the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of the patient’s  personal data, 
informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . In both cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information 
(including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow-up even if study drug is discontinued.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient wishes to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or loc al 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available 
records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after the second randomization at Day 1 .  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied by the Sponsor for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must 
not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication that have been dispensed and returned unused must not 
be re-dispensed.

will receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC  at Month 6 after all predose assessments are conducted and  
once every 6 months during the OLE period. 
Study drug injections will be administered by qualified clinical study center staff under the 
supervision of the Investigator or designee. The injection site may be marked and mapped for 
later observation . Injections may be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the side or back of 
the upper arms. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. 
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
To maintain the blind, the syringes are to be masked by the site pharmacist or designee prior to 
study drug withdrawal from the vial. A full description of the blinding procedure is included in the Pharmacy Manual.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of study drug within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered up to 85 days before the next scheduled dose. Thereafter, the dose will be considered missed and not administered. 
If a patient misses a dose of study drug, the Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor 
whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see also Section  4.3).  
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  The definition of study drug overdose, follow-up procedures, and reporting requirements are 
provided Section  6.5.6.8. 
5.2.3. Dose Modifications

5.2.5. Neurological Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring, and Stopping Study Drug 
Dosing  
Clinically significant events that may be consistent with potential decreased proprioception 
(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by the 
Medical Monitor. 
5.3. Protocol -specified Background Antihypertensive Medications  
All patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 following standard of care oral 
antihypertensive medications during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks and will continue this

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication through Month 6. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications will be supplied by the Sponsor. 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with 
creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min at screening enrolled at sites outside of the US or 
Australia, consistent with local labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan once daily may initiate treatment at 
20 mg once daily and then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 
weeks (i n this case, the patient must take the full olmesartan dose of 40 mg once daily 
for at least 4 weeks prior to reassessment at Run -in Visit 2).  
• Amlodipine: 5 mg orally once daily 
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg orally once daily 
Protocol-specified antihypertensive medications may be downtitrated or temporarily 
discontinued per Investigator judgement for low blood pressure (see Section 5.8.1).  At the 
Investigator’s discretion, oral antihypertensive agents, including protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, may be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume 
depletion. Additional information on the protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications, including side effects, drug-drug interactions, and other important prescribing information can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.

Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for prepar ing zilebesiran or placebo doses  
and dispensing protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the safe handling of study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication are required.  
Study drug will be stored at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose preparation. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication will be stored according to the storage instructions on 
the label. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the 
Sponsor and use of the affected study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication  halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or 
designee, as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication and additional storage will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.5. Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug and protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice 
specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication labels and external packaging will include all 
appropriate information as per local labeling requirements. Additional details will be available in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 5.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied for this 
study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept of when and how much study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication is dispensed 
and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol 
dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs and 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. Used, partially used, and unused 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.7. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.7.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at 
which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typically 
nonmedical in nature; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with 
an AE . Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical 
label, damaged vial , empty vial , and contamination of study drug. 
5.7.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using the process outlined in the Pharmacy Manual. CPCs that may be associated with an AE must be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.8. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.8.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly  with HBPM to ensure 
the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Patients who experience l ow blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should 
promptly seek medical evaluation at the clinical study site or another hospital setting. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of 
orthostatic blood pressure (supine to standing).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or interruption of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg).  Oral antihypertensives 
should be downtitrated/interrupted in reverse order to how they were added (ie, interrupt escape antihypertensive medications before protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general 
medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by the 
Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to 
facilitate this physician -to-physician communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) should be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement as outlined above.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and laboratory  monitoring (serum electrolytes and 
creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as 
fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.8.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
office blood pressure. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure.  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg  
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Until double- blind data are generated that demonstrate acceptable safety 
and added antihypertensive efficacy of zilebesiran when combined with olmesartan, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE 
inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertens ive agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout the study.  
• If added, escap
 e antihypertensives must be used per their labeled 
instructions and in accordance with current clinical  guidelines. [Whelton 
2018; Wi
lliams 2018 ] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of zilebesiran , interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by hypertensive 
symptoms should be evaluated by the clinical study site. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospital setting within 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically 
significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified background 
antihypertensive medication) as an escape antihypertensive medication .  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like  diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already a protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication) : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may  be added as 
an escape antihypertensive medication if the daytime mean SBP is 
≥135 mmHg by ABPM. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling 
clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, other escape antihypertensive medications may also be 
added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in SBP  above 
recommended target  per treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135  mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 
mmHg) .[Williams 2018]

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  48 Study Period  Intervention  
Month 6 to End of 
Study (OLE period)  Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued .  
• Patients  who continue into the OLE period will initiate open -label treatment 
with 600 mg zilebesiran once every 6 months. As many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and serum 
chemistries will be carefully monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 9, and Investigators will be prepared to downtitrate or interrupt  escape
 
antihypertensive medications  if low blood pressure develops (see 
Section  5.8.1).  
• If the Month 6 ABPM is in target (daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg), escape 
antihypertensive medication s (if taken)  may be downtitrated or interrupted 
per Investigator judgement to determine if the patient’s blood pressure 
remains within target on zilebesiran treatment alone.  
• During the OLE period, oral antihypertensive medications may be added 
per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target  per treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 
mmHg) .[Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ]

5.8.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial zilebesiran PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
the Sponsor, and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypovolemia 
− Hypotension 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeats tests, look

participating study sites. These potassium-binding drugs are indicated  for the treatment of 
hyperkalemia and have been shown to safely reduce serum potassium levels and to maintain 
long-term normokalemia in chronic kidney disease patients receiving background conventional RAAS inhibitor therapy.[ Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] 
5.9. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s e CRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals . Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the e CRF.  
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted . However, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated . For other permitted 
concomitant medications administered SC , do not administer in same injection site area as the 
study drug for at least 4 days after each  dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low -dose aspirin (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least 30 days prior to 
screening and during the study treatment period are allowed. Occasional use of other systemic  
over-the-counter NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased blood 
pressure, they should be avoided when possible and for at least 2 days prior to ABPM and office 
blood pressure assessments, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at the 
lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period. 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment 
period. 
Patients receiving stable doses of tamsulosin, alfuzosin, or silodosin for at least 30 days prior to 
screening are allowed . 
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by local or regional regulatory authorities. 
Use of cannabis or delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) -containing substances (including by 
smoking, vaping, dabbing, or ingesting/edibles) should be avoided when possible and for at least 
2 day s prior to ABPM and office blood pressure assessments. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the Investigator, except as described in Section 5.9.1 and after consulting the Pharmacy Manual, which contains information on drug-drug interactions and other important prescribing 
information for the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications. However, it is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the e CRF . Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and 
accepted coding dictionary.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 5.9.1. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors), except for  olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication  
during the 6-month DB period  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than zilebesiran)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities 
or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics (eg, clozapine, olanzapine), diet pills (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine 
hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride), unless individually approved by both the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by both the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium suppl ements, cyclo -oxygenase-2 inhibitors, trimethoprim and 
trimethoprim-containing combination products, mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists, Noni juice, alfalfa, dandelion, horsetail, nettle, milkweed, lily of the 
valley, Siberian ginseng, and hawthorn ber ries. 
All concomitant medications must be reviewed and approved by the Investigator, with particular attention to avoiding drugs that may affect blood pressure. 
5.10. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study staff. Compliance with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be assessed through pill count by study staff. 
5.11. Other Requirements  
5.11.1. Contraception  
Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of 
contraception from 14 days before the first dose  of protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1). 
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 • Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient . Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1) 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth 
control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice.  
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal range.  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by males of contraception 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section  6.5.5.3). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section  6.5.5.3).  
5.11.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited 
to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by the Investigator throughout the course of the study.

Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including, but not limited to , snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 
minutes prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
5.11.4. Dietary Recommendations  
All patients will receive educational materials on diet with recommendations to limit sodium 
consumption to approximately 2.0 g per day from screening through the end of the Treatment 
period. This direction should be provided at the start of the Screening period, and treatment-naïve patients should follow these recommendations for at least 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. This is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European 
Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  6.5.5.1).  
5.11.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood collection for 
clinical laboratory tests  and from any exercise for 30 minutes prior to office blood pressure 
measurements . 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 . Study visits should be scheduled for 
the morning. All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection, are to be performed 
prior to dosing with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug. Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the study manual s. 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine sampl es and measurement of vital 
signs (at the discretion and oversight of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC must be signed (in paper or 
electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards)  by the patient before the 
screening procedures are initiated . All patients will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . Rescreening of patients once is permitted with agreement  of the Medical 
Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to 
medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Run- in Visit 1  will be updated 
prior to administration  of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening or Run -in laboratory abnormalities are likely to 
be transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale must be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during s creening  and once during the Run-
in period provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed Screening  and Run- in periods. Retesting of office blood pressure at Run- in Visit 1 is 
permitted once if in the Investigator’s judgement, the result is not accurate due to a transient 
condition. Retesting of ABPM at Run -in Visit 2  is permitted  once if the first ABPM is invalid. A 
valid ABPM recording must be obtained within 7 days prior to randomization for all patients. If a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion exceeds the 7-day window prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM assessment is permitted, with no option for retesting in 
case of an invalid reading. Eligibility is assessed by the most recent ABPM result obtained. If a 
valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion is not obtained within the 7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run -in failure . 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to return  once for rescreening  following agreement with the Medical Monitor. A patient will be re -
consented  if rescreening occurs outside of the Screening period. In this case, all screening 
procedures must be repeated.  Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria after Run -in Visit 1 
will not be rescreened.  
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken at the times  
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) using the standardized equipment provided 
by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in Section 10.2. Office b lood pressure 
assessments and ABPM initiation  must be performed before administration of  any oral 
antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable) . 
Patients taking oral antihypertensives prior to screening should discontinue these medications at 
Run- in Visit 1 . The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure measured at Run -in Visit 2  must 
be taken within 7 days before Day 1 . An HBPM unit will be provided before Run- in Visit 2  to 
establish the HBPM baseline , and HBPM should be collected at least 3 times during  the last  
week prior to Day 1. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by appropriately trained individuals, as detailed in 
the ABPM Investigator Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood 
pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained 
remotely using the methods described in Section 10.2. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.8.1 and Section  5.8.2, respectively.

The ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of oral antihypertensive medication. 
Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per day) and 
use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to 
ABPM measurements.   
Validity  will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during 
the study, the patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the recording . During the Run-in 
period , if a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion exceeds the 7- day window 
prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM assessment is permitted, with no option for retesting in case of an invalid reading . Eligibility is assessed by the most recent ABPM result 
obtained. If a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion  is not obtained within the 
7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run -in failure . 
See further details in Section  10.2 and the ABPM Investigator Manual. 
6.2.2. Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured  in triplicate  using the automated blood pressure device 
provided by the Sponsor at trough (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and should be at approximately the same time  of day for each assessment ; therefore, visits should be scheduled at 
approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use 
of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure.  Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per 
day) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days 
prior to blood pressure measurements. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.2 and the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual.  
6.2.3. HBPM  
The HBPM should be measured in the morning upon waking, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral antihypertensive medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.2 and the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual.  
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). In addition, blood samples for determination of RAAS biomarkers 
(plasma renin concentration, AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected only for patients randomized to receive olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 Blood samples for PD assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days 
when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing 
(on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical  laboratory by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. B iomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shipping, and storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of zilebesiran or guide clinical management and will not 
be shared with sites until after study unblinding. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and its primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for 
PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shipping, 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination will be  recorded.  
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and include 
office blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are to be collected prior to administration of oral antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable) . When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs 
should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured in the seated position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 5 minutes. Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, forehead,  or 
axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height , and Morphometrics  
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at Day 1  only. 
Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the 
first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by positioning the measuring tape 
over the elastic tape. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant 100 g of tension is recommended. Measurements 
should be obtained with the tape positioned parallel to the floor and performed using the same 
procedure throughout the study. 
The reading is taken to the nearest centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a study drug dosing visit, it 
should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological evaluation  (see the Recommended Neurological Assessments for All Physical 
Examinations document for further details on the assessments to be performed as part of the 
neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of changes in symptoms, 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
during all symptom-directed physical examinations regardless of whether neurological symptoms have been experienced by the patient.  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval , and Fridericia -corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supine for at least 10 
minutes before each ECG is obtained. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all single 12- lead ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the 
eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection for RAAS biomarkers (renin, aldosterone, and Ang I/II) occur at the same visit  and where feasible, blood sample collection should occur first. ECGs 
should be performed at least 30 minutes after phlebotomy or other stressful assessments. 
The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have 
changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific 
instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  5.2.4. For any other unexplained 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test 
should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately 
explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the clinical situation may be requested. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6  and will 
be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in  Table 6  that are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. In patients randomized to receive olmesartan as the protocol -
specified background antihypertensive medication, blood samples for RAAS biomarkers should 
be collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after blood pressure 
measurements and before any assessments collected in the supine position). Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected after the completion of blood pressure assessments. 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

density lipoprotein [HDL-C], non- HDL -C, low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and 
triglycerides), and HbA1c will be collected at the time points listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection for 
fasting glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
6.5.5.2. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti -drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical  laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5.5.3. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients who become 
pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see 
Section  6.5.6.7 for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see 
Section  5.11.1 for definition of postmenopausal state). 
6.5.5.4. Additional Liver Function Assessments  
Additional laboratory assessments will be performed in patients who experience any LFT 
abnormalities as outlined in Section  5.2.4. Following the occurrence of elevated liver 
transaminases or other LFT abnormalities per central laboratory, all assessments in Table 7  will 
be performed 1 time, as well as hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation assessments 
from  Table 6 , and other assessments or evaluations per Investigator discretion, as appropriate.

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
6.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of F ederal Regulations 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred . It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of zilebesiran . 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection . “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  6.5.6.2 and 
Section  6.5.6.3, respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, 
shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
OR death related to an adverse event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity . Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event  severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
The relationship of each AE to the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication 
should also be assessed by the Investigator. 
6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s health since the 
last visit. The patient should also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, 
used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and 
over-the-counter). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient saf ety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study treatment during the Run-in period 
regardless of their relationship to the study treatment through the end of study. Study treatment is 
defined as protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug (zilebesiran 
or placebo).  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Events occurring after 
signing of the ICF and before th e Run -in period will be captured as medical history (see 
Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study treatment , and baseline events that worsen after 
study treatment , must be recorded as AEs . 
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study 
treatment  through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until 
baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the 
patient is stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be related . Each AE must be described in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  64 detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study treatment, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed . Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected . Refer to eCRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom[s] , injection site location, follow -up actions taken). 
6.5.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
6.5.6.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  6.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of 
the event . All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study treatment . 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study treatment , and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Within 24 hours of 
receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and, as applicable, the 
SAE form .  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using the Investigator’s  best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE . These measures and the patient’s response to these measures 
should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment , will be followed by 
the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable . Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran )

study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements . Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow -up (see Section  3.1), 
the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being 
notified of the pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form . The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy, the possible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  6.5.6.4. 
6.5.6.8. Reporting of Overdose and Other Special Situations  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by the participant that is >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, or 
CPC associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor within 24 hours using the contact 
information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of reporting instructions for overdose and other special situations will be outlined in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  66 6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy 
of zilebesiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ). These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its 
designees.  
When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and study unblinding for the analysis  of the primary endpoints and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3. The plan 
will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 630 patients will be randomized to receive either zilebesiran or placebo with sample sizes in each of the patient cohorts with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication as follows:  
• Olmesartan cohort: 300 patients  
• Amlodipine cohort: 210 patients 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  67 • Indapamide cohort: 120 patients 
Assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP 
assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2- sided significance 
level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to olmesartan; 
zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to 
indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add -on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The power is assessed by  simulation based on the Mixed Model with R epeated M easurements 
(MMRM), with change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM at Month 3 as 
response variable and treatment, time, treatment- by-time as fixed factors and corresponding 
baseline value as a covariate.  
7.2. Statistical Methodology  
All analyses will be performed within each of the 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication cohorts. The statistical and analytical plans presented below are 
brief summaries of planned analyses . More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP . Changes 
to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical 
study report. For information on study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by -treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment arm .  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of zilebesiran and 
have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received . 
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  68 For the analyses of the 6-month DB period, t he analysis  population used to evaluate efficacy will 
be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis 
Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
7.2.2. Examination of Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. Detailed methodology will be 
provided in the SAP. 
7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data 
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations 
Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized . 
In general, baseline will be defined as the average of all assessments, including unscheduled 
assessments, between Run-in Visit 2 and prior to the first dose of study drug. Details of the 
definition will be specified in the SAP.  
7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at  Month 3 in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM. The primary hypothesis of the add-on effect of zilebesiran compared to placebo in patients receiving each of 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide) will be tested separately at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.05 using MMRM. The MMRM model will include treatment, time, treatment-by- time, and 
race (black or all other races)  as fixed factors and baseline 24-hour mean SBP assessed by 
ABPM  and screening eGFR as covariates.  
The key secondary endpoints are: 
• Change from baseline at  Month 3 in office SBP  
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in 24-hour mean SBP , assessed 
by ABPM 
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in office SBP  
• Proportion of patients with 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM <130 mmHg 
and/or reduction ≥20 mmHg without escape antihypertensive medication at Month 6  
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key  secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order . 
Details of the analysis method for primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be 
described in the SAP.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  77 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Formula for Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Calculation  
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min/1.73m2) will be calculated from serum 
creatinine (SCr) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.  
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Formula  [Levey 2009] 
• Conventional units 
− eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × (SCr [mg/dL])-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
• SI units − eGFR (mL/min/1.73m
2) = 175 × (SCr [μmol/L]/88.4)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
10.2. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the ABPM Investigator Manual and the HBPM 
and OBPM Investigator Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
ABPM Investigator Manual. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than 
aspirin ≤100 mg per day) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided 
for at least 2 days prior to ABPM measurements. ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory 
state. ABPM recordings that are associated wi th dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the 
visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take

Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  78 readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by their side while 
the device is inflating for a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity  
assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid  if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained). If the ABPM recording is invalid  (either during the Run-in Period or after the second randomization), the 
patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the study within 7 days from  the end  time  of the 
invalid ABPM. During the Run-in period , if a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion 
criterion exceeds the 7 -day window prior to randomization, a single additional ABPM 
assessment is permitted, with no option for retesting in case of an invalid reading. Eligibility is assessed by the most recent ABPM result obtained. If a valid ABPM recording that meets the inclusion criterion  is not obtained within the 7 days prior to randomization, the patient is a run-in 
failure . 
Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by the Sponsor and the arm selected during screening. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medications, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by circadian changes, study visits should be scheduled for a consistent 
timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior 
to measuring blood pressure. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than 
aspirin ≤100 mg per day) use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at 
least 2 days prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last 30 minutes. If necessary, 
delay blood pressure assessment to meet these requirements. Because a full bladder can impact 
blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For
  seated measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
pat
ient’s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by palpation). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 2, 22 September 2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  79 • Follow the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual to initiate the automated blood 
pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a 5 -minute 
period of rest, followed by 4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1- minute 
intervals. The seated blood pressure for the visit will be defi ned by the average of the 
last 3 individual measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the patient should remain at rest without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The 
blood pressure device works best when you are at rest and without any distraction, so 
the staff will avoid interacting with you during this assessment. This assessment  will 
include a 5 -minute period of rest, followed by about 5 minutes of the device inflating 
to measure your blood pressure”. 
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed ar
m bent slightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Measure standing blood pressure 1 to 3 minute s after standing using the automated 
blood pressure device’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-
headedness when standing and record  their response. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute 
“remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel. If a home visit is not possible, a “remote visit blood pressure 
measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by appropriately trained study staff, following the 
instructions detailed in the HBPM and OBPM Investigator Manual. Results and the remote 
method used will be recorded . 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required on days when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1- minute intervals. The seated blood pressure for the 
visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM 3 times during the week prior to  the 
second  randomization.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week  and may be increased at the 
Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measurement is warranted . Patients may select the day 
of the week that is  most convenient for their personal schedule.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo -controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of zilebesiran administered  
subcutaneously ( SC) as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with a 
standard of care antihypertensive medication. A schematic of the study design is provided in 
Figure 1.  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized to receive open-label therapy with olmesartan (40 mg orally once 
daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the United S tates (US) , consistent with local labeling for olmesartan]), 
amlodipine (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks. 
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria after the Run -in period will be randomized 1:1 
to receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB  treatment period as 
add-on therapy to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication.  
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive 
medications”) may be added to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure. 
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran open -label 
extension ( OLE ) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the 
separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months 
for up to 12 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and then transition.  
Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period. 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with up to 2 antihypertensive medications. Patients should have a 24-hour mean systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) >130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
(ABPM ) after at least 4 weeks of run -in on protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication. Patients with secondary hypertension or orthostatic hypotension will be excluded. 
Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Zilebesiran is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) -conjugated small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Patients randomized to receive zilebesiran  will be administered 600 mg SC once during the 6-
month DB treatment period; all patients will receive 600 mg SC once every 6 months during the 
OLE  period.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo ( phosphate-buffered saline for SC administration) will be administered at the same 
dosing interval and volume as the study drug during the 6-month DB period. 
Protocol- specified Background Antihypertensive Medication, Dose, and Mode of 
Administration  
Patients will be randomized to 1 of the following protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications to be administered orally once daily during the Run-in and 6-month DB periods: 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg (or 20 mg for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US, consistent with local labeling). At the 
Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan 
once daily may initiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks. 
• Amlodipine: 5 mg  
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg  
Duration of Treatment and Study Participation 
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 18 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 20 months, including up to 2 months of the Screening and Run-in period s, and up to 18 months of treatment. F or all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB 
period. Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline 
blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening estimated glomerular 
filtration rate  (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
For the primary endpoint, assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2-sided significance level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add-
on to olmesartan; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo 
as add -on to indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the 
following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add-on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  8 • Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by-treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment arm.  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by-
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of 
zilebesiran and have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment. 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received.  
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit. 
For the analyses of the 6-month DB period, t he analysis  population used to evaluate efficacy will 
be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis 
Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order.

Notes:  
• When scheduled at the same time points and where feasible, the assessments of vital signs and blood sample collections should be performed before 
physical examinations and 12- lead ECGs.  
• Run-in Visit 2 should occur at least 4 weeks after Run- in Visit 1.  
• Patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study upon completion of the Month 6 predose assessments. If an individual patient 
reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open- label zilebesiran beginning at the Month 6 visit and continue for 
up to 12 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and then transition at Month 12 or 18 (first visit after the separate OLE study is open ). 
Patients who rollover at Month 6 should complete all assessments scheduled for the Month 6 visit except for study drug admini stration. Patients who 
rollover at Month 12 should complete the EOT visit instead of the assessments scheduled at Month 12.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug at any time during the study or do not enroll in the separate OLE study will be asked to perform Safety Follow -up 
visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if known) or 
12 months, whichever comes earlier. During this Follow -up period, HBPM monitoring may continue at the discretion of the Investigator. The ADA 
sample should only be collected at the first Follow -up visit during the Follow -up period.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/ET assessments should be performed.   
 Footnotes:  
a All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection (Table  2), are to be performed prior to administration of protocol -specified background 
antihypertensive medications (including Run- In Visit 1) and study drug (as applicable).   
b When applicable, pregnancy test results must be known prior to dosing with study drug at dosing visits.  
c Laboratory assessments at Day 1 do not need to be repeated, per Investigator discretion, if they were collected within 7 days  before Day 1 at Run -in Visit 2.  
d Office blood pressure must be measured before the patient takes oral antihypertensive medications or study drug (as applicabl e).  
e ABPM recordings associated with study drug dosing visits should be obtained within 7 days before the visit and results reviewed before dosing.  
f HBPM should be measured  at least 3 times during the  week prior to the second randomization  to establish baseline . After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at 
least once per week  in the morning upon waking and may be increased at the Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measurement is warranted. HBPM is not 
required at times when ABPM is being assessed. In the Safety Follow -up period, the frequency of HBPM assessments can be reduced after the first Safety 
Follow -up visit per Investigator judgement.  
g Neurological evaluation will also be performed as part of the full physical examination.  
h ABPM should only be performed as part of ET assessments if the patient discontinues the study prior to Month 12 and has not had an ABPM within the last 3 
months. ABPM should not be performed at Month 18.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  23 1. INTRODUCTION 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developing zilebesiran ( ALN- AGT01) , a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
ligand, which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. 
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -003 (KARDIA -2) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment 
with a standard of care antihypertensive medication. Patients will be randomized to run- in on 1 
of 3 protocol-specified antihypertensive medications open- label for at least 4 weeks (olmesartan, 
amlodipine, or indapamide). At the end of the Run-in period, patients with uncontrolled blood 
pressure will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo as add -on therapy to the 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication for 6 months during the double-blind 
(DB) period. After completion of the 6-month DB period, patients may be eligible to participate 
in a separate zilebesiran open -label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches 
Month 6 prior to availability of the OLE study, they may discontinue their protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication and receive open- label zilebesiran (600 mg once every 
6 months) for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean systolic blood 
pressure ( SBP), assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ), from baseline to 
Month 3, relative to placebo. Secondary and exploratory objectives of the study include 
evaluating the add -on efficacy of zilebesiran on other measures of blood pressure response 
(including longer treatment durations, eg, 6 months) and evaluating the PD effect of zilebesiran, including reduction in circulating AGT  concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapies achieve target blood pressure in only a minority of 
patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despite the 
availability of multiple efficacious agents, current rates of control are low, and the global burden

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains 
high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
and to overcome the limitations of current therapies is a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developing zilebesiran, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, 
for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of siRNA to its 
complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent 
suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. Z ilebesiran contains an siRNA 
targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc- containing ligand to facilitate delivery to the 
liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, zilebesiran is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 2017; Romero 2015] Because 
hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, zilebesiran has been developed to reduce blood pressure by decreasing circulating AGT levels and the downstream effects of angiotensin II (AngII).  
Zilebesiran is being studied in the ongoing Phase 1 Study ALN- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension as single ascending doses of 10 to 800 mg (Part A), as a single dose of 800 mg under low-salt or high-salt conditions (Part B), as 2 doses of 
800 mg administered every 3 months in obese patients (Part D), and as a single dose of 800 mg co-administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan (Part E). Preliminary data are available from 
Parts A, B, and E. Dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT were observed 
after single SC doses of zilebesiran, accompanied by clinically significant reductions in SBP and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Sustained reductions in serum AGT were observed for up to 6 months following a single dose of zilebesiran.  
Most adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium. No patient has required 
intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevations have been observed in patients who received zilebesiran doses as high as 800 mg. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minority of patients and were all mild and transient events that resolved without intervention. 
Because most patients with hypertension eventually progress to require treatment with more than 
1 antihypertensive class, [Williams 2018 ] it is anticipate d that zilebesiran may be used together 
with other standard of care antihypertensive medication. This Phase 2 study will further quantify the antihypertensive effects of zilebesiran as add -on therapy in patients with hypertension not 
adequately controlled by a standard of care antihypertensive medication. The consistent and 
durable PD effect of zilebesiran  is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour 
blood pressure lowering with infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of zilebesiran is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study 001 indicate that zilebesiran may offer the benefit of sustained  
blood pressure reduction to patients with hypertension with infrequent administration (ie, once 
every 3 months or once every 6 months). The mean SBP reduction observed after single zilebesiran doses of 100 mg or higher exceeds 10 mmHg, which is comparable to the effect of 
conventional antihypertensives.[ Abraham 2015; Materson 1993] The blood pressure of patients 
will be closely monitored, and after Month 3, escape antihypertensive medications will be added 
as needed to control blood pressure. 
Given the mechanism of action and mode of administration of zilebesiran, potential theoretical 
risks include liver transaminase elevations and ISRs. Like any antihypertensive therapy, there is also a theoretical risk of hypotension with zilebesiran. Based upon the disease population, there 
is also a risk of blood pressure elevation. Because eligible patients have mild to moderate 
primary hypertension, the likelihood of disease progression during the course of the study is low. This study has exclusion criteria intended to minimize these risks, as well as frequent monitoring 
for laboratory and blood pressure abnormalities. Furthermore, the duration of the placebo period 
is limited, and escape antihypertensive medications are permitted to manage uncontrolled blood pressure following 3 months of add- on treatment with zilebesiran.  Detailed guidance is provided 
to Investigators for potential liver transaminase elevations (Section  5.2.4), hypotension 
(Section  5.8.1), hypertension (Section 5.8.2), renal dysfunction ( Section  5.8.3), and 
hyperkalemia (Section  5.8.4). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
and ensure the safety of study participants (see Section 3.6).  
Based on available data from Study 001, zilebesiran has an acceptable safety profile in patients 
with hypertension as a monotherapy or with the addition of conventional antihypertensives in 
patients who were inadequately controlled on zilebesiran alone. This experience supports that the 
theoretical risks of treatment are low and can be managed through the proposed monitoring and safety mitigations.  In addition to study drug, each  patient  will receive a protocol -specified 
background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide). These agents are approved standard medications that will be dosed in accordance with local  labeling. 
While zilebesiran is designed to inhibit the RAAS, its site of action (AGT)  in the RAAS is 
unique, and its tissue specificity for the liver is  hypothesized to improve its renal safety profile 
relative to conventional RAAS blockade,[ Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] both in the context of 
monotherapy and when used together with a conventional RAAS blocker such as olmesartan. In 
the latter setting, zilebesiran is hypothesized to add antihypertensive benefit when added to a 
conventional RAAS blocker without the increased incidence of RAAS inhibitor- associated renal 
adverse effects that have been observed in prior trials of conventional dual RAAS 
blockade.[ Makani 2013] Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 
<45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300mg/g will be exclusively assigned to the 
olmesartan cohort to ensure that patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease or diabetes continue the RAAS inhibition standardly recommended for their renal indication throughout the 
study. 
This study’s monitoring plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of 
conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012]. The risk of renal safety events 
is further mitigated in this study by its eligibility criteria, which exclude patients who are at

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 Run-in Period  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized  as described in Section 3.4 to receive open -label therapy with 
olmesartan  (40 mg orally once daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine 
clearance ≤ 60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US , consistent with local labeling for 
olmesartan] ), amlodipine  (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as 
their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at 
least 4 weeks . Prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) will be discontinued upon the start 
of this Run-in period (Run-i n Visit 1).  
Patients who do not tolerate run- in treatment or who do not meet eligibility for randomization at 
Day 1  will be withdrawn from the study and returned to their prior medication regimen in 
coordination with their usual health providers.  
DB Period  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive 600 mg 
zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB period as add -on therapy to their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or 
indapamide). Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or  all other races) , 
baseline blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or 
≥60 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive 
medications”) may be added  to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication  per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure as described in Table 4.  
OLE Period  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. 
If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may 
receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 12 additional months 
until the separate OLE study is open and then transition. Once the separate OLE study is open for 
enrollment, eligible patients may rollover into th at OLE study at Month 6, 12, or 18 ( first visit 
after the separate OLE study is open ). 
During the OLE period of this study, Investigators will use escape antihypertensive medications  
as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure 
monitoring. 
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients who discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the separate zilebesiran OLE study will 
be asked to complete Safety Follow-up visits once every 6 months after their last dose of study 
drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if known) or 12 months, whichever comes earlier. 
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the 
remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration)

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment 
(EOT)/ early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study, and an independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee will review  suspected  renal events to 
adjudicate whether they meet criteria for acute kidney injury.  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the Run-in period and approximately  630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period.  
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 18 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 20 months, including 
up to 2 months of the Screening and Run-in period s, and  up to 18 months of treatment. For all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months. 
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with 
hypertension despite treatment with a standard of care antihypertensive medication.  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM, from baseline to Month 3, relative to placebo. 
Patients with hypertension often require treatment with multiple antihypertensive drugs to reach 
target blood pressure,[ Williams 2018 ] and it is anticipated that zilebesiran may be administered 
to individuals on a background of other antihypertensive medications. Therefore, this study evaluates the effects of zilebesiran relative to placebo in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled despite treatment with 1 of the 3 major drug classes recommended for 
initial treatment of hypertension  by all clinical guidelines: RAAS inhibitors (ie, angiotensin 
converting enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitors, angiotensin II- receptor blockers , or a direct renin 
inhibitor), diuretics, and calcium channel blocke rs (CCBs). [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] 
Studying coadministration with olmesartan will assess if the synergistic antihypertensive effects 
recently observed in rodents treated with both an ARB and an AGT- targeting GalNAc -siRNA 
will translate into clinically significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients given 
zilebesiran as an add -on to conventional RAAS inhibition.[ Uijl 2019] In addition, it will examine 
the safety and  tolerability of liver -specific AGT targeting during treatment with a conventional 
RAAS blocker (olmesartan). The newer -generation ARB olmesartan was selected because of its 
high potency relative to early-generation RAAS inhibitors,[ Ojima 2011; White 2011] enabling a 
robust test for added efficacy when combined with zilebesiran. The maximum dose of 
olmesartan permitted per local  labeling will be used to further increase the rigor of this efficacy 
evaluation. The thiazide- like diuretic indapamide was selected in accordance with recent 
guidelines that highlight the greater potency and durability of thiazide-like diuretics over other diuretics. [Burnier 2019] The long-acting dihydropyridine CCB amlodipine was selected given its 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 extensive use in clinical practice and randomized controlled trials. [Dahlof 2005; Jamerson 2008; 
Julius 2004]  
During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both automated office blood pressure 
measurements and outpatient 24-hour ABPM (EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on 
Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). In 
addition to having greater precision, ABPM can assess short-term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dipping 
pattern that is lost in 24% to 35% of hypertensive patients). More frequent (at least once per 
week) measurements will be collected through a third method, oscillometric home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic.  
As recommended by current guidance (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the 6-month DB period is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. To adhere to best 
ethical standards for the treatment of patients with hypertension, the use of oral antihypertensive 
medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood pressure within target is permitted 
starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the remainder of the study (see Table 4). The 
term “escape antihypertensive medication” is used to refer to any oral antihypertensive 
medication initiated to control blood pressure after Day 1. Separate from these treat -to-target 
modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or 
office DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated with escape antihypertensive medication 
regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration. 
If a patient requires treatment with an oral escape antihypertensive medication before Month 6, a 
CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic (whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication) should be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS.  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol- specified background antihypertensive medication 
(olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to 
participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to 
availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC 
once every 6 months for up to 12 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and 
then transition. Because many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, 
office blood pressure and serum chemistries will be monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 
9.  
During the OLE  period, Investigators may use escape antihypertensive medications  of permitted 
classes  as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure 
monitoring and following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Olmesartan, 
amlodipine, and indapamide will be discontinued as p rotocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication during the OLE period; however, patients may continue to receive 
amlodipine or indapamide as escape antihypertensive medication  at the Investigator’s discretion . 
The use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for high blood pressure should be avoided throughout the study.

relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012].  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The dose of zilebesiran in this study (600 mg once every 6 months) was selected on the basis of data from the Phase 1 Study 001, in which single zilebesiran doses up to 800 mg were found to have an acceptable safety profile, and dose-dependent, clinically significant placebo -corrected 
reductions in mean SBP >10 mmHg by 24- hour ABPM were observed at doses as low as 
100 mg. An acceptable safety profile was also observed for a single zilebesiran dose of 800 mg under low- salt/high -salt conditions or co -administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan once 
daily . The selected dose of 600 mg is predicted to result in a median serum AGT reduction of 
94.9% at trough (Month 6), translating to a median SBP reduction of 11.6 mmHg as monotherapy. 
The protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications are standard agents 
recommended in international and regional hypertension guidelines, and the selected regimens are standard doses used for their approved indication of hypertension.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] Indapamide will be dosed at 2.5 mg orally once daily, and amlodipine will be dosed at 5 mg orally once daily. The dose regimens for indapamide and amlodipine used in this study were selected on the basis of their common use in clinical care (when used both individually and 
combined with other classes of antihypertensives) and their expected efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. Olmesartan will be dosed at the maximum dose allowed per local  labeling: 40 mg 
orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min 
enrolled at sites outside of the US ; Olmetec Product Information, September 2020).[ von 
Bergmann 2001] 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. After the patient signs the informed consent form ( ICF) and before 
proceeding with screening procedures, the Investigator or designee should contact the Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) to obtain a patient identification number. 
The Investigator or designee will contact the IRT to randomize the patient at Run-in Visit 1 and 
again at Day 1 after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at each visit.  
At Run -in Visit 1, patients with screening eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine 
≥300mg/g will be assigned to receive olmesartan. To avoid over -enrollment, patients with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300mg/g will be excluded from the study after 
100 such patients are randomized to study drug on Day 1.  
All other patients will be randomized  10:7:4 to run-in open- label on 1 of 3 protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide), with targeted 
sample sizes across cohorts as described in Section  7.1. If 1 cohort completes enrollment first, 
this cohort will be deactivated for future randomization. The remaining 2 cohorts will be 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 randomized using the original ratio. After the second cohort completes enrollment, all 
subsequent patients will be assigned to the last cohort.  
At Day 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo  as an add -on to  their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication using the IRT. Randomization at 
Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline blood pressure (24 -hour mean 
SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or ≥60 m L/min/1.73m2). 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel and patients will be blinded to study drug treatment through Month 3 of the 6-month DB period. After the database lock to support the analysis of the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3 is complete, Sponsor staff members who will not have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  will be unblinded to 
the analysis results according to the prespecified blinding plan. Site personnel, patients, and Sponsor staff members who have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  
will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after the analysis of Month 6 data is complete.  
All Sponsor and site personnel and patients will be blinded to any clinical laboratory result that could potentially unblind them (eg, AGT levels) until unblinding. 
Zilebesiran and placebo will be packaged identically. Because zilebesiran may be slightly  
visually distinguishable from placebo, the vials will be masked in such a way as to hide the 
identity of the study drug contained within. For administration, syringes will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate prior to withdrawing the study drug from vial. See the Pharmacy Manual 
for additional details.  The study drug will be administered under the supervision of the 
Investigator (see Section  5.2.2).  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact the Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within 1 working day after 
the unblinding event. Unblinding information should be limited to the fewest number of people 
on a need -to-know basis . A record of when the blind was broken, who was unblinded, who broke 
the blind, and why it was broken, will be maintained in the electronic trial master file ( eTMF).  
Refer to the IRT instructions for details on unblinding. 
3.6. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study. The DMC will operate under the rules of a charter that will be reviewed and approved at the organizational meeting of the DMC. Details are provided in the DMC Charter. 
3.7. Clinical Event Adjudication Committees  
An independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee of 2 or more nephrologists will review the suspected renal events blinded to treatment assignment to adjudicate whether they meet

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stopping of the patient’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stopping of a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.9.1) per Investigator discretion  
• AE 
• Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  37 • Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by the Sponsor 
If possible, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section  6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience is captured in the final analyses .  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient has an AE, including SAEs, and/or laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the patient’s  overall status, requires interruption or 
discontinuation from treatment with study drug, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be 
recorded in the eCRF . Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive 
treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6-month DB period (defined as the time the 
first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 6 
assessments) will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (excluding pharmacokinetic [ PK] assessments) through Month 6. They will also be asked to complete S afety 
Follow-up visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) until PD recovery  or 12 months (whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug during the OLE period will be asked to return for their next 
scheduled visit to complete EOT/ ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-up visits once 
every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months (whichever is earlier) ; see Section  3.1. 
4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation  
4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time . A patient or 
legal guardian considering stopping participation in the study before Month 6 should be

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit and comple te 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient or legal guardian consents. If a patient or legal guardian still 
chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation in all follow-up prior to the completion of the 6-month DB period, every effort should be made to conduct the Month 6 visit assessments at an earlier time (see Table 1 ). 
A patient considering stopping participation in the study during the OLE period should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT/ET visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal 
assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator 
is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data 
collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process the patient’s  personal data (see 
Section  4.3.2.2), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included 
after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law.  
4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the Investigator at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . Also, where allowed by local 
law, the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of the patient’s  personal data, 
informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . In both cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information 
(including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time 
of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as 
applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this 
is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow-up even if study drug is discontinued. 
Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient or legal guardian and reschedule the 
missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient or legal guardian on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient or legal guardian wishes [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient or legal guardian (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after the second randomization at Day 1 .  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied by the Sponsor for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must 
not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication that have been dispensed and returned unused must not 
be re-dispensed.

5.2.2. Dose and Administration 
During the 6-month DB period, patients will be administered  a single dose of 600 mg zilebesiran 
or placebo, at the same volume, as SC injection  on Day 1. Patients who enter  the OLE period 
will receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC  at Month 6 after all predose assessments are conducted and  
once every 6 months during the OLE period. 
Study drug injections will be administered by qualified clinical study center staff under the 
supervision of the Investigator or designee. The injection site may be marked and mapped for 
later observation . Injections may be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the side or back of 
the upper arms. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. 
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
To maintain the blind, the syringes are to be masked by the site pharmacist or designee prior to 
study drug withdrawal from the vial. A full description of the blinding procedure is included in the Pharmacy Manual.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of study drug within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered up to 85 days before the next scheduled dose. Thereafter, the dose will be considered missed and not administered. 
If a patient misses a dose of study drug, the Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor 
whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see also Section  4.3).  
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  The definition of study drug overdose, follow-up procedures, and reporting requirements are 
provided Section  6.5.6.8. 
5.2.3. Dose Modifications

• If ALT or AST rises to >5×ULN following resumption of dosing, 
permanently discontinue dosing 
>8×ULN  Permanently discontinue study drug dosing after confirmation of the transaminase value at the central laboratory.  
Abbreviations: ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; LFT=liver function test(s); 
ULN=upper limit of normal.  
Notes: In addition to these criteria, other assessments or evaluations may be performed per Investigator 
discretion, as appropriate.  
5.2.5. Neurological Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring, and Stopping Study Drug 
Dosing  
Clinically significant events that may be consistent with potential decreased proprioception 
(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by the 
Medical Monitor. 
5.3. Protocol -specified Background Antihypertensive Medications  
All patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 following standard of care oral 
antihypertensive medications during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks and will continue this 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication through Month 6. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications will be supplied by the Sponsor. 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with 
creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US, consistent with local labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan once daily may initiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and 
then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks (in this case, the 
patient must take the full olmesartan dose of 40 mg once daily for at least 4 weeks prior to reassessment at Run -in Visit 2).  
• Amlodipine: 5 mg orally once daily 
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg orally once daily 
Protocol-specified antihypertensive medications may be downtitrated or temporarily 
discontinued per Investigator judgement for low blood pressure (see Section 5.8.1).  At the 
Investigator’s discretion, oral antihypertensive agents, including protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, may be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume 
depletion. Additional information on the protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications, including side effects, drug-drug interactions, and other important prescribing information can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for prepar ing zilebesiran or placebo doses  
and dispensing protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the safe handling of study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication are required.  
Study drug will be stored at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose preparation. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication will be stored according to the storage instructions on 
the label. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the 
Sponsor and use of the affected study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication  halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or 
designee, as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication and additional storage will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.5. Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug and protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice 
specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication labels and external packaging will include all 
appropriate information as per local labeling requirements. Additional details will be available in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 5.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied for this 
study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept of when and how much study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication is dispensed 
and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol 
dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs and 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. Used, partially used, and unused 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.7. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.7.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at 
which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typically 
nonmedical in nature; however, it is possible that study drug complaints could be associated with 
an AE . Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, missing clinical 
label, damaged vial , empty vial , and contamination of study drug. 
5.7.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using the process outlined in the Pharmacy Manual. CPCs that may be associated with an AE must be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.8. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.8.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored weekly  with HBPM to ensure 
the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Patients who experience l ow blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should 
promptly seek medical evaluation at the clinical study site or another hospital setting. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of 
orthostatic blood pressure (supine to standing).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or interruption of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg).  Oral antihypertensives 
should be downtitrated/interrupted in reverse order to how they were added (ie, interrupt escape antihypertensive medications before protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general 
medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by the 
Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to 
facilitate this physician -to-physician communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) should be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement as outlined above.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and laboratory  monitoring (serum electrolytes and 
creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as 
fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.8.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
office blood pressure. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure.  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg  
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Until double- blind data are generated that demonstrate acceptable safety 
and added antihypertensive efficacy of zilebesiran when combined with olmesartan, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE 
inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout the study.  
• If added, escap
 e antihypertensives must be used per their labeled 
instructions and in accordance with current clinical  guidelines. [Whelton 
2018; Wi
lliams 2018 ] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of zilebesiran , interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by hypertensive 
symptoms should be evaluated by the clinical study site. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospital setting within 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically 
significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide- like diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified background 
antihypertensive medication) as an escape antihypertensive medication .  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like  diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already a protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication) : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic may  be added as 
an escape antihypertensive medication if the daytime mean SBP is 
≥135 mmHg by ABPM. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling 
clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, other escape antihypertensive medications may also be 
added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in SBP  above 
recommended target  per treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135  mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 
mmHg) .[Williams 2018] 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 Study Period  Intervention  
Month 6 to End of 
Study (OLE period)  Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued .  
• Patients  who continue into the OLE period will initiate open -label treatment 
with 600 mg zilebesiran once every 6 months. As many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and serum 
chemistries will be carefully monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 9, and Investigators will be prepared to downtitrate or interrupt  escape
 
antihypertensive medications  if low blood pressure develops (see 
Section  5.8.1).  
• If the Month 6 ABPM is in target (daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg), escape 
antihypertensive medication s (if taken)  may be downtitrated or interrupted 
per Investigator judgement to determine if the patient’s blood pressure 
remains within target on zilebesiran treatment alone.  
• During the OLE period, oral antihypertensive medications may be added 
per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above recommended target  per treatment guidelines ( eg, office SBP <140 mmHg, 
HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 
mmHg) .[Whelton 2018 ; Williams 2018 ]

5.8.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial zilebesiran PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
the Sponsor, and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypovolemia 
− Hypotension 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeats tests, look

discuss the potential interruption of study drug and/or oral antihypertensives. Serum 
creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.8.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of zilebesiran PD). The guidelines in Table 5 apply for potassium elevations detected by laboratory monitoring.[ McMurray 2016; 
Parving 2012] 
Table 5: Recommended Interventions for Hyperkalemia  
Serum K+ ≥5.2 and <5.5 mmol/L  Serum K+ ≥5.5 and <6.0 mmol/L  Serum K+ ≥6.0 mmol/L  
• Confirm potassium 
concentration in a non-
hemolyzed sample.  
• Reinforce low- potassium diet 
and restriction of food/drinks 
with high potassium content  
• Review medical regimen 
(including dietary supplements and over-the-counter 
medications) for agents known to cause hyperkalemia.

levels to ensure stability ( at 
least weekly if in the first 6 
weeks of treatment or at least 
once monthly afterwards)  • Confirm potassium 
concentration in a non-
hemolyzed sample  
• Consider interruption of open-
label olmesartan (in patients randomized to receive it as their 
protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication) 
according to Investigator medical judgement  
• Consider interruption or delay  
of study drug administration , 
according to Investigator medical judgment  
• Apply all measures outlined for

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 The availability of patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS -9) will be assessed at 
participating study sites. These potassium-binding drugs are indicated  for the treatment of 
hyperkalemia and have been shown to safely reduce serum potassium levels and to maintain 
long-term normokalemia in chronic kidney disease patients receiving background conventional RAAS inhibitor therapy.[ Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] 
5.9. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s e CRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals . Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the e CRF.  
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted . However, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated . For other permitted 
concomitant medications administered SC , do not administer in same injection site area as the 
study drug for at least 4 days after each  dose of study drug. 
Patients receiving low -dose aspirin (defined as ≤100 mg per day) for at least 30 days prior to 
screening and during the study treatment period are allowed. Occasional use of other systemic  
over-the-counter NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased blood 
pressure, they should be avoided when possible and for at least 2 days prior to ABPM and office 
blood pressure assessments, and alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing of systemic NSAIDs should be at the 
lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration possible.  
Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) should 
be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening and during the study treatment period. 
These medications should not be initiated or discontinued, if possible, during the study treatment 
period. 
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by local or regional regulatory authorities. 
Use of cannabis or delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) -containing substances (including by 
smoking, vaping, dabbing, or ingesting/edibles) should be avoided when possible and for at least 
2 day s prior to ABPM and office blood pressure assessments. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the Investigator, except as described in Section 5.9.1 and after consulting the Pharmacy Manual, 
which contains information on drug-drug interactions and other important prescribing 
information for the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded 
on the e CRF . Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and 
accepted coding dictionary. 
5.9.1. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
treatment period (until the EOT visit): 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  50 • Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors), 
except for  olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication  
during the 6-month DB period  
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than zilebesiran)  
• Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities 
or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics (eg, clozapine, olanzapine), diet pills (eg, 
phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine 
hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by both the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium supplements, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, trimethoprim and trimethoprim-containing combination products, mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists, Noni juice, alfalfa, dandelion, horsetail, nettle, milkweed, lily of the 
valley, Siberian ginseng, and hawthorn berries. 
All concomitant medications must be reviewed and approved by the Investigator, with particular attention to avoiding drugs that may affect blood pressure. 
5.10. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study staff. Compliance with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be assessed through pill count by study staff. 
5.11. Other Requirements  
5.11.1. Contraception  
Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of 
contraception from 14 days before the first dose  of protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1). 
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 • Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or 
transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient . Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1) 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal 
range.  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by males of contraception 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section  6.5.5.3). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see 
Section  6.5.5.3).  
5.11.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of 
spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by the Investigator throughout the course of the study. 
5.11.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including, but not limited to , snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 
minutes prior to office blood pressure measurements.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 5.11.4. Dietary Recommendations  
All patients will receive educational materials on diet with recommendations to limit sodium 
consumption to approximately 2.0 g per day from screening through the end of the Treatment 
period. This direction should be provided at the start of the Screening period, and treatment-naïve patients should follow these recommendations for at least 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. This is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European 
Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  6.5.5.1).  
5.11.5. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood collection for 
clinical laboratory tests  and from any exercise for 30 minutes prior to office blood pressure 
measurements . 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 . Study visits should be scheduled for 
the morning. All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection, are to be performed 
prior to dosing with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug. Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Manual s. 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine samples and  measurement of vital 
signs (at the discretion and oversight of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC must be signed (in paper or 
electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards)  by the patient or legal 
guardian before the s creening procedures are initiated . All patients or their legal guardians will 
be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria . Rescreening of patients once is permitted with agreement  of the Medical 
Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Run- in Visit 1  will be updated 
prior to administration  of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  53 6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening or Run -in laboratory abnormalities are likely to 
be transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale must be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during s creening  and once during the Run-
in period provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the 
allowed Screening  and Run- in periods. Retesting of ABPM at Run -in Visit 2  is permitted once , 
with eligibility assessed by the  second ABPM result. 
6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return  once for rescreening  following agreement with the Medical Monitor. A patient will be re -
consented  if rescreening occurs outside of the Screening period. In this case, all screening 
procedures must be repeated.  Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria after Run -in Visit 1 
will not be rescreened.  
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken at the times  
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) using the standardized equipment provided 
by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in Section 10.2. Office b lood pressure 
assessments and ABPM initiation  must be performed before administration of  any oral 
antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable) . 
Patients taking oral antihypertensives prior to screening should discontinue these medications at Run- in Visit 1 . The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure measured at Run -in Visit 2  must 
be taken within 7 days before Day 1 . An HBPM unit will be provided before Run- in Visit 2  to 
establish the HBPM baseline , and HBPM should be collected at least 3 times during  the last  
week prior to Day 1. 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by appropriately trained individuals, as detailed in 
the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely using the methods described in Section 10.2. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.8.1 and Section  5.8.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
The ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of oral antihypertensive medication. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per day) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days prior to 
ABPM measurements.   
Validity  will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is invalid at any point during 
the study, the patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the recording . During the Run-in 
period , if the second ABPM recording is also invalid, the patient is a run -in failure.

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 See further details in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual. 
6.2.2. Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured  in triplicate  using the automated blood pressure device 
provided by the Sponsor at trough (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and should be at 
approximately the same time  of day for each assessment ; therefore, visits should be scheduled at 
approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure.  Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg per 
day) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days 
prior to blood pressure measurements. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual.  
6.2.3. HBPM  
The HBPM should be measured in the morning upon waking, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral antihypertensive medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM 
is being assessed. The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet 
flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). In addition, blood samples for determination of RAAS biomarkers 
(plasma renin concentration, AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected only for patients 
randomized to receive olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication. 
Blood samples for PD assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical  laboratory by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. B iomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shipping, and storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of zilebesiran or guide clinical management and will not 
be shared with sites until after study unblinding. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and its primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  55 Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for 
PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shipping, 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination will be  recorded.  
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are to be collected prior to administration of oral antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable). When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be 
performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured in 
the seated position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 10 minutes. Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart 
rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will 
be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height , and Morphometrics  
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at Day 1  only. 
Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the 
first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the 
midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin  and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the 
level of the waist circumference, which can then be measured by positioning the measuring tape 
over the elastic tape. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of 
the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A

Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant 100 g of tension is recommended. Measurements 
should be obtained with the tape positioned parallel to the floor and performed using the same 
procedure throughout the study. 
The reading is taken to the nearest centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the 
average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a study drug dosing visit, it 
should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of 
the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological evaluation  (see the Study Manual for further details on the assessments to be 
performed as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of changes in symptoms, 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
according to the Study Manual during all symptom-directed physical examinations regardless of whether neurological symptoms have been experienced by the patient.  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval , and Fridericia -corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supine for at least 10 
minutes before each ECG is obtained. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all single 12- lead ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to 
determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same visit, blood sample collection should 
occur first. ECGs should be performed at least 30 minutes after phlebotomy or other stressful 
assessments.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have 
changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  5.2.4. For any other unexplained 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test 
should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the 
clinical situation may be requested. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6  and will 
be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in  Table 6  that are performed at the clinic 
should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. In patients randomized to receive olmesartan as the protocol -
specified background antihypertensive medication, blood samples for RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after blood pressure measurements and before any assessments collected in the supine position). Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected after the completion of blood pressure assessments. 
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and 
consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the clinical database.

density lipoprotein [HDL-C], non- HDL -C, low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and 
triglycerides), and HbA1c will be collected at the time points listed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection for 
fasting glucose, insulin, lipid panel, and HbA1c. Samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day (±2 hours). 
6.5.5.2. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate anti -drug antibodies (ADA). Blood samples for ADA 
testing must be collected before study drug administration (on days when study drug is to be 
dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing (on other days) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). A blood sample to evaluate ADA will be 
collected at the ET visit, if applicable. Blood samples for ADA will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical  laboratory. 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5.5.3. Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy 
testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, 
subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients who become 
pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see 
Section  6.5.6.7 for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see 
Section  5.11.1 for definition of postmenopausal state). 
6.5.5.4. Additional Liver Function Assessments  
Additional laboratory assessments will be performed in patients who experience any LFT 
abnormalities as outlined in Section  5.2.4. Following the occurrence of elevated liver 
transaminases or other LFT abnormalities per central laboratory, all assessments in Table 7  will 
be performed 1 time, as well as hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation assessments 
from  Table 6 , and other assessments or evaluations per Investigator discretion, as appropriate.

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
6.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of F ederal Regulations 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  61 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred . It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of zilebesiran . 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection . “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  6.5.6.2 and 
Section  6.5.6.3, respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, 
shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
OR death related to an adverse event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity . Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
Adverse event  severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
The relationship of each AE to the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication 
should also be assessed by the Investigator. 
6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should 
also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, 
or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the-counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study treatment during the Run-in period 
regardless of their relationship to the study treatment through the end of study. Study treatment is 
defined as protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug (zilebesiran 
or placebo).  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Events occurring after 
signing of the ICF and before the Run-in period will be captured as medical history (see 
Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study treatment , and baseline events that worsen after 
study treatment , must be recorded as AEs . 
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study 
treatment  through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until 
baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the 
patient is stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be related . Each AE must be described in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study treatment, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed . Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected . Refer to eCRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom[s] , injection site location, follow -up actions taken). 
6.5.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
6.5.6.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  6.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of 
the event . All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study treatment . 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study treatment , and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Within 24 hours of 
receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and, as applicable, the 
SAE form . SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using the Investigator’s  best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE . These measures and the patient’s response to these measures 
should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment , will be followed by 
the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable . Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  64 system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the 
study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements . Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow -up (see Section  3.1), 
the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being 
notified of the pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form . The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy, the possible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  6.5.6.4. 
6.5.6.8. Reporting of Overdose and Other Special Situations  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by the participant that is >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, or 
CPC associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor within 24 hours using the contact 
information in the Pharmacy Manual

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  65 6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further elucidate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of zilebesiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ). These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Potential exploratory 
investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety. 
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety 
laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its 
designees.  
When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and study unblinding for the analysis  of the primary endpoints and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3. The plan 
will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 630 patients will be randomized to receive either zilebesiran or placebo with sample sizes in each of the patient cohorts with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication as follows:  
• Olmesartan cohort: 300 patients  
• Amlodipine cohort: 210 patients 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  66 • Indapamide cohort: 120 patients 
Assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP 
assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2- sided significance 
level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to olmesartan; 
zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to 
indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add -on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The power is assessed by  simulation based on the Mixed Model with R epeated M easurements 
(MMRM), with change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM at Month 3 as 
response variable and treatment, time, treatment- by-time as fixed factors and corresponding 
baseline value as a covariate.  
7.2. Statistical Methodology  
All analyses will be performed within each of the 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication cohorts. The statistical and analytical plans presented below are 
brief summaries of planned analyses . More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP . Changes 
to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical 
study report. For information on study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by -treatment analyses based on the FAS will be grouped according to the 
randomized treatment arm .  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the Safety Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of zilebesiran and 
have at least 1 nonmissing postdose PK assessment . 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug. All by -
treatment analyses based on the PD Analysis Set  will be grouped according to the 
treatment actually received . 
• All Zilebesiran Treated Set : All patients who received any amount of zilebesiran, 
including patients who took zilebesiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who initially took placebo and then switched to zilebesiran after the Month 6 visit.

be the FAS. Safety data will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis 
Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.  
The All Zilebesiran Treated Set will be used to summarize the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran 
throughout the 6-month DB period and the OLE period. 
7.2.2. Examination of Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. Detailed methodology will be 
provided in the SAP. 
7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data 
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations 
Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized . 
In general, baseline will be defined as the average of all assessments, including unscheduled 
assessments, between Run-in Visit 2 and prior to the first dose of study drug. Details of the 
definition will be specified in the SAP.  
7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at  Month 3 in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM. The primary hypothesis of the add-on effect of zilebesiran compared to placebo in patients receiving each of 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide) will be tested separately at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.05 using MMRM. The MMRM model will include treatment, time, treatment-by- time, and 
race (black or all other races)  as fixed factors and baseline 24-hour mean SBP assessed by 
ABPM  and screening eGFR as covariates.  
The key secondary endpoints are: 
• Change from baseline at  Month 3 in office SBP  
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in 24-hour mean SBP , assessed 
by ABPM 
• Time -adjusted change from baseline through Month 6 in office SBP  
• Proportion of patients with 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM <130 mmHg 
and/or reduction ≥20 mmHg without escape antihypertensive medication at Month 6  
To control the overall type I error, the primary and key  secondary endpoints will be tested in 
hierarchical order . 
Details of the analysis method for primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be 
described in the SAP.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  76 10. APPENDICES  
10.1. Formula for Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Calculation  
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min/1.73m2) will be calculated from serum 
creatinine (SCr) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.  
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Formula  [Levey 2009] 
• Conventional units 
− eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × (SCr [mg/dL])-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
• SI units − eGFR (mL/min/1.73m
2) = 175 × (SCr [μmol/L]/88.4)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
10.2. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriately sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs (other than aspirin ≤100 mg 
per day ) and use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at least 2 days 
prior to ABPM measurements. ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state. 
ABPM recordings that are associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit (within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  77 readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the 
night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by their side while 
the device is inflating for a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with validity  
assessment. An ABPM will be considered valid  if (1) the number of successful daytime readings 
is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were obtained). If the ABPM recording is invalid  (either during the Run-in Period or after the second randomization), the 
patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the study within 4 days. If the second ABPM recording is also invalid  during screening, the patient is a run -in failure.  
Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by the Sponsor and the arm selected during screening. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit prior to the morning dose of 
antihypertensive medications, before phlebotomy or other potentially stressful assessments. To 
minimize confounding by circadian changes, study visits should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 
hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 
inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the- counter NSAIDs (other than 
aspirin ≤100 mg per day) use of cannabis or THC -containing substances should be avoided for at 
least 2 days prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or 
nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, 
cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) within the last 30 minutes. If necessary, 
delay blood pressure assessment to meet these requirements. Because a full bladder can impact blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For
  seated measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
pat
ient’s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by palpation). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated 
measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 
4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1-minute intervals. The seated blood pressure for the visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Amendment 1, 22 March  2022  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  78 • During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the patient should remain at rest 
without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The blood pressure device works best when you are at rest and without any distraction, so 
the staff will avoid interacting with you during this assessment. This assessment  will 
include a 5 -minute period of rest, followed by about 5 minutes of the device inflating 
to measure your blood pressure”. 
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed 
ar
m bent slightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing using the automated blood pressure device’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and record  their response. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other 
appropriately trained personnel. If a home visit is not possible, a “remote visit blood pressure 
measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by appropriately trained study staff, following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used will be recorded . 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning 
oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure 
program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 4 
sequential blood pressure measurements at 1-minute intervals. The seated blood pressure for the visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient should measure HBPM 3 times during the week prior to  the 
second  randomization.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least once per week  and may be increased at the 
Investigator’s discretion if more frequent measurement is warranted . Patients may select the day 
of the week that is  most convenient for their personal schedule.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo -controlled, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of zilebesiran administered  
subcutaneously ( SC) as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with a 
standard of care antihypertensive medication. A schematic of the study design is provided in 
Figure 1.  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized to receive open-label therapy with olmesartan (40 mg orally once 
daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the United S tates (US) , consistent with local labeling for olmesartan]), 
amlodipine (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks. 
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria after the Run -in period will be randomized 1:1 
to receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB  treatment period as 
add-on therapy to their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication.  
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive 
medications”) may be added to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure. 
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran open -label 
extension ( OLE ) study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the 
separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months 
for up to 12 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and then transition.  
Number of Planned Patients  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period. 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
This study will include adults (18 to 75 years, inclusive) with untreated hypertension or on stable 
therapy with up to 2 antihypertensive medications of the following classes: an angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II-receptor blocker, renin inhibitor, calcium channel 
blocker, thiazide diuretic, and/or thiazide-like diuretic. Patients should have a 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) >130 mmHg and ≤160 mmHg by ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring ( ABPM ) after at least 4 weeks of run -in on protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication. Patients with secondary hypertension or orthostatic hypotension 
will be excluded. 
Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
Zilebesiran is a n SC administered N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) -conjugated small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) targeting liver -expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for angiotensinogen (AGT). 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 Patients randomized to receive zilebesiran  will be administered 600 mg SC once during the 6-
month DB treatment period; all patients will receive 600 mg SC once every 6 months during the 
OLE  period. 
Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Placebo ( phosphate-buffered saline for SC administration) will be administered at the same 
dosing interval and volume as the study drug during the 6-month DB period. 
Protocol- specified Background Antihypertensive Medication, Dose, and Mode of 
Administration  
Patients will be randomized to 1 of the following protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medications to be administered orally once daily during the Run-in and 6-month DB periods: 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg (or 20 mg for patients with creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US, consistent with local labeling). At the 
Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan 
once daily may ini tiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and then uptitrate to the full 
dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks. 
• Amlodipine: 5 mg  
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg  
Duration of Treatment and Study Participation 
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 18 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 20 months, including up to 2 months of the Screening and Run-in period s, and up to 18 months of treatment. F or all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months. 
Statistical Methods  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the 
Run-in period and approximately 630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB 
period. Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline 
blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening estimated glomerular 
filtration rate  (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
For the primary endpoint, assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2-sided significance level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add-
on to olmesartan; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo 
as add -on to indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the 
following difference between zilebesiran versu s placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add-on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  8 The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by- treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm .  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of 
study drug and have at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK parameters and have 
evaluable PK data.  
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug and who 
have an evaluable baseline and at least 1 evaluable post -baseline PD measurement 
will be included in the PD analyses. 
The primary population used to evaluate efficacy will be the FAS. The primary endpoint is the 
change in 24-hour mean SBP from baseline to Month 3, assessed by ABPM. The primary 
hypothesis of the add-on effect of zilebesiran compared to placebo in patients receiving each of 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine or 
indapamide) will be tested separately. To control the overall type I error, the following secondary 
endpoints will be tested in hierarchical order, only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant: 
• Change in office SBP from baseline to Month 3 
• Change in 24-hour mean SBP from baseline to Month 6, assessed by ABPM 
• Change in office SBP from baseline to Month 6 
Safety data will be summarized descriptively.

sample should only be collected at the first Follow -up visit during the Follow -up period.  
• Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments 
(except for study drug administration) through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, EOT/ET assessments should be performed.   
 Footnotes:  
a All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection (Table  2), are to be performed prior to administration of protocol -specified background 
antihypertensive medications (including Run- In Visit 1) and study drug (as applicable).   
b When applicable, pregnancy test results must be known prior to dosing with study drug at dosing visits.  
c Laboratory assessments at Day 1 do not need to be repeated, per Investigator discretion, if they were collected within 7 days  before Day 1 at Run -in Visit 2.  
d Office blood pressure must be measured before the patient takes oral antihypertensive medications or study drug (as applicabl e).  
e ABPM recordings associated with study drug dosing visits should be obtained within 7 days before the visit and results reviewed before dosing. In the Safety Follow -up period, ABPM assessments may be reduced and are optional per Investigator judgement.   
f HBPM should be measured in the morning upon waking. HBPM must be collected daily for at least 1 week during the Run- in period starting at 3 weeks of run -
in (1 week prior to Run- in Visit 2). HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. In the Safety Follow -up period, the frequency of HBPM 
assessments can be reduced after the first Safety Follow -up visit per Investigator judgement.  
g Neurological evaluation will also be performed as part of the full physical examination.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 1. INTRODUCTION 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developing zilebesiran ( ALN- AGT01) , a 
subcutaneously (SC) administered investigational agent comprised of a synthetic small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 
ligand, which is designed to suppress liver production of angiotensinogen (AGT) and thereby reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. 
1.1. Study Rationale  
Study ALN- AGT01 -003 (KARDIA -2) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment 
with a standard of care antihypertensive medication. Patients will be randomized to run- in on 1 
of 3 protocol-specified antihypertensive medications open- label for at least 4 weeks (olmesartan, 
amlodipine, or indapamide). At the end of the Run-in period, patients with uncontrolled blood 
pressure will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo as add -on therapy to the 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication for 6 months during the double-blind 
(DB) period. After completion of the 6-month DB period, patients may be eligible to participate 
in a separate zilebesiran open -label extension (OLE) study. If an individual patient reaches 
Month 6 prior to availability of the OLE study, they may discontinue their protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication and receive open -label zilebesiran (600 mg once every 
6 months) for up to 12 additional months until the OLE study is open and then transition. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean systolic blood 
pressure ( SBP), assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ), from baseline to 
Month 3, relative to placebo. Secondary and exploratory objectives of the study include 
evaluating the add -on efficacy of zilebesiran on other measures of blood pressure response 
(including longer treatment durations, eg, 6 months) a nd evaluating the PD effect of zilebesiran, 
including reduction in circulating AGT  concentration. 
The full rationale for the study and design is presented in Section  3.2. 
1.2. Background  
Hypertension affects 30% to 45% of adults and is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction.[ Olsen 2016; Williams 2018 ] 
The worldwide disease burden is profound, with a global prevalence of over 1 billion,[ Kearney 
2005; NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017] and approximately 9 million deaths attributed to hypertension annually.[ Angell 2015] 
Currently available pharmacologic therapies achieve target blood pressure in only a minority of 
patients, due in large part to physician inertia and patient nonadherence to daily oral 
medication. [Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Low adherence to oral antihypertensives is 
associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and is prevalent at all stages of disease. [Corrao 
2011; Peacock and Krousel -Wood 2017; Schulz 2016; van der Laan 2017] Thus, despite the 
availability of multiple efficacious agents, current rates of control are low, and the global burden of death and disability- adjusted life -years attributed to elevated blood pressure remains

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 high.[ Forouzanfar 2017; Muntner 2020] Development of new approaches to treat hypertension 
and to overcome the limitations of current therapies is a key unmet need.[ Dzau and Balatbat 
2019; McClellan 2019; Services 2020] 
The Sponsor is developing zilebesiran, a novel synthetic RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, 
for SC administration for the treatment of hypertension. RNAi is a naturally occurring cellular 
mechanism for regulation of gene expression, mediated through the binding of siRNA to its complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, leading to mRNA cleavage and subsequent 
suppression of the synthesis and levels of the target protein. Z ilebesiran contains an siRNA 
targeting AGT  mRNA, conjugated to a GalNAc-containing ligand to facilitate delivery to the 
liver. Based on the mechanism of RNAi, zilebesiran is specifically designed to reduce the hepatic synthesis of AGT protein, the first substrate in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
and the sole precursor of vasoactive angiotensin peptides.[ Khanna 2017; Romero 2015] Because 
hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating AGT, zilebesiran has been developed to 
reduce blood pressure by decreasing circulating AGT levels and the downstream effects of 
angiotensin II (AngII).  
Zilebesiran is being studied in the ongoing Phase 1 Study ALN- AGT01 -001 (hereafter referred 
to as Study 001) in patients with hypertension as single ascending doses of 10 to 800 mg (Part A), as a single dose of 800 mg under low-salt or high-salt conditions (Part B), as 2 doses of 
800 mg administered every 3 months in obese patients (Part D), and as a single dose of 800 mg 
co-administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan (Part E). Preliminary data are available from 
Parts A, B, and E. Dose-dependent and durable reductions in circulating AGT were observed 
after single SC doses of zilebesiran, accompanied by clinically significant reductions in SBP and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Sustained reductions in serum AGT were observed for up to 6 
months following a single dose of zilebesiran.  
Most adverse events (AEs) have been mild or moderate in severity, and there have been no 
severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study drug. There have been no clinically 
significant elevations in serum creatinine or serum potassium. No patient has required intervention for low blood pressure. No clinically significant alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevations have been observed in patients who received zilebesiran doses as high as 800 mg. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were reported in a minori ty of patients and were all mild and 
transient events that resolved without intervention. 
Because most patients with hypertension eventually progress to require treatment with more than 
1 antihypertensive class, [Williams 2018 ] it is anticipate d that zilebesiran may be used together 
with other standard of care antihypertensive medication. This Phase 2 study will further quantify 
the antihypertensive effects of zilebesiran as add -on therapy in patients with hypertension not 
adequately controlled by a standard of care antihypertensive medication. The consistent and 
durable PD effect of zilebesiran  is expected to achieve the unique benefit of continuous 24-hour 
blood pressure lowering with infrequent SC dosing.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of zilebesiran is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  26 1.3. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Clinical data available from Study 001 indicate that zilebesiran may offer the benefit of sustained  
blood pressure reduction to patients with hypertension with infrequent administration (ie, once 
every 3 months or once every 6 months). The mean SBP reduction observed after single zilebesiran doses of 100 mg or higher exceeds 10 mmHg, which is comparable to the effect of 
conventional antihypertensives.[ Abraham 2015; Materson 1993] The blood pressure of patients 
will be closely monitored, and after Month 3, escape antihypertensive medications will be added 
as needed to control blood pressure. 
Given the mechanism of action and mode of administration of zilebesiran, potential theoretical 
risks include liver transaminase elevations and ISRs. Like any antihypertensive therapy, there is also a theoretical risk of hypotension with zilebesiran. Based upon the disease population, there 
is also a risk of blood pressure elevation. Because eligible patients have mild to moderate 
primary hypertension, the likelihood of disease progression during the course of the study is low. This study has exclusion crite ria intended to minimize these risks, as well as frequent monitoring 
for laboratory and blood pressure abnormalities. Furthermore, the duration of the placebo period is limited,  and escape antihypertensive medications are permitted to manage uncontrolled blood 
pressure following 3 months of add- on treatment with zilebesiran.  Detailed guidance is provided 
to Investigators for potential liver transaminase elevations (Section  5.2.4), hypotension 
(Section  5.8.1), hypertension (Section 5.8.2), renal dysfunction ( Section  5.8.3), and 
hyperkalemia (Section  5.8.4). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
and ensure the safety of study participants (see Section 3.6).  
Based on available data from Study 001, zilebesiran has an acceptable safety profile in patients 
with hypertension as a monotherapy or with the addition of conventional antihypertensives in 
patients who were inadequately controlled on zilebesiran alone. This experience supports that the 
theoretical risks of treatment are low and can be managed through the proposed monitoring and safety mitigations.  In addition to study drug, each  patient  will receive a protocol -specified 
background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide). These agents are approved standard medications that will be dosed in accordance with local  labeling . 
While zilebesiran is designed to inhibit the RAAS, its site of action (AGT)  in the RAAS is 
unique, and its tissue specificity for the liver is  hypothesized to improve its renal safety profile 
relative to conventional RAAS blockade,[ Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] both in the context of 
monotherapy and when used together with a conventional RAAS blocker such as olmesartan. In 
the latter setting, zilebesiran is hypothesized to add antihypertensive benefit when added to a 
conventional RAAS blocker without the increased incidence of RAAS inhibitor- associated renal 
adverse effects that have been observed in prior trials of conventional dual RAAS 
blockade.[ Makani 2013] Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 
<45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300mg/g will be exclusively assigned to the 
olmesartan cohort to ensure that patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease or diabetes continue the RAAS inhibition standardly recommended for their renal indication throughout the 
study. 
This study’s monitoring plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of 
conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012]. The risk of renal safety events 
is further mitigated in this study by its eligibility criteria, which exclude patients who are at

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29 Run-in Period  
Patients who complete the Screening period and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
enrollment will be randomized  as described in Section 3.4 to receive open -label therapy with 
olmesartan  (40 mg orally once daily [or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine 
clearance ≤ 60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US , consistent with local labeling for 
olmesartan] ), amlodipine  (5 mg orally once daily), or indapamide (2.5 mg orally once daily) as 
their protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication during a Run-in period of at 
least 4 weeks . Prior antihypertensive medications (if taking) will be discontinued upon the start 
of this Run-in period (Run-i n Visit 1) for at least 4 weeks before Run -in Visit 2 to washout their 
effects.  
Patients who do not tolerate run- in treatment or who do not meet eligibility for randomization at 
Day 1  will be withdrawn from the study and returned to their prior medication regimen in 
coordination with their usual health providers.  
DB Period  
Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive 600 mg 
zilebesiran SC or placebo SC on Day 1 of a 6-month DB period as add -on therapy to their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide). Randomization on Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or  all other races) , 
baseline blood pressure (24- hour mean SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or 
≥60 mL/min/1.73m
2). 
Starting at Month 3, additional conventional oral antihypertensives (“escape antihypertensive medications”) may be added  to the patient’s protocol- specified background antihypertensive 
medication  per Investigator judgement for elevated blood pressure as described in Table 4.  
OLE Period  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications will 
be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC once every 6 months for up to 12 additional months 
until the separate OLE study is open and then transition. Once the separate OLE study is open for enrollment, eligible patients  may rollover into that  OLE study at Month 6, 12, or 18 ( first visit 
after the separate OLE study is open ). 
During the OLE period of this study, Investigators will use escape antihypertensive medications  
as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure monitoring. 
Safety Follow- up Period  
Patients who discontinue study drug or do not enroll in the separate zilebesiran OLE study will 
be asked to complete Safety Follow-up visits once every 6 months after their last dose of study 
drug until serum AGT levels return to ≥50% of their individual mean baseline level (if known) or 
12 months, whichever comes earlier. 
Patients who discontinue study drug prior to the Month 6 visit will also be asked to complete the 
remainder of scheduled study visits and assessments (except for study drug administration)

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 through Month 6. If a patient discontinues study drug after the Month 6 visit, end of treatment 
(EOT)/ early termination (ET) assessments should be performed. 
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study, and an independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee will review  suspected  renal events to 
adjudicate whether they meet criteria for acute kidney injury.  
The planned enrollment for this study is approximately 800 patients to be randomized into the Run-in period and approximately  630 patients (300 patients in the olmesartan arm, 210 patients 
in the amlodipine arm, and 120 patients in the indapamide arm) to be randomized in the DB period.  
The duration of treatment with zilebesiran is up to 18 months. The estimated total time on study 
for patients who rollover to the separate OLE study is up to approximately 20 months, including 
up to 2 months of the Screening and Run-in period s, and  up to 18 months of treatment. For all 
patients who discontinue study drug or do not roll over to the separate OLE study, the Safety Follow-up period is up to 12 months. 
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran administered SC as an add -on therapy in patients with 
hypertension despite treatment with a standard of care antihypertensive medication.  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of zilebesiran  as an add -on therapy 
for the treatment of hypertension by evaluating the change in 24-hour mean SBP, assessed by 
ABPM, from baseline to Month 3, relative to placebo. 
Patients with hypertension often require treatment with multiple antihypertensive drugs to reach 
target blood pressure,[ Williams 2018 ] and it is anticipated that zilebesiran may be administered 
to individuals on a background of other antihypertensive medications. Therefore, this study evaluates the effects of zilebesiran relative to placebo in patients whose blood pressure is not adequat ely controlled despite treatment with 1 of the 3 major drug classes recommended for 
initial treatment of hypertension  by all clinical guidelines: RAAS inhibitors (ie, angiotensin 
converting enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitors, angiotensin II- receptor blockers [ Avni ], or a direct renin 
inhibitor), diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs).[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] 
Studying coadministration with olmesartan will assess if the synergistic antihypertensive effects recently observed in rodents treated with both an ARB and an AGT- targeting GalNAc -siRNA 
will translate into clinically significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients given 
zilebesiran as an add -on to conventional RAAS inhibition.[ Uijl 2019] In addition, it will examine 
the safety and  tolerability of liver -specific AGT targeting during treatment with a conventional 
RAAS blocker (olmesartan). The newer -generation ARB olmesartan was selected because of its 
high potency relative to early-generation RAAS inhibitors,[ Ojima 2011; White 2011] enabling a 
robust test for added efficacy when combined with zilebesiran. The maximum dose of 
olmesartan permitted per local  labeling will be used to further increase the rigor of this efficacy 
evaluation. The thiazide- like diuretic indapamide was selected in accordance with recent 
guidelines that highlight the greater potency and durability of thiazide-like diuretics over other diuretics. [Burnier 2019] The long-acting dihydropyridine CCB amlodipine was selected given its

Julius 2004]  
During the study, blood pressure will be monitored with both automated office blood pressure 
measurements and outpatient 24-hour ABPM (EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on 
Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016). In 
addition to having greater precision, ABPM can assess short-term blood pressure variability and circadian patterns (including potential restoration of the normal nocturnal blood pressure dipping 
pattern that is lost in 24% to 35% of hypertensive patients) . More frequent (at least 3 times per 
week) measurements will be collected through a third method, oscillometric home blood 
pressure monitoring (HBPM), to assess long-term blood pressure variability and provide close safety monitoring for potential hypotension (or hypertension) while not in the clinic.  
As recommended by current guidance (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH] Principles for Clinical Evaluation of 
New Antihypertensive Drugs, 2000 and EMA/CHMP/29947/2013/Rev. 4; Guideline on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Hypertension, 2016), the 6-month DB period is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. To adhere to best 
ethical standards for the treatment of patients with hypertension, the use of oral antihypertensive 
medications per Investigator judgement to maintain blood pressure within target is permitted 
starting at Month 3 and will continue throughout the remainder of the study (see Table 4). The 
term “escape antihypertensive medication” is used to refer to any oral antihypertensive 
medication initiated to control blood pressure after Day 1. Separate from these treat -to-target 
modifications, any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg and/or 
office DBP ≥120 mmHg) will be appropriately treated with escape antihypertensive medication 
regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration. 
If a patient requires treatment with an oral escape antihypertensive medication before Month 6, a 
CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic (whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication) should be added because there is extensive experience 
combining these classes with antihypertensive drugs that impact the RAAS.  
After the 6 -month DB period, protocol- specified background antihypertensive medication 
(olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued, and patients may be eligible to 
participate in a separate zilebesiran OLE study. If an individual patient reaches Month 6 prior to 
availability of the separate OLE study, they may receive open -label zilebesiran at 600 mg SC 
once every 6 months for up to 12 additional months until the separate OLE study is open and 
then transition. Because many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, 
office blood pressure and serum chemistries will be monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 
9.  
During the OLE  period, Investigators will use escape antihypertensive medications  of permitted 
classes  as described in Table 4 to control blood pressure, guided by continued blood pressure 
monitoring and following current care guidelines.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 2018 ] Olmesartan, 
amlodipine, and indapamide will be discontinued as p rotocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication during the OLE period; however, patients may continue to receive 
amlodipine or indapamide as escape antihypertensive medication  at the Investigator’s discretion . 
The use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for high blood pressure should be avoided throughout the study.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  32 While the tissue specificity of zilebesiran for the liver is hypothesized to improve tolerability 
relative to current oral antihypertensives, [Mullick 2017; Uijl 2019] the protocol’s monitoring 
plan is designed to meet the standards set by prior studies of conventional RAAS 
inhibitors[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012].  
3.3. Justification for Dose  
The dose of zilebesiran in this study (600 mg once every 6 months) was selected on the basis of data from the Phase 1 Study 001, in which single zilebesiran doses up to 800 mg were found to have an acceptable safety profile, and dose-dependent, clinically significant placebo -corrected 
reductions in mean SBP >10 mmHg by 24- hour ABPM were observed at doses as low as 
100 mg. An acceptable safety profile was also observed for a single zilebesiran dose of 800 mg under low- salt/high -salt conditions or co -administered for 2 weeks with 300 mg irbesartan once 
daily . The selected dose of 600 mg is predicted to result in a median serum AGT reduction of 
94.9% at trough (Month 6), translating to a median SBP reduction of 11.6 mmHg as monotherapy. 
The protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications are standard agents 
recommended in international and regional hypertension guidelines, and the selected regimens are standard doses used for their approved indication of hypertension.[ Whelton 2018; Williams 
2018] Indapamide will be dosed at 2.5 mg orally once daily, and amlodipine will be dosed at 5 mg orally once daily. The dose regimens for indapamide and amlodipine used in this study were selected on the basis of their common use in clinical care (when used both individually and 
combined with other classes of antihypertensives) and their expected efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability. Olmesartan will be dosed at the maximum dose allowed per local  labeling: 40 mg 
orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min 
enrolled at sites outside of the US ; Olmetec Product Information, September 2020).[ von 
Bergmann 2001] 
3.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. After the patient signs the informed consent form ( ICF) and before 
proceeding with screening procedures, the Investigator or designee should contact the Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) to obtain a patient identification number. 
The Investigator or designee will contact the IRT to randomize the patient at Run-in Visit 1 and 
again at Day 1 after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at each visit.  
At Run -in Visit 1, patients with screening eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m
2 or urine albumin:creatinine 
≥300mg/g will be assigned to receive olmesartan. To avoid over -enrollment, patients with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin:creatinine ≥300mg/g will be excluded from the study after 
100 such patients are randomized to study drug on Day 1.  
All other patients will be randomized  10:7:4 to run-in open- label on 1 of 3 protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide), with targeted 
sample sizes across cohorts as described in Section  7.1. If 1 cohort completes enrollment first, 
this cohort will be deactivated for future randomization. The remaining 2 cohorts will be 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  33 randomized using the original ratio. After the second cohort completes enrollment, all 
subsequent patients will be assigned to the last cohort.  
At Day 1, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive zilebesiran or placebo  as an add -on to  their 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication using the IRT. Randomization at 
Day 1 will be stratified by race (black or all other races), baseline blood pressure (24 -hour mean 
SBP < or ≥145 mmHg), and screening  eGFR (<60 or ≥60 m L/min/1.73m2). 
3.5. Blinding  
The Sponsor, all site personnel and patients will be blinded to study drug treatment through Month 3 of the 6-month DB period. After the database lock to support the analysis of the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3 is complete, Sponsor staff members who will not have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  will be unblinded to 
the analysis results according to the prespecified blinding plan. Site personnel, patients, and Sponsor staff members who have direct roles or responsibilities in interacting with study sites  
will remain blinded to treatment assignment until after the analysis of Month 6 data is complete.  
All Sponsor and site personnel and patients will be blinded to any clinical laboratory result that could potentially unblind them (eg, AGT levels) until unblinding. 
Zilebesiran and placebo will be packaged identically. Because zilebesiran may be slightly  
visually distinguishable from placebo, the vials will be masked in such a way as to hide the 
identity of the study drug contained within. For administration, syringes will be masked by a site pharmacist  or delegate prior to withdrawing the study drug from vial. See the Pharmacy Manual 
for additional details.  The study drug will be administered under the supervision of the 
Investigator (see Section  5.2.2).  
3.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
If the treating physician determines that the clinical management of the patient requires 
knowledge of the study drug assignment, the Investigator may break the blind, as necessary, in 
IRT. If time permits, clinical study center personnel should contact the Medical Monitor before 
unblinding to discuss the need to unblind the patient but must do so within 1 working day after 
the unblinding event. Unblinding information should be limited to the fewest number of people 
on a need -to-know basis . A record of when  the blind was broken, who was unblinded, who broke 
the blind, and why it was broken, will be maintained in the electronic trial master file ( eTMF).  
Refer to the IRT instructions for details on unblinding. 
3.6. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study. The DMC will operate under the rules of a charter that will be reviewed and approved at the organizational meeting of the DMC. Details are provided in the DMC Charter. 
3.7. Clinical Event Adjudication Committees  
An independent Clinical Event Adjudication Committee of 2 or more nephrologists will review the suspected renal events blinded to treatment assignment to adjudicate whether they meet

4.3. Removal from Study Drug or Assessment  
Patients or their legal guardians are free to discontinue study drug and/or stop protocol procedural assessments, or participation in the study as a whole at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care. The Investigator or the Sponsor may 
discontinue study drug or stop a patient’s participation in the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any discontinuation of treatment or the stopping of the patient’s participation in the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and should be followed up by the Investigator. 
Discontinuation of study drug or declining procedural assessments is described in Section  4.3.1, 
while the stopping of a patient’s participation in the study is detailed in Section  4.3.2. 
4.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug or Declining Procedural Assessments  
Reasons for discontinuation of study drug include any of the following: 
• Significant protocol deviation; which includes required treatment with prohibited 
medication (as defined in Section  5.9.1) per Investigator discretion  
• AE 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 • Non-adherence to treatment regimen  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Other reason (non- AE) 
• Or, study is terminated by the Sponsor 
If possible, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor before 
discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study 
drug dosing immediately (see Section  6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy). A 
positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. 
Patients who discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be 
automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for 
any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so 
that their experience is captured in the final analyses .  
If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the patient the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ), including different options for follow-up and collection 
of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not 
involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians or from review 
of medical records), including endpoints and AEs, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records.  
If a patient has an AE, including SAEs, and/or laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into account the patient’s  overall status, requires interruption or 
discontinuation from treatment with study drug, the event should be followed as described in 
Section  6.5.6. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be 
recorded in the eCRF . Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive 
treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as 
applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6-month DB period (defined as the time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 6 
assessments) will be encouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (excluding 
pharmacokinetic [ PK] assessments) through Month 6. They will also be asked to complete S afety 
Follow-up visits once every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow-up schedule (see Table 1 ) until PD recovery  or 12 months (whichever is earlier); see Section  3.1. 
Patients who discontinue study drug during the OLE period will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete EOT/ ET assessments and complete S afety Follow-up visits once 
every 6 months after the last dose of study drug per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table 1 ) 
until PD recovery or 12 months (whichever is earlier) ; see Section  3.1.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation  
4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time . A patient or 
legal guardian considering stopping participation in the study before Month 6 should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit and comple te 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient or legal guardian consents. If a patient or legal guardian still 
chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation in all follow-up prior to the completion 
of the 6-month DB period, every effort should be made to conduct the Month 6 visit assessments 
at an earlier time (see Table 1 ). 
A patient considering stopping participation in the study during the OLE period should be 
informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and 
remain in the study to complete the assessments scheduled for the EOT/E T visit and complete 
Safety Follow-up visits as described in Section 4.3.1, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents.  
If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. 
Note, in countries where the collection and processing of the patient’s personal data is based on 
consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process the patient’s  personal data (see 
Section  4.3.2.2), as applicable, personal data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law.  
4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data or Objection to 
Process Patient’s Personal Data  
Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and 
use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the Investigator at any 
time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . Also, where allowed by local 
law, the patient may object to the collection, storage, and use of the patient’s  personal data, 
informing the Investigator at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required . In both cases, the Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information 
(including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time 
of withdrawal/objection) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements.  
4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study 
The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are 
best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow-up even if study 
drug is discontinued.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section  8.1.6. 
4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 
The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section  6.5.6. 
4.3.3. Lost to Follow- Up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient or legal guardian and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient or legal guardian on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient or 
legal guardian wishes [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue 
in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient or legal guardian (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the patient’s medical record.  
• Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. 
• For patients who are lost to follow-up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 
4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients  
No additional patients may be enrolled to mitigate the impact of patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after the second randomization at Day 1 .  
5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
Study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied by the 
Sponsor for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must 
not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication that have been dispensed and returned unused must not be re-dispensed.

zilebesiran . 
5.2.2. Dose and Administration 
During the 6-month DB period, patients will be administered  600 mg zilebesiran or placebo, at 
the same volume, as SC injection s once every  6 months. During the OLE period, all patients will 
receive 600 mg zilebesiran SC once every 6 months. 
Study drug injections will be administered by qualified clinical study center staff under the 
supervision of the Investigator or designee. The injection site may be marked and mapped for later observation . Injections may be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the side or back of 
the upper arms. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
To maintain the blind, the syringes are to be masked by the site pharmacist or designee prior to 
study drug withdrawal from the vial. A full description of the blinding procedure is included in 
the Pharmacy Manual.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of study drug within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered up to 85 days before the next scheduled dose. Thereafter, the dose will be considered missed and not administered. 
If a patient misses a dose of study drug, the Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor 
whether the patient will be able to continue the study (see also Section  4.3).  
Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  The definition of study drug overdose, follow-up procedures, and reporting requirements are 
provided Section  6.5.6.8. 
5.2.3. Dose Modifications

­ Table 7  (all assessments to be performed once)  
­ Hematology, serum chemistry, LFT, and coagulation per Table 6  
• Monitor at least weekly: LFT and coagulation per Table 6  until ALT 
and/or AST is declining on 2 consecutive draws, then may decrease 
monitoring to biweekly  
• If ALT or AST rises to >5×ULN following resumption of dosing, 
permanently discontinue dosing 
>8×ULN  Permanently discontinue study drug dosing after confirmation of the transaminase value at the central laboratory.  
Abbreviations: ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AST=aspartate aminotransferase; LFT=liver function test(s); 
ULN=upper limit of normal.  
Notes: In addition to these criteria, other assessments or evaluations may be performed per Investigator 
discretion, as appropriate.  
5.2.5. Neurological Criteria for Withholding, Monitoring, and Stopping Study Drug 
Dosing  
Clinically significant events that may be consistent with potential decreased proprioception 
(including but not limited to unusual clumsiness, gait abnormalities, and unexplained 
balance/coordination issues that are either absent at or worsening from the baseline) should be reported as an AE. If the treatment -emergent AE is persistent and considered related to study 
drug, specialty consultation with a neurologist should be considered. However, if such a treatment -emergent AE is serious or severe (regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of 
relatedness), the patient must be referred for neurologist consultation, and study drug dosing 
must be held until that consultation is complete. Resumption of dosing must be approved by the 
Medical Monitor. 
5.3. Protocol -specified Background Antihypertensive Medications  
All patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 following standard of care oral 
antihypertensive medications during a Run-in period of at least 4 weeks and will continue this 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication through Month 6. Protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medications will be supplied by the Sponsor. 
• Olmesartan: 40 mg orally once daily (or 20 mg orally once daily for patients with 
creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min enrolled at sites outside of the US, consistent with local labeling). At the Investigator’s discretion, patients who are randomized to receive 40 mg olmesartan once daily may initiate treatment at 20 mg once daily and 
then uptitrate to the full dose of 40 mg once daily after 1 to 2 weeks (in this case, the 
patient must take the full olmesartan dose of 40 mg once daily for at least 4 weeks prior to reassessment at Run -in Visit 2).  
• Amlodipine: 5 mg orally once daily 
• Indapamide: 2.5 mg orally once daily 
Protocol-specified antihypertensive medications may be downtitrated or temporarily 
discontinued per Investigator judgement for low blood pressure (see Section 5.8.1).  At the 
Investigator’s discretion, oral antihypertensive agents, including protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, may be prophylactically held during intercurrent illness or volume depletion. 
5.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for prepar ing zilebesiran or placebo doses  
and dispensing protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, according to 
procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the safe handling of 
study drug or protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright at approximately 2 to 30°C until dose preparation. Protocol-
specified background antihypertensive medication will be stored according to the storage 
instructions on the label. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the affected study drug or protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by 
the Sponsor or designee, as described in the Pharmacy Manual. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Instructions specific to unused study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive 
medication and additional storage will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.5. Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations. Study drug and protocol- specified 
background antihypertensive medication labels and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labeling requirements. Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 5.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication supplied for this 
study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept of when and how much study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication is dispensed 
and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for departure from the protocol 
dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs and 
protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. Used, partially used, and unused 
study drug and protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations. 
Further instructions about accountability will be detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.7. Clinical Product Complaints  
5.7.1. Definition  
A clinical product complaint (CPC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of the study drug and its packaging after it is released for distribution to the site at 
which study drug will be administered. 
A CPC may be detected prior to use of study drug, during use, or after use. A CPC is typically 
nonmedical in nature; however, it is possible that investigational product complaints could be 
associated with an AE . Examples of a CPC include, but are not limited to: illegible clinical label, 
missing clinical label, damaged vial , empty vial , and contamination of study drug. 
5.7.2. Reporting  
For product complaints, the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using the process outlined in the Pharmacy Manual. CPCs that may be associated with an AE must be evaluated and reported as indicated in Section  6.5.6. Detailed instructions on reporting CPCs will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.8. Monitoring for Potential Clinical Events  
5.8.1. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hypotension 
Hypotension is an obligate risk of antihypertensive medications. In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored at least 3 times per week  with 
HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential hypotension. Whenever possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure. 
The following management recommendations for hypotension are provided: 
• Patients who experience l ow blood pressure that is associated with symptoms should 
promptly seek medical evaluation at the clinical study site or another hospital setting. 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 Clinical study site evaluation for low blood pressure should include the assessment of 
orthostatic blood pressure (supine to standing).  
• The Investigator should consider downtitration or interruption of oral antihypertensives (if taking) if confirmed office SBP <90 mmHg or if clinical symptoms, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, develop coupled with a significantly lower SBP compared to prior visits (ie, SBP <100 mmHg).  Oral antihypertensives 
should be downtitrated/interrupted in reverse order to how they were added (ie, interrupt escape antihypertensive medications before protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications). 
• Clinically significant events discovered during the course of a patient’s general 
medical care should be promptly communicated to the site and evaluated by the 
Investigator, especially if hypotension is noted. Patients will carry Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) -approved patient cards to 
facilitate this physician -to-physician communication.  
• If hypotension is confirmed, serum electrolytes and creatinine should be measured and any oral antihypertensive(s) should be downtitrated or interrupted per Investigator judgement as outlined above.  
• The frequency of blood pressure and laboratory  monitoring (serum electrolytes and 
creatinine) should be increased during intercurrent illnesses that predispose patients to 
dehydration (eg, vomiting or diarrhea that persists for more than 24 hours) or when 
symptoms consistent with decreased effective circulating volume (eg, presyncopal symptoms, unexplained falls, decreased urine output) manifest, even if a patient’s recent blood pressure measurements have been normal.  
• Hypotension that warrants direct evaluation at the site should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. In addition, other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (eg, unexplained presyncope, syncope, or falls) should be communicated to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the site being notified. 
• Management of persistent hypotension may include increased salt intake or, if 
unresponsive, standard treatments for orthostatic intolerance syndromes such as 
fludrocortisone or midodrine. 
• Low blood pressure that requires medical treatment (including intravenous fluid support) or other clinical events consistent with potential hypotension (see above) should be recorded as AEs. 
5.8.2. Monitoring and Approach for Clinically Significant Blood Pressure Elevation 
In addition to office blood pressure monitoring, outpatient blood pressure will be monitored frequently with HBPM to ensure the early detection of potential significant elevations. Whenever 
possible, management decisions will be based on blood pressure measurements confirmed by 
office blood pressure. The recommended interventions for potentially clinically significant blood pressure elevation are presented in Table 4.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  47 Table 4: Recommended Interventions for Potentially Clinically Significant Blood 
Pressure Elevation  
Study Period  Intervention  
Throughout Study • Whenever possible, management decisions should be based on blood 
pressure measurements confirmed by office blood pressure.  
• Any confirmed event of severe hypertension (office SBP ≥180 mmHg  
and/or office DBP ≥120 mmHg) should be appropriately treated regardless of its timing relative to study drug administration.  
• Until double- blind data are generated that demonstrate acceptable safety 
and added antihypertensive efficacy of zilebesiran when combined with olmesartan, the use of conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE 
inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors) as escape antihypertensive agents for 
high blood pressure will be avoided throughout the study.  
• If added, escap
 e antihypertensives must be used per their labeled 
instructions and in accordance with current clinical  guidelines. [Whelton 
2018; Wi
lliams 2018 ] 
Day 1 to Month 3 Intervene if clinically significant blood pressure elevation: 
• Because of the gradual onset of effects of zilebesiran , interventions for 
asymptomatic hypertension should be avoided in the first 6 weeks after the 
patient’s first administration of study drug.  
• After Week 6, patients who develop office SBP >160 mmHg and increased 
>10 mmHg from their baseline office SBP that persists for ≥24 hours on 2 
consecutive measurements or that is accompanied by hypertensive 
symptoms should be evaluated by the clinical study site. Severely 
symptomatic patients should be evaluated at the clinical study site or another hospital setting within 24 hours. 
• If persistent hypertension is confirmed (without the identification of a 
specific treatable cause) and the Investigator deems it to be a clinically 
significant change, treatment may be initiated at the medical discretion of 
the Investigator using a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already the protocol- specified background 
antihypertensive medication) as an escape antihypertensive medication .  
Months 3 to 6 Treat to target blood pressure using a CCB and/or thiazide/thiazide- like  diuretic  
(whichever agent is not already a protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication) : 
• At Month 3, a CCB and/or a thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic should be added 
as an escape antihypertensive medication if the daytime mean SBP is ≥135 mmHg by ABPM. If the Investigator feels there is a compelling 
clinical reason to wait, the rationale for exception should be documented in 
the eCRF.  
• After Month 3, other escape antihypertensive medications may also be 
added per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in SBP  above 
target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135  mmHg, 
or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 mmHg).[ Williams 2018 ]

Month 6 to End of 
Study (OLE period)  Treat to target blood pressure using Investigator’s choice of oral 
antihypertensive(s ). 
• At Month 6, protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications (olmesartan, amlodipine, or indapamide) will be discontinued .  
• Patients  who continue into the OLE period will initiate open -label treatment 
with 600 mg zilebesiran once every 6 months. As many patients will receive zilebesiran for the first time at Month 6, office blood pressure and serum 
chemistries will be carefully monitored monthly from Month 6 to Month 9, and Investigators will be prepared to downtitrate or interrupt  escape 
antihypertensive medications  if low blood pressure develops (see 
Section  5.8.1).  
• If the Month 6 ABPM is in target (daytime mean SBP <135 mmHg), escape 
antihypertensive medication s (if taken)  may be downtitrated or interrupted 
per Investigator judgement to determine if the patient’s blood pressure 
remains within target on zilebesiran treatment alone.  
• During the OLE period, oral antihypertensive medications may be added 
per Investigator judgement for persistent elevations in blood pressure above target (target defined as office SBP <140 mmHg, HBPM SBP <135 mmHg, 
or daytime mean SBP by ABPM <135 mmHg).[ Whelton 2018 ; Williams

5.8.3. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Renal Dysfunction 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of eGFR 
through the anticipated onset of initial zilebesiran PD. Based upon the renal dysfunction 
associated with conventional RAAS inhibitors,[ McMurray 2016; Parving 2012] the following 
guidelines apply throughout the study: 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥30% from baseline or to 
≤30 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeat tests, contact 
the Sponsor, and look for potentially reversible causes of renal dysfunction such as: 
− NSAIDs, antibiotics, or other treatments known to impair renal function 
− Recent exposure to intravenous contrast agents 
− Hypovolemia 
− Hypotension 
− Urinary infection 
− Urinary tract obstruction 
• If an individual patient experiences a decrease in eGFR by ≥40% from baseline or to 
≤25 mL/min/1.73m2, the Investigator should obtain confirmatory repeats tests, look

discuss the potential interruption of study drug and/or oral antihypertensives. Serum 
creatinine should be monitored at least weekly until improving. 
5.8.4. Monitoring and Approach for Potential Hyperkalemia 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) includes frequent laboratory monitoring of serum 
electrolytes (at least monthly through the anticipated onset of zilebesiran PD). The guidelines in Table 5 apply for potassium elevations detected by laboratory monitoring.[ McMurray 2016; 
Parving 2012] 
Table 5: Recommended Interventions for Hyperkalemia  
Serum K+ ≥5.2 and <5.5 mmol/L  Serum K+ ≥5.5 and <6.0 mmol/L  Serum K+ ≥6.0 mmol/L  
• Confirm potassium 
concentration in a non-
hemolyzed sample.  
• Reinforce low- potassium diet 
and restriction of food/drinks 
with high potassium content  
• Review medical regimen 
(including dietary supplements and over-the-counter 
medications) for agents known to cause hyperkalemia.

levels to ensure stability (at least weekly if in the first 6 
weeks of treatment or at least 
once monthly afterwards)  • Confirm potassium 
concentration in a non-
hemolyzed sample  
• Consider interruption of open-
label olmesartan (in patients randomized to receive it as their 
protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication) 
according to Investigator medical judgement  
• Consider interruption or delay  
of study drug administration , 
according to Investigator medical judgment  
• Apply all measures outlined for

participating study sites. These potassium-binding drugs are indicated  for the treatment of 
hyperkalemia and have been shown to safely reduce serum potassium levels and to maintain 
long-term normokalemia in chronic kidney disease patients receiving background conventional RAAS inhibitor therapy.[ Georgianos and Agarwal 2018; Weir 2015] 
5.9. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Use of concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded on the patient’s e CRF as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ). Concomitant medications include all 
prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the counter medications, vitamins, and minerals . Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the e CRF.  
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted . However, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated . For other permitted 
concomitant medications administered SC , do not administer in same injection site area as the 
study drug for at least 4 days after each  dose of study drug. 
Occasional use of systemic over-the-counter NSAIDs is allowed. However, given their association with increased blood pressure, they should be avoided when possible and  for at least 
7 days prior to ABPM and office blood pressure assessments, and alternative analgesics 
(acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) should be considered.[ Whelton 2018] When used, the dosing 
of systemic NSAIDs should be at the lower end of the labeled range and for the shortest duration 
possible.  
Patients will be allowed to receive vaccines (eg, for SARS -CoV- 2) that have received health 
agency authorization (including for emergency use) by local or regional regulatory authorities. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator, except as described in Section 5.9.1. However, it is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the e CRF . 
Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
5.9.1. Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications, treatments, and supplements are prohibited throughout the study 
(until the EOT visit): 
• Conventional RAAS inhibitors (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors), except for  olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication  
during the 6-month DB period  
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) 
• Prescription NSAIDs  
• Organic nitrate preparations (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol)  
• An RNAi therapeutic (other than zilebesiran)  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 • Medications, herbal supplements (including Ma Huang and St. John’s wort), or other 
substances (such as licorice) that are associated with increases in LFT abnormalities or with blood pressure abnormalities are prohibited. This includes certain stimulants 
(eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), MAO 
inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics (eg, clozapine, olanzapine), diet pills (eg, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine), and nasal decongestants (eg, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine, naphazoline hydrochloride). 
• Medications, herbal medicines, over- the-counter medications, or supplements known 
to cause hyperkalemia are prohibited unless individually approved by both the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. This includes potassium-sparing diuretics, 
potassium supplements, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, trimethoprim and 
trimethoprim-containing combination products, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, Noni juice, alfalfa, dandelion, horsetail, nettle, milkweed, lily of the valley, Siberian ginseng, and hawthorn berries. 
All concomitant medications must be reviewed and approved by the Investigator, with particular attention to avoiding drugs that may affect blood pressure. 
5.10. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study staff. Compliance with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication will be assessed through pill count by study staff. 
5.11. Other Requirements  
5.11.1. Contraception  
Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of 
contraception from 14 days before the first dose  of protocol-specified background 
antihypertensive medication, throughout study participation, and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1). 
Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: 
• Placement of an intrauterine device.  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient . Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent 
patients must agree to use one of the above-mentioned contraceptive methods if they 
start heterosexual relationships during the study and through safety follow- up (if 
applicable; see Section  3.1) 
Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. 
Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or 
begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral s alpingectomy). A 
postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal 
range.  
For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by males of contraception 
(condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with local 
requirements as described in the corresponding patient ICFs.  
Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section  6.5.5.3). Pregnancy testing will be 
performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see 
Section  6.5.5.3).  
5.11.2. Alcohol Restrictions  
Patients should limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] =1 measure of spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] =½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration 
of the study. Compliance with alcohol restrictions should be assessed on a regular basis by the 
Investigator throughout the course of the study. 
5.11.3. Tobacco and Nicotine Restrictions  
Use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products (including, but not limited to , snuff, chewing 
tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 
minutes prior to office blood pressure measurements. 
5.11.4. Cannabis Restriction  
Use of cannabis or delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol-containing substances (included by smoking, 
vaping, dabbing, or ingesting/edibles) should be avoided throughout the course of the study 
given their effects on blood pressure. 
5.11.5. Dietary Recommendations  
All patients will receive educational materials on diet with recommendations to limit sodium 
consumption to approximately 2.0 g per day from screening through the end of the Treatment 
period. This direction should be provided at the start of the Screening period, and treatment-naïve patients should follow these recommendations for at least 1 week prior to screening 
assessments of blood pressure. This is the sodium intake recommended in the 2018 European

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  53 Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for both hypertensive 
patients and for the general population.[ Williams 2018 ]  
On days on which samples for fasting lipid panel and glycemic assessments are collected, patients are required to fast for ≥10 hours before sample collection ( Section  6.5.5.1).  
5.11.6. Exercise  
Patients should abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests.  
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 . Study visits should be scheduled for 
the morning. All assessments, except for postdose PK sample collection, are to be performed prior to dosing with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug. Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Manual.  
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine sampl es and measurement of vital 
signs (at the discretion and oversight of the Investigator). 
6.1. Screening Assessments  
An ICF that has been approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC must be signed (in paper or 
electronic format per local regulations and institutional standards)  by the patient or legal 
guardian before the s creening procedures are initiated . All patients or their legal guardians will 
be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF. 
Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria . Rescreening of patients once is permitted with agreement  of the Medical 
Monitor (see Section  6.1.2).  
Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Run- in Visit 1  will be updated 
prior to administration  of protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication. 
6.1.1. Retesting  
If in the Investigator’s judgement, the screening or Run -in laboratory abnormalities are likely to 
be transient, then laboratory tests may be repeated . The Investigator’s rationale must be 
documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during s creening  and once during the Run-
in period provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed Screening  and Run- in periods. Retesting of ABPM at Run -in Visit 2  is permitted once as 
described in Section  6.2.1, with eligibility assessed by the  second ABPM result.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 6.1.2. Rescreening  
A patient who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a transient condition observed at 
screening (eg, prohibited medications that were subsequently discontinued) will be allowed to 
return  once for rescreening  following agreement with the Medical Monitor. A patient will be re -
consented  if rescreening occurs outside of the Screening period. In this case, all screening 
procedures must be repeated.  Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria after Run -in Visit 1 
will not be rescreened.  
6.2. Efficacy Assessments 
All blood pressure measurements (ABPM, office, and HBPM) must be taken at the times  
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) using the standardized equipment provided 
by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in Section 10.2. Office b lood pressure 
assessments and ABPM initiation  must be performed before administration of  any oral 
antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable) . 
Patients taking oral antihypertensives prior to screening should discontinue these medications at Run- in Visit 1 . The baseline ABPM and office blood pressure measured at Run -in Visit 2  must 
be taken within 7 days before Day 1 . An HBPM unit will be provided before Run- in Visit 2  to 
establish the HBPM baseline. HBPM must be collected daily for at least 1 week during the Run-
in period to establish baseline, starting at  1 week prior to Run- in Visit 2 and continuing to Day 1. 
After Day 1, the frequency of HBPM should be at least 3 recordings per week . 
ABPM placement may be performed at home by appropriately trained individuals, as detailed in the Study Manual. If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure 
assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely 
using the methods described in Section 10.2. 
Recommendations for approach and monitoring of low blood pressure/hypotension and 
hypertensive escape are provided in Section 5.8.1 and Section  5.8.2, respectively. 
6.2.1. ABPM  
The ABPM must be started prior to the morning dose of oral antihypertensive medication. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs should be avoided for at least 7 days prior to ABPM measurements.  
Adequacy will be assessed for all ABPMs. If the ABPM recording is inadequate, the patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the study. During the Run-in period , if the second ABPM 
recording is also inadequate, the patient is a run -in failure.  
See further details in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual. 
6.2.2. Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured  in triplicate  using the automated blood pressure device 
provided by the Sponsor at trough (prior to taking oral antihypertensives) and should be at approximately the same time  of day for each assessment ; therefore, visits should be scheduled at 
approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. Office blood pressure must include orthostatic measurements (seated and standing).  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  55 Exercise, caffeine, alcohol consumption, and use of nicotine or tobacco-containing products 
(including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or 
e-cigarettes) must be avoided within 30 minutes prior to blood pressure measurements. The use of inhaled short-acting beta agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure and/or heart rate. The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, 
tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) sho uld be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood 
pressure.  Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs should be avoided for at least 7 
days prior to blood pressure measurements. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as 
detailed in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual.  
6.2.3. HBPM  
The HBPM should be measured in the morning upon waking, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral antihypertensive medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the feet flat on the floor as detailed in Section  10.2 and the Study Manual. 
6.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples for determination of AGT will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). In addition, blood samples for determination of RAAS biomarkers 
(plasma renin concentration, AngI, AngII, and aldosterone) will be collected only for patients randomized to receive olmesartan as protocol -specified background antihypertensive medication. 
Blood samples for PD assessments must be collected before study drug administration (on days 
when study drug is to be dosed) or at a time point corresponding to the time of study drug dosing 
(on other days). Blood AGT levels will be analyzed at a regulated bioanalytical  laboratory by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measurement of PD effect. B iomarkers may be 
analyzed using qualified assays. Details regarding the collection, processing, shipping, and storage of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Results will not be used to adjust dosing of zilebesiran or guide clinical management and will not 
be shared with sites until after study unblinding. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and its primary metabolite AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ). A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for 
PK analysis is in Table 2. 
Plasma concentrations of zilebesiran and AS(N -1)3′ zilebesiran will be determined using a 
validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, and the processing, shipping, 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight, 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities 
observed during the physical examination will be  recorded.  
6.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and include 
blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs are to be collected 
prior to administration of oral antihypertensive medications and study drug (as applicable). 
When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured in 
the seated position, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 10 minutes. Body 
temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be  counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will 
be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Blood pressure is described in Section  6.2.  
Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice.  
6.5.2. Weight, Height , and Morphometrics  
Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height will be measured at Day 1  only. 
Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight should be measured in kilograms to the first decimal point in patients wearing light clothing and without shoes.  
Waist circumference and waist -to-hip- ratio will also be collected as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the eCRF. For waist circumference and waist -to-
hip ratio, patients should wear minimal clothing to ensure that the measuring tape is correctly 
positioned. Patients should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, fe et together 
and with their weight equally divided over both legs. To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first located and marked with a pen. The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked. It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally 
midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in 
position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus. The elastic tape thus defines the level of the waist circumferen ce, which can then be measured by positioning the measuring tape 
over the elastic tape. Hip circumference measurement should be taken around the widest portion of the buttocks. Patients are asked to breathe normally, and to breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath. A 
stretch -resistant tape that provides a constant 100 g of tension is recommended. Measurements 
should be obtained with the tape positioned parallel to the floor and performed using the same 
procedure throughout the study. 
The reading is taken to the nearest centimeter and entered in the source document. Each 
measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of each other, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 6.5.3. Physical Examination 
Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ); if a physical examination is scheduled for a study drug dosing visit, it 
should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of 
the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and 
neurological evaluation  (see the Study Manual for further details on the assessments to be 
performed as part of the neurological evaluation). 
Symptom-directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of changes in symptoms, 
or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Neurologic al evaluation should be performed 
according to the Study Manual during all symptom-directed physical examinations regardless of whether neurological symptoms have been experienced by the patient.  
Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on 
the medical history or AE eCRF. 
6.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECGs reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval , and Fridericia -corrected QT interval will be obtained using a local machine, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Patients should be supine for at least 10 
minutes before each ECG is obtained. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all single 12- lead ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to 
determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded in the eCRF.   
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same visit, blood sample collection should occur first. ECGs should be performed at least 30 minutes after phlebotomy or other stressful assessments.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These 
assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of 
the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual.  
6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section  5.2.4. For any other unexplained 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test 
should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the 
clinical situation may be requested. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 6  and will 
be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of the assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in  Table 6  that are performed at the clinic 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central 
laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied 
upon for clinical decisions. 
Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or at home by a 
trained healthcare professional. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs should be 
avoided for at least 7 days prior to laboratory assessments. In patients randomized to receive olmesartan as the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication, blood samples for 
RAAS biomarkers should be collected in the morning and in the seated/upright position (after 
blood pressure measurements and be fore an y assessments collected in the supine position). 
Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected after the completion of blood pressure assessments.  
Spot urine collections for albumin and creatinine should be obtained in the morning. A 24-hour urine collection for sodium and creatinine will be performed at time points listed in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). These 24-hour collections should be obtained within 2 days before the 
ABPM associated with the same visit.  
For any safety event or laboratory abnormality, additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the cl inical database.

A pregnancy test will be performed for females of child -bearing potential. A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per 
the Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected. More frequent pregnancy testing may be performed where required per local requirements. The results of the pregnancy 
test must be known before study drug administration. Patients who are pregnant at screening are 
not eligible for study participation. Any woman with a positive urine pregnancy test, subsequently confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test, during the study will be 
discontinued from study drug but will continue to be followed for safety. Patients who become 
pregnant while on study will be followed at least until the pregnancy outcome is known (see Section  6.5.6.7 for follow -up instructions). 
A blood sample will be drawn at screening to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone in order to confirm postmenopausal status in all women suspected to be postmenopausal (see Section  5.11.1 for definition of postmenopausal state).

6.5.6. Adverse Events  
6.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of F ederal Regulations 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  62 • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred . It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: 
• ALT or AST >3×ULN  
• Severe or serious ISRs; ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of zilebesiran . 
An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection . “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as 
may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the 
injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. 
For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section  6.5.6.2 and 
Section  6.5.6.3, respectively.  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
Severe:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden); OR life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
OR death related to an adverse event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  63 Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity . Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an 
AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Adverse event  severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” A “yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 
The relationship of each AE to the protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication 
should also be assessed by the Investigator. 
6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes 
in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should 
also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, 
or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over-the-counter). In addition 
to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study treatment during the Run-in period 
regardless of their relationship to the study treatment through the end of study. Study treatment is 
defined as protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication or study drug (zilebesiran 
or placebo).  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Events occurring after 
signing of the ICF and before th e Run -in period will be captured as medical history (see 
Section  6.1), while AEs that occur after study treatment , and baseline events that worsen after 
study treatment , must be recorded as AEs . 
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study 
treatment  through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until 
baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the 
patient is stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be related . Each AE must be described in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  64 detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study treatment, action 
taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the supplemental AEs of 
Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed . Additional clinical and laboratory information may 
be collected . Refer to eCRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the 
supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF.  
For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or 
Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom[s], injection site location, follow -up actions taken). 
6.5.6.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section  6.5.6.1), the Sponsor or its designee 
should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 
6.5.6.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  6.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of 
the event . All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study treatment . 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study treatment , and 
• Investigator/site information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. Within 24 hours of 
receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and, as applicable, the 
SAE form . SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using the Investigator’s  best 
medical judgment to treat the SAE . These measures and the patient’s response to these measures 
should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment , will be followed by 
the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable . Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the 
Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  65 system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the 
study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their 
institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country 
requirements . Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through safety follow -up (see Section  3.1), 
the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being 
notified of the pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form . The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy, the possible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section  6.5.6.4. 
6.5.6.8. Reporting of Overdose and Other Special Situations  
An overdose is defined as any dose of study drug administered to the participant or taken by the participant that is >2× the assigned dose during a single administration and/or ≥2 doses within ½ the intended dosing interval. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In an event of an overdose or other special situations (eg, medication error, abuse, misuse, or 
CPC associated with an AE), the Investigator should: 
• Contact the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor within 24 hours using the contact 
information in the Pharmacy Manual 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities 
• Document the amount of study drug given  
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication will be considered AEs/SAEs.  
Full details of reporting instructions for overdose and other special situations will be outlined in 
the Pharmacy Manual.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  66 6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository  
Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational 
therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence 
will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hypertension, as well as 
their responses to treatment.  
Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and patient consent, samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the 
application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further eluc idate the outcomes of this 
study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy 
of zilebesiran.  
Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ). In addition to the dedicated collections for optional exploratory biomarkers (urine, 
plasma, serum), aliquots from each 24-hour urine collection will be archived for optional 
potential exploratory investigations. These specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy, or safety.  
The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study. 
These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following 
the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 
10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. 
Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its 
designees.  
When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples.  
7. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock and study unblinding for 
the analysis  of the primary endpoints and secondary endpoints measured at Month 3. The plan 
will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features 
stated in the protocol. 
7.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 630 patients will be randomized to receive either zilebesiran or placebo with sample sizes in each of the patient cohorts with protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication as follows:  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  67 • Olmesartan cohort: 300 patients  
• Amlodipine cohort: 210 patients 
• Indapamide cohort: 120 patients 
Assuming a standard deviation of 16 mmHg in change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP 
assessed by ABPM and 15% dropout rate from baseline to Month 3, with 2- sided significance 
level of 0.05 for each of the comparisons (zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to olmesartan; 
zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to amlodipine; zilebesiran versus placebo as add -on to 
indapamide), these sample sizes will provide at least 80% power to detect the following difference between zilebesiran versus placebo:  
• 5 mmHg as add -on to olmesartan  
• 6 mmHg as add -on to amlodipine 
• 8 mmHg as add -on to indapamide  
The power is assessed by mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM), with change 
from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP assessed by ABPM at Month 3 as response variable and 
treatment, time, treatment-by-time as fixed factors and corresponding baseline value as a 
covariate.  
7.2. Statistical Methodology  
All analyses will be performed within each of the 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medication cohorts. The statistical and analytical plans presented below are brief summaries of planned analyses . More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP . Changes 
to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified as needed in the clinical study report. For information on study endpoints, see Section  2. 
7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : All randomized patients who received any amount of study 
drug. All by -treatment analyses based on the FAS will be according to the 
randomized treatment arm .  
• Safety Analysis Set : All patients who received any amount of study drug, grouped 
according to the treatment actually received.  
• PK Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug and 
have at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK parameters and have evaluable PK data. 
• PD Analysis Set : All patients who received at least 1 full dose of study drug and who 
have an evaluable baseline and at least 1 evaluable post -baseline PD measurement  
will be included in the PD analyses. 
The primary population used to evaluate efficacy will be the FAS. Safety will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. The PK and PD Analysis Sets will be used to conduct PK and PD analyses, respectively.

Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. Detailed methodology will be 
provided in the SAP. 
7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data 
Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations 
Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized . 
In general, baseline will be defined as the average of all assessments, including unscheduled 
assessments, between Run-in Visit 2 and prior to the first dose of study drug. Details of the definition will be specified in the SAP.  
7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses 
7.2.5.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change in 24-hour mean SBP from baseline to Month 3, assessed by ABPM. The primary hypothesis of the add-on effect of zilebesiran compared to placebo in patients receiving each of 3 protocol-specified background antihypertensive medications 
(olmesartan, amlodipine or indapamide) will be tested separately at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.05 using MMRM. The MMRM model will include change from baseline in 24-hour mean 
SBP assessed by ABPM at Month 3 as the response variable; treatment, time, treatment-by- time, 
and race (black or all other races)  as fixed factors ; and corresponding baseline value and 
screening eGFR  as covariates.  
7.2.5.2. Secondary Endpoints  
To control the overall type I error, the following secondary endpoints will be tested  in 
hierarchical order , only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant: 
• Change in office  SBP from baseline to Month 3 
• Change in 24-hour mean SBP from baseline to Month 6, assessed by ABPM 
• Change in office SBP from baseline to Month 6 
The remaining secondary endpoints below will not be tested in the hierarchical order: 
• Change in 24-hour mean DBP from baseline to Months 3 and 6, assessed by ABPM 
• Change in office DBP from baseline to Months 3 and 6 
• Change in daytime and nighttime mean SBP and DBP from baseline to Month 3 and Month 6, assessed by ABPM 
• Change in serum AGT 
Blood pressure-related secondary endpoints will be analyzed by the MMRM model similar to the primary endpoint. In addition, for change in office SBP and DBP, time- adjusted average from

10.1. Formula for Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Calculation  
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min/1.73m2) will be calculated from serum 
creatinine (SCr) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.  
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Formula  [Levey 2009] 
• Conventional units 
− eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × (SCr [mg/dL])-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
• SI units − eGFR (mL/min/1.73m
2) = 175 × (SCr [μmol/L]/88.4)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742, if 
female), or × (1.212, if African American)  
10.2. Measurement of Blood Pressure  
All blood pressure measurements (office, ABPM, and HBPM) must be taken using the 
standardized equipment provided by the Sponsor, according to the methods described in the relevant user manuals.  
The appropriately sized cuff for each modality must be used for all assessments. The arm’s 
circumference at midpoint (halfway between the acromion and olecranon) should be determined 
at screening with a metric tape measure and used to select the appropriat ely sized blood pressure 
cuff/bladder for each instrument as described in the Study Manual. Unless significant weight loss 
or gain occurs between visits, the patient should use the same cuff/bladder size throughout the study. 
At the first Screening visit only, office blood pressure will be measured in both arms to select the 
appropriate arm to use for office blood pressure and HBPM measurements. Unless a concomitant 
condition favors the use of a specific arm, the arm with the higher office SBP should be used for 
all subsequent office blood pressure and HBPM readings. The ABPM should be measured using the patient’s nondominant arm. If the patient is ambidextrous, the same arm used for office blood pressure and HBPM readings should be used. 
ABPM  
The appropriately sized cuff should be placed on the correct arm following the instructions in the 
Study Manual. Consecutive (daily) use of over-the-counter NSAIDs should be avoided for at 
least 7 days prior to ABPM measurements. ABPM should be started prior to the morning dose of antihypertensive medication. All ABPM collections must be in the outpatient/ambulatory state. 
ABPM recordings that are associated with dosing visits must be obtained in advance of the visit 
(within 7 days before the corresponding dosing visit) and the results reviewed prior to dosing. 
During the 24-hour monitoring period, patients must avoid strenuous exercise but should 
otherwise maintain their usual level of physical activity. The ABPM is programmed to take 
readings every 20 minutes during the day (6 am to 9:59 pm) and every 30 minutes during the night (10 pm to 5:59 am). While awake, the patient should hold their arm still by their side while 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  78 the device is inflating for a reading. Patients must record the timing of going to sleep, waking up, 
and any oral medications taken during the ABPM, and these responses must be entered into the 
eCRF.  
After the monitoring period is complete, upload the ABPM data to receive a report with 
adequacy assessment. An ABPM will be considered adequate if (1) the number of successful 
daytime readings is ≥33, (2) the number of successful nighttime readings is ≥11, and (3) no more than 3 hours are not represented (ie, 3 sections of 60 minutes where 0 valid readings were 
obtained). If the ABPM recording is inadequate (either during the Run-in Period or after the 
second randomization), the patient will be provided 1 opportunity to repeat the study within 2 days. If the second ABPM recording is also inadequate during screening, the patient is a run -in 
failure.  
Office Blood Pressure  
Office blood pressure must be measured using the automated blood pressure device provided by the Sponsor and the arm selected during screening. 
Office blood pressure should be measured early in the visit, before phlebotomy or other 
potentially stressful assessments. To minimize confounding by circadian changes, study visits 
should be scheduled for a consistent timeframe of the day. The use of inhaled short- acting beta 
agonists should be avoided within 6 hours prior to measuring blood pressure and/or heart rate. 
The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil) 
should be avoided within 48 hours prior to measuring blood pressure. Consecutive (daily) use of 
over-the-counter NSAIDs should be avoided for at least 7 days prior to office blood pressure measurements.  
Before measuring blood pressure, confirm that there has been no exercise or use of caffeine or nicotine- or tobacco-containing products (including but not limited to snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, nicotine patches, or e- cigarettes) with in the last 30 minutes. If necessary, 
delay blood pressure assessment to meet these requirements. Because a full bladder can impact blood pressure measurements, ask the patient to use the bathroom before the assessment. 
All office blood pressure assessments will include both seated and standing measurements.  
Seated Office Blood Pressure Measurement:  For
  seated measurements, the patient should be in a 
comfortable resting position in a chair with their back supported and their feet flat on the floor. 
• Place the appropriately sized cuff on the correct arm with no clothing between the 
pat
ient’s arm and the cuff and with the midpoint of the bladder length positioned over 
the brachial artery (located by palpation). The arm should be supported on an armrest or table with mid -cuff at heart level and the palm facing the ceiling.  
• Follow the Study Manual to initiate the automated blood pressure device’s seated measurement protocol. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 4 sequential blood pressure measurements at 1-minute intervals. The seated blood 
pressure fo r the visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual 
measurements.  
• During the device’s seated measurement protocol, the patient should remain at rest 
without distraction (avoid mobile phones). The following script may be used: “The 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AGT01 -003  ALN -AGT01 ( zilebesiran ) 
Original, 25 August 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  79 blood pressure device works best when you are at rest and without any distraction, so 
the staff will avoid interacting with you during this assessment. This assessment  will 
include a 5 -minute period of rest, followed by about 5 minutes of the device inflating 
to measure your blood pressure”. 
Standing Office Blood Pressure Measurement: A standing measurement should be obtained 
immediately after collection of the seated measurements.  
• Being careful to maintain the cuff’s position, ask the patient to stand with the cuffed 
ar
m bent slightly and the hand of the cuffed arm supported at heart level.  
• Measure standing blood pressure 1 minute after standing using the automated blood pressure device’s single measurement protocol.  
• After the standing measurement, ask the patient if they experienced dizziness or light-headedness when standing and record  their response. 
If a patient is unable to report to the site for an office blood pressure assessment, a substitute “remote visit blood pressure measurement” may be obtained remotely by a visiting nurse or other appropriately trained personnel. If a home visit is not possible, a “remote visit blood pressure 
measurement” should instead be obtained using the patient’s HBPM instrument under direct 
supervision (phone call or teleconferencing) by appropriately trained study staff, following the instructions detailed in the Study Manual. Results and the remote method used will be recorded . 
HBPM  
Patients should measure HBPM in the morning, prior to breakfast/caffeine or taking morning oral medications. HBPM is not required at times when ABPM is being assessed. The HBPM 
measurement should be obtained in a room without distractions, seated comfortably with the 
back supported and feet flat on the floor. The patient will initiate the automated blood pressure program on their HBPM device. This program includes a 5-minute period of rest, followed by 4 
sequential blood pressure measurements at 1- minute in tervals. The seated blood pressure for the 
visit will be defined by the average of the last 3 individual measurements.  
To establish baseline, each patient must measure HBPM daily at least 1 week prior to the second  
randomization. If adequate baseline HBPM data are not collected during the Run-in Period, the 
patient is a run -in failure.  
After Day 1, HBPM should be measured at least 3 times per week. Patients may select the 3 days of the week that are most convenient for their personal schedule.

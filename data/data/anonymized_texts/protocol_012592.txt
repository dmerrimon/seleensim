 Phase II Study of the Hyper-CVAD Regimen in Combination with Of atumumab 
as Frontline Therapy for patients with CD-20 positive Acute Lym phoblastic 
Leukemia  
 
1.0 Objectives 
1.1 Primary Objectives: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of th e combination of 
hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab in pati ents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia with any level of CD20 expression: 
- Event-free survival - Overall response rate 
- Overall survival 
1.2 Secondary Objectives: To eval uate the safety of this combination.
  
 
2.0 Background 
 
2.1 Acute Lymphoblast ic Leukemia (ALL) 
 
Adult ALL encompasses a heterogeneous group of lymphoid maligna ncies. 
Prognosis is related to age, kar yotype, molecular profile, immu nophenotype, and 
other disease features. Prognosis  for pediatric ALL has improved significantly 
over the last several decades to current long-term survival rat es of greater than 
80% [1]. However, long-term survi val in adults is currently only 35% to 45% [2,3]. 
The predominant reason for failure is disease recurrence.  Recent advances in treatment h ave been based on the pediatrics regimens. 
Murphy et al. designed an intens ive, multi-agent chemotherapy p rogram based 
on the concept of delivery of age nts in rapid sequence in child ren with Burkitt's 
leukemias and lymphomas [4]. Because it was recognized that the se 
lymphomas/leukemias have high growth fractions and doubling tim es as short as 
25 hours, cyclosphosphamide was fractionated in the induction p hase in an 
attempt to encompass the entire generation time of the tumor as  well as to 
provide a smoother induction with fewer metabolic complications  [5]. The Total B 
regimen consists of cycles of fractionated high-dose cyclophosp hamide 
(300mg/m2 q 12 hours for six doses), vincristine, and doxorubic in alternating with 
high dose methotrexate (1g/m2) and escalating doses of ara-C. K antarjian et al 
modified this program, and devel oped the regimen of hyper-CVAD 
(hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotre xate and ara-C ) [6,7]. This 
regimen has significant activity in the treatment of Burkitt's disease, mantle cell 
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, lym phoblastic lymphoma, and aggress ive chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia with or with out Richter's transformation. Of the 2004 
patients with de novo ALL who were treated with hyper-CVAD protocol, 91% 
achieved a complete remission. The median time to achieve CR wa s 21 days 
with 81% of patients achievin g CR after one course of chemother apy. The 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018

 estimated five-year survival was 39%, and the estimated median survival time 
was 35 months.  
 2.2 Rationale for the Combinat ion of hyper-CVAD and immunothera py 
 
Expression of CD20 was associat ed with a higher incidence of relapse, lower 3-
year complete remission duration (CRD) and lower 3-year overall  survival (OS) 
rate. The independent adverse inf luence of CD20 expression on event-free 
survival (EFS) was observed in a multivariate analysis, particu larly among the 
youngest group of patients [8].  
In order to improve the outcome of these patients, several modi fications were 
incorporated. Among them the addi tion of anti CD20 monoclonal a ntibody, 
rituximab. The addition of rit uximab to the hyper-CVAD program in patients with 
CD20 expression (≥20%) improved outcome compared to historical experience, 
with 3-year CRD rates (68% vs 28%, p<0.001) and OS rates (65% v s 35%, 
p=0.01) approaching those of the CD20 negative counterparts [8] . 
 The improvement in the CRD and OS rates with the use of rituxim ab in the CD20 
positive patients (CD20 expres sion defined by a threshold ≥20%) means that 
currently, the outcome for thes e patients is identical to that of patients with CD20 
negative disease: 3-year EFS rates of 52% and 53%, respectively . Therefore, 
patients with lower expression of CD20 may benefit from monoclo nal antibodies 
with higher and more potent binding capacity. 
 
 
2.3 Ofatumumab  Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) is a
 human monoclonal anti body that targets a 
unique small-loop epitope on CD20 and elicits potent in vitro  complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), even in malignant B cells with low CD20 
expression levels. Ofatumumab wa s found to be more effective th an rituximab in 
promoting lysis of opsonized B cells via classical pathway complement CDC. 
Classical pathway CDC is initiated by binding of C1q to aggregated IgG bound to 
cells. Taylor and colleagues have recently reported on the high er capacity of 
ofatumamab when compared to ritux imab in promoting CDC [9]. In fact, their 
results indicated that binding of very small amounts of C1q to mAb-opsonized 
cells, far below the maximal C1q binding capacit y of the cells, was sufficient to 
promote CDC. Greater CDC induced by ofatumumab compared with ri tuximab 
might be due in part to a higher  level of binding of C1q to OFA -opsonized B cells. 
Also, cell-bound C1q was found to be more closely associated wi th ofatumumab 
(based on the co-localization studies), likely functioning more effectively to 
activate the classical C pathway and promote CDC.  
 Ofatumumab has been shown to be safe and active in chronic lymp hocytic 
leukemia (CLL). In a phase I/II study, 12 of 26 relapsed patien ts who had 
received 4 weekly infusions of up to 2,000 mg of ofatumumab res ponded [10]. 
Time to progression and time to next therapy was 161 and 366 da ys, 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018

 respectively. The interim results of a non-randomized phase III  registration trial in 
patients with CLL who progressed after fludarabine and alemtuzumab (DR) or 
who are refractory to fludarabine and have bulky adenopathy (BF R) have been 
recently reported. The objective response rate ORR was 51% (34,  68%) for the 
DR group and 44% (30, 59%) for the BFR group. Median time to next CLL 
therapy was 9 months for the DR group and 8 months for the BFR group. The 
median OS was about 14 months for the DR group and 15 m onths for the BFR 
group [11]. A phase II study of ofatumumab combined with cyclop hosphamide 
and fludarabine in previously unt reated patients recently compl eted accrual.

1.  Monitoring Visit Intervals 
 
The Clinical Research Monitor (CRM) will notify the site in wri ting of planned visits 
and the purpose of the visit to ensure the availability of medi cal records, study 
personnel and regulatory documents if they are scheduled for re view. 
 
 THE INITIAL MONITORING VISIT WILL OCCUR AFTER THE FIRST SUBJECT HAS COMPLETED THEIR FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT. 
 
 INTERIM SITE MONITORING  VISITS WILL THEN BE 
CONDUCTED EVERY 8-12 WEEKS DURING THE ENROLLMENT PHASE OF THE STUDY.  
 
 ADDITIONAL MONITORING VISITS MAY BE CONDUCTED IF: 
ENROLLMENT PROCEEDS MORE RAPIDLY THAN EXPECTED; 
DATA FORMS ARE NOT BEING COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND/OR THE SITE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
PROTOCOL, FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, AND GCP. 
 
2.  Enrollment   The research team will be responsible for screening and enrolli ng all subjects. 
During scheduled monitoring visits protocol eligibility criteri a will be reviewed for 
each pre-selected subject in order to verify that all criteria were met, and the 
subject was eligible for study participation.  
 3.  Monitoring Requirements  The following procedures will be performed during each monitoring visit unless otherwise indicated:  
 The CRM will generate queries, and provide them in writing to the PI and 
research team. A meeting with the CRM and research team to disc uss the 
queries will be encouraged. 
 Findings will be recorded in the Monitoring Visit Report. 
 A Follow-up Visit Memo will be submitted to the investigator i ndicating all 
outstanding issues and significant findings that require attent ion as well as 
any deviations/violations.   
 For this phase II trial, subjects 1 and 2 will be monitored; an d 30% of future 
accruals will be reviewed. Additional subjects may be monitored  as needed and 
determined by the sponsor.   
  2010-0708

 The Monitoring Log (which will be located in the regulatory bin der) will be 
signed/dated by the CRM and the research team. 
 
3.1  SOURCE DOCUMENT VERIFICATION 
 All existing source material including, but not limited to, progress notes, laboratory results, hospital admission reco rds, discharge summaries, consultations, 
diagnostic testing results, and documentation of all clinic (in cluding study-
specified) visits along with all other clinical data in support  of case report form 
entries that comprise the stud y database will be compared and v erified.   
 CRMs will review 100% of the source documentation for the subjects selected for monitoring; and compare the case report form entries with the s ource documents 
to ensure that the data is complete, accurate, and all study pr ocedures were 
conducted per protocol specifications.  3.2 Informed Consent Process  CRMs will verify that the current IRB-approved informed consent form was used to obtain informed consent, that  the dates of signatures preced e the performance 
of any study-related procedures and that all required signature s are present.  
Comparison of signature dates w ill be made against the required notation in the 
subjects’ medical record regarding the informed consent process  between the 
subject and the individual obtaining consent.   
 
3.3 Study Drug Accountability/Administration  
Pharmacy records regarding study drug shipping, receipt, storag e and return, 
documentation of destruction documents compared against physica l inventory and 
dispensing records will be reviewed periodically throughout the  study.   
 
For each subject the CRM will verify the following: 
 
 dose modification scheme was adjusted accordingly 
 that the appropriate dose and volume were prepared and 
administered  
 that dose interruption/delay guidelines as outlined in the pro tocol 
were followed 
     
 
4. Subject Visits  CRMs will verify that all subject visits have occurred within p rotocol accepted 
windows.  For missed visits and subjects who are lost-to-follow -up, the CRM will 
verify that the site recorded all attempts to contact the subject in source documents 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018 
10 
 
 and that protocol procedures for documentation were followed.  Substantial 
deviations from the protocol and data management guidelines wil l be reported to 
the investigator and documented in the Monitoring Visit Report. 
 
5.  Adverse Event Reporting 
 
CRM’s will verify AEs are graded using NCI Common Toxicity Grad ing Criteria (CTC) 
as noted in the protocol and that causality is appropriately as signed by the Principal 
Investigator.  The CRM will ensure serious adverse events are r eported per sponsor 
and IRB guidelines.  6. Concomitant  Medication 
 All of the enrolled subjects’ co ncomitant medications will be c ollected and readily 
available in the MDACC electronic medical record and will not b e entered into the 
CRF.  7. Laboratory Specimen Samples, Handling and Reporting  CRM’s will verify that protocol specific laboratory tests are d ocumented as having 
been obtained according to protocol. In addition, CRMs will ver ify the following: 
 
 documentation indicative of review and sign-off for laboratory  results by 
the Principal Investigator or designee with any clinically sign ificant 
results denoted as such. 
 
 lab reports will be checked against data forms and results che cked 
against NCI Common Toxicity Grading Criteria to ensure that 
clinically significant results  are recorded by study personnel as 
adverse events as outlined in the protocol 
 
8. Response 
 
CRMs will verify that all response assessments will be obtained , handled and 
documented according to protocol  9. Data Recording 
 
PDMS, the electronic case report forms (eCRF) will be utilized for this study.  The 
CRM will review the eCRF’s in comparison to all available sourc e data during 
interim monitoring visits.  Queries will be generated by the CR M during the site 
visit and submitted to the re search team for resolution. 
 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018

 10. Regulatory Document File Review 
 Periodically throughout the trial the CRM will review the site' s regulatory document 
file for updated information, accuracy and completeness.  
11. Monitoring Visit Reports 
 Monitoring visit reports will be completed and forwarded to the  IND Medical Monitor 
for review.  
 
Information will include , but not be limited to: 
 
 enrollment updates 
 inventory of informed consent s and supportive source data 
 status of completion o f data forms and queries 
 data quality issues 
 new SAEs (including deaths) and updates on previously reported  
SAEs 
 protocol compliance/protocol deviations 
 compliance with all applicable regulations and GCP 
 concerns/issues expressed by study site personnel 
 premature terminations or subjects lost-to-follow-up 
 
The monitor will attempt to meet with the study coordinator at each visit, document 
discussions and note any follow-up that is required in a follow -up letter to the 
investigator.  
 Status of previously identified issues will be addressed in subsequent visit reports, including actions taken.   12.  Deviations/Violations  Deviations/violations from the protocol and applicable regulations will be 
documented in the Monitoring Vi sit Report and reported to the i nvestigator.  
 13. Study Discontinuation   After the last subject has been removed from the study, a final closeout visit will be conducted to ensure all data is complete and regulatory docu ments are in order.  
The CRM will generate a close-out visit report that will outlin e the status of all trial 
documents and data.  5.1 General 
 
All patients are registered through CORE 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018

 No dose escalations beyond those specified in the protocol are allowed. Other 
variations to the treatment pla n outlined are allowed if felt t o be in the best clinical 
interest of the patient. Major deviations should be discussed w ith the Principal 
Investigator.   
Dexamethasone 40mg IV or PO on D1-4 of the induction course are  encouraged 
to be completed despite any dos es given as supportive care prio r to start of 
protocol treatment, but omission of one or more of these doses in the best 
interest of the patient per the treating physician will not be considered a deviation 
and does not require di scussion with the PI.   Patients with Burkitt 
Leukemia/Lymphoma will only receive induction, consolidation an d intrathecal 
chemotherapy as per protocol. T hey will not receive maintenance  therapy nor will 
they receive late intensification. 
 
 After three major deviations, while the participants are on pro tocol treatment the 
course will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator for consi deration of removal 
from study with monitoring for di sease-free and overall surviva l only. 
 Examples of these clinical scenarios include: 1- Treatment delays (> 14 days f rom recovery) despite hematologic recovery for 
reasons of patients request or  unavoidable social situations. T reatment delays to 
allow recovery from infections or other toxicities of therapy w ill not be considered 
deviations, as these are expected complicat ions of the therapy.  
2- Dose reductions or alterati ons in the chemotherapy administr ation beyond 
those specified in the protocol  for reasons of patient request or unavoidable 
social situations. Dose reducti ons performed for clinical reaso ns will not be 
considered deviations, as patient s may have unique toxicities or tolerance not 
accounted for by st andard dose reductions. 
3- Other clinical scenarios after approval by the Principal Inv estigator. 
 5.2 Doses and Schedule General: 
 
Hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab  consists of 8 cycles of d ose intensive therapy with 
hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab (odd courses) alternating with high-dos e 
methotrexate and cytarabine + of atumumab (even courses) adminis tered 
approximately every 21-28 days (may delay for recovery from mye losuppression 
or infection; or sooner if count recovery allows).   
 1- Hyper-CVAD (courses 1, 3, 5,  and 7) will alternate with high -dose 
methotrexate/cytarabine (courses 2, 4, 6, and 8) administered a pproximately 
every 21 days or later to allow for recovery from myelosuppress ion or infection; 
or earlier if count recovery allows. 2- Anti-emetic therapy with eac h course of intensive chemothera py as indicated. 
3- Filgrastim product (G-CSF) a t 10 mcg/kg/day (rounded) or peg filgrastim 6 mg 
as a single dose within 72 +/- 48 hours may be given after chem otherapy until 
  2010-0708

 neutrophil recovery to at least 1 x 109/l or higher. G-CSF may be stopped earlier 
for bone pain or other related toxicity. 
Next course may be started when granulocytes >= 1 x 109/L and platelets >= 50 
x 109/L, following discontinuation of F ilgrastim product (G-CSF). Co urses may be 
started with dose reductions prio r to full platelet recovery, i f the treatment is 
delayed (e.g., 28 days or later f rom the start of last course).   Instances where lab 
results fall outside of above cr iteria in the time between eval uation of next course 
and the actual start of next course will not be considered a de viation.  Start of 
courses in the best interest of the patient outside these param eters need to be 
discussed with and approved by the PI with reasons documented.  The choice of 
filgrastim product will be deter mined by the institutional formulary and patient’s 
insurance. 
 
4- Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. levaquin, trimethprim-sulfame thoxazole, 
fluconazole, valacyclovir) may be  given with each course as ind icated until

Maintenance Therapy: 1- Patients may be moved from th e intensive chemotherapy to the  maintenance 
phase prior to completion of 8  cycles of chemotherapy if signif icantly intolerant of 
the intensive chemotherapy after  discussion with the Principal Investigator.  A 
maintenance cycle will be defined as 28 days. 2- Maintenance chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), metho trexate 
(MTX), vincristine, and prednisone (POMP) for approximately 30 months (except 
for consolidations with hyper-C VAD + ofatumumab followed by 
MTX/pegaspargase [or vice versa] at Course 6 and 7 and MTX/pega spargase 
followed by hyper-CVAD-ofatumum ab [or vice versa] at course 18 and 19)

 3- Dose adjustments for myelos uppression include MTX and 6-MP, but not 
vincristine or prednisone (the la tter should remain 200 mg unle ss steroid 
myopathy or other uncontrolled si gnificant toxicity occurs). Ti trate to keep 
granulocytes >= 1 x 109/L and platelet count >= 50 x 109/L. 
4- Methotrexate 
- Decrease by one dose level for mucositis > grade 2. 
- Decrease by one dose level for bilirubin > 2.5 or elevation o f transaminases >= 
5 x upper limit of normal. - Hold if granulocyte count nadir < 0.5 x 10
9/L or platelets < 10 x 109/L, resume 
with decrease in one dose level  or lower depending on duration of cytopenias. 
5- 6-mercaptopurine - Decrease by one dose level for bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL or eleva tion of 
transaminases >= 5 x upper limit of normal. - Hold if granulocyte count nadir < 0.5 x 10
9/L or platelets < 10 x 109/L, resume 
with decrease in one dose level  or lower depending on duration of cytopenias. 
6- Vincristine - Decrease by one dose level  for >= grade 2 peripheral neuropat hy persisting for 
more than 2 weeks. - Discontinue for grade 3 or g reater peripheral neuropathy. 
7- Note that the dose adjustments of POMP are guidelines, and t he dosing needs 
to individualized to the patient, as differential toxicities between 6-MP and methotrexate may be difficult to discern.  Continued antiviral prophylaxis  to prevent herpes zoster is strongly encouraged. 
Consider antifungal prophylaxis  during days of prednisone. Cons ider PCP 
prophylaxis.  Early and Late Intensifications ( interrupting maintenance phase  as follows): 
-Two courses of chemotherapy mont hs 6 (methotrexate + pegasparg ase) and 7 
(hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab) of maintenance, repeated at months 18  
(methotrexate + pegaspargase) and 19 (hyper-CVAD + ofatumumab) of 
maintenance Hyper-CVAD may pre cede or follow MTX + pegaspargase .  
 
 
Methotrexate 100 mg/m2 day 1 IV over 2 hours and pegaspargase at a dose of 
2000 IU/m2 dose will be capped at 3,750 international on units day 2 by I V over 2 
hours and this dose will be reduced to 1000 IU/m2 on day 2 by IV over 2 hours on 
patients older than 60 years of age. Hyper- CVAD + ofatumumab 
Cyclophosphamide (CTX) 300 mg/m2 IV over 3 h every 12 hrs x 6 doses

- Intensification course may be started when granulocytes >= 1 x 109/L and 
platelets >= 50 x 109/L following discontinuation of Filgrastim product (G-CSF). 
Courses may be started with dos e reductions prior to full plate let recovery, if the 
treatment is delayed (e.g., 28 days or later from the start of last course.)  
Instances where lab results fall outside of above criteria in t he time between 
evaluation of next course and the actual start of next course w ill not be 
considered a deviation.  Start of courses in the best interest of the patient outside 
these parameters need to be disc ussed with and approved by the PI with 
reasons documented - Intensifications may be elimi nated or given alternate months of the maintenance 
therapy, depending on patient toler ance and/or clinical situati on, with reasons 
documented. - Treating physician has discret ion to repeat course 1 dose esc alation of 
ofatumumab during maintenance intensification  All infusion times are approxim ate.  Infusion time variations d ue to IV bag 
overfill/underfill and instituti onal policy on IV flush solutions will not result in a 
protocol deviation.  Administration of oral medications will be documented via diary or verbally by the patient. Occasional missed doses of an  oral medication 
will not result in a protocol violation.  5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Management  
1. Standard CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate and a ra-C with 
each course if no evidence of CNS disease. Total number of prop hylactic 
intrathecal treatments:= 8, except for patients with Burkitt’s Leukemia/Lymphoma will receive 16, consisting of 2 intrathecal treatments 
with methotrexate and ara-C with each course until total number  reached. 
Missed intrathecals (e.g., related to failed procedure attempts, scheduling issues, patient social situati ons) can be "made up" with subseq uent 
courses of chemotherapy. All patients will receive 8 intrathecal treatments except for patients with Burkitt’s Leukemia/Lymphoma will recei ve 16. 
 
2. If the patient has been previously treated, and has had prio r intrathecal 
therapy, or prior CNS disease, discuss management of CNS prophylaxis/therapy with the Principal Investigator. 
 
3. If active CNS disease: methotr exate alternating with ara-C twice weekly 
until CSF clear; then once weekly for 4 weeks, then back to pro phylactic 
schedule. Consider XRT to the base of the skull, particularly w ith cranial 
nerve root involvement (cranial nerve palsies, except for instances where 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018 
19 
 
 intrathecal therapy alone is expec ted to produce a response (e. g., mental 
neuropathy, isolated lateral re ctus palsy). Alternative methods  of treating 
CNS disease are allowed if appropr iate for the patient (e.g., intrathecal 
liposomal ara-C, topotecan, ifosfam ide, radionucleotides or oth ers). 
 
4. Additional intrathecal treatments done as prophylaxis may be  allowed after 
discussion with the PI.  
 
5. Additional Intrathecal treatments done as clinically indicated during 
exploratory lumbar puncture for symptoms of suspected CNS relap se are 
allowed and will not be consi dered a deviation from the protoco l.  
 
6. LPs done outside of window will not be considered a deviatio n if dose is 
made up (if clinically indicated). 
  5.4 Mediastinal disease Patients with mediastinal lymphoblastic lymphoma and bulky medi astinal disease 
(defined as >= 7 cm) or resi dual mediastinal lymphadenopathy at  the end of the 
intensive chemotherapy portion of the treatment should be consi dered for 
consolidative mediastinal irradi ation after recovery from the l ast course of 
consolidation therapy and prior to the maintenance phase of the rapy. 
 5.5 Maintenance therapy Maintenance therapy is planned for all patients as described in  section 5.2, 
unless toxicity prohibits. Pati ents may move to  the maintenance  phase of therapy 
prior to completion of cycles 2 to 8 if they develop side effec ts prohibiting further 
intensive chemotherapy. Patient s who do not complete all therap y per protocol, 
but remain in remission, will not be considered off-protocol, but will be monitored for disease-free survival only.  An end-of-treatm ent date will i ndicate completion 
of therapy.  
5.6 Monitoring Patients on Study 
1- The hyper-CVAD regimens have been conducted since 1992, and have 
accrued over 500 patients on similar induction-consolidation-ma intenance 
phases. The treatment-associated side effects, both myelosuppre ssive and 
extramedullary are well-known, and have been described and repo rted. Known 
and anticipated side effects of t his regimen (see Appendix D) will not be reported 
as individual ADRs, according to the Code of Federal Regulation s and ICH 
guidelines - CGP Section 4.11.1, p. 24. This also complies with the NCI CTEP-CTC guidelines which state that  for expected events "grade 4 myelosuppression 
or other grade 4 events that do not require expedited reporting will be specified in 
the protocol." AEs will not be co llected in the maintenance pha se, only SAEs will 
be collected.

   2- The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and   
  providing source documentation for all adverse events and ass igning the   
  attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the t rial. Adverse events  
  (event name, grade, start/stop date, and attribution will be documented in the  
  medical record and entered into  the case report form).  PDMS/CORE will be  
  used  as the electronic case report form for this protocol 
 3- Recognizing there will be inst ances where patients cannot receive all of their 
care at M.D. Anderson Cancer C enter, the following monitoring p lan is proposed: 
- All patients who are enrolled o n the protocol, will receive their courses of 
therapy that incorporate ofatumumab.  - Subsequent courses of t herapy may be given by a local physici an under 
direction of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center treating physician  or the Principal 
Investigator. The referring physician will be identified, conta cted and the protocol 
details discussed. - It will be detailed that therapy  should not be administered except at the direction 
of the Principal Investigator or treating physician at M.D. And erson. A review of 
laboratory data, review of comp liance with the program, and rev iew of toxicities 
will be performed. The participant s will be informed of the int ended procedure, 
and that their physician will be asked to comply, or they may b e removed from 
the protocol. 4- Physicians will be requested to sign a letter stipulating th ese items, and 
indicating their willingness to participate in the therapy as r equested. Direction of 
therapy will be documented in th e patient's medical record. 
5- Documentation will  be requested from outside physicians, inc luding drug 
administration records to ensure that the orders were followed.  Outside 
physicians will be ask ed to contact us for prior approval of an y decisions or 
changes related to the chemother apy.  However, dose holds by th e patient or 
local physician due to illness or concern for injury that are i nitiated prior to 
speaking with MDACC treating physician but are then reported to  the MDACC 
Treating physician will not be considered a deviation. Note tha t occasional 
missed doses of medication self – administered by patient will be not be listed as 
a deviation.

8.0 Criteria for Response 8.1 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Complete remission (CR) : 
Normalization of the peripheral b lood and bone marrow with 5% o r less blasts in 
marrow with a granuloc yte count of 1 x 10
9/L or above and a platelet count of 100 
x 109/L or above. Complete resolution of all sites of extramedullary  disease is 
required for CR.   Partial response (PR) : 
As above, except for the pres ence of 6-25% marrow blasts. 
 8.2 Lymphoblastic lymphoma (wit h extramedullary disease) except  for patients 
with Burkitt’s Leukemia/Lymphoma: 8.21 Objective response of bi- dimensionally measurable and uni- dimensionally 
measurable parameters: Complete response (CR) : 
Complete disappearance of all known disease. Partial response (PR): 50% or more decrease in tumor siz e using the sum of the product  (bi-

 9.0 Evaluation of Toxicity 
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI Expanded Common Toxicity 
Criteria (see Appendix F).  10.0 Criteria for Removal from the Study 
Criteria for removal from study i nclude, but are not restricted to, the following: 
10.1 Progressive disease. 
10.2 Non-compliance by the patient  with protocol requirements. 
10.3 Patient's request to be removed from the study.  11.0 Statistical Considerations This is a phase II study of Hype r-CVAD + ofatumumab in patients  with CD-20 
positive acute leukemia (ALL). The primary objective is to eval uate the event-free 
survival (EFS), where the event-free survival will be measured from the start of 
therapy until failure to respond, relapse or death.   Historical data suggested that t he 3-year EFS rate in patients with CD-20 positive 
ALL was 50% with a median surviv al of 3 years. It will be promi sing if the 3-year 
EFS rate will increase to 65%- 70% with the treatment of Hyper-C VAD + 
ofatumumab with a potential medi an survival of 4.8 to 5.8 years . Assuming the 
event-free survival time follows  an exponential distribution, t he estimated median 
event-free survival time was 3 years for historical standard treatment, and it is 
expected to improve the median ev ent-survival time to 4.8 to 5. 8 years in this 
study.  A maximum of 80 will be recruited for the study at a rate of < 1 patient per month, leading to a maximum acc rual period of 1 year and five m onths. 
Assuming the median event-free survival time is 3 years, then t he 95% credible 
interval with 80 patients would be (2.22, 4.05), while assuming  median survival 
time is 4.8 years, then the 95% c redible interval with 80 patie nts would be (3.56,  
6.49).  The toxicity and efficacy will be monitored during the study, and all the 
data will be used to update the pr ior distributions for toxicit y and efficacy 
parameters. The study will be stopped for toxicity and futility  based on the 
following stopping rules.   
 
The primary endpoint time-to-event  will be monitored using the method of Thall et 
al.[13] Let T
E and T S represent the event-free surv ival time for the experimental 
treatment and standard treatment r espectively. We assume that b oth  T E | m E 
and T S | mS follow exponential distributions with median m E and m S. We also 
assume that m E and m S have a inverse gamma distribution, with prior 
distributions of m S ~ IG(50, 1746) and m E ~ IG(3, 72). Throughout the trial, we 
will update the distribution on m E and will stop if at any point. 
                                            Prob(m E > m S |data) < 0.05

toxicity by 
E, where non-hematologic toxicity is defined as any Grade 3 or

will stop the trial if, at any t ime during the study, we determ ine that there is more 
than 85% chance that the toxicity  rate is more than 30%. Stoppi ng boundaries

 Analysis Plan: For discrete or categorical data, descriptive statistics will include tabulations of frequencies.  For continuous data,  summary statistics including  n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minim um and maximum will be compute d.  The 
posterior median time to event and it 95% credible interval wil l be estimated.  
Kaplan-Meier method, Log rank test and Cox proportional hazards  regression 
modeling will be utilized to analyze event free survival and ov erall survival.    
 
This study will utilize the clinical conduct (CTC) website 
(https://biostatistics.mdanders on.org/ClinicalTrialConduct   ma intained by the 
Department of Biostatistics to monitor event-free-surv   12.0 Reporting Requirements 12.1 See Appendix D for guideline s for reporting ADR's to the I RB. Adverse 
events should be reported for 30 days post last dose of Ofatumu mab or until

that did not worsen. 
12.4.2 Treatment on an emergency , outpatient basis for an event  not fulfilling any 
of the definitions of serious g iven above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
12.4.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) for M. D. Anderson -Sponsored 
IND Protocols  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “s erious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator  or the sponsor, it results in a ny of the following 
outcomes:  Death 
 A life-threatening adverse dr ug experience – any adverse exper ience that 
places the patient, in the view  of the initial reporter, at imm ediate risk of 
death from the adverse experienc e as it occurred. It does not i nclude an 
adverse experience that, had it o ccurred in a more severe form,  might 
have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization 
 A persistent or significant inc apacity or substantial disrupti on of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 Important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of t he outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events i nclude allergic bronchospasm r equiring 
intensive treatment i n an emergency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or 
convulsions that do not result in  inpatient hospitalization, or  the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 
 Important medical events as def ined above, may also be conside red 
serious adverse events. Any imp ortant medical event can and sho uld be 
reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal Inves tigator or 
the IND Sponsor, IND Office. 
 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith the 
timeframes and procedures outli ned in “The University of Texas M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unantic ipated Adverse Events for Dru gs and 
Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of a ttribution 
(within 5 working days of  knowledge of the event). 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018

 All life-threatening or fatal e vents, that are unexpected, and related to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hour s (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Ma nager in 
the IND Office.  
 
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be 
utilized for safety reporting to  the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the f irst protocol-
specific intervention, until 30 days after the last dose of dru g, unless the 
participant withdraws consent. Serious adverse events must be f ollowed 
until clinical recovery is com plete and laborator y tests have returned to 
baseline, progression of the even t has stabilized, or there has  been 
acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
 Additionally, any serious adver se events that o ccur after the 30 day time 
period that are related to the study treatment must be reported  to the IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary maligna ncy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 
 Serious adverse events will be  forwarded to FDA by the IND Spo nsor 
(Safety Project Manager IND Office ) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
 It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to en sure serious 
adverse events are reported ac cording to the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Good Clinical Pract ices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy 
  
12.5 Update of Adverse Event (AE)  Data Capture Required as of 1 2/8/2015 
on all active treatment patients  
 
Adverse events are collected in accordance with the Leukemia Sp ecific AE 
Recording Guidelines under Appendix D. In accordance with these guidelines, only unexpected AEs will be reco rded in the Case Report Form (C RF). An AE is 
considered to be unexpected if it is “not listed in the investi gator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or  severity that has been observe d; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not cons istent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or el sewhere in the 
current application, as amend ed” (21 CFR § 312.32, 2015). Event s expected 
during leukemia therapy are also listed within the Leukemia Spe cific AE 
Recording Guidelines.   
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018 
28 
 
 Abnormal hematologic values wil l not be captur ed in the CRFs or  on the 
Leukemia AE Record. Only the highest grade per course of grade 3 or 4 
chemistry lab abnormalities will be captured on the AE Record a s well. All 
Serious Adverse Events will be c aptured on the Leukemia AE Reco rd as well as 
entered in the CRFs, regardless of expectedness. 
 
Any “unexpected” AE will have su ch noted in the comments sectio n of the AE 
Records moving forward. The Principal Investigator will sign an d date the AE log 
per each patient after the completion of each course.    12.6 Novartis Adverse Events 
 
 Adverse Events: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical invest igation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whet her or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definit ion of an AE include: 
 Any abnormal laboratory test res ults (hematology, clinical che mistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety asse ssments e.g., ECGs, radiologica l scans, vital 
signs measurements), including thos e that worsen from baseline, and felt to 
be clinically significant in t he medial and scientific judgment  of the 
investigator 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditi on including 
either an increase in frequency  and/or intensity of the conditi on 
 New conditions detected or diagn osed after investigational pro duct 
administration even though it may  have been present prior to th e start of the 
study 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinic al sequelae of a suspected inter action 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinic al sequelae of a suspected overd ose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose p er se will not 
be reported as an AE/SAE) 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological acti on” per se will not 
be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack o f efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition 
of an AE or SAE. Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unl ess judged 
by the investigator to be more s evere than expected for the sub ject’s 
condition.  
  2010-0708

  The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, s igns, or 
symptoms of the disease/disor der being studied, unless more sev ere than 
expected for the subject’s condition 
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy);  the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social 
and/or convenience admission to a hospital) 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuati ons of pre-existing disease(s)  or condition(s) 
present or detected at the star t of the study that do not worse n 
 B cell depletion and hypogammaglob ulinemia due to ofatumumab t reatment 
Definition of a SAE 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that , at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life-threatening 
NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening ' in the definition of 'seriou s' refers to an 
event in which the subject was a t risk of death at the time of the event.  It 
does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have cau sed death, if it 
were more severe. 
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospita lization 
NOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject h as been 
detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting.  Complications that 
occur during hospitalization ar e AEs.  If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any o ther serious criteria, the eve nt is serious.  When 
in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necess ary, the AE 
should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective tr eatment of a pre-existing condit ion that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. An overnight hospital stay due to slow infusion rates will not be considered a 
Serious Adverse Event. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life f unctions.  This definition is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor medical significance su ch as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not  constitute a substantial dis ruption. 
  2010-0708 
  November 5, 2018 
30 
 
 e. Is a congenital anom aly/birth defect 
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important  medical events 
that may not be immediately li fe-threatening or result in death  or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize  the subject or may require m edical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes list ed in the above 
definition.  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such 
events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment i n an 
emergency room or at home for a llergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or developme nt of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Laboratory and Other Safety Asses sment Abnormalities Reported as AEs 
and SAEs 
 Any abnormal laboratory test res ults (hematology, clinical che mistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiologic al scans, 
vital signs measurements), includi ng those that worsen from baseline, and 
felt to be clinically signific ant in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
 
 All events meeting liver stopping criteria must be recorded as  an SAE.  
 
 However, any clinically signific ant safety assessments that ar e associated 
with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the subject’s condition, are not to be reported as 
AEs or SAEs. 
 
 B cell depletion, IgG below  LLN, low CD19+ count, and 
hypogammaglobulinemia due to tr eatment with ofatumumab are not to be 
reported as AEs or SAEs. 
 
 Infusion related AEs may lead to  a prolonged infusion time. Ov ernight stay 
at the hospital due to slow infusion rate is not to be reported as a SAE. 
 
 
Disease-Related Events and/or Di sease-Related Outcomes Not Qual ifying 
as SAEs 
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease und er study (i.e., 
disease progression) does not n eed to be reported as an SAE.  H owever, if the 
progression of the underlying dis ease is greater than that whic h would normally 
be expected for the subject, or if the investigator considers t hat there was a 
causal relationship between treat ment with investigational prod uct or protocol 
design/procedures and the diseas e progression, then this must b e reported as an 
SAE.

 Time Period and Frequency of Detecting and SAEs 
 
Once an investigator determines  that an event meets the protoco l definition of an 
SAE, the SAE will be reported to NOVARTIS within 24 hours of be ing notified of 
the event. All SAEs regardless o f relationship to investigational product will be 
collected from the first dose of investigat ional product to aft er the last dose of 
investigational product (30 days post last dose of Ofatumumab o r until another 
treatment is received).  All SAEs regardless of causality will be collected for 30 
days post last dose of Ofatumuma b or until another treatment is  received. 
 From the time a subject consents  to participate in and complete s the study all 
SAEs assessed as related  to study participation  (e.g., protocol-mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to 
NOVARTIS concomitant medication , will be reported promptly to NOVARTIS. 
 Any SAE brought to the investigator’s attention after the subje ct has completed 
the study and considered by the investigator as possibly relate d to investigational 
product must be reported to NOVARTIS.  Pregnancy  Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to 
NOVARTIS.   To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be re ported to 
NOVARTIS within 2 weeks of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome ( including premature terminati on) and status of 
mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective termina tions for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be 
reported as an SAE. 
 Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to t he investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the study and conside red by the 
investigator as possibly relat ed to the investigational product , must be promptly 
reported to NOVARTIS.  In addition, the investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy information must be reported t o NOVARTIS as 
described above.

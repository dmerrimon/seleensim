CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY2ABSTRACT
Chronic liver disorders (CLD) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals in the US.  Though  serologic analysis will often lead to a  conclusive diagnosis,  liver biopsy remains an  
important method for helping to determine the  etiology  and stage of LD.  Percutaneous liver 
biopsy (PLB), transjugluar liver  biopsy (TLB) and surgical liver biopsy (SLB) are alternative 
methods for  obtaining  hepatic tissue.  In recent  years endoscopic ultrasound guided-liver biopsy 
(EUS-LB) has come to the forefront as  a safe  and effective method for obtaining tissue  in CLD.  
There are several studies of the  safety  of EUS-LB as well as the adequacy of specimens obtained 
in this  fashion.  Most studies involve a 19-gauge needle, therefore in  this study we hope to  
compare the  tissue yields of a 22-gauge FNB  needle, in comparison to conventional  19-gauge.  
We predict  that 19 and  22 gauge FNB needle will  demonstrate similar diagnostic accuracy,  with 
less visible blood artifact.  Similarly we predict  the safety to be  equal.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY3BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE
Chronic liver disease has  a number of causes, and leads to  significant mortality and morbidity in  
the United States.  It has  been estimated  that roughly 36,000 individuals die annually from the 
burden of chronic liver disease, thus early diagnosis and  intervention  are paramount to 
preventing such  complications [1].   Though serologic markers and non-invasive  diagnostic  
imaging modalities are used as a  method for determining the  underlying  disease process,  these 
methods lack the specificity of determining  etiology of a  patient’s  chronic liver  disease [2-5].   
Therefore, liver biopsy remains  the “gold standard” for obtaining valuable diagnostic and 
prognostic information.  
At present there exist  several methods for liver tissue acquisition.   The most  widely accepted 
method remains  percutaneous route  (PLB), which utilizes percussion  or imaging to  localization 
the biopsy site [6-8].  The issue with this approach  is its potential complication  of post-
procedural pain in  up to 84%, bleeding in 1/2500-10,000 procedures, with under 1/10,000  of 
these cases being fatal  [7-17].   Another  means for obtaining tissue samples is the transjugular  
route (TLB),  which also allows for  portal pressure measurement, and is usually reserved  for 
patients with coagulopathy[18,19].  
More recently, endoscopic  ultrasound  guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB) has been developed  as a 
newer LB technique [23,24].  The feasibility of EUS-LB for liver lesions has been validated  
yielding excellent  diagnostic results in several studies  [25-27].  This technique has also  been  
evaluated for hepatic  parenchymal disease with up to 90% diagnostic yield.  Subsequently, EUS-
LB using  a 19-gauge needle was compared to percutaneous/transjugular routes showing at least 
comparative, and in some instances  improved  sample acquisition, versus  other  methods [28].  
Different 19-gauge needles have  been utilized in this setting yielding variable diagnostic 
specimens [29-33].  However, there  has yet  to be comparison of 19 versus a 22-gauge core 
biopsy needle for EUS-LB.  The safety profile  with the 19g needle  is remarkably good; it seems 
logical that a smaller needle would be at  least as good, if not better.
Primary End  Points
1.Proportion of cases for which a histologic  diagnosis could be made based  upon the  
amount of  tissue  obtained with the needle.
2.Number of portal tracts (PT)  in the specimen [34-36]
3.Aggregate specimen length (ASL), length  of the longest piece (LLP), and  degree of 
fragmentation 
Secondary End Points
1.Presence of a  visible  core  specimen
2.Presence of visible clots in specimen

4HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS
4.1 Hypothesis 
We predict  that the  19-gauge needle and 22-gauge core needle  will have similar ability to  obtain 
adequate EUS-LB specimens
4.2 Specific Aim 1
To determine the  adequacy of EUS-LB using a 22-gauge core needle  as compared with  19-gauge 
needle
4.3 Specific Aim 2
To determine if the 22-gauge  core needle will demonstrate less blood  artifact during the time of 
EUS-LB as  compared  with 19-gauge needle.
5PRELIMINARY DATA 
Our EUS group has  used the 22 gauge  EUS core needle in 5 patients undergoing  EUS-guided  
liver biopsy,  and cores of liver  tissue can  be obtained.  We  have found that special tissue 
handling after biopsy  is required to prevent fragmenting the tissue,  since the diameter  of the 
cores are approximately  half the diameter.  We  have improved  the technique  of tissue handling, 
and can minimize post-biopsy fragmentation.  This  can allow a  better  comparison  of different 
needle gauges.

locked cabinet in the  endoscopy center workroom.  The door to the workroom with the cabinet is 
locked after hours and the  endoscopy center is locked after hours as well.  
Upon initial  encounter,  the study shall be described to the patient  in detail by one  of the  study  
investigators and informed consent  obtained.  
Once the patients has  agreed to participate,  demographic data will be  obtained including; age, 
gender, height [inches (in)], weight [pounds (lb)], body mass index (BMI)(lb/in2), past medical 
history [in particular diagnosis  of liver disease,  biliary  or pancreatic disease, ascites, 
encephalopathy, portal hypertension, portal hypertension-related bleeding  (ie. varices), liver 
cancer or masses].  Past surgical  history shall  be obtained regarding prior cholecystectomy, 
hepatobiliary or pancreatic  surgery (i.e. pancreaticojejunostomy)  or bariatric  surgery  (ie. Roux-
en-Y gastric bypass).  Medication  and social history shall be performed regarding alcohol intake  
per week and hepatotoxic medications (i.e. acetaminophen).  A  baseline  INR  and platelet count 
shall be  performed on all individuals prior to EUS-LB, as is the standard of care.
EUS-LB Protocol
Patients undergoing EUS-LB  receive sedation prior  to the procedure, as per normal practice.  
This is  provided by a  certified registered  nurse  anesthetist (CRNA). The endosonographic study 
will be conducted with a linear array echoendoscope (GF-UC140-AL5; Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). Before needle  puncture of the desired lobe,  color Doppler  imaging  will be  
used to ensure the lack of vascular structures  in the  trajectory of the needle.  The EUS-LB will be  
performed in widely  separated regions of  the liver using a 19-gauge EUS-FNA needle (Expect  
Flexible 19g, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) and a  22-gauge  FNB  needle  (SharkCore, 
Beacon Endoscopic, Sunnyvale, CA, or Acquire 22g, Boston  Scientific,  Marlborough,  MA). A  
computer-generated randomized schema  shall  determine  initial needle  gauge selection.  
The left lobe is described as liver  parenchyma  identified a few centimeters below the 
gastroesophageal junction with the echoendoscope torqued clockwise. The right lobe is consider the large area of liver tissue can  be seen through the duodenal bulb, near the gallbladder [37]. 
The stylet is  removed, heparin flushed through the needle lumen, and  the suction device  set and 
attached to the  needle  hub.  The prepared needle is then inserted  into the echoendoscope, A  
transgastric approach will be used  to obtain samples from the left lobe of the liver; a 
transduodenal approach,  with the linear echoendoscope positioned in  the duodenal bulb,  will be  
used to obtain  samples  from the large amount of liver parenchyma  seen  in that location. Once 
adequate liver parenchymal  penetration  will be achieved with the needle (∼ 2-6 cm), full suction 
will be applied  with a 20-mL vacuum syringe. One pass consists of a total of 7 to 10 to-and-fro 
needle motions with the fanning technique applied under direct and continuous endosonographic visualization of the tip of the needle.
The needle  will then  be removed from  the echoendoscope. The specimen will be pushed from the 
needle with the stylet directly  into a microseive, and blood washed from the specimen with a

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARYgentle saline  rinse.  The endosonographer looks for multiple pieces  of light  brown tissue 
approximately 5 to 15 mm  in length.  The  tissue cores are  then “floated”  off the microseive into 
formalin solution.  Then,  a second  pass will be  made  from the same region  of the liver using  the 
alternate needle  used from the first pass.  Heparin is flushed  through the needle  lumen  prior to  
the next pass. The biopsy  process is then repeated on the opposite liver  lobe. Two passes per 
liver lobe are made; one with the standard 19g EUS-FNA needle, and one  with the 22g EUS core  
needle. All patients are  closely observed in the recovery area for 1 hour after the procedure,  as 
per our standard policy.  Patients will be  followed-up with  by a  phone call the next day and at 1 
week after the procedure.
Sample Processing
The surgical pathology department, per  a specific protocol for clinical practice,  will process  the 
EUS-LB samples. Tissue  samples are  left in formalin  for at least  1 hour  before  processing. The 
contents of the  formalin jar  will be poured  into a petri dish, and  visible cores of liver tissue 
picked out with small forceps by the surgical pathology technician. These pieces are arranged  in 
a linear fashion on lens  paper, then the specimen photographed alongside a  ruler to  estimates pre-
processing tissue lengths. Samples  from both lobes and the different  needles will be submitted 
for evaluation separately. The tissue will be processed in  standard  fashion,  and slide blanks made  
(5-μm tissue  thickness). These  blanks are  stained  with  hematoxylin  and eosin, trichrome, and  
reticulin, with other special  stains done as needed. The slides  is digitized using a whole slide 
scanner (ScanScope CS; Aperio Technologies,  Inc, Vista, CA), and the digitized images used for 
quantitative analysis (eSlide Manager;  Aperio Technologies, Inc). Quantification of sample 
length (mm) and  portal triads is performed  by 2 of the  investigators,  annotating  the digital 
images with the software.   Fellowship-trained GI pathologists then perform histologic 
interpretation for  clinical  use.
Post-Procedural Follow-up
After undergoing the procedure,  patients will receive a  1week follow-up phone  call to monitor 
for adverse events (i.e. bleeding).

A representative from the  Biostatistics & Research Data Core will be  doing the statistical 
analysis. 
6.8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan
Descriptive statistics will be utilized to represent continuous and categorical variables, with results expressed as medians with ranges.  Multiple comparisons between the aggregate tissue 
length and CPT yield  from bilobar, left lobe  only, and right lobe only  biopsies will be carried  out 
using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. A P-value of < 0.05 will be  considered statistically  
significant.
6.8.2 Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations
This is  a pilot study to determine if the  22g core  EUS needle can  reproducibly provide adequate  
liver cores for  histologic interpretation.   A few preliminary cases utilizing the 22g core  needle 
have been found to provide  adequate  cores,  with the careful tissue handling approach detailed 
above. It  is felt that 20 cases collected prospectively should be  adequate  to learn if the 22g needle 
is good  enough to provide liver  cores  reproducibly in different  patients with  different liver  
conditions.

7SAFETY MONITORING 
7.1 Adverse  Event Reporting
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored  throughout  the study.  All  AEs will  be reported 
to the institutional review board (IRB) regardless  of whether they are  considered study related.  
The date and time  of onset and outcome, course, intensity, action taken, and causality  to study 
treatment will  be assessed by the study PI.  In the event of a serious AE (SAE),  this will be  
reported to the Geisinger IRB (GIRB) according to the GIRB guidelines.   All other AEs  will be  
summarized and submitted to GIRB during continuing review.
7.2 Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is  any untoward,  undesired,  or unplanned  event in the form  of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or  laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical  study. The  event  does not need  to be causally related to the  test article  or 
clinical study. 
[Include as applicable to study]
An AE  includes, but is not limited to, the  following:
Any clinically  significant worsening of  a preexisting condition.
An AE  occurring from  overdose of a  test article, whether accidental or intentional.  Define 
overdose for each test article  here  or in the  Overdose section.  Overdose is a dose greater  than

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARYthat specified in the protocol.  OR Overdose is a dose greater  than  that specified  in the 
investigator’s brochure/label.  OR define overdose
An AE  occurring from  abuse (eg,  use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article.
An AE  that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article.
For reports from  postmarketing studies, any failure of expected pharmacologic  action of a 
test article.   For over-the-counter products,  the recommended daily  dose must  be 
administered before failure of expected  pharmacologic action can  be attributed.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (see below).
Requires inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of an existing  hospitalization (see below).
Results in a persistent  or significant disability or incapacity (see below).
Results in cancer.
Results in a congenital anomaly or birth  defect.
Additionally, important medical events  that may not result in death,  be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered  SAEs  when, based on appropriate medical  
judgment, they  may  jeopardize the  subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent  one of the  outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include  
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment in  an emergency room  or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or  convulsions that  do not result in hospitalization, or development  of drug 
dependency or drug  abuse.
Life-threatening refers to immediate risk of death  as the event occurred per the reporter. A  
life-threatening experience does not include an  experience, had  it occurred  in a more severe 
form, might  have  caused  death, but as it actually occurred, did  not create an immediate risk of 
death. For example, hepatitis that  resolved  without evidence of hepatic failure would not be  
considered life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe  nature can  be fatal.  Similarly, 
an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema  of the face would not  be life-threatening,  even 
though angioedema of the larynx,  allergic  bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can  be fatal.
Hospitalization is  official  admission to a  hospital. Hospitalization or prolongation of a 
hospitalization constitutes  criteria for an  AE to be serious;  however,  it is not  in itself considered 
an SAE.  In absence  of an AE, a  hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization should not  be 
reported as an  SAE by the participating investigator. This  is the case  in the following situations:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARYThe hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization is needed for a procedure required by 
the protocol.
The hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization is part of a routine procedure followed 
by the center (eg, stent removal after surgery).   This should be  recorded  in the study file.
In addition,  a hospitalization for a  preexisting condition that has not  worsened  does not constitute 
an SAE.
Disability is defined as  a substantial disruption in a person’s ability  to conduct  normal life 
functions.
If there is  any doubt about  whether the information  constitutes  an SAE, the  information  is treated 
as an SAE.
A protocol-related adverse event is an  AE occurring during a  clinical study that is not  related 
to the test  article, but is considered by the investigator or the medical monitor  (or designee) to  be 
related to the research  conditions,  ie, related to the fact that a subject  is participating in the study. 
For example, a protocol-related AE may be an  untoward event occurring during  a washout 
period or an event  related  to a medical procedure  required by the protocol.
Other Reportable Information.  Certain  information, although not  considered  an SAE,  must be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as  indicated  for an SAE.   This  includes:  
Pregnancy  exposure to a test  article, except for exposure to  prenatal vitamins.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, use  of the test article  must  be discontinued immediately.   Information  about 
pregnancy exposure includes the  entire  course of pregnancy and delivery, and perinatal  and 
neonatal outcomes, even if there  are no abnormal findings.  Both  maternal  and paternal 
exposure are considered other  reportable  information.  For  exposure involving  the female 
partner of a male  subject,  the necessary  information  must be  collected  from  the subject, while 
respecting the confidentiality  of the  partner.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY7.3 Recording and Reporting
A subject’s AEs and  SAEs will be  recorded  and reported from the signing  of the informed  
consent form to 1 week from EUS-LB Procedure
7.4 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting
David L. Diehl  will notify GIRB of all study SAEs in accordance with policy guidelines.    If an 
SAE has not resolved at the time of the  initial report, a follow-up  report  including all  relevant  
new or reassessed information  (eg, concomitant medication, medical history)  will be  submitted 
to GIRB.   An SAE will  be followed  until either resolved or stabilized.  
8PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
8.1 Informed Consent
The investigator will provide for the  protection of the subjects by following  all applicable 
regulations.  The informed consent  form will be submitted  to the IRB for review  and approval.  
Before any procedures specified in this protocol are performed, a subject  must:
Be informed of  all pertinent aspects of the study and all  elements of informed consent. 
Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to  participate.
Voluntarily  agree  to participate in the study. 
Sign and date an  IRB-approved informed consent form.
8.2 Protection  of Human Subjects Against Risks
Potential Risks due to Study participation -  
A potential risk is loss of the patients’  privacy and loss of the confidentiality  of their  data.  Upper 
endoscopy possesses a  0.0004-0.00009% risk of perforation, and  less than 0.5%  risk of bleeding 
[38].  Adverse events  described  with  the EUS and fine needle aspirate possess  a complication  
rate of 1.72% in prospective studies and 0.64% in retrospective studies.   The risk of perforation 
for EUS  is roughly 0.06%  and bleeding 0.13%.  There have not been established increased risks  
of complication in patients who undergo  EUS  with biopsy needle  or with variable needle  gauges.  
However, the 19g needle  is the standard needle size  in use for EUS-LB, and has been found to be 
very safe.  If anything, the  ability to use a 22g needle for the same purpose may be even safer, 
although the study is  not powered to demonstrate increased safety compared to the  19g.
Potential Benefits
Included patients are already undergoing the  procedure to  make a  clinical diagnosis of the liver 
abnormality, and also have  the benefit of requiring only  one endoscopic procedure to  evaluate

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARYdigestive system  problems  while at the same  time obtaining liver  biopsy.  As the potential 
complications with EUS-LB  seem to be lower  than other means of liver biopsy,  a potential 
benefit is sparing  patients from the  complications  caused by other methods of liver biopsy.  This  
study shall also benefit future patients  by providing data regarding prediction of success for 
EUS-LB with 22 versus 19-gauge needles.
Risk:Benefit Ratio  
A potential risk in this study involves loss of confidentiality.  The use of  password protected data 
storage, removal of  PHI and assignment  of randomly generated patient number and  limitation  of 
data to the study investigators shall limit this risk.  Additionally, there is a  small risk of 
perforation or bleeding in diagnostic endoscopy  and EUS-LB.  These risks  are outweighed by the 
benefit of  procuring  a diagnosis behind their liver-related abnormality.   
Procedures to  Maintain Privacy  and Confidentiality  
As exposure of confidential information  is a potential risk, subject identifiers shall not  be 
recorded and subjects shall be given  a randomly generated number.   The project investigators 
shall be  the only ones with access to the study data, which  shall be kept on a password 
protected/locked Geisinger  computer.  All data will be destroyed at the completion  of this 
study’s manuscript completion.
The principal investigator will  review all patient  data every six months,  and provide  a semi-
annual report to the QASM Committee. This report will include: 
1. The protocol  title,  IRB protocol number,  and the activation date of the study. 
2. The number of patients enrolled to date 
3. The date of first and  most recent  patient enrollment 
4. A summary  of all adverse events regardless  of grade and attribution 
5. A response evaluation for evaluable patients 
6. A summary  of any  recent literature that  may affect  the ethics of the study. 
The study principal investigator  and clinical  research associate  will monitor for  serious toxicities 
on an ongoing basis. Once  the principal investigator  or clinical  research  associate becomes aware 
of a serious adverse event, the  SAE  will be  reported to the HRPO and QASM Committee  within 
10 working days. 
Vulnerable Subjects
It is possible that terminally  ill patients may be involved in this study.  This  study will however  
not involve direct intervention  and not impact/delay the procedure for  which  they are  
undergoing.  The observational  nature  of the  study  and the subject’s ability to  exclude  them  from 
the study at any time shall be reinforced by the PI/Co-I.
No individuals who require substituted consent shall be involved  in this study, nor any children.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARYNo compensation shall be granted to subjects as this is an  observational study and does not 
deviate from the standard  of care.
Treatment of Research-Related  Injuries
A study coordinator  or clinical  investigator  will contact each patient and review their medical 
records at the following  intervals to assess for procedure related adverse events, as outlined in 
the American  Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) lexicon:   1 weeks after  the 
procedure (Appendix 1)[39].
Potential procedure-related injuries would include  perforation or bleeding,  which  would be 
managed in a standard fashion.  There are no additional “research-related” injuries.  Any  injuries 
in the study cohort will be  a result of risks inherent to the  procedure.  This  is always explained 
during the consent  process for the  procedure  and is the standard  of care.
8.3 Data  Monitoring  Plan 
Procedures to  Maintain Privacy  and Confidentiality  
As exposure of confidential information  is a potential risk, subject identifiers shall not  be 
recorded and subjects shall be given  a randomly generated number.   The project investigators 
shall be  the only ones with access to the study data, which  shall be kept on a password-protected 
Geisinger computer. All physical forms  will remain in  a locked storage device.  All data will be  
destroyed at the completion  of this study’s manuscript completion.
The principal investigator will  review all patient  data every six months,  and provide  a semi-
annual report to the QASM Committee. This report will include: 
1. The protocol  title,  IRB protocol number,  and the activation date of the study. 
2. The number of patients enrolled to date 
3. The date of first and  most recent  patient enrollment 
4. A summary  of all adverse events regardless  of grade and attribution 
5. A response evaluation for evaluable patients 
6. A summary  of any  recent literature that  may affect  the ethics of the study. 
The study principal investigator  and clinical  research associate  will monitor for  serious toxicities 
on an ongoing basis. Once  the principal investigator  or clinical  research  associate becomes aware 
of a serious adverse event, the  SAE  will be  reported to the HRPO and QASM Committee  within 
10 working days.

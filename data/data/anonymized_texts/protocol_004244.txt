B Introduction 
 
A1 Study Abstract 
The prevalence of mental health problems among coll ege populations has risen steadily 
in recent decades, with one-third of today’s colleg e students struggling with anxiety, 
depression, or an eating disorder. Yet, only 20-40%  of college students with mental 
disorders receive treatment. Inadequacies in mental  health care delivery result in 
prolonged illness, disease progression, poorer prog nosis, and greater likelihood of 
relapse, highlighting the need for new approaches t o detect mental health problems and 
engage students in services. 
 
Our interdisciplinary research team has developed a  transdiagnostic, scalable, mobile 
health prevention and intervention platform. This p latform uses population-level 
screening to engage college students in tailored se rvices that address common mental 
health problems. This evidence-based approach to ca re delivery addresses comorbid 
mental health issues and uses personalized screenin g and intervention to increase 
service uptake, enhance engagement, and improve out comes. Further, our service 
delivery model harnesses the expertise of our team of leaders in behavioral science, 
college student mental health, technology, and heal th economics, and bridges our 
team’s work over the past 25 years in successfully implementing a population-based 
screening program in over 160 colleges and demonstr ating the effectiveness of Internet-
based programs for targeted prevention and interven tion for anxiety, depression, and 
eating disorders in over 40 colleges. We propose to  test the impact of this mobile mental 
health platform for service delivery in a large-sca le trial across 20 colleges. Students 
who screen positive or at high-risk for clinical an xiety, depression, or eating disorders 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 5 (excluding anorexia nervosa, for which more intensi ve medical monitoring is warranted), 
which account for a substantial proportion of the m ental health burden on college 
campuses, and who are not currently engaged in ment al health services (N=7,884; of 
146,000 initially screened) will be randomly assign ed to: 1) intervention via the mobile 
mental health platform; or 2) referral to usual car e (i.e., campus health or counseling 
center). Our comprehensive mental health care platf orm can yield clinical benefit to 
students, appeal to university stakeholders, minimi ze barriers to implementation 
sustainability on campuses, and produce an economic  return on investment compared to 
usual care.  This population-level approach to serv ice engagement has the potential to 
improve mental health outcomes for the 20+ million students enrolled in U.S. colleges 
and universities. 
 
A2 Primary Hypothesis 
The mobile mental health platform will yield substa ntially higher and earlier uptake of 
services compared to referral to usual care. 
 
B Background 
 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies 
Prevalence of mental health problems among college students has risen steadily in 
recent decades. 9 In national epidemiologic studies, past-year preva lence of mood and 
anxiety disorders was 11% and 12%, respectively, 16  and 9% of college students 
screened positively for an eating disorder (ED). 21  Among students with probable 
disorders, only 20-40% received treatment, 16,22  and this number was even lower among 
students of color and those from low-income familie s. 17  With over 20 million people 
enrolled in U.S. postsecondary education, 23 we can infer an extremely large treatment 
gap 24,25 —there are at least 6.5 million college students wi th mental disorders, and at 
least 4 million college students with untreated men tal disorders. Early intervention is 
particularly important during college ages of 18-24 , when mental illnesses account for 
the largest burden of any disease. 26  Untreated symptoms become more frequent, 
severe, and persistent over time. 27-29  Students often have difficulty getting appropriate  
health care, 30  which can have lasting consequences on functioning , physical health, 
suicidality, social relationships, and educational attainment. 14,15,31  Although many 
campus counseling and health centers have increased  their capacity to provide 
services, 7 there remain major limitations to access and deliv ery of mental health services 
in college populations. For students, important bar riers include lack of problem 
recognition, lack of time, lack of urgency to seek services, and stigma. 32  Increasing the 
number of providers, by itself, neither addresses t he large number who wait until they 
reach a crisis level to seek mental health support,  nor alleviates stigma or campus  
leaders’ concerns about continuing to pour more res ources into services without 
appreciable slowing in demand. 7 These factors highlight the need for a more effici ent, 
proactive, and accessible service delivery model fo r managing mental health in college 
student populations through combined targeted preve ntion and  intervention. 
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 6 B2 Rationale for this Study 
mHealth technologies have potential to improve ment al health care on college 
campuses by overcoming treatment barriers and incre asing efficiency. Such 
interventions can offset in-person clinical demands , increase access, enhance treatment 
precision, and reduce costs. 35  Mobile technologies are efficacious for screening and 
treatment of anxiety, depression, and EDs across se ttings and populations, including in 
college students 1,2,6,36-38 for whom smartphone use is ubiquitous, 39  with high acceptability 
given their convenience and anonymity. However, the se interventions have been 
primarily delivered independently. A key challenge is delivering these technologies 
effectively and in combination at a population leve l. Such an approach would link 
screening with intervention, maximize engagement, a nd address comorbid problems. 
 
C Study Objectives 
 
C1 Study Aims 
Our study aims are as follows: 
1) Aim 1: Examine uptake (i.e., individuals beginni ng treatment) of the mobile 
mental health platform compared to referral to usua l care. 
2) Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the mobile mental health platform, compared 
to usual care, in (2a) reducing the number of indiv iduals with mental health 
disorders (primary outcome); (2b) reducing disorder -specific symptoms 
(secondary outcome); and (2c) improving quality of life and functioning 
(secondary outcome).  
3) Aim 3: (3a) Examine if the mobile intervention c hanges targets previously found 
to be associated with outcomes, both transdiagnosti c (i.e., decreased 
dysfunctional cognitions, increased use of CBT skil ls) and disorder-specific (i.e., 
reduced avoidance for anxiety, increased behavioral  activation for depression, 
reduced dietary restraint and weight/shape concerns  for EDs); (3b) determine if 
changes in targets are associated with clinical ben efit; and (3c; exploratory) 
identify other putative mediators of change (e.g., early engagement in help 
services, rapid response), (3d; exploratory) within -mobile program predictors of 
outcome (e.g., sessions completed), and (3e; explor atory) treatment moderators.  
4) Aim 4 Evaluate stakeholder-relevant outcomes: (4 a)  costeffectiveness; (4b) 
students’ academic performance; and (4c) attitudes.   
 
C2 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures 
 
As detailed above, we’ll be examining uptake of the  mobile mental health platform 
compared to referral to ususal care, as well as eff ectiveness of the platform in reducing 
the number of individuals with mental health disord ers; reducing disorder-specific 
symptoms; and  improving quality of life and functi oning. These are critical outcomes as 
they will tell us whether the mobile mental health platform is not only more likely to be 
used by students (uptake) but also whether it is ef fective on several dimensions.  
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 7 We also propose several mediators, which fall into:  1) primary intervention 
targets/mechanisms, considered most essential to ou tcomes (some of which are 
transdiagnostic and some disorder-specific; and 2) other mediators—early engagement 
in services and rapid response. CBT theory posits t hat the most 
important ways to change symptoms are by changing c ognitions and/or changing 
behaviors.  Thus, our transdiagnostic targets are d ecreased dysfunctional cognitions and 
increased use of CBT skills. Empirical support for cognitive changes suggests that they 
are central to reduction in anxious 113  and depressive 114  symptoms. For EDs, although 
only a few studies have examined change in cognitio n, 115  it is worth including given its 
emphasis in CBT theory. 116 There is evidence that acquisition of CBT skills (e .g., 
challenging thoughts) is another critical target at  least for anxiety and depression. 117-122  
Our disorder-specific, evidence-based targets are a s follows: reducing avoidance , 
associated with changing anxiety; 123-125  increasing behavioral activation, associated with 
reducing  depressive symptoms 126-128 ; and reducing dietary restraint and weight/shape 
concerns for reducing EDs. 61,102,115,129  We will examine whether the mHealth platform 
leads to change in the targets listed above and whe ther target change is associated with 
clinical benefit. Use of any potentially helpful se rvices (e.g., Lantern, self-help, face-to-
face therapy, medication) is also likely to lead to  change, particularly in the first 6 weeks. 
Thus, while not a specific target of intervention, early engagement in help services is a 
potential mediator of symptom reduction 130  and will be tested. Rapid response in 
symptoms, with rapid response usually defined as ≥5 0% reduction in symptoms 
occurring within the first 4-6 weeks of treatment, 131,132  predicts longer-term outcome in 
anxiety, depression, and EDs and is considered a me diator. 97,100-102,133-138  Within-mobile 
program indices will be tested as predictors of out come, including sessions completed, 
number of messages sent by user and coach, techniqu es completed, time spent with the 
program, and coach personalization (i.e., assessed through users’ perception and 
coding a subset of messages. Finally, data will be used to explore moderators— 
subgroups for whom further tailoring or more intens ive services are needed in future 
iterations. Moderators exploratory and based on pri or work; they are: gender, 
race/ethnicity, expectancy/credibility, 139-143  symptom severity, 142,144-147  duration of 
problem, 142,145,148-150  comorbidity, 142,145,149,151-153 , disorder for which the person sought 
treatment, 144,152,154  degree of cognitive distortion, 142  impairment, 145  family income, 142 and 
motivation. 155  
 
D Study Design  
 
D1 Overview or Design Summary 
At each of the participating campuses, we will recr uit students from the undergraduate 
population. Some campuses may decide to provide us with with a random sample 
(requesting from the Registrar [or equivalent campu s unit] which  isoversampled by 
gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [e .g., Pell grant recipients] to ensure 
that participant samples are diverse and representa tive on these dimensions). 
 
Students will be recruited via emails to their camp us email address to participate in the 
screen.  
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 8 Students will be asked at the start of the screen i f they would like to opt out of receiving 
information about potential future studies. We will  create an entire new registry of 
students from those who do not select to opt out  of future studies, ensuring we will not 
be able to contact those who opted out of future co ntact from the new registry.  
 
Following the screen students will receive personal ized feedback about their results. The 
personalized feedback will be automated through Qua ltrics,allowing for an efficient yet 
individualized feedback approach. The personalized feedback will include either an end 
of survey message thanking the individual for their  participation (and a referral for 
treatment if applicable) or an invitation to partic ipate in the full study as follows: 
1. No symptoms or low risk for depression, anxiety,  and EDs - they will not be 
eligible to participate in the next phase of the st udy. 
2. Low risk with trauma, insomnia, or substance abu se - receive referral for clinical 
evaluation and intervention. 
3. At high risk for or with clinical anxiety, depre ssion, or an ED not currently in 
treatment; own a smartphone - will be invited to pa rticipate in phase 2 of the 
study. 
4. At high risk for or with clinical anxiety, depr ession, or an ED currently in 
treatment and/or without a smartphone – will be enc ouraged to continue in 
treatment provided with a referral for clinical eva luation and intervention. 
5. Anorexia nervosa - receive referral for clinical  evaluation and intervention. 
 
Following the personalized feedback, students meeti ng study eligibility criteria will 
receive a brief statement of eligibility for and de scription of the study purpose and 
duration, activities involved, and assessment time points. Students will be asked to 
confirm their willingness to continue. If they agre e students will be asked for their email 
address and phone numbers, and will be provided a l ink to the Phase 2 survey. After 
giving online consent, participants will be randomi zed via a code through Qualtrics into 
one of two conditions:  
1) Intervention: receiving access to our mobile coa ched self-help program for 6 
months.  
2) Control: Receiving information on how to receive  treatment at the student’s 
counseling center on campus.  
 
Participants will then complete the baseline survey , which will assess treatment 
expectancy/credibility, cognitive distortion, impai rment/quality of life, motivation for 
treatment, and mental health treatment utilization.  After completing these measures 
students will be made aware of the condition they w ere randomized into and asked to 
complete a short Treatment Credibility and Expectan cy Questionnaire. 
 
Individuals who choose not to continue will receive  their screen feedback through 
Qualtrics, a recommendation to seek care, and a cam pus-specific list of resources.  
 
After completing the baseline survey participants w ill receive an email and text message 
with information about their screen responses and e ither a link to the mobile intervention 
or information on how to access clinical services, based on their randomized condition. 
Individuals who screen positive or at high risk for  more than one of the three mental 
health disorders (anxiety, depression, EDs) will be  asked to select which problem is 
most bothersome or impairing to their everyday func tioning, which has been shown to 
correlate with provider ratings,and will then be di rected to focus primarily on that problem 
using either the mobile app or in-person services. 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________

All students in the usual care condition will recei ve a recommendation to seek care and 
will be given a list of resources available through  their respective health or counseling 
center, including contact information to make an ap pointment and any other relevant 
resources on campus. Participants who will be compl eting the mobile interventions will 
be given a link to the program, hosted on a platfor m by our technology partners 
SilverCloud Health, and a program description. They  will also be provided with 
instructions to download the SilverCloud Health pro gram app, through which they can 
access the intervention, as well. Students are enco uraged to log in to the intervention, 
create an anonymous username and password, and begi n the program.  
 
Both intervention and control groups will be asked to complete assessments at 6 weeks, 
6 months, and 2 years after completing the baseline  screen. 6 week assessments will 
ask participants to complete assessments of anxiety , depression, EDs, motivation for 
treatment, and mental health treatment utilization.  The 6 month and 2-year follow-ups 
will include assessments of anxiety, depression, ED s, comorbidities, impairment/quality 
of life, motivation for treatment, mental health tr eatment utilization, and screening and 
treatment feedback. In addition, alternate contact information will be requested at 
baseline, 6, and 12 month follow-ups in order to ma ximize the likelihood that participants 
can be reached at the next follow-up assessment, in cluding cell phone number for 
receiving SMS text-message reminders for follow-up surveys to be sent from the 
Qualtrics platform. Follow-up emails and SMS may al so use images or other media to 
increase the students’ attention and likelihood of reponse. In order to increase the 
response rate at 2-year follow-up the study team ma y call participants to remind them to 
complete the survey, the study team may leave a voi cemail if the participant does not 
respond. All assessments will be conducted using Qu altrics survey platform. 
 
Participants will be compensated by receiving an el ectronic gift card for completing the 
Baseline ($5), 6 week ($5), 6 month ($10), and 2-ye ar ($20) follow-up assessments. 
Particpants will be entered into a sweepstakes to w in one of five $50 gift cards after 
completing the Baseline, 6 week, 6 month, and 2-yea r surveys. In addition, once 
particpants complete all four surveys, they will be  entered into a sweepstakes to win one 
of ten $100 gift cards. 
All students who receive a recruitment email will b e automatically entered into a 
sweepstakes for one of 40 $100 electronic gift card  prizes. 
 
In order to assess mental health treatment utilizat ion, in addition to assessing this via- 
self-report, we will obtain aggregate counts of par ticipants in therapy from campus 
counseling/health centers, by random assignment gro up at baseline, 6 months, and 2 
years. To assess academic outcomes, including term by-term GPA and enrollment 
status (to assess drop-out), at the end of the 2 ye ars we will obtain aggregate data of 
participants from Registrars by semester/term to in clude GPA and attrition rate by 
condition. 
 
D2 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 10 2.a Inclusion Criteria  
Screening survey inclusion criteria: Undergraduate students at participating colleges and 
universities who are 18 years old and older. 
 
Full study inclusion criteria:  
 Students who screen has high risk or clinical/subc linical for anxiety, depression, 
and, EDs 
 Students who are not currently in treatment, i.e.,  in the past month. 
 Own a smartphone. 
 
Students who endorse suicidal ideation in the basel ine screening assessment will be 
given a referral to seek in-person care, however, w e decided not to exclude students 
with suicidality, given that only 20-40% of college  students with mental health problems 
receive treatment. As such, we deemed it insufficie nt to exclude such individuals from 
receiving the intervention and only providing an in -person referral, given the goal of this 
proposal to narrow the treatment gap for mental hea lth problems among college 
students . 
2.a Exclusion Criteria  
For the full study we will exclude students who do not own a smartphone since the 
intervention is a mobile app. We will also excludes  students who are currently engaged 
in mental health treatment given the goal to increa se access to services for those not 
receiving help. 
2.b Ethical Considerations  
All key personnel involved in the design or conduct  of research involving human subjects 
will receive the required education on the protecti on of human research participants prior 
to the start of the study. Participants will be inf ormed that they do not have to answer 
any questions that make them uncomfortable. There a re minimal risks for participants in 
the mobile health intervention. Coaches in SilverCl oud Health will be recruited at the 
study four participating sites. Coaches will be stu dents in a graduate program in 
psychology, counseling, or social work. Coaches wil l be trained and under the close 
supervision of a coach supervisor, at WUSM and PAU who licensed psychologists, as 
well as the Fidelity Monitoring Center.  
 
Given national data showing that nearly 10% of stud ents have seriously considered 
suicide in the past year and that rates of suicide on university campuses continue to 
increase, suicidality will be consistently monitore d throughout the study, including within 
the mobile intervention itself and through the comp letion of the baseline and 6-week, 6-
month, and 2-year follow-up assessments. Students w ho endorse any suicidality on 
these assessments will receive immediate follow-up,  including a referral to seek in-
person care. Despite the perceived risk that assess ing suicidality will increase suicidality, 
research supports that asking about this does not i ncrease suicidality and, among those 
who may endorse active suicidal plans or intent, ma y lead to improvements in health 
seeking behaviors and increased safety. Notably, we  decided not to exclude students 
with suicidality, given that only 20-40% of college  students with mental health problems 
receive treatment. As such, we deemed it insufficie nt to exclude such individuals from 
receiving the intervention and only  providing an in-person referral, given the goal of this 
proposal to narrow the treatment gap.  
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 11  
Participant safety is of utmost clinical import, an d several safety precautions and 
procedures will be implemented. 
1) SilverCloud Health flags and notify coaches when  a user responds positively to the 
PHQ-9 item about suicidality. Coaches will monitor the platform weekly to assess for 
significant changes in symptoms (e.g., increased pu rging). Any participant deemed 
unsafe or needing more intensive clinical intervent ion will be given a referral by their 
coach as well as contacted directly via telephone. Appropriate follow-up (e.g., contacting 
the university's on-call clinical staff or local po lice) will be implemented if participants are 
deemed to be at imminent risk and no response is pr ovided by the participant indicating 
their safety. This protocol is to safeguard against  concerns with keeping individuals in 
guided self-help care when more intensive services are warranted. 
2) Individuals who remain in the clinical symptom r ange, in both the intervention and 
control conditions, at the 6-month or 2-year follow -up assessments, will be offered a 
referral for in-person treatment. For individuals i n the intervention condition, in line with a 
stepped care model, those who do not demonstrate sy mptom improvement by 6 weeks 
will be referred to in- person care but can still e ngage in the program. 
 
In the case of imminent risk, such as in the extrem ely rare case of a user reporting plans 
of suicide or homicide, there are several steps tha t coaches for students engaging in the 
mobile program are mandated to take as mandated rep orters. First, coaches contact a 
coach supervisor and the Fidelity Monitoring Center  either by phone or an email marked 
URGENT to consult about how to proceed as soon as p ossible. If coaches do not 
receive a response within an hour, they will reach out to a back-up coach supervisor. 
Second, coaches identify the appropriate local agen cy such as the campus police at the 
user’s college or university to prepare for possibl y making a report. Next, they provide 
the user with a variety of emergency options such a s counseling center information, 
suicide hotline phone number, emergency room locati on, or local police information and 
encourage clients to seek additional support or hos pitalization through these options. 
Coaches also gather relevant information by reviewi ng the coaching record for all 
identifying information available such as name, age , phone number, and email address 
to provide to the agency when making a report. If i t is deemed appropriate by the 
coaching supervisor, coaches call in the report as soon as possible to the identified local 
agency. They also follow up with the user, express concern, provide support, and let 
him/her know a report has been made. In addition, c oaches follow up with the coach 
supervisor and the Fidelity Monitoring Center via e mail to let him/her know the report 
was made. Finally, coaches continue to monitor the user for emerging or worsening 
risks, as demonstrated by information the user inpu ts into the program or messages to 
the coach, and they continue to keep in close conta ct with the coaching supervisor. 
Should the user continue to worsen and be deemed at  continued imminent risk, the 
coach and coach supervisor may make a decision to w ithdraw the participant from the 
program. 
 
In the case that individuals endorse criteria for p ossible AN (low weight and significant 
weight shape concerns) at the 6-month or 2-year fol low-up assessments, they will be 
offered a referral for in-person treatment. 
 
The Fidelity Monitoring Center will conduct fidelit y checks on the coaching data from 
SilverCloud Health to ensure that coaches are follo wing protocol (e.g., referrals given if 
lack of symptom improvement). In general, the Fidel ity Monitoring Center will oversee 
regular review of coaches using quantitative and qu alitative metrics that include tone and 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 12 style (authentic, personalized) of their interactio ns with clients, content (depth, goal 
orientation), efficiency (response time), user enga gement, outcomes, and accuracy rate 
for risk management. Coaches that do not meet the m etrics will be put on a performance

The use of a single IRB model is designed to enhanc e and streamline the process of 
IRB review and reduce inefficiencies without compro mising ethical principles and 
protections within this multi-site clinical study. Each site signs an IRB Authorization 
Agreement to document the delegation of responsibil ities of IRB review to WUSM and 
demonstrate WUSM’s acceptance of these responsibili ties. 
 
2.c Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process 
Each participating school will provide us with a da tabase of students from their registrar 
or academic information office. The database will c ontain a full population sample or 
random sample of undergraduate students. The databa se will include demographic 
information about students such as first name, emai l address, sex, race/ethnicity. 
 
Students will be recruited via emails to their camp us email address to participate in the 
screenning assessment. Students will first receive a brief “pre-notification” email, which 
lets them know that an invitation to the study will  be coming soon. Two to three days 
later, we will send the screening assessment recrui tment email with a link to the online 
survey, and we will follow-up with reminder emails to non-responders. The emails will 
note that students can reply to decline participati on (and any further reminders); they 
may also select this option on the consent form pag e of the screening survey. 
 
Once students click on the survey link, students wi ll be asked to review the consent 
information sheet, they will have all the time they  need to review it. Full disclosure of the 
purpose of the study, the benefits and risks to ind ividuals who participate, and the 
confidential nature of information obtained during the study will be explained to 
participants. Participants will be aware from the o utset that they could be eligible for 
phase 2 of the study. Participants will be consente d according to the policies and 
procedures of the WUSM IRB, the IRB of Record for t he study. A trained study staff 
member will be available to students via phone to a nswer any questions they may have 
about their participation in the study.  
 
We will follow-up with reminder emails to non-respo nders. The emails will note that 
students can reply to decline participation (and an y further reminders); they may also 
select this option on the consent form page of the baseline survey. 
 
For phase 2 eligible participants,  following the p ersonalized feedback , they will receive 
a brief statement of eligibility for and descriptio n of the study purpose and duration, 
activities involved, and assessment time points. St udents will be asked to confirm their 
willingness to continue. If they agree students wil l be asked for their email address and 
phone numbers, and will be provided a link to the P hase 2 baseline survey. People who 
do not complete the baseline survey will be sent an  email reminder to complete the 
survey. 
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 13 Once students click on the survey link, students wi ll be asked to review the informed 
consent before continuing with the baseline survey.  Student will have all they time they 
need to review it. Full disclosure of the purpose o f the study, the benefits and risks to 
individuals who participate, and the confidential n ature of information obtained during the 
study will be explained to participants. Participan ts will be aware from the outset that 
they could be randomly assigned to a mobile health platform or referral to usual care. 
They will also be aware that their expected partici pation will last up to two years, 
including three additional follow-up assessments. P articipants will be consented 
according to the policies and procedures of the WUS M IRB, the IRB of Record for the 
study. A trained study staff member will be availab le to students via phone to answer 
any questions they may have about their participati on in the study.  
 
2.d Randomization Method 
In phase 2, participants will be randomized after g iving online consent, participants will 
be randomized via a code through Qualtrics into one  of two conditions:  
1) Intervention: receiving access to our mobile coa ched self-help program for 6 
months.  
2) Control: Receiving information on how to receive  treatment at the student’s 
counseling center on campus. 
Participants will be made aware of the condition th ey were randomized into after 
completing the baseline survey. 
2.e Risks and Benefits 
Risks 
 
There are minimal risks for participants. 
 
The assessment process may carry potential risks. F or example, some of the questions 
may be upsetting to participants, and there may be some risk of breach of confidentiality 
if the suicide or crisis assessment protocols need to be deployed. 
 
There are no high-risk or hazardous aspects of our proposed mobile intervention 
program; however, we recognize that programs to tre at mental health problems may 
promote increased focus on mental health symptoms, more than that which may exist 
before starting the program. 
 
Coaches in SilverCloud Health will be recruited fro m the institutions of the study team 
members (i.e., WUSM, PAU, PSU, UM). Coaches will be  students in a graduate program 
in psychology, counseling, or social work. Coaches will be trained and under the close 
supervision of coach supervisors, at WUSM and PAU, as well as the Fidelity Monitoring 
Center. Given national data showing that ~10% of st udents have seriously considered 
suicide in the past year, suicidality will be consi stently monitored throughout the study, 
including within the program itself and through the  completion of all assessments. 
Students who endorse any suicidality on these asses sments will receive immediate 
follow-up, including a referral to seek in- person care. Participant safety is of utmost 
clinical import, and several safety procedures will  be implemented. 
 
1) SilverCloud Health flags and notify coaches when  a user responds positively to the 
PHQ-9 item about suicidality. Coaches will monitor the platform weekly to assess for 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 14 significant changes in symptoms (e.g., increased pu rging). Any participant deemed 
unsafe or needing more intensive clinical intervent ion will be given a referral by their 
coach as well as contacted directly via telephone. Appropriate follow-up (e.g., contacting 
the university's on-call clinical staff or local po lice) will be implemented if participants are 
deemed to be at imminent risk and  no response is p rovided by the participant indicating 
their safety. This protocol is to safeguard against  concerns with keeping individuals in 
guided self-help care when more intensive services are warranted. 
2) Individuals who remain in the clinical symptom r ange, in both the intervention and 
control conditions, at the 6-month or 2-year follow -up assessments, will be offered a 
referral for in-person treatment. For individuals i n the intervention condition, in line with a 
stepped care model, those who do not demonstrate sy mptom improvement by 6 weeks 
will be referred to in- person care but can still e ngage in the program. 
 
In the case of imminent risk, such as in the extrem ely rare case of a user reporting plans 
of suicide or homicide, there are several steps tha t coaches are mandated to take as 
mandated reporters. First, coaches contact a coach supervisor and the Fidelity 
Monitoring Center either by phone or an email marke d URGENT to consult about how to 
proceed as soon as possible. If coaches do not rece ive a response within an hour, they 
will reach out to a back-up coach supervisor. Secon d, coaches identify the appropriate 
local agency such as the campus police at the user’ s college or university to prepare for 
possibly making a report. Next, they provide the us er with a variety of emergency 
options such as counseling center information, suic ide hotline phone number, 
emergency room location, or local police informatio n and encourage clients to seek 
additional support or hospitalization through these  options. Coaches also gather relevant 
information by reviewing the coaching record for al l identifying information available such 
as name, age, phone number, and email address to pr ovide to the agency when making 
a report. If it is deemed appropriate by the coachi ng supervisor, coaches call in the 
report as soon as possible to the identified local agency. They also follow up with the 
user, express concern, provide support, and let him /her know a report has been made. 
In addition, coaches follow up with the coach super visor and the Fidelity Monitoring 
Center via email to let him/her know the report was  made. Finally, coaches continue to 
monitor the user for emerging or worsening risks, a s demonstrated by information the 
user inputs into the program or messages to the coa ch, and they continue to keep in 
close contact with the coaching supervisor. Should the user continue to worsen and be 
deemed at continued imminent risk, the coach and co ach supervisor may make a 
decision to withdraw the participant from the progr am. 
 
 
In addition, Dr. Newman will hold monthly meetings with coach supervisors. 
Furthermore, the Fidelity Monitoring Center will co nduct fidelity checks on the coaching 
data from SilverCloud Health to ensure that coaches  are following protocol (e.g., 
referrals given if lack of symptom improvement). In  general, the Fidelity Monitoring 
Center will oversee regular review of coaches using  quantitative and qualitative metrics 
that include tone and style (authentic, personalize d) of their interactions with clients, 
content (depth, goal orientation), efficiency (resp onse time), user engagement, 
outcomes, and accuracy rate for risk management. Co aches that do not meet the 
metrics will be put on a performance improvement pl an and may be terminated if 
improvement is not demonstrated.  
 
Benefits 
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 15 The benefits to participants in this study and to s ociety are expected to be great. In 
terms of potential benefits to participants, these include: improved uptake of services, 
reduced anxiety, depressive, and/or ED symptoms, an d improved quality of life. The 
treatment may also improve academic impairment and reduce likelihood of dropout from 
college as well as stress on the individual posed b y the burden of mental health 
problems. In addition, it is possible that skills t o solve ongoing problems that may 
maintain mental health problems may improve. The gr owing prevalence and burden of 
mental health problems on the college campus highli ght the need for a new approach for 
detecting mental health problems and engaging colle ge students in services. Therefore, 
the potential risks that are associated with this s tudy are reasonable when considering 
the many benefits that the participants and society  may gain. 
2.f Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
The recruitment emails will note that students can reply to decline participation (and any 
further reminders); they may also select this optio n on the consent form page of the 
screening survey. 
 
2.g When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Taking part in this research study is voluntary. Pa rticipants may choose not to take part 
in this research study or may withdraw their consen t at any time. They may withdraw by 
telling the study team they are no longer intereste d in participating in the study or they 
may send in a withdrawal letter. There will be no p enalty or loss of benefits to which they 
were otherwise entitled. 
 
2.h Data Collection and Follow-up for Withdrawn Sub jects  
 
When a participant withdraws from the study, the re search team will stop collecting data 
from them. 
D3 Study Intervention 
 
SilverCloud Health Guided Self-Help Mental Health P rograms 
 
The SilverCloud Health platform provides three self -help guided interventions, one for 
each disorder (both for those with clinical symptom s and at high risk). The interventions 
were derived from evidence based guided self-help t reatments that were efficacious in 
traditional efficacy trials, specifically for anxie ty, depression, and EDs. Each session 
takes about 20 minutes. To maximize efficacy, key t argets (i.e., decreased avoidance for 
anxiety disorders; increased behavioral activation for depression; decreased dietary 
restraint and weight/shape concerns for EDs; and de creased dysfunctional thoughts and 
increased use of Cognitive behavioral treatment ski lls for all three disorders) are 
addressed, which include the following content to a ddress the targets: Anxiety: 
Psychoeducation on anxiety and avoidance, goal sett ing, self-monitoring and cognitive 
restructuring (to identify and alter negative autom atic thoughts), exposure therapy, 
mindfulness/relaxation. Depression: Psychoeducation  on the cognitive-behavioral theory 
of depression, goal setting, identifying and engagi ng in enjoyable activities (behavioral 
activation), emotion regulation and distress tolera nce skills, self-monitoring and cognitive 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 16 restructuring (to identify and alter negative autom atic thoughts). EDs: Psychoeducation 
on the cognitivebehavioral theory of EDs, self-moni toring, goal setting, meal planning 
and tracking, cognitive and behavioral strategies t o improve body image, eating, and 
coping skills.  
 
Participants completing the mobile intervention who  screened positive or at high risk for 
2 or more disorders (i.e., of depression, anxiety, and EDs) will be asked to choose a 
focus based on which problem is most bothersome or impairing to their everyday 
functioning, and will be assigned that program as t heir primary track. Incorporating 
participant preference in our approach is designed to enhance the students' involvement 
as stakeholders and to increase their engagement. A s they progress through the 
intervention, they also will be assigned the compon ents presumed to be essential to 
intervention effects for the comorbid disorder. 
 
Participants completing the mobile intervention wil l receive the support from a coach. 
Their role includes supporting and enhancing user m otivation; monitoring progress; 
facilitating goal setting and offering accountabili ty; providing feedback on technique 
usage and encouraging practice; answering user ques tions; and monitoring 
for/responding to clinical risk. Communication with  users is primarily via two-way, 
asynchronous messaging, with optional, supplementar y phone calls to enhance goal 
setting. Coach messaging is done via a web-based "d ashboard," and delivered to users 
within the SilverCloud Health  app. Coaches have pa rticipants' baseline screen results 
so they can personalize treatment and help the user  apply skills learned to comorbid 
problems. Moreover, coaches will monitor symptoms u sing the following assessments 
built into the SilverCloud Health programs: 
1) For individuals with depression, depression is a ssessed weekly using an 
abbreviated version of the measure used for assessi ng depression at baseline 
(i.e., PHQ-2). 
2) For individuals with anxiety, anxiety is assesse d weekly using a short, validated 
measure of anxiety (i.e., GAD-2).  
3) For individuals with eating disorders, weekly mo nitoring includes three questions 
based on the EDE-Q assessing eating disorder behavi ors (i.e., binge eating, 
purging) and weight/shape concerns. 
 
Note: When individuals have more than one of these problems, they complete weekly 
monitoring for each comorbidity. 
 
If the coach feels the online program cannot adequa tely address comorbidity, 
participants are referred to appropriate campus/com munity resources. 
 
The program will be accessible via smart phone app or their desktop. Program access 
will be password protected. 
 
3.a COVID-19 Specific SilverCloud Module 
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, coaches in the Silver Cloud intervention will be 
randomized into either condition: 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________

E1 Screening for Eligibility 
Eligibitlity will be assessed using the measures an d cut-offs in the table below. 
 
 
 
Participants will also be asked if they own a smart phone and if they are currently in 
treatment for mental health. 
 
E2 Schedule of Measurements 
Participants will be assessed at screening, baselin e, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. All 
surveys will be administered via Qualtrics. Partici pants will be compensated by receiving 
an electronic gift card for completing the Baseline  ($5), 6 week ($5), 6 month ($10), and 
2-year ($20) follow-up assessments. Particpants wil l be entered into a sweepstakes to 
win one of five $50 gift cards after completing the  Baseline, 6 week, 6 month, and 2-year 
surveys. In addition, once particpants complete all  four surveys, they will be entered into 
a sweepstakes to win one of ten $100 gift cards.

 19 significant disability. The initial step in reporti ng adverse events of any kind is to consult 
with Dr. Newman, PI at PSU, who will be providing o versight for adverse event reporting 
for the study. Additionally, adverse events will be  reported to PIs at the other sites, Drs. 
Wilfley (WUSM), Eisenberg (UM) and Taylor (PAU), wh o will decide if the event is 
serious enough to warrant treatment discontinuation  or participant withdrawal. Any 
potentially adverse events will be evaluated by the  PIs within 72 hours. All serious 
adverse events will be immediately reported to the IRB of Record. All adverse events 
and study withdrawals, together with a detailed exp lanation of the event and withdrawal, 
will be forwarded to the Human Subjects Committee a nd the DSMB. In addition, at its 
regular meeting, the DSMB will summarize all advers e events of any severity, to be 
forwarded to the IRB of Record via Dr. Wilfley.  
 
2.b Reporting Procedures 
Because the online interventions follow standard pr actice guidelines that have been 
used in research trials without significant adverse  events, we do not anticipate any 
significant adverse events. However, coaches will b e trained to monitor for adverse 
events, including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) suc h as deaths, hospitalizations, and 
life threatening events and Unanticipated Problems (UPs), and will report any potential 
adverse events immediately upon their identificatio n to the FMC. We will also monitor for 
adverse events at all follow-up assessments and via  all other communication with study 
participants. Any potentially adverse events will b e evaluated by the PIs within 72 hours. 
Serious adverse events will be promptly reported to  the study IRB. Study-related serious 
adverse events will be reported to the NIMH within 2 weeks; all others will be included in 
the annual report to the NIMH. 
2.c Adverse Event Reporting Period

E3 Study Outcome Measurements and Ascertainment 
Study outcomes includes the following: 
 Reducing the number of individuals with mental hea lth disorders. 
 Reducing disorder-specific symptoms 
 improving quality of life and functioning 
F Statistical Plan  
 
F1  Sample Size Determination and Power 
Sample size was based on achieving greater than 80%  power to detect minimally 
meaningful differences in primary and secondary out comes. We will include 20 colleges 
with approximately equal numbers of participants pe r campus, and approximately 3,154 
high risk and 3,154 clinical participants with comp lete follow-up data. All power estimates 
were derived from Monte Carlo simulations (a gold s tandard in power estimation) 214,215 . 
For all analyses, power estimation is based on an e ffect size of .2 (i.e., for the primary 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 20 outcome, a differential change of .2 in the treatme nt vs. control group; for moderator 
analyses, effect size was .2 for each moderation ef fect; for mediator analyses, each 
pathway within the mediation was estimated at .2). We thus have power to detect 
smaller differences than we anticipate based on ass umptions; this extra power is 
important, given that smaller differences would sti ll be clinically meaningful at a 
population scale, particularly considering the mode s t cost of this online intervention. 
Power for all secondary outcomes was also estimated  within the Monte Carlo simulation 
using all moderators within the same model; and all  mediators within the same model 
targeting a .2 effect size, reflecting a conservati ve approach to power calculation and 
model estimation. Results of the Monte Carlo simula tions suggested we had greater 
than 90% power to detect all primary outcomes and g reater than 80% power to detect all 
secondary outcomes. 
F2  Interim Monitoring and Early Stopping 
The DSMB will provide oversight and ongoing monitor ing of participant safety, quality of 
data collection, and integrity of the study on a ye arly basis. The DSMB will receive a 
report from the study Screening Implementation and Data Coordinating Center 
approximately four weeks before each review date. T hese reports will include the major 
variables necessary for monitoring safety, quality of data collection, and integrity of the 
study and will include otherwise blinded outcome da ta. The DSMB will prepare a report 
after every meeting based on the material received from the Screening Implementation 
and Data Coordinating Center, which will be forward ed to the PIs to review at Study 
Executive Committee meetings and also forwarded to the IRB of Record by Dr. Wilfley. 
 
F3  Analysis Plan 
To evaluate efficacy of the mHealth platform vs. us ual care, in engaging participants 
(Aim 1) we will use hierarchical logistic regressio n to examine uptake (i.e., individuals 
beginning any sort of treatment). Outcome will be a t least one session of mental health 
services use (either online or in-person) assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. 
Using hierarchical logistic regression, we will als o examine efficacy in reducing or 
preventing number of students with mental health di sorders (i.e., a positive screen for at 
least one of anxiety, depression, or ED as the outc ome reflecting a "clinical 
case")assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months and 2 years, wi th a primary endpoint of 2 years. 
This allows for a single, universal outcome applica ble to everyone in the study. Both 
logistic regression models will include random inte rcepts for colleges and for students 
nested within colleges, and account for repeated as sessments within students, and will 
estimate the following fixed effects: main effect o f time (coded as a factor variable, 
including baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months, and 2 years) , treatment condition, and two-way 
interaction between time and treatment condition.  
 
To evaluate reduction in disorder-specific symptoms  (Aim 2b) and improvement in 
quality of life (Aim 2c), multilevel models will be  used. Analyses of symptom change will 
be conducted within each clinical disorder subgroup  separately with relevant symptoms 
as the response variables. We will also use a z-sco re to standardize primary symptom 
measures to obtain an estimate for a unified interv ention effect. All symptom models will 
include random intercepts for colleges and for stud ents nested within colleges, account 
for repeated assessments within students, and will estimate the following fixed effects: 
main effect of time, treatment condition, and two-w ay interaction between time and 
treatment condition. Parameter estimates from these  models will allow separately 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 21 comparing change between arms from pre to 6 weeks, pre to 6 months, and from pre to 
2-year follow-up. Each model will use dummy-coded f actor terms as a stringent test of 
the treatment to ensure that: 1) treatment was asso ciated with significantly greater 
change from pre to post than the control group; and  2) gains made in treatment at 6 
weeks are maintained and significantly greater than  baseline at each follow-up. 
 
Analyses for Aim 3 (targets, other mediators, withi n-mobile program predictors, 
moderators). Potential mediators,are categorized in to three groups: 1) clinical targets 
(Aim 3a and Aim 3b); 2) early engagement with servi ces (Aim 3c); and 3) early clinical 
response/rapid response (Aim 3c). We will test for mediation using structural equation 
models (SEM) with confidence intervals derived from  bootstrapping of indirect effects 
and total effects. We will examine targets and medi ators preceding changes in 
outcomes. To draw more informative and coherent con clusions across the three 
disorders, we will explore meaningful transdiagnost ic clinical targets as well as disorder 
specific targets. For transdiagnostic mediator outc omes, binary clinical case status and 
quality of life measures are natural outcome measur es, but for symptom outcomes, we 
will use standardized symptom scores (for transdiag nostic outcomes) and 
nonstandardized symptoms scores (for disorder-speci fic outcomes). Moderated 
mediation (with treatment vs control as the moderat or) will be tested by constraining the 
indirect effect to be equal across treatment and co ntrol groups and testing differences in 
chi-square fit. Any significant misfit caused by sp ecifying the indirect effect of each 
mediator to be equal suggests that there are signif icant differences in this mediational 
path between the treatment and control. All mediati onal paths between the primary 
predictor and outcome will be estimated simultaneou sly to account for any and all 
interdependence between paths and to ensure these i nterdependencies do not bias 
estimation. Note that in applying moderated mediati on analyses to both transdiagnostic 
and disorder-specific targets, we will be simultane ously testing whether the intervention 
engages the targets (Aim 3a) and whether interventi on-induced changes in targets are 
associated with clinical benefit (Aim 3b). Putative  moderators (Aim 3e) will examine 
interaction terms with time point and random assign ment in regressions to identify 
subgroups that benefit most from treatment, and oth ers for whom additional tailoring 
may be necessary in future refinements of the deliv ery model. In cases where 
moderators are significant, we will then conduct me diator analyses separately by 
subgroups defined by these moderators, because diff erent intervention effects often 
imply different mechanisms by which effects are occ urring 216 .In moderation models, 
results will estimate the following fixed effects: 1) main effect of time, treatment 
condition, and each proposed moderator; 2) two-way interactions between time and 
treatment condition, treatment condition and each m oderator, and time and each 
moderator; and 3) three way interactions between ti me, treatment condition, and each 
moderator. The models will also estimate random eff ects of time nested within 
individuals, and intercepts nested within campuses.  Within-mobile treatment predictors 
of change (Aim 3d) will use multilevel models using  the fixed effects of maineffects of 
time, and each within-mobile program predictor, and  the interaction between within-
mobile program predictors and time estimating rando m effect of time nested within 
individuals and intercepts nested within campuses. 
 
Analyses for Aim 4: Economic evaluation analyses (A im 4a) were designed to provide 
information for stakeholders considering implementi ng the mobile platform 217 . As such, 
analyses will be conducted from the payer’s perspec tive to reflect opportunity cost for 
the payer. We will use TreeAge software, taking a m ultistep approach. Overall, the 
model will be evidence-based and fully validated us ing study data. A decision analytic 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 22 model using a microsimulation approach 218  will be used to provide the most flexibility for 
testing model assumptions and provide clear evidenc e to decision-makers concerning 
reliability of results. Internal validation of the model will be conducted by comparing 
outcomes of participants whose data were used to co nstruct the model to their predicted 
outcomes. Model fit will be tested using the R2 sta tistic for continuous data and the chi-
squared statistic for categorical data. External va lidity will be tested by comparing the 
model’s predicted outcome to actual for participant s who were “excluded” from the 
model-building process. The outcome of interest is the net benefit of the intervention 
compared to usual care at 2 years. Sensitivity of t he decision model to the assumptions, 
including time frame, discount rate, and perspectiv e, will be thoroughly tested using 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyse s. 219,220  We will also calculate  
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, correspondin g to the incremental difference 
(intervention vs. control) in costs divided by the incremental difference in the primary 
outcome, the number of clinical cases at 2-year fol low-up. Monte Carlo simulations and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be use d to present uncertainty around this 
estimate. Academic outcomes (Aim 4b) will be analyz ed using the methods described for 
the primary outcomes under Aim 1. Academic outcomes  will also be included into cost 
analyses, by translating drop-outs from college int o losses in tuition (for institutions) and 
losses in lifetime expected productivity. Stakehold er attitudes (Aim 4c) will be assessed 
for variation using descriptive statistics, and wil l be used to predict intention to adopt the 
platform using ordered probit regressions (with Lik ert categorical variables 
corresponding to intention to adopt). 
F4  Missing Outcome Data 
All analyses will be intent-to-treat analyses, usin g full-information maximum likelihood to 
handle missing data. 
 
G Data Handling and Record Keeping  
 
G1 Confidentiality and Security 
All surveys will be completed on the secured survey  platform Qualtrics. Survey data will 
be directly downloaded by our Screening Implementat ion and Data Coordinating site, 
UM, onto a protected server.  
 
The data coordinating center will store the study d ata on secure, password-protected 
servers, with identifying information always kept s eparate from other study data (such as 
assessment responses). The data will only be access ible at any given time to the small 
number of study team members who need to use the da ta at that time. Data will be 
stored separately by participating institution unti l de-identified analytic files are 
assembled after data collection. 
 
Data will be transmitted betweem sites using the se cured file share program Box.  
 
In order for the Fidelity Monitoring site, PSU, to review coach messages and data, 
SilverCloud Health will send PSU the data using Box . The data will be stored on 
password protected computers. 
 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 23 SilverCloud Health’s privacy is aligned with US per sonal data protection principles and is 
HIPAA compliant. 
 
All of our surveys will be completed using Qualtric s. Within Qualtrics we will create a 
contact list based on the registrar office database  sent by the universities, which will 
allow Qualtrics to send out personalized email invi tation to students.  Only our Data 
Coordinating Center, the University of Michigan, wi ll have access to the identifying 
information and will create an anonymous study ID f or each participant who agrees to 
participate in the study. With the assistance of Si lverCloud we were able to create a 
code to automatically link the anonymous Qualtrics Response ID from the survey with 
the self-selected username in SilverCloud.  SilverC loud will only have access to limited 
data from Qualtrics for people who were randomized into the SilverCloud program. The 
data they will receive will help inform the coach o n how to best support participants such 
as disorder risk level, suicide risk, gender, schoo l, and co-morbidities. SilverCloud will 
also receive the email address of the participants in order to send them an automatic 
email to sign-up for the program.” 
G2 Training  
All staff personnel are trained and comply with HIP AA regulations. All study team 
members will complete the CITI training and Good Cl inical Practice training. 
 
G3 Performance Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for this trial includes close monitoring by the 
principal investigators (PIs) and four independent safety officers through the DSMB.  
 
H Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
 
H1 Study Monitoring Plan  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
An independent panel of experts with experience in clinical trials, health services 
research, biostatistics, and college mental health,  consisting of four members who are 
not affiliated with the study – including an interv ention researcher, a counseling center 
director, a biostatistician, and a patient advocate  – will be appointed to constitute a Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Members will be  named prior to the 
commencement of the study. In addition, the study P Is (Drs. Wilfley, Eisenberg, 
Newman, and Taylor) and designated staff will atten d the DSMB meetings (as non-
voting participants) and will be responsible for pr eparing and presenting data reports 
from the study. The DSMB will provide oversight and  ongoing monitoring of participant 
safety, quality of data collection, and integrity o f the study on a yearly basis. The DSMB 
will receive a report from the study Screening Impl ementation and Data Coordinating 
Center approximately four weeks before each review date. These reports will include the 
major variables necessary for monitoring safety, qu ality of data collection, and integrity 
of the study and will include otherwise blinded out come data. The DSMB will prepare a 
report after every meeting based on the material re ceived from the Screening 
   
   
___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ 
 24 Implementation and Data Coordinating Center, which will be forwarded to the PIs to 
review at Study Executive Committee meetings and al so forwarded to the IRB of Record 
by Dr. Wilfley. 
 
The DSMB will provide the following functions: 
 Review of data (including masked data) over the co urse of the trial relating to 
efficacy, recruitment, randomization, adherence, re tention, operating procedures, 
forms completion, intervention effects, ethnic/raci al minority inclusion, and 
participant safety. 
 Identification of problems relating to safety over  the course of the study. Study 
PIs and Program Administrators will be informed by phone and via written report 
of their findings and recommendations.  
 Identification of needs for additional data releva nt to safety issues and request of 
these data from the study investigators. 
 Selection of appropriate analyses and periodic rev iew of data on safety and 
outcomes. 
 Recommendations regarding recruitment, treatment e ffects, adherence, 
retention, safety issues, and continuation of the s tudy. 
 Provision of written reports to the Project Office r and the PIs following each 
DSMB meeting. These reports will summarize the key issues reviewed by the 
DSMB. 
 
The frequency and type of data review is summarized  in the following table, with 
additional information following:

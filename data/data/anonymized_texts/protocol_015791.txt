13Protocol Summary
Study Compound: Cariprazine
Phase: 3
Study Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine 1.5 mg/day and 3mg/day
compared with placebo as an adjunctive treatment to ongoing antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with 
major depressive disorder (MDD) who have had an inadequate response to antidepressants alone .
Clinical Hypotheses: In the treatment of patients w ith MDD who have had an inadequate response to ADT 
alone, cariprazine as an adjunct ive treatment to ADT is safe and more effective than placebo + ADT .
Study Design
Structure: This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double- blind (DB), placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
fixed -dose study comparing cariprazine 1.5mg/dayand cariprazine 3 mg/d aywith placebo as an adjunctive 
treatment to ongoing ADT in outpatients with a diagnosis of MDD (via the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Ment al Disorders , Fifth Edition [DSM -5])who have an inadequate response ,as measured by the modified 
Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) ,to 1 to 3 antidepressant sadministered during the 
current episode at an adequate dose and adequate duration.  Adequate dose is defined as a dose above the 
minimum labeled dose (per package insert). Adequate duration is defined as continuous ADT treatment for at 
least 6 w eeks, with a minimum of 3 of 6 weeks above the minimal dose. The study schema is pre sented in
Figure 1.
Duration : The study will consist of up to 14 days of screening (with up to an additional 7 days if needed w ith 
Sponsor approval) and w ashout of prohibited medications follow ed by  6 weeks of DBtreatment followed by a 
4-week safety follow -up. At the end of the screening period, patients meeting the entry criteria for this study 
will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 DBtreatment groups :
cariprazine 1.5mg/day+ADT
cariprazine 3mg/d ay+ADT
placebo + ADT
Study Treatment Groups : cariprazine 1.5mg/day + ADT and cariprazine 3mg/day +ADT
Controls : matching placebo +ADT
Dosage/Dose Regimen :Investigational product (cariprazine or placebo) in the form of capsules packaged in 
blister packs will be provided by the S ponsor. No investigational product w ill be administered during the 
screening/washout period ; patients will continue the same antidepressant and dose they we re on at Screening .
Patients who are taking more than one antidepressant at Screening, regardless of the indication, will need to 
discontinue all other antidepressants prior to Baseline ( Visit 2 ). During the DBtreatment period (6 w eeks), 
patients will tak e 1 capsule orally per day in addition to their ongoing ADT. Patients in the 1.5mg/day + ADT 
arm will take 1.5 mg + ADT starting at Visit 2 (Week 0) . Patients in the 3mg/day + ADT arm will take 
1.5mg+ ADT st arting at Visit 2 (Week 0) for 2 weeksand then titrate to 3 mg/d ay+ADT starting at Visit 4
(Week 2). Patients will be supplied w ith identically appearing capsules of either cariprazine 1.5 mg, cariprazine 
3mg, or placebo. After completion of the DB treatment period, patients w ill continue a s outpatients during the 
safety follow -up period and will receive treatment as usual at the discretion of the investigator or designee ; no 
investigational product w ill be administered .
Randomization/Stratification :After the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
cariprazine 1.5mg/day+ADT, cariprazine 3mg/d ay+ADT, or placebo + ADT .
Visit Schedule :There are 7 visits including screening/washout (up to 14 days, with up to an ad ditional 7 days if
needed w ith Sponsor approval ), the DB treatment period (6 weeks), and the safety follow -up visit (4weeks) as 
shown in Table 1.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 3111 -302- 001 Amendment 3
14Study Population Characteristics
Number of Patients: The study will screen approximately 1700 patients to randomize 750 patients in a 1:1:1 
ratio to cariprazine 1.5 mg/d ay+ ADT, cariprazine 3mg/d ay+ ADT, and placebo + ADT groups. In the event 
that screen failure rates are higher than projected, enrollment w ill continue until approximately 250 patients per 
treatment arm are randomized.
Condition/Disease :Major depressive disorder
Key Inclusion Criteria :Male or female 18 to 65 years of age; meeting DSM -5 criteria for MDD; having a total 
score ≥ 22 on the Ham ilton Depression Rating Scale– 17 items (HAMD- 17)and hav ingan inadequate response , 
as measured by the modified ATRQ, to 1-3 antid epressant sadministered during the current episode at an
adequate dose and adequate duration. Adequate dose is defined as a dose above the minimum labeled dose (per 
package insert). Adequate duration is defined as continuous ADT treatment for at least 6 weeks, with a 
minimum of 3 of 6 weeks above the minimal dose.
Key Exclusion Criteria: Any current psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD (including those w ith current 
intellectual development disability) with the exception of specific phobias. History of me eting DSM -5 for any 
substance -related disorders (ie, use disorders except caffeine -and tobacco -related) and addictive disorders 
within the 6 months before Visit 1 .
Response Measures
Primary Efficacy Parameter :Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MA DRS).
Pharmacokinetics: Samples will be collected for determination of the plasma concentrations of cariprazine and 
its metabolites. A total of 3 blood samples will be collected during the study, as shown in Table 1.
Pharmacogenetic Sampling: One b lood sample will be collected from randomized patients at any time point 
betw een Visit 2/Baseline (Week 0 )and Visit 6 /ET(Week 6) for pharmacogenetic biobanki ng. Participation is 
optional.
Safety: Adverse event recording, clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, prolactin), 
vital sign parameters (including blood pressure, pulse rate), body mass index, weight, waist circumference, 
physi cal examinations, electrocardiograms, Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating 
Scale , and m easures of extrapyramidal symptoms: Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale, and Simpson -Angus Scale.
General Statistica l Methods and Types of Analyses: Efficacy analyses will be based on the modified 
intent -to-treat p opulation, consisting of all randomized patients with ≥ 1 postbaseline assessment of the 
MADRS total score.
The primary efficacy parameter w ill be the change from baseline to Week 6 in the MA DRS total score. The 
primary analysis will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures with treatment group, 
country, ADT failure category ( one ADT failure, more than one ADT failure), visit, and treatment 
group -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and the baseline value and baselin e-by-visit interaction as covariates. 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -patient scores. The Hochberg 
procedure w ill be u sed to control the overall t ype I error rate at a 0.05 level (2 -sided) for multiple comparisons 
of 2active doses with placebo for the primary endpoint.
Safety analyses will be based on the safety p opulation consisting of all randomized patients who receiv ed at 
least 1dose of DBinvestigational product. All safety parameters w ill be summarized descriptively.
Sample Size Calculation :The study will screen approximately 1700 patients to randomize 750 patients in a 
1:1:1 ratio to cariprazine 1.5mg/d ay+ ADT, cariprazine 3 mg/d ay+ ADT, and placebo + ADT gro ups. A 
sample size of 250 patien ts per arm will provide approximately 90% statistical pow er to show  at least 1of the 
2cariprazine doses is statistically significantly more efficacious than placebo in the primary endpoint, assuming 
an effect size of 0.286 and a dropout rate of 15% at Week 6. The sample size and pow er were calculated 
adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Hochberg procedure.

191Back ground and Clinical Rationale
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highl y disabling, serious condition that is associated 
with significant morbidity and mortality . MDD manifests as a major depressive episode 
(which may  be singular or recurrent) in which the affected individual experien ces 
1)depressed mood, or 2) loss of interest or pleasure (as well as other symptoms) for most of 
the day , nearl y ever y day, for at least 2 weeks. MDD af fects approximately  14.8 million 
American adults, or about 6.7% of the US population 18 years of age an d older, in a given 
year (Kessler et al, 2005 ). Worldwide, about 15% of the adult population is at lifetime risk of 
developing MDD ( Kessler et al, 1994 ).
Depression may  cause serious, long -lasting s ymptoms and often disrupts a person’s ability  to 
perform routine tasks. According to the World Health Or ganization , depression is one of the 
leading causes of disability , measured as years lived with d isability , in the world today  
among persons age 5 years and older and is the fourth most important contributor to the 
global burden of disease, measured as disability -adjusted life y ears ( Mathers and Loncar , 
2006 ). In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for nearl y 184 million 
disability -adjusted life years worldwide; depressive disorders accounted for 40.5% of this 
total burden ( Whiteford et al , 2013 ).The total econ omic burden of treating depression in the 
United States was $83.1 billion, with workplace costs, including missed day s and lack of 
productivity  due to illness, accounting for most of the total economic burden (62%). Other 
economic burdens in 2000 included $26.1 billion (31%) for treatment costs and $5.4 billion 
(7%) for suicide -related costs ( Greenberg et al, 2003 ).
MDD is a leading cause of disability  in the United States (Murray  et al, 2013 ). Moreover ,
MDD is known to be a significant risk factor for suicide and ischemic heart disease, as it
accounted for 16 million of the disability -adjusted life y earsassociated with suicide and 
4million of the disability -adjusted life yearsassociated wi th ischemic heart disease. 
Research has shown that untreated depression has both a functional (social and work role) as 
well as a neuroanatomical (hippocampal shrinkage) ef f ect on the patient ( Vid ebech and
Ravnkilde, 2004 ). Given the disease burden and link to suicidality  as well as increased 
mortality  with other comorbid conditions, MDD is a serious and life- threatening condition 
that is a leading cause of disability  in the world.
Selective Ser otonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Ser otonin -Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors in 
Major Depr essive Disor der
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
currentl y represent the first line of treatment of depressi on in the United States. 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
20Unfortunately , a large number of patients do not experience therapeutic benefit from these 
first-line agents ( Rosenzweig -Lipson et al, 2007 ). Lack of suf ficient response to adequate 
treatment remain s a critical problem in the management of patients with MDD. Up to two 
thirds of patients treated with first- line antidepressant monotherap y do not reach full 
remission, and as many  as a third become treatment resistant ( Fava and Davidson, 1996; 
Tri vedi et al, 2006 ). Not achieving remission has been shown to be predictive of poorer 
psychosocial functioning, higher rates of relapse, and higher rates of rehospitalization 
(McInt y re and O’ Donovan, 2004 ).The results of the ST AR*D study  suggest that with 
successive failures of treatment, patients are less and less likely  to respond to subsequent 
treatment, and those who do respond are more likely  to relapse ( Rush et al, 2006 ). Present 
strategies available to treat patients who do not respond to first -line antidepressant 
monotherap y include switching of antidepressant (either within or between classes); 
combination therap y in which mul tiple antidepressants are used simultaneously ; 
augmentation of ongoing antidepressant monotherapy with adjunctive use of drugs such as 
mood stabilizers or aty pical antipsy chotics ( Boland and Keller ,  2006 ); and the use of 
nonpharmacologic treatments including ps ychotherap y and phototherap y, vagus nerve 
stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and e lectroconvulsive therapy .
Atypical Antipsychotics as Adjunctive Therapy in Major Depr essive Disor der
The drugs currentl y approved for use as adjunctive therap y to antidepre ssants for the 
treatment of MDD —namely , the at ypical antipsychotics —are Abilify®(aripiprazole ; Abilify®
Package Insert, 2017 ), Seroquel XR®(quetiapine fumarate ; Seroquel XR®Package Insert, 
2017 ), and Rexulti®(brexpiprazole ; Rexulti®Package Insert, 201 8). Abilify (aripiprazole) 
was approved in 2007 for adjunctive tre atment in adult patients meeting Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disor ders, Fourth Edition, criteria for MDD who had had an 
inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy  (ADT ).Aripiprazole and brexpip razole 
are both dopamine partial agon ists like cariprazine. Both have shown ef ficacy  in the 
treatment of depression as an adjunct ive treatment to ADT . Seroquel XR was approved in 
2009 for adjunctive treatment in adult patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disor ders, Fourth Edition, criteria for MDD. Quetiapine is an at ypical antipsy chotic 
with relatively  high af finity  for D 2and 5 -HT 2areceptors and an active metabolite that has 
inhibitory  affects at the norepinephrine transporter . Olanzapine in combination with 
fluox etine has been shown to be ef fectiv e in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression 
and is currentl y marketed for that indication as Symbyax®(Sym by ax®Package Inser t).
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
21Cariprazine is an orall y active and potent partial agonist at central dopamine D3/D2and 
serotonin 5- HT 1Areceptor s and an antagonist at serotonin 5 -HT 2Areceptors developed b y 
Gedeon Richter P LCand Allergan Sales, LLC . 
On 17 September 2015, cariprazine (V raylar®) was approved by  the US FDA  for the 
treatment of schizophrenia (1.5 mg to 6 mg/day ) and for the acute treatment of manic or 
mixed episodes associated with bipolar I  disorder in adults (3 mg to 6 mg/day )  ( Vra y lar®
Package Insert 2017 ). On 13 July  2017, Allergan ’s development partner , Gedeon Richter, 
was granted marketing authorization in the European Union for cariprazine (Reagila®) 
(Reagila®Package Insert 2017 ) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients (1.5 to 6
mg/day ). 
Cariprazine has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression in three 
studies ( RGH -MD-53, RGH -MD-54and RGH -MD-56). Cariprazine doses of 1.5 and 3 mg 
have demonst rated efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression . 
The mechanism of action of cariprazine in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder has not been 
fully  elucidated . However , the efficacy of cariprazine could be mediated through a 
combination of partial ag onist activity  at central dopamine D 2and serotonin 5- HT 1A
receptors and antagonist activity  at serotonin 5- HT 2Areceptors. Cariprazine forms 2 major 
metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethy l cariprazine (DDCAR) , that 
have in vitro receptor binding profiles similar to the parent drug. 
A unique feature of cariprazine is that it binds with significantl y higher affinity to D 3than to
D2receptors. Cariprazine display s partial agonist as well as antagonist activity  on
biosy nthesis -and release -modulating presy naptic D 2receptors and has preferential
dopaminergic actions in the limbic regions. However , cariprazine is more potent than 
aripiprazole, and the degree of its apparent partial agonist activity  is greater than 
aripiprazole ’s.Cariprazine also has considerable affinity for , and is a partial agonist and 
antagonist at, the serotonin 5- HT 1Aand 5 -HT 2Breceptors, respectively . 
Antidepressant -and/or anxioly tic-likeeffects of cariprazine may  also be mediated through 
these receptors.

222Study Obje ctives and Clinical Hypotheses 
2.1 Study Objective
The objective of this study  is to evaluate the ef ficacy , safety ,and tolerability of cariprazine 
1.5mg/d ayand 3mg/daycompared with placebo as an adjunctive treatment to ADT in 
patients with MDD who have had an inadequate response to antidepressants alone.
2.2 Clinical Hypotheses
In the treatment of patients with MDD who have had an inadequate response to ADT alone, 
cariprazine as an adjunct ive treatment to ADT is safe and more effective than placebo as an 
adjunct ive treatment to ADT .
3Study Design
This is a global, multicenter , randomized, double -blind (DB), placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, fixed- dose study  comparing cariprazine 1.5 mg/day  and cariprazine 3 mg/day  
with placebo as an adjunctive treatment to on going ADT in outpatients with a diagnosis of 
MDD (via the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
[DSM -5]) who have had an inadequate response to ADT in the current episode as measured 
by the modif ied Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) . The study 
schema is presented in Figure 1.
Dose Selection and R ational e:Cariprazine has been evaluated as an adjunctiv e treatment to 
ADT in three flexibly -dosed clinical trials (RGH -MD-71, RGH -MD-72, and RGH -MD-75) 
in patients who have had an inadequate respons e to ADT alone. In those trials, the dose of 
cariprazine ranged from 0.1 mg to 4.5 mg. In one trial (RGH -MD-75), cariprazine 2 mg to 
4.5mg + ADT was found to be superior to placebo + ADT , as measured by  the change from 
baseline to Week 6 on the MADRS total score. In this patient population, cariprazine doses 
lower than 2 mg did not demonstrate ef ficacy  as an adjunct ive treatment to ADT .However , in 
3 monotherap y fixed -dose trials conducted in patients with depressive episodes associated 
with bipolar I  disorder (RGH -MD-53,RGH -MD-54, and RGH -MD-56) cariprazine 1.5 mg 
was shown to be superior to placebo as a monotherap y treatment of depression. Cariprazine 
1.5 and 3 mg/day have both demonstrated superior ef ficacy  in the monotherapy  treatment of 
bipolar depression.
The bipolar depression studies utilized a dif ferent titration schedule than previously  
employ ed for bipolar mania. This alternate dosing regimen and lower dose contributed to 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
23improvements in tolerability . In the phase III bipolar depression program, all patients were 
started on cariprazine 1.5 mg. Patients assigned to 1.5 mg remained on dose for the 
rema inder of the study , whereas, patients assigned to cariprazine 3 mg remained on 
cariprazine 1.5mg for 14 day s before being uptitrated to 3 mg for the remainder of the study. 
Accordingly , based on the above -mentioned studies in MDD and bipolar depression, th e 
doses for investigation in Study  3111-302-001 will be 1.5 mg/day  and 3 mg/day  as an 
adjunctive treatment to ADT .
Another area to consider is dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy . Cariprazine 1.5 mg/day  D2 
occupancy  is 59% while its D3 occupancy  is 83%. At 3 mg/day , D2 occupancy for 
cariprazine is 72% and D3 is 90% (Study  RGH -PK-15). While no specific occupancy data 
are available to guide a dosing decision for adjunctive use of an antips ychotic agent with 
antidepressants, we do know that 2 other dopamine par tial agonists with approved indications 
as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressants (aripiprazole 5 to 15 mg/day  and brexpiprazole 
2mg/day to 4 mg/day ) have rates of D2 receptor occupancy  ranging from 60% to 90% 
(aripiprazole 80% to 90%; brexpiprazole 6 0% to 67%). The low D2 occupancy of cariprazine 
at 1.5 mg/day  and 3 mg/day  may  provide enough receptor blockade to af fect mood without 
adversel y affecting movement. The occupancy  of D3 and 5HT 1Areceptors may  also play  an 
important role in the antidepressa nt efficacy  of cariprazine.
Study Duration: The study  will consist of up to 14 day s of screening (with up to an 
additional 7 day s if needed with Sponsor approval ) and washout of prohibited medications 
followed b y 6 weeks of DB treatment followed by a 4-week safety  follow -up.
Screening/W ashout Period: Patients with MDD with inadequate response to ongoing ADT  
in the current episode will undergo a screening period where consent, eligibility  assessment, 
and withdrawal of prohibited medications will occur for u p to 14 day s(with up to an 
additional 7 day s if needed with Sponsor approval ).During the screening period, the patients 
will continue to take the ADT at the same dose to which they are having an inadequate 
response .Patients who are taking more than one antidepressant at Screening, regardless of 
the indication, will need to discontinue all other antidepressants prior to Baseline (V isit 2 ). 
The length and timing of the washout of prior ps ychiatric medications during the 14 day s 
allotted for the screening period is at the discretion of the investigator (with up to an 
additional 7 day s if needed with Sponsor approval ). Prior medications should be graduall y 
withdrawn such that the washout is completed b y Baseline ( Visit 2). Please note that during 
the washout period ps ycho tropic medications other than those listed as rescue (Section 4.5.3 ) 
may not be newl y initiated or reinitiated.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
24Randomization/DB T reatment Period: At the time of randomization, eligible patients will 
be randoml y assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive cariprazine 
1.5mg/d ay+ ADT  or 3mg/d ay + ADT , or placebo + ADT . Investigational product (IP) will 
be administered orally  once dail y for 6 weeks.
Dosage and Dosing Regimen: Investigational product (cariprazine or placebo) in the form 
of capsules packaged in blister packs will be provided by  the S ponsor . No investigational 
product will be administered during the screening/washout period; patients will continue on 
the ADT they  were on at Screening. During the DB treatment period (6 weeks), patients will 
take 1 capsule orall y per day in addition to their ongoing ADT . Patients in the 1.5 mg/day  + 
ADT arm will take 1.5 mg + ADT  starting at V isit 2 (W eek 0). Patients in the 3 mg/day  + 
ADT arm will take 1.5 mg + ADT  starting at V isit 2 (W eek 0) for 2 weeks and then 3 mg/day  
+ ADT  starting at V isit 4 (W eek2). Patients will be supplied with identically  appearing 
capsules of either cariprazine 1.5 mg, cariprazine 3 mg, or placebo. After completion of the 
DB treatment period, patients will continue as outpatients during the safet y follow -up period 
and will re ceive treatment as usual at the discretion of the investigator or designee; no 
investigational product will be administered.

4.5 Permissible and Prohibited Medications/T reatments
4.5.1 Permissible Medications/T reatments
Treatment consi dered necessary  for the patient’ s welfare may  be gi ven at the discretion of the
Investigator . Prohibited and allowed escape medications are detailed in Sections 4.5.2 and
4.5.3 , respectivel y. If the permissibility  of a specific medication/treatment is in question, 
please contact the Allergan Medical Monitor .
4.5.1.1 Definition of Females of (Non -)Childbearing Potential and/or 
Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
For the purposes of this study , females will be considered of childbearing potential unless 
they are naturall y postmen opausal or permanentl y sterilized (eg, h ysterectomy ). Natural 
menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, determined 
retrospectivel y after a woman has experienced 12 months of amenorrhea without any  other 
obvious pathological or p hysiological cause. 
For women of childbearing potential who may  participate in the study , and are not 
exclusively  homosexual, the following methods of contraception, if properly  used, are 
generall y considered reliable: hormonal contraceptives (ie, oral, p atch, injection, implant 
ring), with barrier method, (eg, condom, diaphragm) or condom with intravaginal spermicide, 
diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, surgical sterilization 
(bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectom y),vasectomized partner , or sexual abstinence.
For males who may  participate in the study , the following methods of contraception, if 
properl y used, are generally  considered reliable: postbilateral vasectomy, barrier 
contraception, or sexual abstinence.
The investigator and each patient will determine the appropriate method of contraception for 
the patient during his or her participation in the study .The investigator must discuss with the 
patient the need to continue contraceptive use for 12 weeks after the last dose of study  drug.
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study, th e investigator will notify  the 
Sponsor immediately  after the pregnancy  is confirmed and the patient will be exited from the 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
31study  after appropriate safety  follow -up. The inve stigator will (1) notify  the patient ’s 
physician that the patient was being treated with cariprazine, and (2) follow the progress of 
the pregnancy . The investigator must document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide a 
copy  of the documentation to Aller gan.
4.5.2 Prohibited Medications/T reatments
Medications that are moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or are CYP3A4 inducers , with 
the exception of the concomitant study  ADT, are not allowed. Patients taking moderate (eg, 
erythromy cin, fluconazole) or strong CY P3A4 inhibitors (eg, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
clarithrom ycin) or CYP3A4 inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine) will need to have 
medications discontinued 10 day s prior to the start of treatment with DBIP. Patients who 
cannot or should not be taken off the CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer should not be enrolled. If 
a patient requires concomitant treatment with either a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
or a CYP3A4 inducer at any  time during the study , he or she must be discontinued.
Any psychotropic drug or any drug/treatment with psychotropic activit y or with a potentially 
psychotropic component (including medications, supplements and herbal medications) is 
prohibited, other than what is listed under rescue medications.
Psychotropic medications include the following:
Antipsy chotics/neuroleptics
Antidepressants (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors) except the ongoing ADT
Stimulants
Anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers
Sedative s/hypnotics/anxioly tics
Dopamine- releasing drugs or dopamine agonists
Psychotropic drugs not otherwise specified (including herbal products).
Phenaz epam
The decision to administer a prohibited medication/treatment is done with the safet y of the
study  patient as the primary  consideration. When possible, Allergan should be notified before 
the prohibited medication/treatment is administered.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
32Patients will be asked to limit drinking alcohol and abstain from using illicit drugs during the 
study .
Patients who have been taking stable doses of benzodiazepines (lorazepam up to 2 mg/d ayor
equivalent , with the exception of phenaze pam) for at least 1 month before screening can 
continue use.
4.5.3 Rescue Medications
Medically appropriate episodic use (up to 3 day s) of narcotic analgesics for acute medical
indications (eg , tooth extraction) is allowe d during the study .
For insomnia the following will be allowed but should not be prescribed prophylactically:
Zolpidem (maximum of 10 mg/d ay)
Zolpidem extended release (maximum of 12.5 mg/d ay)
Zaleplon (maximum of 20 mg/d ay)
Eszopiclone (maximum of 3.0 mg/ day)
Zopiclone (maximum of 7.5 mg/d ay)
Chloral hy drate (maximum of 1000 mg/d ay) may  be used acutely  with appro val from the 
Allergan Medical Monitor
Suvo rexant (maximum of 20 mg/day)
These medications for insomnia must be administered before bedtime as reco mmended in 
their prescribing information. The medication must be documented on the relevant electronic 
case report form (eCRF). No such medication is permitted within 8 hours of psy chiatric or 
neurological assessments.
For extrapyramidal s ymptoms ( EPS)or akathisia, the following will be allowed but should 
not be prescribed prophylactically:
For EPS or akathisia that emerges or worsens during the study , the rescue medications listed
below will be allowed. However , each of the 3 EPS scales (Abnormal Invo luntary  Movement
Scale [AI MS], Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS], and Simpson- Angus Scale [SAS])
should be administered first to support the decision to dispense these rescue medications. The
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
33only exception to administering the EPS scales before dispens ing rescue medication is
medical urgency (eg, d ystonia, severe akathisia, etc.).
Benztropine 
Biperiden
Diphenhy dramine
Trihexyphenid yl
Propranolol. Daily  dose of propranolol depends on heart rate and blood pressure (BP) .
The need for continued use of the se medications shoul d be regularl y assessed by  the 
investigator and documented appropriately .
Injectable agents are not allowed, except for the treatment of an acute d ystonic reaction if
deemed necessary .
For agitation, restlessness, and hostility:
Episodic use of lorazepam up to 2 mg/d ay(or equivalent benzodiazepine) and for up to
3consecutive day s at a time is allowed for agitation, restlessness, and hostility .The 
medication use and the agitation, restlessness, or hostility  must be documented on the
relevant eCRF pages.
Efficacy  assessments should not be performed within 8 hours of administration of lorazepam
or equivalent benzodiazepine , or within 24 hours of administration of diazepam. Abrupt 
discontinuation of benzodiazepines is not advised.
5Study Treatments 
5.1 Study Treatments and Formulations
Capsules containing 1.5 mg of cariprazine and 3.0 mg of cariprazine.
5.2 Contr ol Treatment
Matching placebo capsules.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
345.3 Methods for Masking/Blinding
During the DB period, all IP(cariprazine or placebo) will be provided in identical blister 
cards to maintain masking throughout the study . All patients will be instructed to take 
1 capsule of IP  once daily  at approximately  the same time each day , in addition to the 
background ADT .
5.4 Method for Assignment to Treatmen t Groups/Randomization
Prior to initiation of study  treatment, each patient who provides informed consent will be 
assigned a patient number via an automated interactive web response s ystem (I WRS) that 
will serve as the patient identification number on all study  documents.
At the time of randomization, eligible patients will be randoml y assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive cariprazine 1.5 mg/d ayor 3mg/day, or placebo. Stratified 
randomization will be used for this study  with strata defined b y two factors: ADT failure 
category  (one ADT failure, more than one ADT  failure) and country . 
An IWRS will be used for patient randomization and to manage all aspects of IP during the 
study . Allergan Statistical Programming (randomization progra mmer) will prepare the 
randomization codes.
IP will be labeled with medication kit numbers. The I WRS will provide the site with the
specific medication kit number(s) for each randomized patient during the DB treatment 
period (cariprazine 1.5mg/dayand 3 mg/day, or placebo). Sites will receive the I WRS 
confirmation notifications for each transaction. All notifications will be maintained with the 
study  source documents.
5.5 Treatment Regimen and Dosing
No IPwill be administered during the screening/washout peri od or the safety  follow -up 
period. Patients will continue on their background ADT during the screening/washout period.
During the safety  follow -up period, the investigator may initiate alternative treatment as 
clinically  necessary . 
During the DB treatment period (6 weeks), patients will take 1 capsule of IP,orally,per day
in addition to their ongoing ADT as shown in Tab le 2.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
35Table 2 Treatment Regimen and Dosing
Drug/Dose Investigational Product 
FrequencyRoute of Administration
Double -Blind T reatment Period (Visit 2 through Visit 6)
Placebo Once daily Oral (capsule)
Cariprazine 1.5 mg Once daily Oral (capsule)
Cariprazine 3 mg (1.5mg/day for 2 w eeks, 
starting at Visit 2 [ Baseline]; 3 mg/day from 
Visit 4 [Week 2] through Visit 6 [Week 6])Once daily Oral (capsule)
All investigational products will be taken orally as a single daily dose at approximately the same time of day 
(morning or evening). The dosing time can be switched if there are tolerability problems. Any switch must 
allow  at least 24 hours between 2 consecutive doses and must be documented in the eCRF.
5.6 Treatment Compliance
5.6.1 IP Compliance
IP compliance will be closely  monitored b y counting the number of capsules dispensed and 
returned, and through patient interviews at study  visits .Before dispensing new I P, study  
center personnel will make every  effort to collect all unused I P and empt y blister cards. 
Patients who take less IP  or more IP than the prescribed regimen must be counseled on the 
importance of taking study  medication as in structed. If a patient demonstrates poor 
compliance during the study  (<80% or > 120% overall, measured b y capsule counts and 
patient interview s), the Investigator should evaluate whether the patient should be 
discontinued from the study . 
The study  center s will monitor pati ent compliance at every  visit and maintain an accurate 
drug disposition record which specifies the amount of IP administered to each patient and the 
date of administration. The site ’s drug disposition record will be considered source 
documentation. 
Any patient who misses ≥ 4 consecutive doses of IP  and/or ongoing ADT  must b e 
discontinued from the study . 
5.6.2 ADT Compliance
Background ADT medication compliance will also be closel y monitored. Patients will 
continue on the same antidepressant a nd dose of ADT  they  were on at b aseline .Patients 
should be questioned to determine if there were any missed doses or changes in dose between 
visits. Every  effort should be made to have patients bring their background ADT to stud y 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
36Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for verification of patient -reported compliance b y pill /capsule count 
(to the extent possible) and patient interviews at study  visits. Patients who take less ADT  or 
more ADT  than the prescribed regimen, must be counselled on the importance of taking ADT 
as instructed. If a patient demonstrates poor compliance with their ongoing ADT during the 
study  (< 80% or > 120% overall ,measured b y pill/capsule count and patient interview ), the 
Investigator should evaluate whether the patient should be discontinu ed from the study . Any 
patient who misses ≥ 4 consecutive doses of IP and/or ongoing ADT must be discontinued 
from the study . Patients, who in the current episode, have had an inadequate response to at 
least 1 ADT given at a dose above the minimum and for at least 6 weeks, can be enrolled. 
5.7 Storage of Study Medications/T reatments
IP (cariprazine and placebo) will be packaged in blister cards and provided by  Allergan , and 
must be stored in an appropriate secure area (eg, a locked cabinet in a locked room) at room 
temperature ( 20°C to25°C or 68°F to 77°F, with a permitted range of 15°C to 30°C or 
59°F to 86°F) and must be protected from heat, moisture, and light.
6Response Measures and Summary of Data Collection Methods
6.1 Diagnostic Assessments
6.1.1 The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5)
The SCI D-5 is a semi -structured interview guide for making the major DSM -5 diagnoses 
(formerl y diagnosed on Axis I). This clinician- rated diagnostic assessment will be 
administered b y an investigator, subinvestigator, or rater who has extensive professional 
training and experience in the diagnosis of mental illness. The SCI D-5 will be considered a 
source document for this study . 
6.1.2 SAFER Criteria Inventory
The SAFER criteria inventory  (Tar gum et al, 2008 ) is a clinician -rated scale that is used to 
facilitate the identification of appropriate and valid patients for clinical trials. The scale will 
confirm that the identified patients have acute s ymptoms that refle ct the current state of 
illness and that these sy mptoms can be assessed with the appropriate rating instruments. The 
scale will be administered to the patients remotely via telephone b y clinicians from the 
Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Trial Netw ork and Institute (MGH CTNI) at Visit 1 
(Screening) . In addition, the MGH CTNI SAFER raters will also remotel y administer the 
HAMD- 17 and the modified ATRQ. After the assessments are evaluated, MGH CTNI will 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
37notify  the study  center , indicating whether the patient meets eligibility  criteria to continue in 
the study . MGH CTNI will only  perform the SAFER, HAMD -17, and m odified ATRQ 
interviews at Visit 1 and only  for patients who have alread y met the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria assessed at V isit 1. To ensu re the highest quality  and for patient comfort, these calls 
should not be conducted while the patient is on- site, unless approved b y the Sponsor .
Study  center staff will schedule the telephone assessment (SAFER interview) with raters 
from MGH CTNI. Patient s who do not meet the SAFER criteria will be screen failed. The 
information collected b y MGH CTNI will be copied and transmitted to the study  centers to 
retain as source documentation. Sites will acknowledge receipt of the SAFER scale, 
HAMD-17 and modifi edATRQ interview results via a check -box in an eCRF .
6.1.3 The Modified Antidepressant T reatment Response Qu estionnaire
The ATRQ ( Fava 2003) is a clinician -administered questionnaire that will be used to 
determine whether the pat ient meets inclusion criteria for prior ADT treatment and response 
requirements. A modified ATRQ, completed b y a clinician at the study  site who has been 
certified in administration of the ATRQ, will be used to assess prior antidepressant exposure 
and resp onse within the current depressive episode. The clinician will identify  the 
antidepressants the patient had previously  taken within the current episode; indicating the 
dose range and duration. The clinician will then select the level of response the patien t had to 
the antidepressant which resulted in the greatest response.
The number of ADT s in the current episode to which the patient had an inadequate response 
will include any  ADT with < 50% reduction in depressive s ymptoms if given at adequate 
doses (as defined by  the ADT package insert; with at least 1 ADT  having been escalated 
above the minimum dose) and with a duration of at least 6 weeks during the present episode. 
6.2 Efficacy Endpoints
6.2.1 Primary Efficacy
The primary  efficacy  parameter will be the change f rom baseline to Week 6 in the MADRS 
total score.
Assessment and ratings of the primary  efficacy  scale will be per formed by  a trained rater. 
Every ef fort should be made to have patient s assessed by  the sam e rater at each scheduled 
timepoint.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
386.2.1.1 Montgomery -Åsbe rg Depression Rating Scale
The MADRS ( Montgomery  and Åsberg, 1979 ) is a 10 -item, clinician-rated scale that
evaluates the patient’s depressive s ymptomatology  during the past week. Patients are rated 
on items assessing feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality , 
reduced sleep or appetite, dif ficulty  in concentration, and lack of interest. Each item isscored 
on a 7- point scale with a score of 0 reflecting no symptoms and a score of 6 reflecting 
symptoms of maximum severity .
6.2.2 Additional Efficacy Variables
Assessment and ratings of ef ficacy  scales will be performed b y a trained rater . Every  effort 
should be made to have patients assessed b y the same rater at each scheduled timepoint.
6.2.2.1 The Hamilton Anxie ty Rating Scale
The Hamilton Anxiety  Rating Scale (HAM- A) (Hamilton 1959 ) is a clinician -rated scale 
which consists o f 14 items, each rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (no t present) to 
4(very  severe). The highest possible score is 56, which represents the most severe form of 
anxiety ; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of anxiety . This 
instrument will be administered b y an experienced rater meeting the training requirements 
and q ualifications set b y the S ponsor .
6.2.2.2 Clinical Global Impressions –Severity
The CGI -S (Guy  1976 ) is a clinician -rated scale that measures the overall severit y of a
patient ’s illness in comparison with the severit y in other patie nts the phy sician has observed.
The patient is rated on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating a “ normal state ” and 7 indicating
“among the most extremely  ill patients”. The CGI -S will be administered by aninvestigator , 
subinvestigator or rater with extens ive professional training and experience in assessing 
mental illness.
6.2.2.3 Clinical Global Impressions –Improvement
The Clinical Global I mpression s–Improvement (CGI -I) scale ( Guy  1976 ) is a clinician -rated
scale that in this stud y will be used to rate total improvement or worsening of mental illness
from V isit 2, regardless of whether the i nvestigator considers it to be a result of drug
treatment or not. The patient will be rated on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating that the
patient is very  much improved and 7 indicating that the patient is very  much worse. The 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
39CGI-I will be administered by  aninvestigator, subinvestigator or rater with extensive 
professional training and experience in assessing mental illness.
6.2.2.4 Hamilton Depres sion Rating Scale– 17Item s
The HAMD -17 (Hamilton 1960; Hamilton 1967; Miller et al, 1985 ) is a clinician -rated, 
17-item scale used to rate the patient’ s depressive state based on feelings of depression, guilt, 
suicidality , anxiety , agitation, level of insight, patterns of insomnia, loss of interest in work 
and other activities, weight loss, hy pochondriasis, and degree of ps ychomotor retardation. It 
also can be used to identify genital and somatic s ymptoms. This instrument will be 
administered b y an experienced rater meeting the training requirements and qualifications set 
by the S ponso r.
6.3 Health Outcome Measures
The 12-item Short Form (SF )-12v2 health survey , a shortened version of the 36 -item Short 
Form (SF -36) survey , is a g eneric assessment of health -related quality  of life from the 
patient ’s perspective. It measures 8 concepts: phy sical functioning, role limitations due to 
physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality  (energy/fatigue), social 
functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health (phy siologic 
distress and phy siologic well -being) ( War e et al, 1996). The 8 scales are aggregated into 
2summary measures: the Phy sical Component Summary  (PCS -12) and the Mental 
Component Summary  (MCS -12) scores, which range from 0 to 100, with higher scores 
indicating better quality  of life.
6.4 Pharmacok inetics Measures
Samples for determination of the plasma concentrations of cariprazine and its metabolites
DCAR an d DDCAR will be collected at 3 timepoints during the study ,Visit 4 (W eek 2), 
Visit5 (Week 4) and V isit 6 (W eek 6). Samples may  be collected at any  time during the visit. 
The date and time of plasma sampling will be recorded in the eCRF along with the date and 
approximate time of the previous 2 doses of IP . Every  effort should be made to collect 
pharm acokinetic ( PK)samples for each patient. However , if for reasons of safet y or patient 
refusal, blood sampling is not possible, the PK sample can be omitte d. In the event that a PK 
sample is missed, the reason must be recorded in the eCRF.
For details on blood sample collection, plasma separation, storage, and shipment, refer to
instructions from the central laboratory .
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
406.5 Pharmacogenetic Sampling
Pharmacogenet ic sampling is to be conducted only  at study  centers where the institutional
review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) has approved the pharmacogenetic
portion of the study . Participation in the pharmacogenetic portion of the study  is optional and
will require a separate informed consent form (ICF). The pharmacogenetic ICF must be
signed before the pharmacogenetic blood sample is taken. Pharmacogenetic consent may  be 
obtained at an y time between V isit 1 (Screening ) and Visit 6 (W eek 6). Pharmaco genetic 
sampling (one sample per patient ) can be conducted at a ny time point between Visit 2 
(Baseline) and Visit 6 (W eek 6). Following consent, a single blood sample will be collected 
to determine individual genoty pe status and for pharmacogenetic biobank ing. The genetic 
material from the blood sample will be used to study  factors which may  influence how 
patients respond to a drug or may  explain the pathophy siology  of the disease. Blood samples 
will be stored to provide a resource for potential future studies conducted by Allergan. All 
pharmacogenetic samples collected will be sent to the designated central laboratory  and later 
shipped to a biorepository  for storage .Please refer to the laboratory  manual for the 
pharmacogenetic blood sampling procedures, sa mple anony mization, shipping instructions, 
and contact information. Anony mized pharmacogenetic samples may  be stored at the 
biorepository  for potential analy sis under separate protocols for up to 15 y ears. Samples may  
be stored for a longer time if a regul atory  or governmental authority  has active questions that 
are being answered. In this special circumstance, such samples will be stored until these 
questions have been adequately  addressed. A patient who initially  consents can withdraw that 
consent at an y time and have his or her pharmacogenetic sample destro yed, including an y by-
products of the sample.
6.6 Safety Measures
Patients must be evaluated by  a ph ysician or an appropriatel y trained health care professional
at every  visit and the evaluation must be doc umented. The procedures discussed below will 
be completed at the designated visits shown in Tab le 1, the schedule of visits and procedures.
6.6.1 Adverse Events
Subjective adverse events (AEs) will be collected throughout the study . For all AEs, the 
Investigator must provide an assessment of the severity , causal relationship to the I P, start and 
stop date, and seriousness of the event (eg, serious adverse event [SAE]), document all 
actions taken with regard to the I P, and detail any  other treatment measures taken for the AE.
Treatment for an AE is entered as a concomitant medication on the AE CRF .For events noted 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
41as SAEs, Allergan must be notified immediately to meet their reporting obligations to 
appropriate regulatory  authorities (see Section 9.3).
6.6.2 Ocular Events of Spe cial Inter est 
The S ponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory  authorities ofocular events of 
special interest. Therefore, the S ponsor must be notified immediately regarding an y ocul ar 
adverse events of special interest that occur after informed consent is obtained.
The following are considered ocular AEs of special interest, whether serious or nonserious,
and require immediate notification :
cataract, lens, or lenticular abnormality  or change, opacity , opacification or opalescence
blindness, night blindness, visual acuity  or vision decrease, abnormality  or change, visual 
acuity  test abnormality  or change
retinal, macular , or optic nerve degeneration, abnormality or change; retinal pig ment 
epithelium detachment, abnormality  or change
color vision decrease, abnormality  or change
Within 24 hours of learning of an y ocular event of special interest, the study site personnel 
must report the event , whether serious or nonserious, on the SAE/AESI  form.
All ocular events of special interest are to be followed by  the study  staff until resolution or 
until the ocular event of special interest is deemed stable. The S ponsor may  contact the study  
site to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.
6.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Determinations
Clinical laboratory  tests will be performed according to the schedule in Tab le 3. Patients will
be asked to fast for at least 10 hours prior to any  visit requiring clinical laboratory  testing.

6.6.4 Vital Signs
Vital sign assessments will include radial pulse rate, sy stolic and diastolic BP , body  weight,
waist circumference and temperature. BP , pulse rate, temperature, and body weight will be
measured at all visits. Whenever possible, the patient ’s weight should be measured at the
same time of day. Patients should wear their usual indoor clothing but remove their jackets
and shoes.
Height (without shoes) will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening) only.
Waist circumference will be measured at V isits 2 an d 6/earl y termination (ET) .
BP and radial pulse rate will be measured in the supine position followed by  the standing
position. The standing measurements must be measured after a suf ficient amount of time has 
been given to allow the BP  to equilibrate in the standing state. Radial pulse rate should be
measured after BP  measurements. BP  and radial pulse may  be measured manually  or by
machine.
All BP  and radial pulse rate measurements will be recorded in the source documents and
eCRF . Patients should be instructed not to wear clothing with tight sleeves when they  come
for clinic visits. Additionally , patients should be kept as calm and undisturbed as possible
while BP  and pulse rate measurements are taken (eg, there should be no talking while the BP
is being measured). The same arm and BP  cuff should be used for all BP measurements.
6.6.5 Electrocardiograms
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and V isit 6 or ET  using a standard 
paper speed of 25 mm/sec. ECGs will be electronically  transmitted for analy sisaccording to 
the instructions provided by  the ECG central reader . Measurements (in msec) will be 
recorded for the following parameters in lead II or lead III (other leads may be used onl y if it 
is not possible to obtain good -quality  tracings from lead II or lead III): PR interval, QRS 
interval, RR interval (preceding the QT), and uncorrected QT  interval. Copies of the ECG 
waveforms will also be sent to the central reader , where the ECG parameters will be 
measured and evaluated. The ECG tracing and cardiology report will be retained as a source 
document. Sites will transmit all ECGs to the ECG central reader .

446.6.6 Other Safety Assessments
Assessment and ratings of safet y scales will be performed b y a trained rater . Every ef fort 
should be made to have patients assessed b y the same rater at each scheduled time point.
6.6.6.1 Extrapyramidal Symptom sScales
The following 3 scales will be used to sy stematically  assess extrap yramidal side ef fects at
Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or at ET.
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
The AIMS ( Guy  1976 ) assesses abnormal involuntary  movements, such as tardive
dyskinesia, associated with antipsy chotic drugs; it measures facial, oral, extremities, and
trunk movements, as well as the patient ’s awareness of abnormal movements. The first
10items are rated on a none (0) to severe (4) scale. There are an additional 2 items on dental
status that are answered yes or no. 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale
The BARS ( Barnes 1989 ) is a 4- item rating scale used to assess drug -induced akathisia. The
scale comprises 3 items for rating the observable restless movements that characterize the
condition, the sub jective awareness of restlessness, and an y distress associated with the
akathisia (each on a 4 -point scale from normal [0] to severe [3]). I n addition, there is a global
severit y for akathisia item rated on a 6- point scale (absent [0] to severe akathisia [ 5]).
Simpson- Angus Scale
The SAS ( Simpson and A ngus, 1970 ) is a 10 -item rating scale for assessment of
antipsy chotic -induced parkinsonism in both clinical practice and research settings. Each item
ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme sy mptoms). The scale consists of 1 item measuring gait
(hypokinesia), 6 items measuring rigidity , and 3 items measuring glabella tap, tremor , and
salivation, respectivel y.
6.6.6.2 Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severit y of both suicidal ideation 
and behavior . Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5 -item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 
(nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any  methods [not plan] 
without int ent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
45plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). The C -SSRS also 
captures information about the intensity  of ideation, specificall y the frequency , dura tion, 
controllability , deterrents, and reasons for the most severe t ypes of ideation. Suicidal 
behavior is classified on a 5 -item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 (preparatory  acts or 
behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt). More than 
1classification can be selected provided they  represent separate episodes. For actual attempts 
only, the actual or potential lethality  is classified for the initial, most lethal, and most recent 
attempts. The C -SSRS will be completed at all study visits. At V isit 1 ( Screening), the 
C-SSRS will be completed for the patient’ s lifetime history  of suicidal ideation and behavior , 
including a 12- month lookback . At all other visits the C -SSRS will be completed for ideation 
and behavior since the previous visit.
The C -SSRS must be completed by aninvestigator , subinvestigator or trained rater, all of 
whom must have extensive professional training.
6.6.6.3 Young Mania Rating Scale
The Y MRS ( You ng et al, 1978) is an 1 1-item scale that assesses manic s ymptoms based on 
the patient ’s perception of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours, as well as the 
physician ’s clinical observations during the interview . The 1 1 items are elevated mood, 
increased motor activity -energy, sexual interest, sleep, irritability , rate and amount of speech, 
language -thought disorder , content, disruptive- aggressive behavior , appearance, and insight. 
The severit y of the abnormality  is rated on a 5- point (0 to 4) or 9 -point (0 to 8) scale .
Possible scores range from 0 to 60. 
This scale will be administered b y a trained rater with expertise in evaluating manic patients. 
6.7 Summary of Methods of Data Collection
An IWRS will be used to screen patients, dispense I P, randomize patients, and manage IP  
inventory . All other data for this study  will be collected using eCRFs via an electronic data 
capture s ystem, except for ECG and laboratory  data.
A qualified central ECG and central laboratory  vendor will be used for the anal ysis of all 
ECGs and blood and urine samples. ECG and laboratory  data will be transferred to Allergan 
or its designee on a periodic basis throughout the study .

7.2 Collection and Derivation of Primary and Secondary Efficacy
Assessments
7.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary  efficacy  parameter is the change from baseli ne to Week 6 in the MADRS total 
score .
7.2.2 Additional Efficacy Variables
Additional ef ficacy  parameters wil l include the following at post baseline visits described in 
Tab le 1:
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
47Change from baseline in the CGI -S score
CGI-I score
CGI-I response (CGI -I score ≤ 2)
MADRS response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score)
MADRS remission (MADRS total score ≤ 10)
Change from baseline in the HAMD -17 total score
Change from baseline in the HAM -A total score
7.3 Hypothesis and Methods of Analysis
All ef ficacy  anal yses will be based on the mITT  population. Baseline for efficacy is defined 
as the last nonmissing efficacy assessment before the date of the first dose of DBIP. All 
statistica l hypothesis tests will be 2- sided 5% -level of significance tests for main ef fects. All 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be 2 -sided 95% CIs , unless stated otherwise.
To compare with historic studies, some analy ses based on the imputed data using the 
last-observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach, will be presented for all ef ficacy  
parameters. Onl y the post baseline total score of a parameter will be imputed; individual item 
scores will not be carried forward. The baseline value will be carried forwar d only  for the 
intermittent missing values immediately  after baseline. If all the postbaseline values are 
missing, the baseline value will not be carried forward.
7.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses
The primary  estimand is provided below through specification of the population, the variable, 
the handling of intercurrent events ,and the population- level summary . 
Population
The target population are patients with MDD who have had an inadequate response to 
antidepressant therap y in the current episode and who satisfy t he inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as specified in the protocol.
The anal ysis population is defined to be the mITT  population consisting of all randomized 
patients with ≥ 1 postbaseline assessment of the MADRS total score as specified in protocol 
Section 7.1.1.4 .
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
48Variable
The variable is the same as the primary  efficacy  endpoint, which is the change from baseline 
to Week 6 in the MADRS total score.
Accounting of Intercurrent Events
Intercurrent events and their handling rules are described as follows:
Regardless of whether allowed rescue medications are taken or not, data are included 
in the anal ysis. Patients are still taking assigned drugs as specified in the prot ocol 
while taking allowed rescue medications. The clinical objective is to assess the 
efficac y of the treatment regardless of allowed rescue medication use. 
To evaluate the efficacy at W eek 6 in the mITT  population, patients are assumed to 
adhere to the a ssigned treatment for the duration of the study . As a result, data after 
the discontinuation from the study  treatment due to all reasons will not be included in 
the primary  analy sis and they  will be assumed as missing at random. 
Population -level Summary
The population -level summary  for the primary  endpoint is the dif ference in primary  variable 
means between each cariprazine group and placebo.
To address the primary  hypotheses that each dose of cariprazine is superior to placebo in the 
reduction of MADRS to tal score after 6 weeks of treatment, the change from baseline in 
MADRS total score will be anal yzed using a mixed- effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) with treatment group, country , ADT  failure category , visit, and treatment 
group -by-visit interacti on as fixed ef fects, and the baseline value and baseline -by-visit 
interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the 
covariance of within- patient scores. The Kenward -Roger approximation ( Kenward and
Roger ,  1997 ) will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. In the event of 
non-convergence of the model using unstructured covariance matrix, a structured covariance 
matrix will be used in combina tion with empirical variance estimate (ie ,sandwich estimator) 
to address the potential mis -specified situation. The following sequence of alternative 
covariance structures (First -order antedependence [ANTE (1)], Toeplitz [T OEP], First -order 
autoregressive [AR(1)] and compound sy mmetry [CS]) will be considered in the MMRM 
until convergence.
The anal ysis will be performed based on all post baseline scores using onl y the observed 
cases without imputation of missing values. The treatment dif ference in the primary  endpoint 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
49at Week 6 for each active treatment group versus placebo in the mITT population will be 
estimated and reported along with t he corresponding 95% CIand the p- value.
The Hochberg procedure ( Hochberg 1988 ) will be used to control the overall t ype I error rate 
at a 0.05 level (2 -sided) for multiple comparisons of 2 active doses with placebo for the
primary  endpoint. Statistical significance will be determined b y comparing the adjusted 
p-values to α = 0.050.
The study  will be considered positive if at least 1 dose arm of cariprazine is statistically  
superior to placebo for change from baseline in MAD RS total score at W eek6 after 
multiplicity  adjustment.
A sensitivity  analy sis using a pattern- mixture model based on non–future -dependent missing 
value restrictions ( Kenward et al, 2003 ) will be performed to assess the rob ustness of the 
primary  MMRM results to the possible violation of the missing -at-random assumption. The 
details of this sensitivity  anal yses are as follows:
The pattern for the pattern -mixture model will be defined b y the patient ’s last visit with an 
observ ed value. The observed MADRS total score at a visit is assumed to have a linear 
relationship with the patient ’s prior measurements. The missing values will be imputed under 
the assumption that the distribution of a missing observation dif fers from the obse rved onl y 
by a shift parameter value Δ. The dataset with missing values imputed will be anal yzed using 
an anal ysis-of-covariance (ANCOV A) model with treatment group , country , and ADT failure 
category , as factors and baseline MADRS total score as a covariat e for between –treatment -
group comparison at Week 6. The imputation of missing values and the analysis will be 
performed multiple times ,and the inference of this sensitivity  anal ysis will be based on the 
combined estimates using the standard multiple imput ation technique. The values for Δ will 
be selected as 0 to 6, inclusively . This range is selected because the mean reduction of 
MADRS score from baseline within a treatment group at Week 6 is likely  to be within 
15 points ( Bauer et al, 2009; El-Khalili et al, 2010 ), and a Δ value of 6 accounts for 40% of 
treatment ef ficacy .
The second sensitivity  analy sis will consider dropout reasons while imputing missing values 
after the discontinuation. Patients who discontinued due to lack of ef ficacy  in the cariprazine 
arms are assumed to have no treatment ef fect after the discontinuation. These patients are 
assumed to cop y the profile of placebo arm and missing values are imputed based on the 
distribution estimated from the placebo group under the MAR using cop y-reference approach 
(Carpenter et al, 2013 ). The rest of missing values in the placebo arm and cariprazine arms 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
50will be imputed using the observed data in their respective gro up under the MAR 
assumption.
Mean treatment difference (raw mean difference ± standard error) in change in primary 
endpoint between each cariprazine dose and placebo with missing values imputed using the 
LOCF approach will be plotted against country . In ad dition, summary  statistics will be 
provided b y center to examine the consistency of treatment ef fect across the study  centers. 
The impact of dropouts on the ef ficacy  outcomes will be explored graphically  by plotting the 
time courses of mean changes b y dro pout reason.
Results of analy ses from MMRM and from ANCOV A models will also be reported for each 
visit between baseline and Week 6. 
To compare with historic studies, the LOC F approach will be used with an ANCOV A model 
that has treatment group , country  and ADT failure category as factors and the baseline value 
as the covariate.
7.3.2 Other Efficacy Analyses
Additional quantitative ef ficacy  parameters will be anal yzed in the following way :
Analy sis of CGI -I score, change from baseline in HAMD -17 total score, change from 
baseline in HAM -A total score, and change from baseline in CGI -S will be performed using a 
similar MMRM to that used for the primary  anal ysis. Baseline CGI -S score will be used as a 
covariate for the anal ysis of change in CGI -I score. I n additi on, these parameters will be 
analyzed using ANCOV A (with LOCF imputation) as used for the analy sis of primary  
efficac y parameters.
Additional categorical efficacy parameters will be anal yzed in the following way :
Rates for categorical parameters (response and remission) will be reported by treatment 
group and b y visit; a logistic regression model (with L OCF imputation) will be used to model 
the probability  of a response or the probability  of a remission as a function of a treatment 
group and the correspondi ng baseline score (CGI- S for the anal ysis of the CGI -I response) as 
explanatory  variables.

The safet y analysis will be performed using the safety  population. The safety  parameters will 
include AEs, clinical laboratory  parameters, vital sign s, ECG parameters, EPS scales, the 
C-SSRS and the YMRS . For each safet y parameter , the last assessment made before the first 
dose of DBIPwill be used as the baseline for all anal yses of that safet y parameter .The 
summarization will be by  treatment group for both double -blind and safet y follow -up 
periods.

treatment group will be tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term; by s ystem organ 
class, preferred term, and severit y; and by  system organ class, preferred term, and 
relationship to the IP. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same 
patient, the patient will be counted onl y once for that preferred term using the most severe 
and most related occurrence for the summarization by severit y and b yrelationship to the IP.
The distribution of TEAEs by  severit y and relationship to the IPwill be summarized by  
treatment group.

7.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Plasma s amples will be analy zed for the concentrations of cariprazine and its metabolites 
DCAR and DDCAR using a validated bioanaly tical method. A population PK approach will 
be used to estimate individual -level drug -exposure parameters ( eg,steady -state area -unde r-
the-curve [AUC ], steady -state maximum concentration [C max], steady -state minimum 
concentration [C min])for each of the 3 analytes. This will be performed via the use of 
appropriate nonlinear mixed- effects modeling software. The relationship, if any , betw een 
effectiveness and drug -exposure parameters will be explored. These anal yses will be reported 
separately . 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
567.4.2 Health Outcome Measure Analyse s
The SF -12 will be administered at Visit 2 and Visit 6/ET . 
Analy sis of change from baseline in the PCS -12 and MCS- 12 score at W eek 6 will be 
conducted using the ANCOV A model that has treatment group and study  center as factors 
and the baseline value as the covariate.
7.5 Subgr oup Analyses
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the 
estimate of the between -group treatment ef fect (with a 95% CI ) for each cariprazine dose 
versus placebo for the primary  efficacy  variable will be estimated within each category  of the 
following classification variables:
ADT failure category ( one ADT  failure, more than one ADT  failure)
Region (US, NonUS)
7.6 Interim Analyses
No interim anal ysis is planned for this study .
7.7 Sample Size Calculation
The study  will ra ndomize approximately  750 patients i n a 1:1:1 ratio to cariprazine 
1.5mg/d ay, cariprazine 3 mg/d ay, and placebo groups. A sample size of 250 patien ts per arm 
will provide approximately  84% statistical power to show statistically  significantly higher 
effect in each dose of cariprazine versus placebo based on the mITTanalysis set. The study  
has approximately  90% statistical power to show that at least 1of the 2 cariprazine doses is 
statistically  significantly  more efficacious than placebo in the primary  endpoint. These 
calculations assumed an ef fect size of 0.286. All statistical pow ers presented in this section 
were calculated adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Hochberg procedure with the 
family -wise t ype I error rate being controlled at a 0.05 level (2- sided). The dropout rate is 
assumed to be 15% at W eek 6. W ithin-person correlation for the primary  endpoint is assumed 
to be 0.58. This value is used in the sample size calculation to calculate an inflation factor 
thataccounts for information loss due to t he missing data at W eek 6 for longitudinal data 
collection.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
57Assumptions of ef fect size, intracorrelation and dropout rate are based on cariprazine 
Study RGH -MD-75.
8Study Visit Schedule and Procedur es
Pleas e see Tab le 1 for a schematic of the sc hedule of visits and pr ocedur es, and Section 6for 
details of tests and rating scales.
8.1 Patient Entry Procedures
8.1.1 Overview of Entry Procedures
Prospective patient s as defined b y the criteria in Section s4.3and4.4(inclusion/exclusion 
criteria) will be considered for entry  into this study .
8.1.2 Informed Consent and Patien t Privacy
The study  will be discussed with the patient and a patien t wishing to participate must give 
informed consent prior to any  study -related proc edures or change in treatment. The patien t 
must also g ive a uthorization (United States only), data protection consent (Europe onl y), and 
other written documentation in accordance with the relevant country  and local privacy  
requirements (where applicable) prior to an y study -related pro cedures or change in treatment.
Each patient that provides informed consent will be assigned a patient numb er that will be 
used on patien t docum entation throughout the study .
Where applicable, a central vendor will be used to verify  patients’ current and past research
study  status in order to mitiga te safet y concerns associated with duplicate enrollment and
protocol deviations associated with multiple trial enrollment. Following proper informed
consent and after issuing a patient number , each patient will be reviewed in the Verified
Clinical Trials ( VCT) database, indicated in the s chedule of visits and procedures ( Tab le 1).
Partial identifiers will be utilized. Patients who are identified as verification failure s by VCT
should not continue participation without documented approval from the Sponsor.
8.2 Washout Interval
Patients with MDD with inadequate response to ongoing ADT in th e current episode will 
undergo a washout of prohibited medications for up to 14 days during the screening period, 
with up to an additional 7 day s if needed with Sponsor approval (see Section 4.5.2 ). During 
the washout ,the patients will continue to take the ADT that they are not responding to.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
58The length and timing of the washout of prior ps ychiatric medications during the 14 day s 
allotted for the screening period is at the discretion of the investigator (with up to an 
additional 7 d ays if needed with Sponsor approval ). Prior medications should be graduall y 
withdrawn such that the washout is completed b y Baseline ( Visit 2).Please note that during 
the washout period ps ycho tropic medications other than those listed as rescue (Section 4.5.3 ) 
may not be newl y initiated or reinitiated.
8.3 Procedures for Final Study Entry
Final study  eligibility , for patients meeting SAFER criteria, will be determined at Visit 2 
(Baseline Visit). Patients should continue to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria as 
specified in Sections 4.3and 4.4.
A patient is considered to have entered the study  at the time of randomization to treatment at 
Visit2 (Baseline).
Rescreening of screen failures is permitted in certain situations after consultation with the 
Allergan Medical Monitor .
See Section 5.4for the met hod for assignment to treatment groups/ randomization.

8.9 Withdrawal Criteria
It is the right and the duty of the Investigator or subinvestigator to stop treatment in any  case 
in which emerging ef fects are of unacceptable risk to the indivi dual patient. I n addition, the 
Investigator or subinvestigator is to stop treatment of any  patient with unmanageable factors 
that may  interfere significantly  with the trial procedures and/or the interpretation of results. 
A patient must be discontinued from the study  for any  of the following reasons:
1.The patient misses ≥ 4 consecutive doses of IPand/or ongoing ADT
2.The patient required or initiated hospitalization for his/her psy chiatric s ymptoms
3.The p atient decompensates psy chiatricall y (becomes acutel y suicidal, homicidal or

8.10 Study Termination
The study  may  be stopped at astudy  site at any  time by  the site investigator .The S ponsor
may stop the study  (and/or th e study  site) for an y reason with appropriate notification.
9Adverse Events
AEsoccurring during the study  will be recorded on an AEeCRF .If AEs occur , the first 
concern will be the safety of the stud y patients.
9.1 Definitions
9.1.1 Adverse Event
An AEis an y untow ard medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AEcan therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. I n addition, during the screening period, AEs will be asses sed 
regardless of the administration of a pharmaceutical product.
Note: AEs must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless of whether 
or not the patient has been administered I P.
Progression of treatment indication, including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs 
or sy mptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy  variables and assessed as unequivocall y 
associated with the disease progression and/or lack of efficacy , should NOT  be reported as 
AEs unless the disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the 
disease .
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
66AEs will be assessed, documented, and recorded in the eCRF throughout the study  (ie, after 
informed consent has been obtained). At each visit, the investigator will begin by  querying 
for AEs b y asking each patient a general, non- directed question such as “ How have you been 
feeling since the last visit? ” Directed questioning and examination will then be done as 
appropriate. All reported AEs will be documented on the appropriate eCRF .
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
AnSAE is any  AEoccurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following outcomes: death, 
is life-threatening, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a 
persistent or significant disability /incapa city, or a congenital anomal y/birth defect. Important 
medical events that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered a nSAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may  
jeopardize the patient and m ay require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition ( see Section 9.3for procedures for reporting SAEs ).
Allergan considers all cancer AEs as SAEs . In addition, Allergan considers any abortion 
(spontaneous or nonspontaneous) as a nSAE .
Preplanned surgeries or procedures for pre -existing, known medical conditions for which a 
patient requires hospitalization is not repo rtable as an SAE .
Any preplanned surgery  or procedure should be clearl y documented in the site source 
documents by  the Investigator or designee at the time of the patient ’s entry  into the study . If 
it has not been documented at the time of the patient’ s screening visit (Visit 1) , then it should 
be documented as a n SAE and reported to Allergan.
9.1.3 Severity
A clinical determination will be made of the inte nsity  of an AE. The intensity  assessment for 
an AEmust be completed using the following definitions as guidelines:
Mild A type of AEthat is usually  transient and may  require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activities of daily  living
Moder ate A type of AEthat is usually  alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of 
daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent 
risk of harm to the research patient .
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
67Severe A type of AEthat interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or 
significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention.
9.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug
A determination will be made of the relationship (if an y) between an AEand the study  drug 
or study  procedure, as applicable. A causal relationship is present if a determination is made 
that there is a reasonable possibility  that the AEmay have been caused by  the drug or study  
procedure.
9.2 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events
Any AEmust be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .
All AEs that are drug -related and unexpected (not listed as treatment- related in the current 
Investigator ’s Brochure) must be reported to the governing IRB/IECas required by  the 
IRB/IEC, local regulations, and the governing health authorities.
Any AEthat is marked ‘ongoing ’ at the last visit must be followed -up as appropriate.
9.3 Procedures for Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
Any SAE occurring during the study period (beginning with informed consent) and for at 
least 30 days after the last dose of DB IPmust be immediately  reported but no later than 
24hours after learning of a nSAE . SAEs must be reported to Allergan (or agent of Allergan) 
as listed on the Allergan Study  Contacts List and recorded on the SAE/AESI Form. All 
patient s with a n SAE must be followed and the outcomes reported. The I nvestigator must 
supply  the S ponsor and the I RB/IEC with any  additional requested information (eg, autopsy  
reports ,discharge summaries ).
In the event of a n SAE, the Investigator must:
1.Notify  Allergan immediately  using the SAE/AESI F orm (contact details can be found 
on page 1 of the SAE/AESI  Form); phone numbers and relevant Allergan personnel 
contacts are also on the front page of the protocol and study  contacts list
2. Obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow- up of 
the patient
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
683.Provide Allergan with a complete, written description of the AE(s) on the SAE/AESI  
Form describing the event chronologically , including an y treatment given 
(eg,medications administered, procedures performe d) for the AE(s). Summarize 
relevant clinical information about the event: signs, symptoms, diagnosis, clinical 
course and relevant clinical laboratory  tests, etc. Include an y additional or alternative 
explanation(s) for the causality  which includes a stat ement as to whether the event 
was or was not related to the use of the investigational drug
4.Promptly  inform the governing IRB/IEC of the SAE as required b y the IRB/IEC, 
local regulations, and the governing health authorities
9.4 Reporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study
Study  site personnel must report every  pregnancy  from the time the patient signs the ICF 
until 12weeks after the last dose of IP .Serum pregnancy  tests are scheduled at screening and 
at Visit 6 /ET and V isit 7 (EOS). If a pregnancy  is suspected at an y other time, an unscheduled 
serum pregnancy test should be performed. If any  β-hCG test comes back as borderline, it 
should be repeated and consultation with the Allergan Medical Monitor is required. Within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy , the study  site personnel must report the event to 
Allergan ’s Global Patient Safety  department on the clinical trial pregnancy  form and 
fax/email it to the SAE fax number /email address on the cover page of this protocol , even if 
no AE has occurred. Pregnancies in female partners of male patients occurring during the 
time frame described above must also be reported.
The pregnancy  must be followed to term and the outcome reported by  completing a 
follow -up clinical trial pregnancy form. If the pregnancy  is associated with an SAE (eg, if the 
mother is hospitalized for hemorrhage), a separate SAE/AESI  Form for clinical trials must be 
reported with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, hospitalization) indicated in add ition to 
the pregnancy  form.
9.5 Potential Hy ’s Law Cases
Criteria for potential Hy ’s law cases are as follows: 
ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN AND 
Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN AND 
Alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
69Study  site personnel must report every  patient who meets these criteria. T ypically , all 
3analytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they  may  come from multiple samples 
taken within a 24 -hour period. This requirement applies from the time the patient signs the 
ICF for the stud y until 30 day s after last known dose of study  treatment. 
A laboratory  alert for potential Hy ’slaws cases will be in place, and the laboratory  must 
notify  Investigators and the Sponsor (Allergan) immediately  when the above criteria have 
been met. A potential Hy ’s law case must be reported to Allergan on an SAE/AESI  Form as 
soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy ’s law case) to the 
SAE/Pregnancy  fax number, even if no AE has occurred. The eCRF for potential Hy ’s law 
cases must be completed within 7 calendar d ays. Every  effort to determine the cause of the 
liver enzy me abnormalities must be made, and close monitoring should be initiated in 
conjunction with the Allergan Medical Monitor and in accordance with the FDA  Guidance 
for Industry , Drug -Induced L iver Inju ry: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009. The 
patient should return to the study  site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y wit hin 
48 hours from the time the I nvestigator becomes aware of the abnormal results. This 
evaluation should inclu de laboratory  tests, detailed history , and phy sical assessment.
9.6 Procedures for Unmasking of Study Medication
When necessary  for the safet y and proper treatment of the patien t, the I nvestigator can 
unmask the patient ’s treatment assignment to determine which treatment has been assigned 
and institute appropriate follow -up care. When possible, the Sponsor (Allergan Medical 
Safety  Physician ) should be notified prior to unmasking study  medication. The I nvestigator 
should inform the S ponsor (Allergan Medical Safety  Physician) of the unmasking if there is 
no notifi cation prior to the unmasking.
The treatment assignment for the patient can be determined by designated site per sonnel 
calling into the IWRS system via password protected access. The reason for breaking the 
code must be recorded in the patient’ s source documents.

medication is to be used in accordance with the protocol .
10.5.3 Return or Disposal of Study Me dications/T reatments
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility  to ensure that patients return all unused IP, and all empty  
blister packs, to the site. AllIP will be returned to Allergan or Allergan designee for 
destruction. All unused IP  must be returned to Allergan during the course of the study when a 
patient discontinues from the study , upon drug expiration, and at the end of the study . 
10.6 Monitoring by the Sponsor
A representative of the S ponsor will monitor the study  on a periodic basis. The determination 
of the extent and nature of monitoring will be based on considerations such as the objective, 
purpose, design, complexity , blinding, siz e, and endpoints of the study .
Authorized representatives of Allergan or regulatory authority  representatives will conduct 
on-site visits to review , audit ,andcopy  study -related documents. These repr esentatives will 
meet with the I nvestigator(s) and appropriate staf f at mutually  convenient times to discuss 
study -related data and questions.
10.7 Hand ling of Biological Specimens
Samples of blood and urine for eva luation of hematology , chemistr yand urinaly sis, will be 
analyzed at a centralized clinical laboratory  with certification from a recognized accreditation 
agency  (eg, College of American Patholo gy or Clinical Laboratory  Improvement 
Amendments certification). 
Blood samples obtained for analysis of cariprazine and its metabolites DCAR and DDCAR 
will be stored by  the central clinical laboratory  until ready  for anal ysis. Analy sis will be 
performed using a validated method and a laboratory  that meets Good Laboratory  Practice 
requirements. Allergan shall have full ownership rights to any biological specimens/samples 
derived from the stud y.
Patients consenting to participate in pharmacogenetic sampling will have a single blood 
sample collected to determine individual genot ype status and for pharmacogenetic 
biobanking. The genetic material from the blood sample will be used to study factors that 
may influence how patients respond to a drug or may  explain the pathophy siology  of the 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
75disease. These blood samples will be stored to provide a resource for potential future trials 
conducted b y Allergan.
All pharmacogenetic samples collected will be sen t to the designated central laboratory  and 
later shipped to a biorepository  for storage.

8012.2 Protocol Modifications for COVID -19
As a result of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic , the following
protocol modifications can be followed for active patients in Study  3111-302-001, who have 
completed all assessments through V isit 2 (i nclusive) per Tab le 1, Schedule of Visits and 
Procedures and have been randomized via the Interactive W eb Response S ystem (I WRS). 
The instructions and procedures speci fied herein will supersede those specified in the 
Schedule of V isits and Procedures onl y in local, regional or national circumstances that limit 
the conduct of the Global Protocol as a direct result of the COVID -19 pandemic (including 
any potential re -emer gence of this coronavirus). Please refer to Tab le 1 of the Global 
Protocol (or Country -Specific protocol, if applicable) for the visit assessments and 
procedures requi red at Visit 1 and Visit 2, including the full inclusion and exclusion criteria 
to be evaluated prior to randomization. The following procedures appl y in cases where 
patients are either unable or unwilling to attend study  visits as a result of the pandemic.
12.2.1 Planned changes in resear ch
In response to the impact of COVID -19 to study  patients and site staff, the following
modifi cations to the study  planare allowable for sites and patients facing extenuating 
circumstances:
Allowing wider visit windows when necessary  
Replacing protocol mandated in- person stud y visits with one or more of the 
following:
ohome visits
otelemedicine virtual visits (preferred method if/when home visits are not 
feasible)
otelephone/video calls (no rec ording will be performed)
Allowing blood draws at alternative or commercial laboratories (where available)
Study  sites shipping investigational products (I P) to research patients (where 
permissible by  local/statutory  or country  law) and where approved b y Sponsor
Extending the window for consecutive missed doses of IP specificall y resulting from 
COVID -19-related circumstances from 4 or more day s to more than 7 day s, prior to 
requiring withdrawal of the patient from the stud y (seeSection 12.2.6 .)
12.2.2 Remote Assessment of Efficacy
Efficacy  assessments must alway s be conducted by  a rater that has been certified by  Signant 
Health to rate that assessment for thi s study . Every  effort should be made to have patients 
assessed b y the same rater at each scheduled timepoint. For efficacy assessments that are 
conducted remotely  (eg, by  telephone, telemedicine virtual visit, video call) or in- home b y 
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
81qualified site staf f, the following assessments are required to be completed in the course of 
the remote visit.  Note: The source documents and eCRF should clearl y denote which 
assessments have been completed remotely.
Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
Hamilto n Anxiety  Rating Scale (HAM- A)
Clinical Global I mpression -Severit y scale (CGI -S)
Clinical Global I mpression -Improvement scale (CGI -I)
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale –17 Items (HAMD -17)
12.2.3 Remote Assessment of Health Outcome measures
In the event that V isit 6 /Early  Termination (ET) is being conducted remotely  (eg, by  
telephone, telemedicine virtual visit, video call), study  staff should verbally administer the 
Short -Form 12 (SF -12) to the patient and record the patient’ s responses in the source.  The 
source do cument should capture the name of study  personnel administering the SF -12, the 
date and time of administration, as well as clearl y document that the responses were obtained 
verball y due to COVID -19. For in- home visits, study  staff should have patient compl ete the 
SF-12 per protocol .
12.2.4 Remote Assessment of Safety
For safet y assessments that are conducted remotely (eg, b y telephone, telemedicine virtual 
visit, video call), the following assessments are required to be completed in the course of the 
remote visit.  Note: The source documents and eCRF (as applicable) should clearl y denote 
which assessments have been completed remotely .
Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Event Assessment 
Concomitant medication assessment
Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) -Must be conducted by a certified 
rater.  Every  effort s hould be made to have patients assessed b y the same rater at each 
scheduled timepoint.  In the event the rater certified for this study  is unavailable, a 
rater certified on the C -SSRS for another Allergan trial may conduct the assessment.
Young Mania Ratin g Scale (YMRS)
Movement scales (BARS/AI MS/SAS) –Must be conducted by  a certified rater .  
Telemedicine virtual visits (where available) or video calls (without recording) are the 
preferred method of remote assessment.  If a scale item cannot be assessed, t he item 
may be skipped and the source should indicate the item could not be assessed. Every  
effort should be made to have patients assessed b y the same rater at each scheduled 
timepoint.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
8212.2.4.1 In-Home Study Visits
Where possible via in -home visits by  study  perso nnel or contracted vendor (where 
applicable), the following safet y assessments should also be completed, in addition to the 
safet y assessments above.  Note: For an y clinical laboratory determinations, specimen 
collection, handling and processing must be ca rried out in accordance with the central 
laboratory  manual.  Due to considerations of the processing time required, pharmacokinetic 
(PK) samples should not be collected during in -home visits.  I f processing cannot be 
completed within the time specified in the central laboratory  manual for any  other samples, 
collection of those samples should be omitted.
Collection of samples for clinical laboratory  assessments (in accordance with Table 3-
Schedule of Clinical Laboratory  Tests of the Global Protocol (Amendme nt #3) or 
Country -Specific Protocol, if applicable.)  
Serum pregnancy  testing 
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Vital signs (with or without weight)
Physical examination
12.2.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments
All attempts should be made to complete clinical laboratory  assessments, including 
pregnancy  testing, in accordance with Table 3- Schedule of Clinical Laboratory  Tests of the 
Global Protocol (Amendment #3) or Country -Specific Protocol, if applicable.  As an 
alternative to patients having laboratory  assessments on -site, or conducted via an in -home 
visit by  study  personnel, laboratory  assessments may  also be conducted at an alternate 
laboratory  facility , if necessary  (eg, general practitioner ’s office, commercial laboratory  etc.).  
In this case, the data is intended to facilitate the safety  oversight of the patient and will be 
filed in the source document only  and not recorded in the eCRF . If a patient is unable or 
unwilling to travel to an alternate laboratory  facility , the laboratory  assessment at the 
scheduled timepoi nt may be omitted.  For women of childbearing potential, study  sites may  
provide urine pregnancy  test kits for at -home testing.  Study personnel should document the 
patient ’s verbal confirmation of pregnancy  test results in the source document.  Results of at-
home urine pregnancy  tests will not be recorded in the eCRF .  Every  attempt should be made 
to have patient complete as an Unscheduled assessment during the Safet y Follow -up (SFU) 
period.  Clinical findings upon termination must be followed until the co ndition returns to 
prestudy  status or can be explained as unrelated to investigational product. If necessary , an 
additional follow -up visit should be scheduled.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
8312.2.4.3 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
If visit is being performed remotely , this assessment may  be omitted at the protocol -specified 
timepoint. Every  attempt should be made to have patient complete as an Unscheduled 
assessment during the Safety  Follow -up (SFU) period.  Clinical findings upon termination 
must be followed until the condition returns to prestudy  status or can be explained as 
unrelated to investigational product. If necessary , an additional follow -up visit should be 
scheduled. 
12.2.4.4 Physical Examination
If visit is being performed remotely , this assessment may  be omitted at the protocol -specified 
timepoint.  Every  attempt should be made to have patient complete as an Unscheduled 
assessment during the SFU period.  Clinical findings upon termination must be followed until 
the condition returns to prestudy  status or can be explained as unrelated to in vestigational 
product. If necessary , an additional follow -up visit should be scheduled.
12.2.4.5 Vital Signs
If visit is being performed remotely , this assessment may  be omitted at the protocol -specified 
timepoint. Vital signs should be obtained at the next schedul ed in- home or in- person visit.
12.2.5 Visit 6/ET -End of Double -Blind and Early Termination Visit
Every  attempt should be made to complete the V isit 6/ET  efficacy , safet y and health outcome 
assessments on the same date.  In the event that a remote visit for V isit6/ET  is not possible at 
the scheduled timepoint, all V isit 6/ET  efficacy  assessments should be completed within 2 
weeks of the last dose of IP .  If Visit 6/ET  is completed as a remote visit without the 
assessment of clinical laboratory  parameters (includi ng pregnancy  testing, if applicable), 
physical examination and/or ECG, the patient should be brought back for safety  assessments 
during the SFU period. Patients who have missed the safet y assessments scheduled for V isit 
6/ET  and are unable to return for th ese assessments during the SFU period should be 
encouraged to return to the site for a final assessment of safet y when possible. All attempts 
should be made to make a final assessment of safety  even if it falls bey ond the end of the 
Safety  Follow -up period. If Visit 6/ET  procedures are being completed more than 2 weeks 
after the last dose of IP , efficacy  assessments should be omitted.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
8412.2.6 Treatment compliance
Investigational Product compliance is to be assessed at every  visit during the Double -Blind 
Treatment period.  Wherever possible, IP  compliance will be closel y monitored b y counting 
the number of capsules dispensed and returned, and through patient interview . For remote 
visits where a pill count by site staff may  not be possible, patient reported complianc e is to be 
documented.  If a remote visit is occurring through a video/telemedicine virtual call, study 
staff should make every  effort to visuall y verify  number of capsules remaining in the blister 
card.  Otherwise, patient reported verification of IP  caps ules remaining should be 
documented in the source.  
To minimize undue burden on the patient, IP  return may  be less frequent during the time that 
visits are being conducted remotely but should occur no less frequentl y than monthly .  
Background ADT medicat ion compliance is also to be assessed at every  visit. Patients should 
be questioned to determine if there were an y missed doses or changes in dose between visits. 
Every ef fort should be made to have patients bring their background ADT  to in -person study  
visits for verification of patient- reported compliance by  pill/capsule count (to the extent 
possible) and patient interviews. For remote visits where a pill count by  site staf f may  not be 
possible, patient reported compliance is to be documented. 
Patients w ho take less IP  or ADT  or more IP or ADT  than the prescribed regimen must be
counseled on the importance of taking study medications as instructed. If a patient 
demonstrates poor compliance during the stud y (< 80% or > 120% overall), the investigator 
should evaluate whether the patient should be discontinued from the study .  It is recognized 
that patients may  miss doses of investigational product or his/her ADT  due to circumstances 
related to COVID -19 (eg, unanticipated study  window extension, delay  in receipt of IP  
shipment from site to patient).  There will be an allowance of up to 7 consecutive missed 
doses before requiring that a patient be discontinued from the study . The PI must ensure that 
the reason for missed doses is adequatel y assessed and determined to be related to logistical 
challenges related to COVID -19 and not that the reason is related to a causally -related 
adverse event, general non-adherence with the protocol, etc.  Given the aforementioned 
concession, patients missing 4 or more doses should not be automatically  withdrawn from the 
study  treatment and the study  as a result of the pandemic .
The study  centers will continue to keep an accurate drug disposition record that specifies the 
amount of I P dispensed to each patient and the date of dispensing.
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
86*Note: If necessary , Visits 3 to 7 may be conducted up to 3 days before or after the scheduled visits. The visit windows for each scheduled visit are relative to 
Visit 2 for V isits 3 through 7.  In extenuating circumstances, the visit window for Visits 3 t o 7 (inclusive) m ay be extended an additional 4 days (ie, +7 
days) from  the scheduled visit.  All attem pts should be made to conduct the visit within the pre -defined ± 3 day window as well as to avoid a 
potential lapse in IP  during the extension of a visit window .

aClinical laboratory assessments, including serum pregnancy testing (WOCBP  only) may be perfo rmed at an off -site laboratory facility if needed.  If patient is 
unable or unwilling to travel to an alternate laboratory facility , the laboratory assessment at the scheduled timepoint may b e omitted.  For WOCBP , study sites 
may provide urine pregnancy te st kits for at -home testing.  Study personnel should document the patient ’s verbal confirmation of pregnancy test results in the 
source document.  Patient should have clinical laboratory testing performed as an Unscheduled assessment during the Safety Fo llow-up period. Clinical 
findings upon termination must be followed until the condition returns to prestudy status or can be explained as unrelated to investigational product. If 
necessary , an additional follow -up visit should be scheduled.
bIf visit is bei ng performed remotely , this assessment may be omitted. Vital signs should be obtained at the next scheduled in -home or in -person visit. 
cIf visit is being performed remotely , this assessment may be omitted at this timepoint. Patient should have this assessment p erformed as an Unscheduled 
assessment during the Safety Follow -up period. Clinical findings upon termination must be follow ed until the condition returns to prestudy status or can be 
explained as unrelated to investigational product. If necessary , an additional follow -up visit should be scheduled. 
dIf visit is being performed remotely , study staff should verbally administer the Shor t-Form  12 (SF -12) to the patient and record the patient ’s responses in the 
source.  
eMovement scales may be conducted remotely if needed.  Where possible, telemedicine virtual visits or video calls (without rec ording) should be used to 
conduct this asses sment remotely .  If a scale item cannot be assessed, the item may be skipped and the source should indicate the item could no t be assessed. 
Movement scales may only be conducted by raters certified on the scale. 
fC-SSRS may be assessed remotely if needed by a certified rater . Clinicians with a valid C -SSRS certification for another Allergan study may rate C -SSRS in 
the event the study -certified rater is unavailable to complete the assessment. 
gAs an alternative to in -person drug dispensing, IP  may be di spensed via a secure delivery method (w here permissible by local, statutory, federal/country law) 
and after approval by Sponsor .
hAssessment of compliance should be performed at each visit.  For remote visits where a pill count by site staff may not be po ssible, patient reported 
compliance is to be documented.  Patient reported verification of IP  capsules remaining should be documented.
iTo minimize undue burden on the patient, IP  return may be less frequent during the time that visits are being conducted remotely but should occur no less 
frequently than monthly .
jIf visit is being performed remotely or at an alternate laboratory facility , this assessment may be omitted.  In consideratio n of the processing time required, 
pharmacokinetic samples should not be collected during in -home visits.
kPharm acogenetic consent may be obtained at any time between V isit 1(Screening) and V isit 6 (W eek 6).  Pharmacogenetic consent may not be obtained 
remotely .
Allergan Confidential Protocol 31 11-302-001 Amendment 3
87lPharm acogenetic sample (1 per patient for the entire study) may be obtained from randomized patients at any time between V isit 2 (Baseline) and V isit 6 
(Week 6). T o be omitted if sampling is not possible due to remote visits being completed.

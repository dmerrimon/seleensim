PRÉCIS  
 
Background:  
• Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively rare heterogeneous group of tumors that 
constitute about 1% of adult cancers. 
• The mainstay of treatment for advanced disease has been palliative chemotherapy  with a 
median overall survival of approximately 12 months.  This h as not changed considerably 
in the past years and there is an unmet need for newer targeted therapies. 
• VEGF levels  are elevated in patients with  STS and various sarcoma cell lines express 
high levels of activated c- Met receptor . 
• We hypothesize that dual ta rgeting of the VEGF  and c- MET pathway s with cabozantinib 
would result in clinical benefit in patients with soft tissue sarcoma .  
Objectives:   
Primary:  
• Assess the response rate (CR+PR) of cabozantinib  in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.  
• Assess the 6 month progression free survival (PFS) of cabozantinib in soft tissue 
sarcomas. 
Secondary:  
• Determine and compare circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF -A, and 
soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior t o and following administration of cabozantinib. 
Eligibility:  
• Patients must have had disease progression following one line of standard therapy  
• Age ≥ 18 years . 
• Adequate organ function. 
• Patients will be stratified based on prior VEGFR TKI therapy.  
Design:  
• All patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg PO daily in 4 week cycles. 
• Tumor response evaluations by imaging will be done every 2 cycles ( less frequently for 
patients on study more than one year). 
• The study will be conducted as a dual -endpoint two- stage Phase II trial to target objective 
tumor response rate (CR+PR) of 30% against an unacceptably low rate of 10%, and  6-month PFS rate of 65 % against an unacceptably low rate of 45% (corresponding to 
media n PFS of 9.6 vs. 5.2  months). 
• The trial will accrue up  to 50 evaluable patients .

 1 OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
• Assess the response rate (CR+PR) of cabozantinib  in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.  
• Assess the 6 month progression free survival (PFS) of cabozantinib in soft tissue 
sarcomas.  
1.2 Secondary O bjectives  
• Determine and compare circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF -A, 
and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of cabozantinib. 
 
 
2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)  
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively rare heterogeneous group of tumors that arise mainly 
from embryonic mesoderm.   They constitute about 1% of adult cancers with 10,000 new cases 
diagnosed every year in the US with an overall mortality rate of 3,920 cases per year including adults and children.
1  More than 50 different histological types have been identified the most 
common of which are pleiomorphic sarcoma also known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), GIST, liposarcoma, leiomyo sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve 
sheath tumors .
2  Diagnosis at an early stage is crucial since complete surgical rese ction yields the 
best prognosis.  However, the lack of a screening modality makes it difficult with more than 50% of patients developing metastasis during their course of disease decreasing their 5 yr survival to below 10%.The mainstay of treatment for the advanced disease patients has been palliative chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy backbone of an anthracycline with or without ifosfamide has been used for decades and yielded response rates of 20 -30% and a median overall survival of 
approximately 12 months.
3-10  Anthracycline resistant STS and certain subtypes like 
leiomyosarcoma appear to have better responses to the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel which is the only regimen in STS which has demonstrated an overall survival advantage in the phase III randomized setting .
11-13  With the median survival of these patients 
having changed very little over the past decade there is an unmet need for newer targeted therapies.  
 
One of the targets that have  emerged in this setting is the tumor produced angiogenic factor 
vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  It has been shown that VEGF levels are elevated in 
patients with STS and correlates with th e grade of the tumor.
14-17  Factors other than VEGF, such 
as platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF), are also likely to be involved in STS angiogenesis.18  
Bevacizumab a monoclonal antibody against VEGF has been studied in combination with chemother apy regimens including gemcitabine, docetaxel
19 and temozolomide20 with promising 
results.  Pazopanib, an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that targets VEGF receptors (VEGFRs),  PDGF  
receptors (PDGFRs), and c-kit has also been studied in STS in phase II21 and III settings22 to 
show improvement in PFS by 13 weeks compared to placebo.

 Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) activates the c- Met receptor tyrosine kinase 
and promotes cell proliferation,  survival, and invasion and also plays a role in angiogenesis.23,24  
Various sarcoma cell lines express high levels of activated c -Met receptor and suggesting that 
HGF/SF signaling pathway may contribute to sarcomagenesis.25  Interruption of a utocrine or 
paracrine HGF/SF c -met signaling with the monoclonal antibody AMG102 in leiomyosarcoma 
cell line SK -LMS-1 and in mouse xenograft models has shown significant antitumor effect.26 It 
has also been shown that clear cell sarcoma cells are dependent on HGF/C- Met axis27 for 
invasion, chemotaxis, and survival. 
2.2 Cabozantinib (XL184) 
Cabozantinib is a new chemical entity that inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases MET (hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] receptor) and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2).   Both MET and VEGFR2 are important mediators of tumor growth and tumor 
angiogenesis, and MET is particularly associated with tumor invasiveness and metastasis.  In vivo pharmacodynamic activity of cabozantinib against MET and VEGFR2 has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies and has been associated with  tumor growth 
inhibition and tumor regression.  In preclinical studies, cabozantinib treatment has also been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness and metastasis, and the progression of tumors in bone.  Cabozantinib inhibits multiple RTKs  implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, 
and angiogenesis (Investigator's Brochure, 2011) .  The primary targets of cabozantinib are MET 
and VEGFR2; additional targets include RET, AXL, KIT, and TIE-2. 
 
Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of MET and VEGFR2 with half -maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values of 1.3 nmol/L and 0.035 nmol/L, respectively.
28  Cabozantinib 
strongly inhibited several kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including KIT, RET, AXL, TIE2, and FLT3 (IC50 = 4.6, 5.2, 7, 14.3, and 11.3 nmol/L, respectively).  Cabozantinib did not potently inhibit kinases such as RON, EGFR, IGFR1, and EphA4/B4.  In cellular assays, it inhibited phosphorylation of MET and VEGFR2, as well as 
KIT, FLT3, and AXL with IC50s of 7.8, 1.9, 5.0, 7.5, and 42 μmol/L, respectively.
28  
 Nonclinical Development of XL184  
In Vivo Activity  
In RIP -Tag2 transgenic mice (model of pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma), tumors 
treated with XL184 were smaller (P <0.05) than in mice treated with vehicle or an anti-
VEGF antibody, but were also less invasive ( P <0.05) and had no liver metastases .29  All 
mice treated with XL184 (n = 6) survived until 20 weeks, but none treated with vehicle  (n = 14) or anti-VEGF antibody (n= 8) reached that endpoint.  Tumor vascularity decreased after treatment, with reductions ranging from 67% at 3 mg /kg to 83% at 30 
mg/kg for 7 days (You et al. , 2011).  Tumors were 35% smaller after XL184 treatment 
than corresponding values for vehicle control mice.  c- Met protein in tumors was slightly 
less, but phosphorylated c- Met was markedly reduced after treatment for 7 days.  
 
Mice bearing MDA- MB-231 cells (expressing MET and VEGF) were administered four 
oral doses of 100 mg/kg.
28  XL184 increased tumor hypoxia (13-fold) and apoptosis 
(TUNEL; 2.5 -fold) at 8 and 4 hours after the first and second doses, respectively, when 
compared to vehicle- treated tumors.   In addition, XL184 disrupted tumor vasculature by 
inducing endothelial cell death that negatively impacted tumor viability.  XL184 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
10 
 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition of MDA -MB-231 tumors ( P 
<0.001) at all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared to vehicle- treated  tumors.  
Dose -dependent inhibition was observed for the 3 and 10 mg/kg doses ( P <0.01), and 
complete inhibition was observed at the 30 and 60 mg/kg doses.  A single 100 mg/kg dose resulted in sustained MDA- MB-231 tumor growth inhibition for ~8 days after which 
tumors began growing at a rate similar to vehicle -treated control tumors.  In addition, 
XL184 inhibited tumor growth ( P <0.001) in the MET-expressing rat C6 glioma cell line 
for all doses (1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg) when compared with vehicle- treated  tumors.  The 
3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses resulted in significant tumor regression (62% and 85%, P 
<0.0001) when compared with pre- dose tumor weights.  Subchronic administration of 
XL184 was well tolerated in mice and rats with no signs of toxicity, as dete rmined by 
stable and/or increasing body weights during the treatment period.
28 
 
Pharmacodynamics In vivo pharmacodynamic experiments showed that XL184 inhibits key RTKs that 
promote tumor cell proliferation and/or angiogenesis (MET, VEGFR2, TIE -2, and RET) 
(Investigator's Brochure, 2010).  In mice, the effective dose resulting in 50% inhibition (ED50) of targets was achieved at well tolerated doses of XL184 and at pl asma exposures 
comparable to exposure observed in clinical trials.  XL184 produced prolonged inhibition 
of receptor phosphorylation, such as sustained inhibition of MET and VEGFR2 for 10 hours after administration of a single dose of XL184.  This extended inhibition occurred in a manner that was generally predicted by plasma exposure, i.e., inhibition was 
diminished when plasma levels fell below approximately 20 μM for MET, 5 μM f or 
VEGFR2, and 23 μM for TIE -2. 
 
Once  daily administration of XL184 resulted i n significant inhibition of MET 
phosphorylation in TT tumors, with maximal inhibition of 70% seen at 60 mg/kg, relative to tumors from vehicle control -treated mice (Investigator's Brochure, 2011).  Dose -
dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of MET and RET was observed among the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose groups.  
 
MET phosphorylation was inhibited by a single 100 mg/kg oral dose of XL184, 2–8 hours post dose in H441 tumors (human lung papillary adenocarcinoma) that harbor constitutively phosphorylated MET 
28. This effect was reversible, as MET 
phosphorylation returned to basal levels by 48 hours after treatment.  
 
Toxicology In rodents and non-rodents, histopathological changes associated with XL184 administration were observed in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, and adrenal and reproductive tract tissues (Investigator's Brochure, 2011).  Histopathological changes present in the bone and pancreas were considered secondary to 
XL184 administration.  Adverse effects following oral exposure to XL184 were generally 
dose- related, clinically monitorable, and self -resolving upon discontinuation of dosing.  
In 6- month chronic toxicity studies, treatment-related changes were present only in 
kidney (rats) and reproductive tissues (dog).  In reproductive/developmental toxicity studies, XL184 administration resulted in decreased fertility in male and female rats, in embryotoxicity when given to pregnant rats, and in a visceral tissue malformation (small 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
11 
 spleen) when given to pregnant rabbits.  The no-observable- adverse- effect -levels 
(NOAELs) for the chronic toxicity and reproductive/developmental toxicity studies occurred at plasma exposures (AUC) below steady -state values measured in subjects with 
solid tumors administered 175 mg XL184 capsule form daily (Study XL184-001).  
 
In definitive genotoxicity bioassays, XL184 was negative in an S. typhimurium/ E. coli 
bacterial mutagenicity study, an in vitro chromosome aberration study using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus study.  
In safety pharmacology studies, no adverse effects occurred on neurobehavioral or respir atory functions in XL184- treated rats or on cardiovascular function in XL184 -
treated dogs
. 
 Clinical studies with Cabozantinib  
As of 4 May 2011, 1003 subjects have been enrolled in open- label clinical studies of  
cabozantinib, and 330 subjects have been enrolled in a placebo-controlled blinded Phase 3 study.  Clinical data are available from nine studies of cabozantinib including four Phase 1 studies, one Phase 1b/2 study, three Phase 2 studies, and one Phase 3 study.  
Doses in the studies listed in Table 1 are in terms of salt -based dosing with the exception 
of study XL184-203, where the free-base equivalent weight is also noted.

 Multiple dose levels of e rlotinib + XL184 were evaluated.  
Response: The  dose levels in phase 2 study XL184- 202 are: 
arm B (75 mg XL184 + 150 mg erlotinib and 50 mg XL184 + 150 mg erlotinib [MTD]) and arm A (75 mg XL184 + 100 mg erlotinib; 125 mg XL184 + 100 mg erlotinib; and 125 mg XL184 + 50 mg erlotinib) (Wakelee et al., 2010).  Six 
of 36 evaluable patients, including at least 3 patients with 
prior erlotinib therapy, had 30% reduction in tumor measurements on at least 1 post -baseline scan, including 3 
with a cPR (1 with MET amplification).  Prolonged SD of 4 months was observed in some patients, including one patient for 9+ months and one patient with epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M.  A cPR was 
achieved in 5 of 64 (8%) eva luable patients enrolled in 
phase 1  (Investi gator's Brochure, 2011).  In phase 2, a cPR 
was observed in one patient treated with single-agent XL184.

 Non-randomized extension cohorts in CRPC and ovarian 
cancer  
Response:  One hundred seventy one CRPC subjects were 
enrolled .  Randomization was suspende d after 122 subjects 
were enrolled due to demonstrated clinical benefit.  Seven patients achieved a cPR at week 12, and three additional patients achieved PR after the 12 -week lead -in stage.  The 
disease- control rate (rate of response +stable disease) at 
week 12 was 68%.  Seventeen subjects were randomized to 
placebo; 14 to XL184.  Among these subjects, the hazard 
ratio for PFS was 0.013 (p = 0.007) .  Of 108 subjects 
evaluable for bone scan response, 19% had complete resolution; 56% had partial resolution; 21% had stable 
disease and only 3% had progression as their best response.  
Three hundred nineteen subjects with non-CRPC advanced solid tumors were also enrolled in study XL184-203 .The overall ORR at week 12 by cohort was: HCC 10% (3/30 patients), NSCLC 10% (6/60 patients), breast 10% (2/20 
patients), melanoma 5% (4/77 patients), SCLC 5% (1/21 
patients), pancreatic 0% (0/20) and gastric/GEJ 0% (0/21).  In 51 evaluable epithelial ovarian cancer patients, at 12 weeks, the overall RR was 24% (12/51 patients) , 21% in 
platinum -refractory/resistant patients (7/34)), and 28% in 
platinum -sensitive patients (10/36).  The highest disease 
control rates at week 12 were HCC (73%), ovarian (53%), melanoma (47%), breast (45%), and NSCLC (40%).

 175 mg QD or placebo administered QD.  
Response:  Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 
study recently reported top line data indicating that the primary endpoint of the study, PFS, was met .  PFS on the 
cabozantinib arm was 11.2 months compared to 4 months 
on placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.28, p < 0.0001.   
 
The dose of 60 mg proposed in this study is based on a recent trial reported at ASCO 
2012 30.  An adaptive response scheme was used to determine the lowest active daily 
cabo zantinib dose among dose levels +1 (60 mg), 0 (40 mg), and -1 (20 mg) .  The 
primary endpoint was wk 6 bone scan response (BSR) assessed with an automated FDA 510(k) approved computer- aided detection system .  A ≥30% decrease in total bone scan 
lesion area (BSLA) was defined as a response.  The first cohort was treated at dose level 0.  The number of responses (≥8 vs. <8 among 11 evaluable pts) was used to select the dose level (-1 vs. +1) for the second cohort.  Based on the observed BSR rate in the second cohort of 11 pat ients, a dose was selected for expansion to treat 13 more pts.  The 
study completed planned enrollment of 36 pts.  Median age was 66; 44%  were docetaxel -
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044

 pretreated .  Among 12 pts enrolled at dose level 0, there were 10 BSRs at wk 6 including 
1 complete response (CR), and 1 pt with stable disease (SD) .  The median decrease in 
BSLA was 62% .  Ten p atients evaluated at wk 12 included 9 BSRs (3 CRs), and 1 
sustained SD .  Among 11 pts then treated at dose level -1, 10 pts were evaluable at wk 6: 
1 BSR, 5 SD, and 4 had progressive disease.  No pts in the 2 cohorts required dose reduction or treatment interruption at 12 wks; 1 p atient discontinued due to grade 3 AEs 
(anorexia, fatigue).  6/12 pts with ≥  6 months follow -up remain on study.  5/5 pts enrolled 
at 40 mg with CTCs ≥5 per 7.5 mL converted to <5.  Thirteen pts accrued to the expansion cohort at 40 mg daily had confirmed high BSR rate.  The s tudy concluded that 
cabozantinib 40 mg daily achieves a high BSR rate in men with CRPC and bone metastases, and is associated with better tolerability than previously reported for cabo zantinib 100 mg daily .  Hence, the manufacturer is carrying a dose of 60  mg forward 
in phase III trials , which is the dose that we have chosen in our trial. 
 
Pharmacokinetics In study XL184-001
31, pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis showed dose- proportional 
increases in plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) both for the PIB formulation (dose range: 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg) and the capsule formulation (dose range: 125 mg to 175 mg).  After repeat daily dosing, t1/2, z values (mean ± standard deviation) for cabozantinib were 91.3 ± 33.3 hours (n = 23), and apparent steady- state plasma levels were reached by day 15.  
Steady -state clearance for the 175 mg capsule dose derived from repeat dose data was 4.2 
± 1.5 L/h. Patients who received 175 mg capsules had four- to five -fold higher steady -
state exposure (AUC) compared with Day 1 (7.68 ± 2.85 μg·h/mL; n = 23 vs. 41.6 ± 15.5 
μg·h/mL; n = 23), indicating that cabozantinib  accumulated with repeat daily dosing.  
There was no significant difference in exposure between patients with MTC and those without MTC.  
 
Safety  
As of March 1, 2011, the most frequently (>20%) observed adverse events (AEs) in 806 
patients treated in single agent, open label cabozantinib studies, regardless of the relationship to drug, were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, constipation, 
palmar- plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, vomiting, dysphonia and 
hypertension, (Investigator's Brochure, 2011).  Effects that may be related to the inhibition of VEGF, including hypertension, thromboembolic events, GI perforation, fistula formation, hemorrhage, wound healing complications, and proteinuria, have also been observed .  As of 4 May 2011, of the 1003 subjects enrolled in open- label clinical 
trials with cabozantinib (eith er as a single -agent or in combination with other therapies).  
Across all open -label studies, the most common SAEs, regardless of causality were PE, 
dehydration, vomiting, DVT, pneumonia, diarrhea, nausea, convulsion, mental status changes, and abdominal pain .  Fatigue (16%), diarrhea (10%), and nausea (6%) were the 
most common reasons for discontinuation.  There have been 15 deaths considered related to cabozantinib  treatment within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment: pulmonary 
embolism (2 patients), respiratory failure (pulmonary embolism) (1 patient), respiratory failure (1 patient), GI hemorrhage (2 patients), unexplained death (2 patients), hemoptysis (1 patient), hemorrhage intracranial (1 patient), enterocutaneous fistula (1 patient), respiratory disorder (1 patient), intestinal perforation (1 patient), hemorrhage (1 patient), and diverticular perforation –peritonitis (1 patient).

 2.3 Correlative Studies  
Substantial inhibition of phosphorylation of MET, RET, and KIT, as well as of downstream signaling molecules AKT and extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK), was seen following 
administration of cabozantinib (Investigator's Brochure, 2011).  
 
From the first 12 cases in study XL184-201, 80% of samples of tumor cells were positive for MET with a lower fraction positive for RET and VEGFR2 (42% and 58%, respectively) 
(DePrimo et al. , 2009).  MET signal in blood vessels was limited (33%); whereas, RET and 
VEGFR2 expression was often seen in tumor- associated blood vessels.  Modulation of plasma 
levels of VEGFA, soluble MET, soluble VEGFR2, soluble KIT, and PlGF, was consistent with multiple on -target effects.  Objective response was observed in the presence or absence of tumor 
EGFR amplification, phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) mutation, and O6-methylguanine- DNA-
methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.  
 Phase 1: Study XL184 -001 Changes in pharmacodynamic markers consistent with anti-
angiogenesis activity were observed in Cohorts 6 through 12 and the eMTD Cohort with plasma samples taken on Day 1 pre-dose and Day 29.  While small cohort sizes presented a challenge for statistical analysis of pharmacodynamic marker changes the combined data of Cohorts 12 and the eMTD Cohort (i.e., subjects enrolled at the MTD) demonstrated that changes in PlGF (↑), VEGF -A (↑), EPO (↑), and sVEGFR2 (↓) reached statistical significance.   Soluble MET a s a 
potential biomarker of MET inhibition was increased upon cabozantinib treatment and changes reached statistical significance.  
 
One set of serial skin biopsies was received from a subject enrolled in the eMTD Cohort and was analyzed using fluorescence-based IHC.   Changes in total MET, RET and KIT were minimal 
during the course of cabozantinib treatment but the activity (as assessed by the phosphorylation status) of these cabozantinib targets (decrease compared to baseline: MET: 40%, RET: 40%, KIT: 61%) as well as of the downstream signaling molecules AKT (39%) and ERK (55%) was statistically significantly reduced in this surrogate tissue.  These observations support the on-target inhibitory effect of cabozantinib.  Total levels and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 were not affected by cabozantinib treatment in this surrogate tissue.  
 
 Circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF -A, and soluble VEGFR2 
(sVEGFR2) in patients treated with MET and VEGFR inhibitors  
Many proteins are proteolytically released from the cell surface by a process known as 
ectodomain shedding.  Shedding occurs under normal physiologic conditions and can be increased in certain pathologies.  MET is among the many receptors for which ectodomain shedding has been demonstrated.  HGF stimul ates mitogenesis, motogenesis, 
and morphogenesis in a variety of cellular targets during development, homeostasis,  and 
tissue regeneration.   Inappropriate HGF signaling resulting in unregulated cell 
proliferation, motility, and invasion occurs in several h uman malignancies .  This can 
occur through paracrine signaling, autocrine loop formation, receptor mutation, gene amplification or gene rearrangement accompanied frequently with overexpression of ligand and/or receptor proteins .  Working under the hypothes is that aberrant MET 
pathway activation in cancer might result in increased ectodomain shedding, MET could be a useful biomarker of tumor progression; Athauda et al. developed a sensitive 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
16 
 electrochemiluminescent immunoassay to quantitate MET protein in biological samples.
32  Their study showed significant direct correlations between malignant 
potential and sMET production in tumor-derived and genetically engineered cell lines, and between  tumor burden and plasma sMET levels in mice harboring human tumor 
xenografts.
32  These preclinical studies supported the hypothesis that sMET might 
indicate malignant potential and/or tumor burden for cance rs where the pathway is active.  
 
Several studies of human clinical samples are now underway to investigate the potential utility of sMET to aid diagnosis and patient selection, and as a pharmacodynamic marker for drugs that directly target MET kinase activity .  Among these is an ongoing 
collaboration between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the NCI Urologic Oncology Branch to measure plasma sMET, HGF, VEGF -A and sVEGFR2 in patients in Phase I and II 
clinical trials of GSK1363089 (GSK089), an inhibitor of MET and VEGFR2 tyrosine kinases.  In a Ph ase II gastric cancer study, patients treated with GSK089 on an 
intermittent dosing schedule showed significantly increased plasma sMET and VEGF -A 
during the treatment periods and decreases during drug holidays.  Follow-up cell-based studies show that inhi bition of MET kinase activity blocks receptor internalization, 
resulting in increased exposure to cell surface MET shedders(s), suggesting a direct short-term relationship between sMET levels and drug target inhibition.  Increased 
VEGF -A levels have been r eported as a response to VEGFR inhibitors in previous 
clinical studies .  Median tumor burden did not change significantly over the course of the 
gastric study, so it was not possible to determine whether sMET levels could also reflect 
tumor burden.  This q uestion will be better assessed in an ongoing Phase II clinical trial 
of GSK089 in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma, where changes in tumor 
burden meeting RECIST criteria were reported in an interim trial report.
33 
 
 Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)  
CTCs will be isolated from whole blood samples collected at baseline and then 
throughout the study for assessment of DNA damage response markers such as γH2AX.  We will also evaluate whether we can measure changes in the number and phenotype (epithelial -mesenchymal transition) of CTCs in patients over time to explore any 
correlation with response to treatment or disease progression.  This analysis will be performed in Dr. Kinders’ lab with the ApoStream instrument, which uses antibody-independent CTC isolation technology that can isolate viable CTCs from epithelial and non-epithelial cancers.   
2.4 Rationale  
We propose a clinical trial of cabozantinib, a dual VEGFR and MET inhibitor, in refractory soft 
tissue sarcoma for the following reasons:   
 
1. It has been shown that VEGF levels  are elevated in patients with  STS and correlates with 
the grade of the tumor.
14-17 Anti -VEGF agents like bevacizumab have been studied in this 
disease with promising results.19,20 Pazopanib has also been studied in STS in phase II21 
and III settings22; patients showed improvement in PFS by 13 weeks compared to placebo. 
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
17 
 2. Various sarcoma cell lines express high levels of activated c -Met receptor suggesting that 
HGF/S F signaling pathway may contribute to sarcomagenesis.25 Interruption of autocrine 
or paracrine HGF/SF c -met signaling with the monoclonal antibody AMG102 in 
leiomyosarcoma ce ll line SK -LMS-1 and in mouse xenograft models has shown significant 
antitumor effect.26 It has also been shown that MiT tumors like clear cell sarcoma cells are 
dependent on HGF/C- Met axis27 for invasion, chemotaxis,  and survival. 
 3. The MET pathway may play an important role in resistance to VEGF inhibitors like sunitinib .
34 Treatment with multiple VEGF inhibitors has been reported to be associated 
with an aggre ssive phenotype with increased invasiveness and higher MET expression.35-37 
Hence, we propose to target the dual arms of the VEGF/MET  axis with cabozantinib in the 
hope to eliminate some of the resistance that has been encountered in the past with angiogenic inhibitors. 
 4. In vivo activity  of XL184  has been shown in the form of tumor shrinkage in RIP- Tag2 
transgenic mice
29 and mice bearing MDA -MB-231 cells28. As shown in Figure 3, 
combination blockade of VEGFR and c-MET with XL184 significantly (P < 0.05) prolongs survival compared to treatment with vehicle or anti-VEGFR antibody alone in the RIP-Tag2 transgenic mouse mode l, a spontaneous and highly vascularized pancreatic islet cell 
cancer.  
 
 
 
Figure 3: Increased survival of RIP -Tag2 transgenic mice following treatment with the 
VEGFR and c -MET inhibitor XL184 compared to treatment with anti-VEGF antibody 
or vehicle.  The extent of liver metastasis was also less in RIP -Tag2 mice treated with 
combination blockade of VEGFR and c- MET than in mice treated with anti- VEGF 
antibody alone.  
5. In the clinical arena , cabozantinib  has been shown in Phase 1 study XL184-001 that 
evalu ated the capsule formulation and suspension formulation to achieve SD of at least 
3 months in advanced solid tumors (including one patient each of alveolar soft part sarcoma and clear cell sarcoma).
31  
 
By targeting the dual VEGF/c- MET pathway with cabozantinib in soft tissue sarcoma we 
propose to improve on the PFS that was established in the Phase III trial of pazopanib where it improved median PFS by 13 weeks compared to placebo.
22 If our proposed trial is positive , we 

CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
18 
 would anticipate this could lead to a large randomized phase III trial comparing the two targeted agents pazopanib and cabozantinib in STS, thereby establishing a new standard of care in this population. 
  
3 PATIENT SELECTION

Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
19 
 
 Subjects must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and 90 mmHg (diastolic) for eligibility.  Initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted prior to study entry provided that the average of three BP readings at the time of enrollment  is ≤ 140/90 mmHg 
 Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets.   Tablets must not be crushed or 
chewed.  
 The effects of cabozantinib  on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this 
reason and because receptor tyrosine k inases are known to be teratogenic, women 
of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception.  All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s).  
Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) 
during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used.   
 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Patients who have had anticancer therap y, including kinase inhibitors or any 
investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 half- lives (whichever is shorter)  (6 
weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who 
have not recovered to baseline  from adverse events (except alopecia and other 
non-clinically significant AEs) .  Patients who have received prior cabozantinib or 
inhibitors of c- MET or HGF are ineligible . 
 The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose 
of study treatment  
 The subject has received radiation therapy  within 4 weeks ( ≤ 2 weeks for 
palliative radiation therapy) 
 Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or epidural disease are excluded from this clinical trial.  Subjects with brain metastases 
previously treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects with epidural disease previously treated with radiation who are asymptomatic and have remained stable for 4 weeks  and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 
weeks before starting study treatment are eligible.  Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.  Baseline brain imaging with contrast- enhanced CT or 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
20 
 MRI scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility.  
 Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications  or substances k nown to af fect or 
with the potential to affect the a ctivity of cabozantinib  will be determined 
following review of their ca ses by the Principal Investigator (see Section s 3.2.8, 
3.2.9 and 3.2.10 for further information).  Patients who are taking enzyme-
inducing anticonvulsant agents are  not eligible. 
 Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could interfere with  absorption. 
 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or  
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib  has the 
potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potent ial risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the 
mother with cabozantinib , breastfeeding  should be discontinued if the mother is 
treated with cabozantinib. 
 Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can affect levels of cabozantin ib and 
should be avoided whenever possible or switched to alternatives.  Subjects requiring chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) are not eligible for this study .  Because the 
lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently -updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical 
reference texts such as the Physicians’ Desk Reference may also provide this information.  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need  to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-
the-counter medicine or herbal product.  
 HIV- positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because 
of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with  cabozantinib.  A ppropriate 
studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.  
 The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin -related agents, heparin, thrombin or 
Factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel).  Low dose aspirin (≤81 mg/day), low -dose warfarin (≤1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted.  (Please note that there may be cases in 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
21 
 which  patien ts on study require anticoagulation for DVT/PE management; this 
does not necessitate taking the patient off study. See Section 6.1.5.)  
 The subject has experienced any of the following  
• clinica lly-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months  before the 
first dose of study treatment;  the participant must be maintained on a 
prophylactic regimen for management of an upper GI bleeding event with no evidence of recurrence and/or endoscopic confirmation of resolution of the source of a lower GI bleed.

5 TREATMENT PLAN  
This is a multicenter phase II trial of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  Treatment will be 
administered on an outpatient basis.    Patient evaluations will be performed throughout the study as described below.  Baseline history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis , pregnancy test , and EKG must be 
conducted within 8 days prior to start of protocol therapy.  If protocol therapy is started within 8 days of the eligibility screening evaluations (see  Sectio n 3.4 ), the results from these screening 
evaluations may be used as baseline measurements.  If >8 days have passed since the screening evaluations, the medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis , 
pregnancy test , and EKG must be repeated prior to starting protocol therapy.  Tumor imaging 
must be performed within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy.  H
istory and physical examination, l abs (CBC with differential; serum chemistries) , serum or 
urine pregnancy test ( for female participants of childbearing potential ), and EKG  will be 
performed at baseline  and within 8 days prior to the start of each new cycle after cycle 1 .  B12 
and folate are not part of the screening evalu ation but will be measured at baseline (within 8 days 
prior to start of protocol therapy ) and every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles; within 8 days prior to the 
start of the cycle) .  Urinalysis  for evaluation of urine protein/creatinine ratio should occur at 
baseline, within 8 days prior to the start of each new cycle after cycle 1 , and as clinically 
indicated .   
 CT scans will be performed at baseline (within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy), and repeat imaging scans will be performed every 2 cycles (every 3 cycles for patients on study for 
more than 1 year; every 4 cycles for patients on study more than 3 years).  MRI evaluation of site 
of disease may be performed in lieu of CT evaluation at the dis cretion of the principal 
investigator if in the opinion of the investigator this modality would provide a more accurate 
assessment of disease than a CT would for a given site.    
 The history and physical exam, pregnancy test, CT scan,  EKG,  and all other protocol-required 
labs, including blood collections for CTCs, will be done less frequently for patients on study more than one year (every 3 cycles after 1 year on study and every 4 cycles after 3 years on study).  B12 and folate (measured at baseline and then every 3 cycles) will be measured  every 4 
cycles after 3 years on study . 
5.1 Agent Administration  
Adult patients will receive cabozantinib  tablets as 60  mg tablets orally once a day in a 28-day 
cycle.  A dose of 100 mg daily was tested and found to have acceptable efficacy albeit greater toxicity and a dose of 40 mg was also tested and found to be efficacious
30,38.  Patients who 
tolerate the 60  mg dose with little or minimal toxicity may be dose escalated to 80  mg after the 
first restaging (after cycle 2) for subsequent cycles .  Dose escalation will be decided by the 
treating phy sician after discussion with the study PI.  Ad verse events and potential risks are 
described in Secti on 7.  Appropriate dose modifications  are described in Section 6. 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
26 
  
No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy.  C abozantinib  will be taken o n an 
empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after food.  Subjects may fast for at least 1 hour before and 
2 hours after eating.   The drug will be administered once daily at approximately the same time 
each day.  Tablets must be swallowed whole and not crushed.  A new cycle may begin up to 1 week later than it would otherwise be scheduled based on the 28-day cycle, to allow for flexibility for days the clinic is closed and other unexpected events.    Patients will be provided with a Study Diary (Appendix C ), instructed in its use, and asked to 
bring it with them to each a ppointment.  After cycle 2, a cycle will be considered completed if 
90% of the prescribed doses are administered . 
 Cabozantinib 
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substrate), based on 
data from in vitro studies using CYP- isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies . 
Concomitant medications that are inhibitors or inducers of the CYP3A4 pathway should be used with caution.  Strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, St. John's Wort, and troglitazone should be avoided.  In addition, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib  (Investigators brochure, 2011).   
Caution must also be used when 
discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently 
receiving a stable dose of Cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to Cabozantinib 
 
Because there is a potential for interaction of cabozantinib with other concomitantly 
administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the- counter medications, or alternative 
therapies.  The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  Appendix B  
presents guidelines for identifying m edications/substances that could potentially  interact 
with cabozantinib.  Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ ).  
 
B 
ecause in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other 
CYP450 pathways (e.g., CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib exposure is not known.  Therefore, these drugs should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib. 
 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound, 99.9%.  Use caution when co- administering 
cabozantinib with medications that are highly protein -bound (e.g., diazepam, furosemide, 
dicloxacillin, and propranolol).  Administration of warfarin with cabozantinib is 
contraindicated a s warfarin is highly protein -bound and has a very narrow therapeutic 
index.   
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
27 
 Drugs Associated with QTc Prolongation:  Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc interval.  Caution should be used when treating subj ects on cabozantinib with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org ).  Additional QTc monitoring is suggested for subjects who are 
treated concomitantly  with QTc prolonging drugs. 
 
Other Interactions: In a relative bioavailability study in dogs, cabozantinib exposure was not significantly affected by drugs that alter gastric pH.   Nevertheless, drugs such as 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-antagonists produce profound suppression of gastric acid secretion and significant increases in gastric pH.  By elevating gastric pH, PPIs and H2 -antagonists may decrease cabozantinib plasma exposure levels and its 
effectiveness in vivo, resulting in clinically significant drug interactions.  
 
Avoid concomitant use of cabozantinib  with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H
2 -
antagonists if possible.  The PPIs and H 2 –antagonists may decrease cabozantinib  plasma 
exposure levels and its effectiveness in humans.  Examples of PPIs are omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole; examples of H
2 –antagonists 
are ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine.  Cimetidine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  Avoid using cimetidine with  cabozantinib.  If needed, ant acids are recommended for the 
initial treatment of dyspepsia or indigestion.  If antacids are not adequate, the use of H
2 
blockers (other than cimetidine) is preferred over PPIs.  If antacids, H 2 blockers, or PPIs 
are needed, take them at least 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking cabozantinib  but at 
least 14 hours before the next dose of cabozantinib  if possible.  
 
Potential Food Effect  
The effect of food on the bioavailability of cabozantinib  was evaluated in healthy adult 
subjects in a Phase 1; open -label, randomized, single -dose, two- treatment, and two- way 
crossover study (Study XL184-004).  Based on the preliminary PK data, a high fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t
1/2, but significantly increased the median tmax to 6 
hours from 4 hours (fasted).  The high fat meal also significantly increased both the cabozantinib Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively.  Based on this result, cabozantinib should be taken on an empty st omach (fasting is required 1 hour before, and 
2 hours after each cabozantinib dose). 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
All patients will be provided with the best available supportive care.  No chemotherapeutic drugs other than cabozantinib will be allowed.   Because there is a potential for interaction of 
cabozantinib with other concomitantly administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter 
medications, or alternative therapies.  The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes. 
 Anorexia 
Anorexia leading to grade 3 weight loss  will be managed according to local standard of 
care including nutritional support.  Pharmacologic therapy such as megestrol acetate or 
dronabinol may be considered.  For Grade 3 weight loss dose reductions will not be done 
unless pharmacologic interventions have been tried first and fail. 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044

 Diarrhea  
If diarrhea develops and does not have an identifiable cause other than study drug administration, anti-diarrheals such as Lomotil (diphenoxylate HCl 2.5 mg + atropine sulfate 0.025 mg/tablet) dosed according to package insert or loperamide 4 mg po after the first unformed stool with 2 mg po with every 2 hours (4  mg every 4 hours while 
asleep), till resolution of episode of at least 12 hours (no more than 16 mg of loperamide during a 24-hour period) .  This regimen can be repeated for each diarrheal episode.  
Diarrhea will be considered refractory if it does n ot resolve within 24 hours to ≤ Grade 2 
with the above regimen (maximum of 16 mg of loperamide in a 24- hour period).  If the 
patient develops blood or mucus in the stool, dehydration, or hemodynamic instability, or fever along with the diarrhea, anti- diarr heals will be discontinued and the patient will be 
treated with IV fluids and antibiotics as medically indicated .  The dose modification 
guidance in Table 6-1 should be followed.  In addition, general supportive measures will 
be implemented including continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals ; and stopping lactose-containing products, high fat 
meals, and alcohol. 
 Nausea and vomiting  
Anti-emetics will not be administered routinely prior to  cabozantinib.  Anti -emetic agents 
along with supportive care are recommended as clinically appropriate at the first sign of nausea and vomiting.  The dose modification guidance in Table 6-1 should be followed.   
 
The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are recommen ded over chronic use of NK-1 receptor 
antagonists and dexamethasone (NK-1 receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and glucocorticoids induce CYP3A4 and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure.  Caution is also recommended with the use of nabilone , which is a weak 
inhibitor of CYP3A4.  
 Myelosuppression 
The use of growth factors will be considered in accordance with ASCO guidelines. 
 Stomatitis and Mucositis 
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential c omplications before study treatment is initiated.  Appropriate correction of 
local factors should be instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill- fitting dentures 
and appropriate care of gingivitis.  During treatment with cabozantinib, good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as non -traumatic cleansing, and oral rinses ( e.g., with 
a weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maintained.  The oral cavity should be rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brus hed often to 
remove plaque.   Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms.  
When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be considered. 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
29 
 • Disease progression  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatme nt 
• Significant toxicity occurs despite 2 dose reductions as described in Section 6  or no 
lower dose level exist s 
• P atient decides to withdraw from the study  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
• Necessity for treatment with other anticancer treatment prohibited by the protocol,  
• Sexually active subjects who refuse to use medically accepted barrier methods of 
contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom) during the course of the study and for 4  months following discontinuation of study treatment, 
• Women who become pregnant or are breast feeding, 
• Request by regulatory agencies for termi nation of treatment of an individual subject 
or all subjects under the protocol, or 
• Significant noncompliance with the protocol schedule in the opinion of the investigator.  
5.4 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients will be followed for 30 days after the last dose is administered or until one of the following occurs: patient enrolls on another protocol, patient receives standard of care, or death, and whichever comes first.  The follow -up will consist of a ph one call between Days 27 -30 after 
the last dose to evaluate adverse events that were ongoing and any new events that might be deemed related to the therapy.  Toxicities felt to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drugs that have not resolved or stabilized by Day 30 post- treatment will be followed until 
stabilization or resolution via biweekly phone calls.  
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from study for one of the following reasons: completed 30 -day follow 
up period or toxicities are unresolved but stabilized, patient withdraws from study, and /or patient 
enrolls on another protocol.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the medical record and communicated to Centr al Registration per Section 
4. 
  
6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Treatment ma y be delayed for a maximum of 2 weeks for toxicities.  In case toxicities do not 
resolve as stated, the patient will not receive further therapy on this protocol and will be followed for resolution of toxicities.  S tart of next cycle may be delayed for up to 1 week  to accommodate 
scheduling conflicts.  Dose modifications are intended for within- cycle and start -of-next- cycle 
changes.  If administration of study drug is interrupted for any reason, it will not be made up, and counting of the cycle days continues.  A maximum of 2  dose reductions will be allowed before 
patient is taken off treatment.  Patients who  require a dose reduction will not have the dose re-
escalated.   
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044

 All patients begin at dose level 0 .  Patients who tolerate dose level 0 with no or minimal 
toxicity may  be escalated to 80  mg daily , sequentially , after the first restaging (after cycle 
2).  Dose escalation will be decided by the treating physician after discussion with the study PI.

6.1 Management of C abozantinib- related AE  
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs throughout the study.  Subjects must be instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all toxicities . 
 General guidelines for the management of non- hematologic and hematologic 
toxicities are provided in Table 6 -1 and Table 6-2, respectively. 
These algorithms should be followed unless there are specific clinical circumstances for which the treating physician decides an alternative treatment approach is clinically appropriate.  Consultation with the study c hair is recommended .

 Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Elevations of transaminases have also been observed during treatment with cabozantinib.  
In general, it is recommended that subjects with elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters.  If possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in subjects who develop elevated transaminases.  Since subjects may enter the study with elevations of AST/ALT 
at baseline, the following guideline should be used for dose modifications:

the standard protocol -defined monitoring of LFTs.   
Grade 2  Continue  cabozantinib with weekly monitoring of LFTs for 2 weeks  or until LFTs 
return to ≤  Grade 1 or baseline.   If LFTs continue to rise within Grade 2, interrupt 
cabozantinib treatment.  Then continue with weekly LFTs  for 4 weeks or  until 
resolution to Grade  ≤ 1.  Study treatment may then be resumed at a one dose -level 
reduction of cabozantinib  
Grade 3  Interrupt cabozantinib treatment  and monitor with at least twice weekly LFTs until 
Grade ≤ 2.  Then continue with at least weekly L FTs until resolution to Grade  ≤ 1.  
Cabozantinib may then be resumed at a one dose -level reduction .   
Grade 4  Discontinue study treatment permanently .  LFTs should be monitored as clinically 
indicated, at least 2 -3 times per week, until resolution to Grade  ≤ 1.  If the subject 
was unequivocally  deriving clinical benefit, the subject may be able to resume 
treatment at a lower dose of cabozantinib as determined by the investigator and  
sponsor but only with sponsor approval.

  Cabozantinib treatment s hould also be interrupted when transaminase increases are 
accompanied by progressive elevations of total bilirubin, and/or elevations of coagulation tests ( e.g., International Normalized Ratio [INR]).  Monitoring of transaminases should 
be intensified (2 –3 times per week) and cabozantinib should be held until the etiology of 
the abnormalities is determined and these abnormalities are corrected or stabilize at 
clinically acceptable levels (INR < 1.5 ×  ULN, total bilirubin <  1.5 ×  ULN, 
aminotransferases ≤ baseline grade).  
 
Subjects must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are accompanied by evidence of impaired hepatic function (bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN), in 
the absence of evidence of biliary o bstruction (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline 
phosphatase) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol 
hepatitis), as the combined finding (i.e., Hy’s Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause sev ere liver injury.  
 
All subjects who develop isolated bilirubin elevations of Grade 3 should have study treatment held until recovered to Grade ≤1 or baseline (or lower).  If this occurs within 6 weeks of the dosing delay, study treatment may continue at a reduced dose.  In subjects without biliary obstruction and Grade 4 bilirubin elevation, or with recurrence of Grade 3 bilirubin elevation after a dose reduction, study treatment must be discontinued.

Asymptomatic Lipase or Amylase  Elevations  
Grade 1 or Grade 2  Continue at current dose level.  More frequent monitoring is recommended  
Grade 3  • Interrupt treatment  
• Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly  
• Upon resolution to Grade  ≤1 or baseline, cabozantinib may be restarted at 
the same dose or at a reduced dose provided that this occurs within 6 weeks.  
• If retreatment following Grade 3 lipase or amylase elevation is at the same 
dose and Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevations recur, then treatment must be interrupted again until lipase and amylase  levels have resolved to Grade ≤1 
or baseline and retreatment must be at a reduced dose.  
Grade 4  • Interrupt treatment  
• Monitor lipase and amylase twice weekly  
• Upon resolution to Grade  ≤1 or baseline and if resolution occurred within 4 
days, cabozantinib may be restarted at the same dose or a reduced dose.  If resolution took more than 4 days, the dose must be reduced upon 
retreatment provided that resolution occurred within 6 weeks.  
• If retreatment following Grade 4 lipase or amylase elevation is at the same 
dose and Grade 3 or 4 elevations recur, then treatment must be interrupted again until lipase and amylase have resolved to Grade ≤1 or baseline and 
retreatment must be at a  reduced dose.

deriving benefit from cabozantinib therapy, treatment may resume at a reduced 
at a reduced dose agreed to by the investigator  and sponsor  but only with 
sponsor approval . 
 Skin Disorders  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand-foot syndrome), 
skin rash (including blister, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pigmentary changes, and alopecia have been reported in  cabozantinib- treated subject s.  All subjects on study 
should be advised to use prophylactic measures for skin care.  These measures includes the use of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, sunscreen with SPF ≥30; avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot wa ter; protection of pressure-

 sensitive areas of hands and feet; and use of thick cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep the palms and soles dry.  Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection ( e.g., abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo).  
 
Early  signs of hand-foot syndrome can include tingling, numbness, and slight redness or 
mild hyperkeratosis.  Early manifestations  include painful, symmetrical red and swollen 
areas on the palms and soles.  The lateral sides of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected.  Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of affected areas.  Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology referral.  
 
Treatment  guidelines for PPE related to study treatment are presented in the table below.  
 
In the case of study treatm ent-related skin changes (e.g., rash, hand- foot syndrome), the 
investigator may request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent.  These assessments may include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the skin changes resolve.  
 
Hand -Foot Skin Reaction and Hand Foot Syndrome (PPE)  
Grade 1  Continue cabozantinib at current dose.  Start urea 20% cream twice daily AND clobetasol 
0.05% cream once daily.  Assess subject at least weekly for changes in severity.  Subjects 
should be instructed to notify investigator immediately if severity worsens.   
Grade 2  If tolerable, continue cabozantinib at current dose.  If intolerable, reduce cabozantinib 
dose to next lower level and/or interrupt dosing.  Start/continue urea 20% cream twice 
daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream once daily.  Add analgesics for pain control w ith 
NSAIDs/GABA agonists/narcotics if needed.  Assess subject at least weekly for changes 
in severity.  If treatment was interrupted (but not reduced), treatment may be restarted at 
the same dose or at one dose level lower when reaction decreases to Grade 1 or 0.  If a 
treatment interruption is again required, the dose must be reduced when treatment 
resumes.  Subjects should be instructed to notify investigator immediately if severity 
worsens.  If severity worsens at any time, or affects self -care, proceed to the management 
guidelines for Grade 3 PPE.   
Grade 3  Interrupt study treatment until severity decreases to Grade 1 or 0.  Start/continue urea 
20% cream twice daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream once daily.  Pain control with 
NSAIDs/GABA agonists/narcotics.  Treatment may restart at one dose level lower when 
reaction decreases to Grade 1 or 0.  Permanently discontinue subject from study if 
reactions worsen or do not improve within 6 weeks.   
 Embolism and Thrombosis  
Deep  vein thrombosis and PE have been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib; 
including fatal events (please refer to the I nvestigators Brochure ).  Subjects who develop 
a PE or DVT should have study treatment held until therapeutic anticoagulation with  
heparins is established.  Study treatment may be resumed with a one dose- level reduction 
in subjects who have uncomplicated PE or DVT and are deriving clinica l benefit from 
study treatment.  During treatment with anticoagulants , subjects need to be monitored on 
an ongoing basis for bleeding risk and signs of bleeding.  Subjects with life- threatening 
PE or DVT should have study treatment discontinued unless toxicity can be managed and subject is deriving clear clinical benefit as determined by the investiga tor and agreed by 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
36 
 the Sponsor.  Venous filters ( e.g., vena cava filters) are not recommended due to the high 
incidence of complications associated with their use.  Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per investigator judgment  at one dose lower.  
Subjects should permanently discontinue experimental treatment  after a second 
thrombotic event.  Although routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjects, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed for individual subjects at the discretion of the investigator.   Note:  lovenox will be administered as therapeutic anticoagulation; no 
data exist of an interaction between cabozantinib and lovenox.   
 
Arterial thrombotic events (e.g., transient ischemic attack,  myocardial infarction) have 
been observed rarely in studies with cabozantinib.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute MI or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.  
 Hypertension toxicity  
Therapeutic BP monitoring by a health care provider will occur at the beginning of every 
cycle for the duration of treatment .All patients will be required to monitor their BP at 
least once a day (preferably BID) throughout the treatment and record the readings in the study diary ( Appendix C ).  S
ubjects with known hypertension should be optimally 
managed prior to study entry.  Cabozantinib dosing should be interrupted in subjects with severe hypertension (180  mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic; or sustained ≥160 mm 
Hg systolic or ≥110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled with medical interventions and discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or hypertensive encephalopathy (see 
next Table 4 below). 
 If
 the readings are abnormal the patient needs to have the BP reconfirmed by a health 
care provider prior to changes in study drug or antihypertensive medications are made.  Table  4 will be used for the management, and for the determinatio n of cabozantinib  dose 
modification.   Suggested antihypertensive medications are listed in Appendix D .

 Proteinuria toxicity  
Evaluation of urine protein/creatinine  ratio (UPC) should occur as follows: at baseline 
and at the start of each cycle.  Dos e modification should be done according to Table 5 
below. 
 
Severity of Proteinuria  Management of Proteinuria  
Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio  
≤ 1 • No change in treatment or monitoring  
> 1 and < 3.5  • Confirm with a 24 hour urine protein excretion 
within 7 days.    
• If proteinuria of > 1 g/24 hours is confirmed, hold cabozantinib and continue with UPCR monitoring.  
When UPCR  returns to < 1, restart cabozantinib at 
a reduced dose.  Continue monitoring UPCR once every week until two consecutive readings  are < 1, 
then revert to UPCR monitoring frequency 
specified in the protocol.  
≥ 3.5  • Hold cabozantinib immediately  and confirm with 
24 hour urine protein excretion.  
• Evaluate for nephritic syndrome.  If present, 
discontinue cabozantinib treatment permanently, 
and monitor subject for resolution of nephritic 
syndrome.  
• If proteinuria of ≥ 3.5 g/24 hours is confirmed without diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, continue 
to hol d cabozantinib and monitor  UPCR weekly.  If 
UPCR decreased to < 1, then revert to UPCR 
monitoring frequency specified in protocol  
UPCR, urine protein/urine creatinine ratio.  
 
 Guidelines for the Prevention of Hemorrhagic Events  
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways 
as well as with cabozantinib .  As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for 
potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
38 
 bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on study.  Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following:  
 
• Tumor lesions with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or abut major blood vessels.  The anatomic location and characteristics of primary tumors or metastases as well as the medical history should be carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib.  
• Recent or concurrent r adiation to the thoracic cavity.  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory GI diseases.  
• Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (e.g., deficiencies in clotting factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia). 
• Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis.  
• History of clinically significant hemoptysis.  
 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious and life-threatening bleeding events or recent hemoptysis (≥  0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood).  Treatment 
with cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after the cause of hemorrhage has been identified and the risk of bl eeding has subsided at a dose agreed to by the sponsor and the 
investigator.  Therapy of bleeding events should include supportive care and standard medical interventions.  
 
Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel or who develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study treatment must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment.  
 Rectal and Perirectal Abscess  
Rectal and perirectal abscesses have been reported, sometimes in subjects with concurrent diarrhea.  These should be treated with appropriate local care and antibiotic 
therapy.  Cabozantinib should be held until adequate healing has taken place.  
 Guidelines for Prevention of GI Perforation/Fistula and Non -GI Fistula Formation  
GI perforation/fistula and Non-GI fistula formation have been reported with approved 
drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib.  Carefully monitor for episodes of abdominal pain, especially in subjects with known risk factors for developing GI perforation/fistula or non- GI fistula, to allow for early diagnosis. Such risk factors 
include (but may not be limited to) the following:  
 
GI-perforation/fistula:  
• Intra -abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa.  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis .  
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
39 
 • Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing).   
Complete  healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intra-abdominal 
abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with ca bozantinib. 
 
Additional risk factors include concurrent chronic use of steroid treatment or non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs.  Constipation indicative of bowel obstruction 
should be monitored and effectively managed.   Non-GI fistula:  
• Radiation therap y has been identified as a possible predisposing risk factor for non -GI 
fistula formation in subjects undergoing treatment with drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways.  In addition, subjects who have undergone extensive surgery may be at increased risk of developing a fistula of the involved organs non -GI fistula should be 
ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy.  
 
Discontinue all study treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI or non- GI 
perforation/fistula.  
 Wound Healing and Surgery 
VEGF in hibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which 
may occur even long after a wound has been considered healed.  Therefore, surgical and traumatic wounds must have completely healed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment and be monitored for wound dehiscence or wound infection while the subject is being treated with cabozantinib.  
 
Treatment with cabozantinib must be interrupted for any wound healing complication which needs medical intervention.  Treatment with cabozantinib can be resumed once 
wound healing has occurred unless otherwise prohibited in specific protocols.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious or chronic wound healing complications.  
 
The appropriate dose hold interval prior to elective surgery to reduce the risk for wound healing complications has not been determined.  In general, cabozantinib should be stopped at least 3 weeks (5 half- lives ) prior to elective surgery.  
 Endocrine Disorders 
Prospective studies of markers of thyroid functions are currently ongoing in two single-
agent studies to characterize the effects of cabo zantinib on thyroid function.  P reliminary 
data indicate that cabozantinib affects thyroid function tests (TFTs) in a hig h number of 
subjects (see Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure).  Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated with cabozantinib.  Management of thyroi d 
dysfunction ( e.g., symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice 
guidelines. 
 
Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects.  Monitoring with 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
40 
 standard laboratory tests for endocrine disorders and clinical examination prior to initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib is required.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-threatening endocrine dysfunction. 
 Guidelines for Prevention of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported with use of antiangiogenic drugs and bisphosphonates and denosumab in cancer patients.  Additional risk factors for ONJ have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial surgery procedures, and cancer disease itself.  Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib, the details of w hich are provided in the current version of Investigator’s Brochure.  As a 
preventive measure, invasive dental procedures should be avoided if possible in subjects who have previously been treated with or concomitantly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab.  In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, the risks and benefits of a dental procedure and the extent of the procedure as well as the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw need to be considered when deciding on the duration of a temporary treatment interruption of cabozantinib.  If clinically possible, treatment with cabozantinib should be held for at least 2 weeks prior to a dental procedure and resumed after complete wound healing occurred. 
 
Subjects with any documented case of osteonecros is should have study treatment 
interrupted, and appropriate clinical management should be initiated.  Reinitiation of study treatment must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor on a case by case 
basis.  
 Guidelines for Management of Treatment- Emergen t Corrected QT (QTc) 
Prolongation 
Treatment with cabozantinib has been associated with a mild prolongation of the QTc 
interval.  Other factors which may contribute to QTc prolongation include 
• Treatment with other drugs associated with QTc prolongation (see 
http://www.qtdrugs.org). 
• Treatment with CyP 3A4 inhibitors (which may increase cabozantinib drug 
levels)  
• Electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia). 
• Medical conditions which can alter electrolyte status e.g., severe o r prolonged 
diarrhea.  
 
Subjects having any of these additional risk factors while on cabozantinib must have EKGs performed approximately one week after the onset of these factors.  
 
If at any time on study there is an increase in QTc interval to an absolute value >500 msec, two additional E KGs should be performed within 30 minutes after the initial E KG 
with intervals not less than 3 minutes apart.  If the average QTcF from the three E KGs is 
>500 msec, study treatment must be withheld and the following actions should be taken: 
 
• Check electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium, and calcium.  Correct abnormalities as clinically indicated.  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
41 
 • If possible, discontinue any QTc -prolonging concomitant medications.  
• Repeat E KG triplets hourly until the average QTcF is ≤500 msec or otherwise 
determined by consultation with a cardiologist. 
 
The Sponsor should be notified immediately of any QTc prolongation event.  
 
Subjects with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc 
elevation has resolved.  Cardiology consultation is recommended for evaluation and 
subject management.  Symptomatic subjects must be treated according to standard clinical practice.  No additional study treatment is to be given to the subject until after the event has resolved, the subject has been thoroughly evaluated, and further treatment has been agreed to by the Sponsor.  If any additional study treatment is given (e.g., after correction of electrolyte abnormalities and normalization of QTcF), it will be at a reduced dose as agreed to by the investigator and the Sponsor. 
 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS: L IST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a rout ine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting (via CTEP- AERS ) in addition  to 
routine  reporting.  
7.1 C omprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List  (CAEPR)  
 CAEPR for Cabozantinib  (NSC 761968) 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf 
for further clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 3219 patients. Below is the CAEP R 
for XL184 (Cabozantinib).  
NOTE: Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has 
an AE listed on differ ent SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

 7.2 CTEP Reporting  Requirements  
 Adverse Event Characteristics  
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized until March 31, 2018 for AE reporting.  CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018 .  All 
appropriate treatment areas should  have access to  a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.   
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
o AE
s for the agent that  are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed 
in the SPEER column, Section 7.1.1 ) should be reported through CTEP- AE RS 
only if the grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
o Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined 
in Section 7.2.4. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
1. Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
2. Probable – The AE  is likely related to the study treatment.  
3. Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
4. Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
5. Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP- AERS (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via t he CTEP Web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “ NCI G uidelines for 
Investigators:  Adverse Event Reporting R equirements  for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and  
DCP INDs and IDEs ” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the table s below (Section 7.2.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to CTEP by telephone at 301- 897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP- AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.   
 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
CTEP- AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator(s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding Organization or Lead Organization, the local treating 
physician, and the Reporter and Submitter.  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for 
other e- mail recipients  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
47 
 
 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol- specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note :  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality, unless as noted below.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression”  
in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.”  
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated w ith a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration of the Investigational Agent/Intervention  
1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or 
not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of t he following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/bi rth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
(FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via 
CTEP- AERS w ithin the timeframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospitalization Grade 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5 
Timeframes  
Resulting in Hospitalization       
≥ 24 hrs  10 Calendar Days  
24-Hour ; 5 Calendar Days  
Not resulting in Hospitalization       
≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR. 
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar D ays” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-
hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within 10 calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
48 
 Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 AEs resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” 
above applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011  
 Additional Protocol-Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions 
Lymphopenia (any grade), alopecia (any grade), anemia (grade 2), electrolytes (grade 2: 
sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium), albumin (grade 2), hyperuricemia (grade 3), INR (grade 2), and PTT (grade 2) will NOT be reported through CTEP- AERS  
but will be reported in the routine data submissions. 
 Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported  
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
 
 Pregnancy 
Although not an adverse event in and of itself, pregnancy as well as its outcome must be documented via CTEP -AERS .  In addition, the Pregnancy Information Form  included 
within the NCI Guidelines for Adverse Event Reporting Requirements must be completed and submitted to CTEP.  Any pregnancy occurring in a patient or patient’s partner from the time of consent to 90 days after the last dose of study drug must be reported and then followed for outcome.  Newborn infants should be followed until 30 days old.  Pl ease see the “NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” (at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ adverse_effects.htm ) for more details on 
how to report pregnancy and its outcome to CTEP.  
 
 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation, or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP- AERS .  Three options are available to describe 
the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., a cute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
49 
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS  unless otherwise specified .  
 Multicenter Guidelines for Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
7.2.10.1 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting for Participating Sites  
Adverse Event Reporting via CTEP -AERS:  
Follow sponsor expedited AE reporting requirements in Section 7.2 and copy Ashley Bruns  (ashley.bruns@nih.gov) and Dr. Alice Chen (chenali@mail.nih.gov) on all CTEP-AERS reports.    Adverse Event Reporting to N IH IRB:  
The Coordinating Center will review CTEP- AERS reports and submit to the N IH-IRB 
via iRIS (https://iris.nci.nih.gov/iMedris/).  The site PI must immediately report to the Coordinating Center PI any serious adverse event, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event within 24 hours of PI awareness of the event.  The site PI must also report any protocol deviations or violations to the Coordinating Center PI within 7 days of PI awareness.  Participating centers must also submit the report to their IRB in accordance with their 
institutional policies.  
 
Follow N IH IRB expedited AE reporting requirements in this section.  Complete the N IH 
IRB Expedited AE form supplied by the Coordinating Center.  Send the completed form

8.2 Agent Ordering  
 NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the responsible investigator  (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.   PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained).   The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Biosketch, Agent Shipment 
Form , and F inancial Disclosure Form (FDF).   If there are several participating 
investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for the study should 
be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution. 
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
52 
 Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator-designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OA OP) application ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx).  
Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account  (https://ctepco re.nci.nih.gov/iam) and the maintenance of an “active”

 Sample Co llection and Processing  
Biospecimens will be collected and processed using validated SOPs that will ensure both specimen quality and patient confidentiality pursuant to informed consent provisions.  
 
Using a computerized inventory system and a backup hardc opy process, all specimen 
collection and processing steps will be documented and the specific location of each specimen will be tracked.  Each new specimen collected will be assigned a unique barcode identifier that can be linked to the original specimen c ollected and other relevant 
information within the inventory system.  To ensure patient confidentiality, only containers used for the initial specimen collections will be labeled with patient identifiers.  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
55 
 Only the barcode identifier will be applied to all subsequent specimen containers.  When specimens are processed and aliquoted, no patient information will be included on the new containers.  Original specimen containers will be discarded.  Only barcode- labeled 
specimens without patient identifiers will b e shipped for analysis and/or storage.  
Specimen labels will indicate: CTEP protocol number, unique patient accession number, 3-digit sample  number (see list below), collection time, and total volume collected, as 
appropriate.  Samples from sets of at least three patients will be grouped for scientific analysis.  
 
Standardized 3- digit sample collection numbers: 
300 series: blood for PD 400 series: blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  
 The inventory process contains other security provisions sufficient to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality.  Access to the inventory system and associated documents will be restricted to appropriate individuals.  Requests to use specimens stored in the repository must be approved.  The only patient information avai lable in the inventory 
system will be the patient sex, diagnosis, and level of informed consent given.  SOPs ensure that any changes in informed consent made by a patient and relayed to the PI will be reflected in the inventory system to ensure that specimens are destroyed as appropriate.  All laboratory personnel will be trained to adhere to SOPs and will be monitored for high-quality performance. 
 
Any new use of these samples will require prospective IRB review and approval.  Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
   
If at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request.  Following receipt of this request, the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested), and reported as such to the IRB.  Any samples lost (in transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity (i.e., broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) will be reported as such to the IRB.

 10 STUDY CALENDAR  
Eligibility screening evaluations are to be conducted within 8 days prior to enrollment, with the exception of informed consent and tumor imaging scans , which must be done within 28 days 
prior to enrollment (see Section 3.4 ).  Baseline history, physical examination, laboratory 
evaluations, urinalysis , pregnancy test , and EKG are to be conducted within 8 days prior to the 
start of protocol therapy.  If protocol therapy is started within 8 da ys of the eligibility screening 
evaluations, values from the screening evaluations may be used as baseline measurements; if > 8 days have passed since the screening evaluations, the medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis , pregnancy test, and EKG must be repeated prior to starting 
protocol therapy.  Baseline imaging scans and must be done within 28 days prior to the start of protocol therapy.    A
 new cycle may begin up to 1 week later than it would otherwise be scheduled based on the 28-
day cycle, to allow for flexibility for days the clinic is closed and other unexpected events.  In the event that the patient’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.

11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks  or 2 
cycles (every 3 cycles for patients on study for more than 1 year; every 4 cycles for patients on 
study more than 3 years).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  Bone scans will be done at baseline for patients with known bone tumors and at restaging if clinically needed.  Response and progression will be evaluat ed in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with cabozantinib. 
 
Evaluable for objective response.  Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 f:   Evaluation of urine protein/creatinine ratio should occur at baseline , within 8 days prior to the start of each new 
cycle, and as clinically indicated.  If patient has urine protein/creatinine ratio >1+,  obtain a 24 hour urine for 
protein and creatinine clearance.  
g:  Tumor measurements are repeated  every  2 cycles (every 3 cycles for patients on study for more than 1 year; 
every 4 cycles for patients on study more than 3 years ). 
h: EKG will be performed at baseline and  within 8 days prior to the start of each new cycle. 
i:   Serum or urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential) at baseline and  within 8 days prior to the start 
of each new cycle. 
j: Blood s amples will be obtained at the following time points: at baseline, on C1D1 3 -6 hours after dose of 
cabozantinib  and C2D1 3- 6 hours post drug (mandatory at the NCI but optional at participating sites) . 
k:  TSH at baseline and  within 8  days prior to the start of each new cycle. 
l:   Blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be collected (optional) as described in Section 9.1.2.  
m: The history and p hysical exam, pregnancy test, CT scan , EKG, TSH, and all other protocol -required labs  and 
CTC blood collections will be done every 3 cycles after 1 year on study and every 4 cycles after 3 years on 
study.  
n:  Eligibility screening results may be used for these baseline measurem ents if conducted within 8 days  prior to the 
start of protocol therapy. See Sections 3.4  and 5 . 
o:  B12 and folate at baseline and every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles, within 8 days prior to the  start of the  cycle; every 
4 cycles after 3 years on study ).

 Evaluable Non- T arget Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest 
x-ray or as >10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or d ecimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be > 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-m easurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are c onsidered as non -measurable.  
 
N
ote:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic  lesions’  thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   A
 ll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it self 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
61 
 as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in  the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-ta rget lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
11.2 Met
hods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up.  Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions:  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -r
ay : Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI :  This  guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 U
se of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable global ly.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same typ e of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 PET- CT:
 At  present, the low dose or attenuation cor rection CT portion of a combined PET- CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
62 
 quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound: U
 ltrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduc ed in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :
  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
T
he cytological confirmatio n of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect  of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG- PET
 :  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly poss ible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. N egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing site of 
disease on CT that is not  progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of  FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by disease- specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations  of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
63 
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
11.3 Response Criteria  
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :
    Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study. 
 
 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesi ons and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
N
ote:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/ Non -PD:    Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :
   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
64 
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of 
the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall r esponse is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment  will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation

should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be 
made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.

(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  
12.1 D ata Reporting 
 Method 
Data will be collected in the Center for Cancer Research C3D database.   This study will 
be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) Version 3.0.  Cumulative protocol- and patient -specific CDUS data will be submitted electronically to CTEP on a 
quarterly basis, either by FTP burst of data or via the CDS web application.  Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  Instructions for submitting data using the CDUS can be found on the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/cdus.html ).  
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
66 
 Note :  All adverse events that have occurred on the study, including those reported 
through CTEP- AERS , must be reported via the monitoring method identified above. 
 Responsibility for Data Submission 
Study participants are responsible for submitting CDUS data and/or data forms to the 
Coordinating Center quarterly to allow time for Coordinating Center compilation, Principal Investigator review, and timely submission to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for compiling and submitting CDUS data to CTEP for all participants and for providing the data to the Principal Investigator for review.   
 
12.2 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan 
The investigators at each participating center will be responsible for the collection, maintenance, and quality control of the study data.  Adverse events observed in patients enrolled on the trial will be monitored in real time by the Principal and Associ ate 
Investigators, and attribution of these events to the research will be determined at the end of each treatment cycle in each subject.  The clinical research team (PI, adjunct PI, research nurses, data managers) will meet weekly when patients are being actively treated on the trial to discuss each patient in detail and ensure that all events are graded appropriately, and that the attribution to study drug is correct.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for establishing conference calls between participating sites at least on a monthly basis to discuss the observed toxicities and protocol issues.   All SAEs will be reported through CTEP-AERS to CTEP, to the Coordinating Center PI 
at NCI, and forwarded to the IRB per Section 7.0 .  In all cases where the dose of the 
study treatment has been reduced/modified or the patient withdrawn due to unusual or 
unusually severe toxicity considered related to the study treatment, the investigator must contact and inform the Coordinating Center PI.  All sites will be monitored by the CTEP drug monitor, who will receive data from all participating sites.  
 Data will be monitored regularly by the PI in order to identify significant toxicity trends.  Any new significant finding that may affect the patient’s willingness to continue in the study will be shared with patients.    Confidentiality will be maintained as much as possible, consistent with applicable regulations.  Names of participants or identifying material will not be released without patient permission, except when such release is required by law.  No patient’s name or identifying information will be released in any publication or presentation.  Records are maintained according to current legal requireme nts, and are made available for review 
according to the requirements of the FDA or other authorized user, only under guidelines established by the Federal Privacy Act.  
 Safety Monitoring Committee:  
Because this is a multi -institutional protocol for which the NCI CCR is the Coordinating 
Center, it will be monitored by the DTC Safety Monitoring Committee, NCI.

 12.3 Multicenter Guidelines  
This protocol opened initially at the NCI.  The N IH IRB will be notified once the 
participating centers’ IRBs have approved the studies to open.  This protocol will follow the CCR’s Clinical Research Operations’ SOPs for multicenter trials.  
 
 IRB Approvals  
As the Coordinating Center for a trial, it is the PI’s responsibility to ascertain that no patients are entered on the trial at a participating institution without full IRB approval.  Thus, the N IH IRB must approve the addition of each participating institution to the 
protocol and will require a copy of the local IRB approval from each participating institution before NIH  IRB approval will be granted. 
  The PI will provide the N IH IRB with a copy of the participating institution’s approved 
yearly continuing review.  Registration will be halted at any participating institution in which a current continuing approval is not on file at the NIH  IRB.  
 
 Amendments and Consents  
The NCI PI will provide the NIH  IRB with copies of all amendments, consents, and 
approvals  from each participating institution.  
 
 Data Collection  
The investigators will be responsible for the collection, maintenance, and quality control 
of the study data.  All data collected for each study subject will be entered into the Cancer Central Clinical Database (C3D), an NCI electronic case report form/database, every 2 weeks.  The participating sites will be able to enter the data remotely into the web -
based C3D system.  Each site investigator is also responsible for maintaining all source documentation related to the study, including any films, tracings, computer discs or tapes.  NCI will be responsible for data management, data analysis, and reporting.  Data collection forms will be provided to the participating institutions.  Required data include, not exclusively: prior disease -related therapies with dates, disease type, stage, disease 
sites, with measurements, and concurrent medications.   
 Data and Center Audits 
Audits will be conducted yearly to ensure data integrity and provide quality control.  These audits will be conducted by the NCI research team.  Selected patient charts should be audited as well as the participating institution’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) at the time of the visit.  Data from participating institutions should be available when the protocol is audited at the NCI.

13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
The study will be conducted as a dual -endpoint two- stage Phase II trial to target objective tumor 
response rate (CR+PR) of 30% against an unacceptably low rate of 10%, and 6- month PFS rate 
of 65% against an unacceptably low rate of 45% (corresponding to median PFS of 9.6 vs. 5.2 months).  
 
The trial is designed to accrue up to 50 evaluable patients and judge the agent as promising if either tumor respons e rate or 6 -month PFS rate is promising .  If at least 11 objective responses 
(at least 22%), or at least 27 instances of 6 -month PFS (at least 54%), are  observed among the 50 
evaluable patients, this agent w ill be considered worthy of further testing in this disease .  If no 
more than 3 objective responses (12%), and no more than 12 instances of 6-month PFS (no more than 48%), are observed among the initia l 25 patients, the study will be terminated early and 
declared negative.  This design yields at least 90% power to detect a true objective response rate of at least 30%.  It yields at least 92% power to detect a true 6 -month PFS rate of at least 65% 
(media n PFS of 9.6 months).  It yields at least .89 probability of a negative result if the true 
objective response rate is no more than 10% and the true 6-month PFS rate is no more than 45% (median PFS of 5.2 months), with approximately .53 probability, at least, of early negative stopping in this case.  These last two probabilities (of a negative result and early negative stopping, both under the null hypothesis) are calculated assuming that tumor response rate and PFS rate are uncorrelated.  If they are positively correlated, as is likely, the probabilities will be a 
bit higher.   
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The study will accrue 50 evaluable patients at the rate of 2 -3 patients per month.  To allow for a 
small number of unevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling h as been set at 5 5 patients.  
13.3 Stratification Factors  
 Patients will be stratified based on prior VEGF/TKI therapy .  In order to ensure accrual of 
multiple different histological types of STS to this trial (including histologic types that are felt to 
be driven by angiogenesis or the MET pathway), following accrual of the first 20 patients, discussions will be held with CTEP to review which other histologic types of STS should be enrolled. 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
• Determine and compare circulating l evels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and 
soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of cabozantinib. 
• All PD changes from baseline will be assessed descriptively by calculating the mean and 
the 95% confidence interval of the change.  PD measures derived from blood samples will be used to assess the change from baseline 3 -6 hours after the first dose of the first 
cycle of treatment and 3 -6 hours after the first dose of the second cycle of treatment.

 13.5 Reporting and Exclusions  
 Evaluation of toxicity – All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with cabozantinib. 
 Evaluation of response – All patients included in the study will  be assessed for 
response to treatment, even if there are major p rotocol treatment deviations or if 
they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early d eath from toxicity, 7) 
early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) will  be included in the main analysis of 
the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 will be considered to have a 
treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
 
All conclusions will be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, 
these subanalyses will not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis will be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals will also be provided.  
  
14 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
14.1 Justification for Subject Selection  
This study will be open to all individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, or race , provided that 
the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  Patients for this study will be recruited through internal referral, our physician referral base, and through various cancer information hotlines (i.e., Clinical Studies Support C enter, 1-800-4Cancer).  To date, there is no 
information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or effect on tumor would be expected in one ethnic group compared to another.  Efforts will be made to extend accrual to each representative population, but a balance must be struck between participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore racial/ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in outcome that correlate to ethnic identity are noted, a follow -up 
study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
 
Due to lack of knowledge of the effects of cabozantinib on the fetus or infants, as well as the possibility of teratogenic effects, pregnant and nursing women will be excluded from this trial.  Patients with unstable or serious medical conditions are excluded due to the possibility that 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
72 
 cabozantinib may worsen  their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may 
obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to cabozantinib .  HIV -positive patients on 
combination antiretroviral therapy  are excluded from the study because of possible interactions 
with cabozantinib 
 Participation of Children  
This study includes patients 18 years of age and older.  Because insufficient dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of cabozantinib  in patients <18 years 
of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials.  Studies will be performed in patients <18 years of age when it is appropriate to do so.  
14.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts  
There may or may not be any clinical benefit to a  patient from participation in this trial.  Their 
participation will benefit future cancer patients.  Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects that are listed in the consent document.  The procedure for protecting a gainst or minimizing risks will be to medically evalua te patients as described in 
Sections 5 and Section 6 .  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be fully 
evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to which participants are entitled under applicable regulations.  
14.3 C
onsent and Assent Process an d Documentation 
An associate or principal investigator on the trial will inform patients of the purpose, alternatives, 
drug administration plan, research objectives, and follow- up of this trial.  The patient will be 
provided an IRB -approved consent for review and signature and his/her questions will be 
answered.  After a decision is made to enroll into the study, a signature will be obtained from the patient.  The original signed consent goes to Medical Records; a copy will be placed in the 
research record.   Patients will not be consented by telephone. 
 
All patients must have a signed informed consent form and an on- study (confirmation of 
eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating investigator before entering on study.  
 Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However, re- consent 
may be necessary, and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become decisionally impaired. For this reason, and because there is a prospect of direct benefit fr om 
research participation  (i.e., long-term stabilization and/or improvement in the pain and physical 
impairment caused by soft tissue sarcoma) , all subjects ≥ age 18 at the NCI only  will be offered 
the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and c are, and assign a substitute decision 
maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively  impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI or AI 
will contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team for evaluation.  For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre- determined substitute decision maker, the procedures 
described in NIH OHSRP Policy 403 for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects 
who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.

Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
73 
 14.4 Procedure for Protecting Against or Minim izing Any Potential Risks  
All care will be taken to minimize side effects, but they can be unpredictable in nature and severity.  This study may involve risks to patients, which are currently unforeseeable.  All patients will be monitored for side effects from taking study medication .  This research 
represents a greater than minimal risk to participants, but presents the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects. 
 
14.5 Patient Advocate 
The patients’ rights representative is available to patients receiving treatment on this protocol at the NIH Clinical Center at (301) 496 -2626 in Building 10 of the Clinical Research Center, Room 
1-3521, on the Bethesda NIH campus.  Patients will be informed that they can contact the study PI or RN at any time with questions about their medical care, and that the patients’ rights representative is also available to answer non -medical questions about the study.

 APPENDIX E: CTEP Multicenter Guidelines  
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a CTEP sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines must be followed. 
 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information Office 
(PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by anyone other than the Protocol Chair.  There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure 
safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data for 
study analysis. 
 Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office for 
Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.   The Coordinating Center is responsible for 
assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain copies of IRB approvals from each participating site.  
• Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP Form 310 
(documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO. 
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient reg istration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating 
site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for review by the Protocol Chair. 
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating Center 
for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating sites.  If the 
NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
85 
 Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
• The title page must include the name and address of each participating institution and the 
name, telephone number and e- mail address of the responsible investigator at each 
participating institution.  
• The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
• Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be stated in 
the protocol. 
• Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be submitted 
with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
• Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
• Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to participating institutions.   
 Agent Ordering Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP (See Section 8 ).  Investigational agents may be 
ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO.

Study Title:  A Phase 2 Study of Cabozantinib (XL184), a Dual Inhibitor of MET and VEGFR, 
in Patients With Metastatic Refractory Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Introduction 
We invite you to take part in a research study .   
First, we want you to know that: 
Taking part in this research is entirely voluntary .  
You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time.  In either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.   You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that may help people in the future. 
 
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of 
medical or research treatments they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your doctors or research team before you agree to the study. 
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much 
time as you need to ask any questions and discuss this study with family, friends or your personal 
physician or other health professional.   
 
Why is this study being done?  
We are doing this study to try to develop better treatments for cancer.  In this study, the 
experimental drug cabozantinib will be given to you.  The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug is effective in a particular type of tumor called soft ti ssue sarcoma, which is what your 
doctor has diagnosed you with.  We are trying to understand how these drugs work in soft tissue sarcomas.  For that, this study will look at how cabozantinib may affect the levels of certain 
proteins in your tumor.    The u se of cabozantinib in soft tissue sarcoma is experimental.  Cabozantinib works by two 
mechanisms.  Firstly, it acts by blocking the formation of new blood vessels in tumors, a process called angiogenesis.  New blood vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to growing cancers, and blocking this process can cause cancer cells or the supporting blood vessels to stop growing.  A drug that works by the same mechanism, pazopanib, has already been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with sarcoma.  In lab oratory studies, some drugs that block angiogenesis 
increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer cells adapt to not having enough oxygen, so the tumor can keep growing.  C abozantinib also blocks c- MET  in tumors.  By both 
these mechanisms the ability of the sarcoma tumor cells to survive may be markedly reduced by the drug.   
Although we hope this drug will decrease the size of your tumor, we cannot promise or predict 
the benefits of the treatment at this time.  The drug used in this study has known side effects that will be reviewed with you by your medical team before you sign the consent form.

Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
93 
 Why are you being asked to take part in this study?  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have advanced cancer that has progressed after receiving standard treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists.   
 Have these drugs been given to other people?  
Cabozantinib has been studied in many different cancer types like prostate cancer.  So far, more than 1300 patients have received cabozantinib  in clinical trials for different types of cancers.   
 How many people will take part in this study?  Up to 55 patients will ta ke part in this study at 4 centers across the United States. 
 
Description of Research Study  
What will happen if you take part in this research study?   Before you begin the study You will need to have the following examinations, tests, or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  These tests are part of your regular cancer care and should be done by your health care team even if you do not join the study.  If you have had them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor.  
If you decide that you would like to participate in this study, you will be asked to sign this 
consent form.  You will then have the examinations, tests, and procedures listed below done to see if you can take part in the study (this is called the screenin g/baseline evaluation).  
• Complete medical history.  
• Physical examination,  including height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. 
• Standard blood tests  (requiring about 1 tablespoon of blood in total), which include 
measurement of your white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, blood sugar and 
electrolytes, how your liver and kidneys work, and how well your blood clots. 
• Pregnancy test in women who are able to become pregnant. 
• Urine tests:  A urine test will be done every 4 weeks to check the level of protein 
excreted by your kidneys.  Depending on the results of blood tests, you may be asked to 
collect your urine for 24 hours for further testing.  
• EKG to check your heart. 
• CT scans  (a computerized x -ray examination) of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to 
measure your tumor(s).  Other imaging tests may be done as needed.  
• Pathology slides:   Before starting on the study, we will request tumor slides or blocks to 
confirm your diagnosis.   
 During the study  
If you are accepted and choose to take part, you will begin taking the study drug cabozantinib.  Cabozantinib is taken by mouth.  The study drug will be given in cycles.  All cycles are 4 weeks (28 days) long.   Cabozantinib is taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after food.  Each day that you take study drug, you will be asked to fill in a diary to show when you took the study drugs, how many pills you took, and report any side effects you may have had.    
For some study procedures we will need you to come to the ________________[name of center]  
You will also have tests performed because you are in the study to see how the study drug is 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
94 
 affecting your body and to find out how your body handles the study drug.  This will include imaging studies (for example, CT scans) to find out if your cancer has responded.   
 
We will ask that you come to the __________________[name of center] for at least 2 days 
during the first cycle, and then at the beginning of each cycle after that (less often if you have 
been on study for more than one year).  Dur ing the first cycle, you may be admitted for the first 2 
days of drug administration to make it easier to perform study test and procedures to see how the drugs are affecting your body.  If you develop any side effects, you may be asked to visit more often .  Please see the study chart for more details.   
 Standard procedures being done because you are in this study; these may be done more often because you are in the study:  
 
• Clinic visit to ask how you are feeling and to evaluate you with a physical examination at 
the beginning of each cycle (up to 8 days before the start of each cycle; less often if you 
have been on study for more than one year). 
• Vital signs and physical examination: will be performed during the clinic visits.  
We will ask that you buy a blood pressure monitor (the cost of may be reimbursed to you; 
discuss with your study team) and measure your own blood pressure at home at least once a day (preferably twice a day) throughout the study.  You will record the readings in a diary.  If your systolic blood pressure (top number) is ever more than 150 or your diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) more than 90, you should re -measure your blood pressure 1 to 4 
hours later.  If your systolic pressure is still greater than 150 or your diastolic  blood 
pressure is still greater than 90, please contact your study team for instructions.  You 
should also call the research team if you experience any symptoms of high blood pressure, 
such as chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, blood in the urine, or double vision. 
• Blood tests:  Measurement of your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, and 
measurements of your blood sugar, electrolytes, and how your liver and kidneys work will be done each time you are seen in the outpatient clinic.  All of these blood tests combined will require 1 -2 tablespoons (20-30 mL) of blood each time. 
• Urine test  to check urine protein will be done during the first cycle and then before you 
start each new cycle (less often if you have been on study for more than one year).  You 
may need it more frequently if the study doctor thinks it is needed to check for signs of possible damage to your kidneys.  Depending on the results of urine tests, you may be asked to collect your urine for 24 hours for further testing.   
• CT scans  or other imaging tests such as ultrasound (an examination using sound waves) or 
MRI (an examination using magnetic field and radio waves) that detect your tumor will be done every 2 cycles (about every 8 weeks; every 12 weeks if you have been on study for more than 1 year or every 16 weeks if on study for more than 3 years) while you are receiving treatment.  This is done so that any benefit of the treatment can be determined, and so that if your cancer is not responding to the treatment, the study team can tell you and help you move to a different treatment program (discussed further below).  
 
Tests and procedures being done to see how the drug is affecting your body:  
• Research blood samples (optional):  We may  collect blood samples to help us find out if 
cabo zantinib affects the levels of certain proteins.  Blood will be collected before you first 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
95 
 take the drug and on the first day of cycles 1 and 2 only.  Please see the study chart for more details.  The total blood for all these tests will be about 2 teaspoo ns.   
• We will also be collecting optional blood samples to find out the effects of the drug on any 
tumor cells in your blood.  Blood samples will be collected before you first take the drug, on the first day of cycle 1, and on the first day of every cycle for as long as you are on study (every 3 cycles if you have been on study for more than one year or every 4 cycles if more 
than 3 years).  Each blood collection is about 2 teaspoons.   
 
Study Chart  
The treatment is given over periods called cycles.  All cycles are 4 weeks long.  Treatment cycles will be repeated as long as you are tolerating the drugs and your cancer is either stable or getting better.  Each cycle is numbered in consecutive order.  The chart below shows what will happen during Cycle 1 and f uture cycles.  The left -hand column shows the day in the cycle, and the 
right-hand column tells you what will happen on that day.  This schedule shows what will happen to you after you sign the consent and start the study.   Cabozantinib should be taken with water at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.   
The drug tablets should be swallowed whole with water and may not be crushed or broken.

Risks or Discomforts of Participation  
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in this study?   If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that the XL184 (cabozantinib) may not be as good as the usual approach for your cancer or condition at shrinking or stabilizing your cancer.  
 You also may have the following discomforts: 
• Spend more time in the hospital or doctor’s office.  
• Be asked sensitive or private questions about things you normally do not discuss. 
• May not be able to take part in future studies. 
 The XL184 (cabozantinib) used in this study may affect how different parts of your body work such as your liver, kidneys, heart, and blood.  The study doctor will test your blood and will let you know if changes occur that may affect your health.  There is also a risk that you could have side effects from the study drug(s)/study approach.  Here are important things to know about side effects:  
• The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side effects. 
• Some side effects may go away soon, some may last a long time,  and some may never go 
away.  
• Some side effects may make it hard for you to have children. 
• Some side effects may be mild.  Other side effects may be very serious and even result in death. 
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
97 
 You can ask your study doctor questions about side effects at any tim e.  Here are important ways 
to make side effects less of a problem:  
• If you notice or feel anything different, tell your study doctor.  He or she can check to see if it is a side effect.  
• Your study doctor will work with you to treat your side effects.  
• Your study doctor may adjust the study drugs to try to reduce side effects. 
 The tables below show the most common and the most serious side effects doctors know about.  Keep in mind that there might be other side effects doctors do not yet know a bout.  If important 
new side effects are found, the study doctor will discuss these with you.  High blood pressure is one common side effect of cabozantinib.  Your blood pressure will be closely watched while you are taking this drug.  You will also be checking your blood pressure at home at least once a day (preferable twice a day) for the entire study.  If you have high blood pressure while taking cabozantinib, your study doctor may recommend follow- up with your 
primary care physician and/or starting or increasing medication to lower your blood pressure.  Some patients on this study have experienced blood clots in the lungs, possibly related to the study drug.  Let your doctor know immediately if you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain.  In addition, some patients on this study have experienced sepsis, or an infection in the 
bloodstream, possibly related to the study drug.  This condition can cause fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion.  Sepsis can be life- threatening. 
 Grapefruit juice has been shown to affect how the body handles some drugs by blocking the 
activity of the body’s cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system.  CYP450 is important in breaking 
down substances in the body, including cabozantinib.  Do not take grapefruit/ grapefruit juice or Seville oranges while participating in this trial.  Inform physician and study healthcare team about current medications including over the counter drugs, herbals, or natural medicines.  We do not know if taking cabozantinib will cause other drugs you may be taking to work differently.  It is very important that you talk to a member of the research team before beginning any new drugs, over- the-counter medications, vitamins, or alternative therapies.  
 Risks and side effects rel ated to cabozantinib  may include: 
 
COMMON, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS   
In 100 people receiving XL184 (cabozantinib), more than 20 and up to 100 may have:  
• Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting  
• Tiredness  
• Weight loss , loss of appetite 
• Changes in taste  
• Redness, pain or peeling of palms and soles

• A tear or hole in internal organs that may require surgery  
• Non-healing surgical site  
• Damage to the jawbone  which may cause loss of teeth  
• Bleeding in the brain  which may cause confusion  
• Stroke  which may cause paralysis, weakness  
• Brain damage  which may cause headache, seizure, blindness (also known as Reversible 
Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome) 
• Lung collapse  
  Reproductive Risks:  
If you are a woman who is breast feeding or pregnant, you may not take part in the study because we don’t know how cabozantinib would affect your baby or your unborn child.  If you are a woman who can become pregnant, or are the partner of a woman who can become pregnant, you will need to practice two effective forms of birth control before starting study treatment, during study treatment, and for  4 months after you finish study treatment.  Your study team will talk 
with you about the kinds of birth control that can be used in this study.   If you think that you or your partner is pregnant, you should tell your study doctor or nurse at once.   
Effective forms of birth control include:  
• abstinence  
• intrauterine device (IUD) 
• hormonal [injections, or implants]: estrogen containing pills are not allowed due to the 
risk of blood clotting  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
99 
 • tubal ligation  
• vasectomy  
 
Side Effects of Blood Draw: 
Infrequent (occurs in 1 to 10 out of 100 people): persistent pain and discomfort at the injection 
or needle insertion site as well as possible infection, bleeding, bruising, and soreness.  
 
Potential Benefits of Participation  
Are there benefits to taking part in this study?  
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  We do not know if you will receive personal, medical benefit from taking part in this study.  These potential benefits could include shrinking of your tumor or lessening of your symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the cancer.  You should discuss other treatment options with the study team and your home doctor before deciding to take part in this study.  We do know that information from this study will help doctors learn more about these study drugs.  This information will also help future cancer patients.  
 Alternative Approaches or Treatments What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
Instead of being in this study, you have these options  
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study 
• Taking part in another study 
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, 
tiredness, appetite problems, and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat the cancer directly.  Instead, it tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep 
you as active and comfortable as possible.  
 Please talk to your doctor about these and other options.  Research Subject’s Rights  What are my rights if I take part in this study?  
Taking part in this study is your choice.  You may choose either to take part or not to take part in this study.  If you decide to take part, you may leave the study at any time.  No matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any of your regular benefits.  Leaving the study will not affect your medical care.  You can still get your medical care from our institution if you are eligible and choose to participate in another trial.  We will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study.  In the case of injury resulting from this study, you do not lose any of your legal rights to seek payment by signing this form. 
 
   What are the costs of taking part in thi s study?  
CTEP Protocol #9284 
Clinical Center Protocol # 13-C-0044 
   
100 
  You and/or your health plan/insurance company will need to pay for some or all of the costs of treating your cancer in this study.  Some health plans will not pay these costs for people taking part in studies.  Check with your health plan or insurance company to find out what they will pay for.  Taking part in this study may or may not cost your insurance company more than the cost of getting regular cancer treatment.  
 The NCI will supply cabozantinib at no charge while you take part in this study.  Even  though it 
is unlikely, there is a possibility that at some point the supply of study agents may run out, necessitating taking you off-study.  [If applicable, inform the patient of any tests, procedures, or agents for which there is no charge.  The explanation, when applicable, should clearly state that there are charges resulting from performance of the test or drug administration that will be billed to the patient and/or health plan.  For example, “The NCI is supplying (drug) at no cost to you.  However, you or your health plan may need to pay for costs of the supplies and personnel who give you the (drug).”]   You will not be paid for taking part in this study.  
For more information on clinical trials an d insurance coverage, you can visit the National Cancer  
Institute’s Web site at http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/understanding/insurance -coverage.  You 
can print a copy of the “Clinical Trials and Insurance Coverage” information from this Web site.   
 
Another way to get the information is to call 1 -800-4-CANCER (1 -800- 422-6237) and ask them 
to send you a free copy.  
 
Stopping Therapy  
Your doctor may decide to stop your therapy for the following reasons: 
• if he/she believes that it is in your best interest  
• if your disease comes back during treatment  
• if you have side effects from the treatment that your doctor thinks are too severe 
• if new information shows that another treatment would be better for you  
• if too many patients in the study experience severe side effects  
• if you become pregnant 
 
In this case, you will be informed of the reason therapy is being stopped.  You can stop taking 
part in the study at any time.  However, if you decide to stop taking part in the study, we would like you to talk to the study doctor and your regular doctor first.   If you decide at any time to withdraw your consent to participate in the trial, we will not collect any additional medical information about you.  However, according to FDA guidelines, information collected on you up to that point may still be provided to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or designated representatives.  If you withdraw your consent and leave the trial, any samples of yours that have been obtained for the study and stored at the NCI can be destroyed upon request.  However, any samples and data generated from the samples that have already been distributed to other researchers or placed in the research databases cannot be recalled and destroyed.  
 
 Follow- up  
CTEP Protocol #9284

101 
 You will be followed for 30 days after taking the last dose of study drug.  We will call you after about 30 days to ask about any side effects that were ongoing when you stopped therapy, or any new side effects that might be related to the study  therapy.  If you have side effects that might be 
related to the study drugs that have not gotten better after 30 days, we will call you every 2 weeks until the side effects have become stable or gotten better.  The follow- up period will end if 
you enroll on another protocol or start receiving standard therapy.    What happens if I am injured because I took part in this study?  
It is important that you tell your study doctor, __________________ [investigator’s name(s)], if you feel that you have been injured because of taking part in this study.  You can tell the doctor in person or call him/her at __________________ [telephone number]. You will get medical treatment if you are injured as a result of taking part in this study.  You and/or your health plan wil l be charged for this treatment.  The study will not pay for medical 
treatment.  
 Will my medical information be kept private?  
We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical record will be kept private.  However, we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Your personal information may be given out if required by law.

Use of Specimens and Data for Future Research  
To advance science, it is helpful f or researchers to share information they get from studying 
human samples.  They do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases, where it is stored along with information from other studies.  A researcher who wants to study the information must  apply to the database and be approved.  Researchers use specimens and data 
stored in scientific databases to advance science and learn about health and disease.   
We plan to keep some of your specimens and data that we collect and use them for future research and share them with other researchers. We will not contact you to ask about each of these future uses.  These specimens and data will be stripped of identifiers such as name, address or account number, so that they may be used for future research on any topic and shared broadly for research purposes.  Your specimens and data will be used for research purposes only and will not benefit you.  It is also possible that the stored specimens and data may never be used.  Results of research done on your specimens and data will not be available to you or your doctor.  It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.   
My specimens and data may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent, or treat 
cancer or other health problems.    Yes              No                Initials_________

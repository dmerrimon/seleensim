Real-World Patient Characteristics, Treatment Patterns, and Clinical Outcomes Among 
Talazoparib-Treated Patients with HER2-Negative, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer and Germline BRCA1/2 Mutations: US Chart Review
Version 1, 22 June 2021
Rationale and background
Talazoparib (TALZENNA
®) is an orally available poly (adenosine diphosphate–ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for treatment of adult patients with human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC, including locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer) and germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (gBRCA1/2) mutations. To date, there is no published information about the characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of talazoparib-treated patients in the real-world (RW) United States (US) setting. The RW assessment of ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib since its approval in 2018 will provide information about the patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical ou tcomes of talazoparib-treated patients in the 
US.
Research question and objectivesPrimary objectives : 
The following primary objectives will be assessed among adult patients with HER2-negative 
ABC with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib in the RW practice setting in the US.
1. Describe demographic and clinical characteristics.2. Describe patterns of treatment with talazoparib monotherapy  
 
3. Describe RW clinical outcomes of talazoparib monotherapy-treated patients, including:
a. Time to treatment failure (TTF) for talazoparib 
b. RW progression-free survival (rwPFS) 
d. RW overall response rate (rwORR) PPD

Study design
This study consists of a retrospective, multi-site, patient-level medical chart review of US adult 
ABC patients who initiated talazoparib on or after October 16, 2018 and were managed by participating providers from Cardinal Health’s  Oncology Provider Extended Network (OPEN). 
A minimum of 6 months follow-up is required unless the patient died within this follow-up period. 
PopulationData from primary  populations will be analyzed  
Primary population: 
1. HER2-negative ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib 
monotherapy initiated on or after October 16, 2018 and ≥18 years of age at initiation 
of talazoparib. 
All patients in the primary population will have had a minimum of 6 months follow-up time 
after initiation of talazoparib unless the patient d ied within this follow-up period. No patients
will have participated in any breast cancer (BC) clinical trial after initiation of talazoparib, 
been treated with a PARP inhibitor as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, have unknown gBRCA1/2 status, or have been diagnosed with any other malignancy within the 5 years prior to data collection.

Variables
Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, patterns of treatment with talazoparib and 
therapy administered prior to and following talazoparib, and clinical outcomes will be collected and analyzed  for primary and  cohort . 
Data sourcesThe patient’s treating physician will abstract data from the patient’s electronic health record 
(EHR) into the data capture forms. All study data are secondary. Providers will be trained on data collection to ensure accuracy and reliability. No protected health information (PHI), except for dates of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, will be collected. The patient’s EHR data will not be shared directly with Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions (CHSS) or Pfizer. 
Study sizeThe total targeted sample sizes for the  primary and  population  are as 
follows: 
Primary population: 
1. Approximately 110 HER2-negative ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated 
with talazoparib.

Page 14 of 39Data analysis
Primary  cohorts will be delineated and analyzed  
 Descriptive analyses will be conducted on patient 
demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and history, biomarker status (e.g., mutation of  BRCA1 or BRCA2), and clinical outcomes. For  rwPFS, and all other time-to-event endpoint analyses, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method will be used, accounting for right-censoring. To assess differences in the odds of disease response, logistic regression may be used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and associated P-values  
 Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression 
will be applied for time-to-event data analysis. If post-hoc analyses are performed, the log-rank test may be used to assess a difference in median time-to-event data among subgroups for the primary analysis cohort.  
 
The comparison of means (medians where appropriate) and proportions 
across cohorts will be performed using t-tests (Wilcoxon where appropriate) and chi-square 
tests (Fisher exact where cell size is fewer than 5 patients). The numbers of missing and unknown observations will be described for both categorical and continuous variables. No data imputation will be conducted. Patients with missing/unknown data will be reported as such. 
If sample size allows, clinical outcomes will also be reported for analytic subgroups of interest 
 for the primary population  
 Subgroups may include the following, to be determined once data collection is 
complete: hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative patients and patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC),

Page 17 of 397. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Breast cancer (BC) represents a major public health problem, with 284,200 new cases and 
44,130 deaths estimated in the United States (US) during 2021.1Prognosis with metastatic BC 
is poor, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of approximately 28.1%.2Although the advent 
of novel therapeutic interventions such as immunotherapy and targeted agents have brought major strides in the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC, including locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer), patients may continue to experience minimal or short-lived responses to these agents.
2As such, the development and characterization of effective interventions are 
greatly needed in order to ensure patient-specific, appropriate, and tolerable treatment that achieves meaningful improvement in survival and quality of life. By increasing understanding of the true efficacy, safety, effectiveness, and treatment patterns of ABC-focused regimens in a broad, real-world (RW) patient population, RW studies can add tremendous value to this process.
3
BC is classified into 4 main disease subtypes based on hormone receptor (HR) status (i.e., estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone recepto r [PgR]) and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) expression, including HR-positive/HER2-negative (luminal A), HR-negative/HER2-negative (triple-negative br east cancer [TNBC]), HR-positive/HER2-positive 
(luminal B), and HR-negative/HER2-positive (HER2-enriched).
4Each subtype is associated 
with distinct disease features as well as treatment recommendations.4,5Treatment strategy may 
also be driven by mutation status of certain genes, including the BC susceptibility gene 1 or 2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2), in which mutations may render cells deficient in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, thereby increasing reliance on poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent, single-strand break repair mechanisms.
5-8Germline BRCA1 
or BRCA2 (gBRCA1/2) mutations account for approximately 5% of all BC cases, with prevalence of these mutations higher among those with HER2-negative disease.
9-11
Talazoparib (TALZENNA®), which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) on October 16, 2018, is an orally available PARP inhibitor indicated for treatment of adult patients with HER2-negative ABC having gBRCA1/2 mutations.
12This approval was 
based on the Phase 3 EMBRACA trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), which demonstrated that, in comparison to single-agent chemotherapy of the physician’s choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine), talazoparib improved median progression-free survival (PFS) by approximately 3 months in adult patients diagnosed with HER2-negative ABC with gBRCA1/2 mutations (8.6 months vs 5.6 months [hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.71; P<0.001).
13,14Additionally, the objective 
response rate (ORR) was 62.6% in the talazoparib arm versus 27.2% in the chemotherapy arm (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.8; P<0.001).
13,14Grade 3-4 hematologic adverse events 
(AEs) occurred in 55% of talazoparib-treated patients (primarily anemia) versus in 38% of chemotherapy-treated patients, whereas nonhematologic Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 32% and 38% of patients, respectively.
13
To date, there is no published information related to the characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of talazoparib-treated patients in the RW US setting.

9. RESEARCH METHODS 
9.1. Study designTo achieve the research objectives described above, retrospective, multi-site, medical chart 
review will be conducted of study-eligible, talazoparib-treated ABC patients at community oncology clinics in the US. Providers in the OPEN who have previously indicated treating patients meeting the study selection criteria will be recruited and invited to participate (see 
Section 8.2. for further details) in the patient identification and data abstraction. Additional 
providers in OPEN may be recruited to aid in patient recruitment. All study data are secondary and will have been collected retrospectively from existing clinical data originally collected as part of routine care.
Patient eligibility will be confirmed by the treating physician. Providers will abstract de-
identified patient-level data necessary to achieve the research objectives into an eCRF. No protected health information (PHI), except for dates of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, CCI

Page 20 of 39will be collected. The patient’s electronic health record (EHR) data will not be shared directly 
with Cardinal Health or Pfizer.
Data related to RW patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes among 
talazoparib-treated patients will be captured and reported separately for the following 3 distinct cohorts of patients (cohorts will never be combined during analysis): 
One primary population:  
!HER2-negative ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib 
monotherapy initiated on or after October 16, 2018 and ≥18 years of age at initiation 
of talazoparib. 
 
 
 
 
 
If sample size allows, clinical outcomes will also be reported for post-hoc analytic subgroups 
of interest  for the primary population  
 Subgroups may include the following, to be determined once data 
collection is complete: patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative BC and patients with TNBC, 
   
 
  
 
For all study-eligible patients, talazoparib treatment for ABC will have been initiated on or 
after October 16, 2018 and a minimum of 6 months follow-up is required unless the patient died within this follow-up period. Data collection is scheduled to begin in August 2021 and end in September 2021. The pre-index period will be variable and will encompass events and data occurring prior to the initiation of talazoparib treatment (e.g., initial breast cancer diagnosis, initial diagnosis of ABC, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy). Index date is defined as the date of initiation of talazoparib. The index period is defined as the period of time spanning the initiation of talazoparib on or after October 16, 2018 and the date of last follow-up. A minimum of 6 months follow-up after initiation of talazoparib is required for all patients, with the exception of patients who died within the follow-up period. The exact length of follow-up will be variable between patients ( Figure 1 ).CCI

9.1.1. Other Aspects of Study Design
Although data on AEs will not be collected in the CRF, all clinicians who participate in this 
research will be required to complete Pfizer training related to the identification and reporting 
of AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs). AE/SAE training materials will be provided to the 
participating clinicians prior to any data collection. Providers will complete the AE/SAE 
training and electronically sign the certificate.
9.2.
Setting
Providers who participated in the prior related feasibility  survey s and short chart review stud y 
and who reported having treated potentially  eligible patients will beinvited to participate in 
this study .These providers volunteered to participate in the feasibility  survey s and/or short 
chart review after receiving invitations to participate that were sent out to a subset 
(approximately  800) of CHSS’ OPEN providers. Additional physicians from the OPEN may 
also be recruited to achieve the targeted patient numbers. Recruited providers who volunteer 
to part icipate in this study  will identify  patients meeting the study  selection criteria through a 
series of screener questions. Additionally , these physicians will provide an estimate of their 
total eligible patient population.
As of 2020, the OPEN community  comprised more than 7,000 unique providers in oncology , 
hematology , and urology  across the USwho had participated in Cardinal Health internal 
market research, educational summits, industry -sponsored research, or whose practi ces had

Page 22of 39used the Cardinal Health proprietary  point -of-care claims remittance software over the past 7 
years. Of the providers, approximately  800 composed the RW research community , and 300 
unique investigators have contributed patient -level data to retrosp ective chart abstraction 
research since 2016. OPEN is group purchasing organization (GPO) -and EHR -software 
agnostic. Providers are predominantly  in community  practices (>75%), ranging in size from 
solo practitioners to hospital sy stems, and participate i n centralized institutional board review 
(IRB) approval. Because OPEN is a provider -level (as opposed to site-based) community, 
CHSS can obtain large, representative samples of patients and collect detailed clinical data 
from their treating providers. Due to the purposive sampling that selects physicians and 
patients based on pre-specified selection criteria, however, this study  may not be representative 
of all ABC patients treated with talazoparib or of all providers treating these types of patients. 
To be eligible for participation in this research study , a board -certified hematologist/oncologist
must have treated or be treating at least 1 ABC patient meeting the eligibility  criteria for the 
study , agree to participate in a study sponsored b y Pfizer, and agree to complete and adhere to 
the Pfizer AE/SAE reporting protocols. Providers must also be able to participate in research 
monitored by a central IRB. No site-specific IRB approval will be sought, and providers 
requiring this approval will not be eligib le. 
After IRB approval of the research protocol, the eCRF will be pre-tested with 2 providers. Data 
collected as part of the pre -test will not be used in the final analy tic dataset. After testing and 
revisions (if necessary ), providers from OPEN will be contacted and asked to participate in the 
research. Data collection will be conducted over the course of 4 weeks. Providers will submit 
a maximum of 10 eCRFs each (the maximum number of eCRFs per provider may be increased, 
if necessary , to achieve target patient numbers following pre-approval from Pfizer). Physicians 
will be asked to identify  all eligible patients, report the total number of eligible patients, and 
chronologicall y select consec utive eligible patients, starting with the earliest eligible.
9.2.1. Inclusion criteria

Page 26 of 399.4. Data sources 
Data will be abstracted and entered into the eCRFs by patients’ treating physicians within the 
OPEN. The source documents are the patient chart/medical record data housed within the EHRs and accessed by the participating providers. Data abstracted into the eCRFs must match those charts. To adhere to Pfizer’s requirements for non-interventional studies (NIS) collecting data for patients treated with a Pfizer product, all providers who wish to participate will complete the required Pfizer pharmacovigilance (PV) training for reporting of AEs.
Through the chart review approach, data elements contained in unstructured fields of the EHR
(e.g., clinical progress notes, radiographic scans/reports, pathology reports) or those elements requiring a provider’s interpretation (e.g., date of progression) can be collected. The eCRF is a custom data abstraction tool allowing the provider chart abstractor to input de-identified data directly from the patient EHR into a secure, web-based platform. The data elements that can be collected are limited by the length of time required for the participating provider to conduct the data abstraction, which may vary depending upon the complexity of data elements required 
and the patient’s health record. Based on the study objectives, a preliminary outline of key variables and datapoints to be abstracted into the eCRF by participating physicians is included in Section 9.3 above. 
No source document verification can be condu cted by CHSS; however, data quality control 
(QC), quality assurance (QA), and validation processes will be performed as described. These processes and systems are vetted during field testing with volunteer physicians, as described inSection 9.8.
9.5. Study size
As there are no a priori hypotheses specified, sample size calculations are not applicable, and 
power calculations were not performed. To  estimate the numbers of potentially available 
eCRFs, an initial feasibility survey and subsequent , in-depth feasibility/short CRF study were 
conducted that identified the numbers of HER2-negative or HER2-positive ABC patients with 
gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib since 2018 by providers in the Cardinal Health OPEN. In the short CRF study, providers were required to confirm whether germline mutations were detected in BRCA1, BRCA2, or  both, as well as the sample type used to detect gBRCA 
mutation(s). Participating physicians were also required to provide other basic demographic, clinical, and treatment descriptors of patients. 
 
 For the main analysis aimed to address the primary objectives of 
this study, sample size will be approximately 110 patients.

Page 27of 399.6.Data management 
Patient- level data are entered b y the treating provider into the eCRF, a custom data abstraction 
tool for capturing deidentified patient-level data directl y into a secure, web-based survey 
platform (Qualtrics). The eCRF structure and format are designed to allow providers to 
efficientl y move through the EHR while documenting the patient journey  throughout the 
course of disease. The eCRF conforms to the rules and regulations of the Health Insurance 
Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) of 1996 governing the abstraction and storage of 
PHI. Limited and necessary  to achieve study  objectives PHI (e.g., start and end of treatment 
dates, date of death) will be collected in the course of the chart review or stored in the eCRF.
The CHSS research team is responsible for the programming, testing, and hosting of data from 
submitted eCRFs, and all data are stored on encry pted, password -protecte d, and HIPAA -
compliant servers housed within the Cardinal Health electronic data storage infrastructure.
Participating ph ysicians will be asked to complete the chart review individually , meaning that 
site research staff or support staff will not complete any data abstraction. Physicians are 
instructed to consult all available sources and indicate whether data points have been 
substantiated by source materials in the EHR. The study  variables that can be collected are 
limited to those that can be captured wit hin the allotted 45 to 60 minutes.
Following protocol finalization, a text version of the CRF will be created, and once finalized, 
an eCRF will be programmed in Qualtrics. Variables are captured in numeric and text format, 
as appropriate, and grouped accor ding to the study objectives as described in the protocol. The 
Qualtrics interface used for data entry  and management provides screens for data entry  and 
includes study -specific programming checks to help control for data quality , consistency , and 
validity . No source document verification can be conducted by Cardinal Health; however, data 
QC, QA, and validation processes will be performed as described. The raw data entered into 
Qualtrics will be vetted through QA, QC, and validation procedures as described inSection 
9.8, and a CHSS analy st will export them into SAS v9.4 for data transformation and anal ysis, 
which will be used for all manipulations of data. Pfizer will not have access to the individual 
data collected.
9.6.1. Case report f orms (CRFs) /Electronic data r ecord
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . 
A CRF is required and sh ould be completed for each included patient. The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property  of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  authorities, 
without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator shall ensure that the CRFs are 
securel y stored at the study  site in encry pted electronic form and will be password -protected 
to prevent access b
y unauthorized third parties.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source

Page 28 of 39documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.
The source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart. In these cases, data collected 
on the CRFs must match those charts.
9.6.2. Record retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to local regulations or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for so long as they are retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period, (e.g., retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.
Study records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of 
the study unless CHSS and Pfizer have expressly agreed to a different period of retention via a separate written agreement. Record must be retained for longer than 15 years or as required by applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even 
if retention requirements have been met.
9.7. Data analysis

be documented in the SAP, which will be dated, filed, and maintained by the sponsor. Due to the descriptive nature of this retrospective,  observational study, no hypotheses have been 
specified a priori and no formal hypothesis testing will be performed. 
Descriptive analyses will be conducted on variables related to provider characteristics, patient
demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and history, biomarker status, and clinical outcomes. For  rwPFS, and all other time-to-event endpoint analyses, the Kaplan-

Page 29 of 39Meier (KM) method will be used, accounting for right-censoring. To assess differences in the 
odds of disease response, logistic regression may be used to calculate the OR and associated P-values  
 If 
post-hoc analyses are performed, the log-rank test may be used to assess a difference in median time-to-event data among subgroups for the primary analysis cohort.  
 
The comparison of means (medians 
where appropriate) and proportions across cohorts will be performed using t-tests (Wilcoxon where appropriate) and chi-square tests (Fisher exact where cell size is fewer than 5 patients). The numbers of missing and unknown observations will be described for both categorical and continuous variables. No data imputation will be conducted. Patients with missing/unknown data will be reported as such. Primary  cohorts will be delineated and analyzed 
 as follows  The primary 
analysis cohort will consist of adult HER2- negative ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations 
treated with talazoparib monotherapy in a RW practice setting in the US.  
 
If sample size allows, clinical outcomes will also be reported for post-hoc analytic subgroups 
of interest only for the primary population  
 Subgroups may include the following and will be determined once 
data collection is complete: patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative BC and patients with TNBC,  
 
 
 
 
Post-hoc statistical comparisons between subgroups of interest in the primary analysis cohort 
may be performed if sample size allows, using chi-square tests and t-tests or their non-parametric equivalents. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS v9.4. All tests will be 2-tailed, and the level 
of significance will be set at α=0.05. Statistical tests will only be conducted if the sample size 
is adequate for comparisons. 
9.7.2. Analysis of baseline characteristics in the primary analysis population

All categorical and continuous non–time-to-event variables collected for the primary analysis 
population of adult HER2-negative ABC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations treated with talazoparib monotherapy in a RW practice setting in the US will be analyzed using descriptive 
statistical techniques. For continuous/numeric variables, the mean, STD, median, interquartile range (IQR), and minimum/maximum values will be calculated. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be provided. 
All time-to-event endpoints will be estimated using univariate analysis and KM methods, as 
appropriate. KM survival curves, KM survival proportions at specified intervals, the number of events, and the number of patients censored will be provided. KM-estimated median values, first and third quartiles, and 95% CIs around each point estimate will be reported when estimable. 
If post-hoc analyses are performed, the log-rank test may be used to assess a difference in 
median time-to-event data among subgroups for the primary analysis cohort. To assess whether differences exist in the odds of disease response to treatment, the OR and associated P-valuesmay be calculated,  
 
Analytic study endpoints for the primary analysis population will include (but are not limited 
to) the following:
!TTF – time from initiation of talazoparib to discontinuation for any reason, including 
disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death
oPatients still on therapy at last encounter  will be censored at last encounter date
!rwPFS – time from initiation of talazoparib to disease progression based on

9.8. Quality control
CHSS will be responsible for the programming, testing, and hosting of data from submitted 
CRFs. Testing includes ensuring functionality across web-based user environments, looping logic to ensure proper alignment of data-related fields (required responses to certain fields prior to entering data into subsequent field), and other programmatic checks to reduce input of erroneous data (such as specifying maximums for year of birth or initiation of index treatment within the dates of the enrollment period). 
In addition, the eCRF will be field-tested with 2 providers to ensure its functionality, the correct 
interpretation of the questions in relation to the data points of interest, and the proper length of time for completion of data abstraction on a single patient. The pre-test results will be reviewed by CHSS with Pfizer. No data from the pre-tes ting phase will be used in the current study. 
Additionally, prior to data collection (during the field test and actual study launch), CHSS will complete the previously described user acceptance testing (UAT), inputting various clinical scenarios and identifying function edit checks and checks that are required to be made manually post-data collection. Results of the UAT will be included in the data QC log. Any 
changes made to the CRF document as a result of the pre-test will require the resubmission of 
the CRF and study protocol to the IRB.
Participating providers are informed in their contractual agreement that follow-up with CHSS 
may be required and are contacted for query reso lution and/or data validation as needed. For 
medical queries and random data validation, providers will be asked to create a 4-digit unique identifier for each patient, which will be transmitted to Cardinal Health and used for identifying the patient record for data validation. Data will be reviewed by a licensed healthcare professional (HCP) employee of Cardinal Health to identify medical queries. Data will be further reviewed by an analyst and scientist to check for face validity of aggregate results (e.g., statistical outliers; eCRF completion in an unexpectedly short time; treatment regimens unknown to be used for the disease under study; individual provider responses compared with aggregate responses; laboratory, pathology, and radiology results inconsistent with known clinical parameters; other clinical data inconsistent with known standards and outcomes; and distribution and content of key variables needed for analysis). Issues flagged for potential data validation will be resolved with the providers directly on a case-by-case basis. Any eCRF CCI

Individual eCRFs that cannot be validated will beremoved from the dataset , and the respective
provider will not be compensated for theeCRF that isremoved.
Random data validation occur sby selecting a random eCRF from each provider submitting a 
patient. Providers subjected to random validation areasked to complete a 3data point -
validation exercise for the patient, whereb y the provider isgiven the unique patient identifier 
but no other information. The provider isthen asked to re -enter the data elements. The 3data 
points may include: month/y ear of treatment initiation, stage at diagnosis, and date of treatment 
discontinuation (or date of last treatment/pre scription if patient is still on therapy ). Providers 
who had been previously  verified by CHSS willnot be subject to random validation. A verified 
provider isany physician abstractor who has completed at least 2of the following: (1) 
completed and acknowl edged CHSS web-based chart data abstraction training in the past 2 
years, (2) participated in a chart review pre-test with screen sharing, (3) participated in two 
previous chart review studies in the past 2 years and accuratel y validated data, and (4) 
completed a phone interview with the CHSS team for data validation. Despite a provider 
having been verified, however, he or she willstill be required to answer questions regarding 
patients with data flagged by the research operations or research analytics teams. A provider 
who fails to validate all data points for a selected patient will be required to submit to further 
clinical data review. No resampling to replace an y excluded eCRF will be conducted. 
After completion of QC/QA reviews and for all completed e CRFs, the study  database will be
locked, and all data will bedownloaded and stored on a secured server housed within the 
Cardinal Health Information Technology  infrastructure. Analy ses for all research objectives 
will beperformed at that time.
9.9.Strengths and limitations of the research methods
9.9.1. Strengths
The extensive CHSS network of oncologists/hematologists is geographicall y diverse, 
EHR/GPO -agnostic, and inclusive of multiple settings of community  oncology  care, thus 
making the survey  results representat ive of the US oncology  provider pool and patient 
population. Retrospective medical chart review provides in-depth knowledge of biomarker 
testing, diagnostic testing, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and rationale for treatment 
decisions using an effi cient, reliable, and verifiable method. Chart review studies are therefore 
well suited for oncology  as these clinical parameters are important to assess the patient journey , 
especiall y with the current focus on targeted, precision, and personalized medicin e. Further, 
data are abstracted b y providers for patients under their care, ensuring high data qualit y as the 
abstractor does not have to make assumption
sabout data elements. The majority of ph ysicians 
invited to participate in this study  have undergone various training sessions with CHSS staff 
related to abstraction of data from patients’ medical charts 
and completion of eCRFs and are 
well versed with the chart abstraction process. Finally , many of the data elements of interest, 
including biomarker result s, are often not available in structured or unstructured EHR fields , 
and physician -abstracted chart review allows for collection of these difficult -to-retrieve 
patient -level data elements.

Page 34 of 399.9.2. Limitations
As is a limitation of any observational research study, not all patient characteristics will be 
included in the data collection (e.g., income and other variables that may influence physician prescribing behavior or treatment decisions), thereby allowing for potential unmeasured and residual confounding that cannot be accounted for in descriptive, univariate, multivariate, or subgroup analyses. 
CHSS does not, and cannot, conduct source document verification. CHSS requires that all 
physicians submit to at least 1 random data validation check during the study whereby they are asked to re-enter 3 data points regarding a patient. Physicians failing to correctly re-enter data are subject to further review, and at the discretion of CHSS, may have all patient records submitted removed from the analytic dataset.
This study employs purposive sampling that selects physicians and patients based on pre-
specified selection criteria and hence, this may not be representative of all patients within the 
cohorts of interest or representative of all physicians treating these patients. Physicians invited to participate in this study will represent a subset of OPEN physicians. Importantly, treatment patterns reflected in the study will represent only the practices of physicians who have volunteered to participate, and may vary from non-responding physicians (i.e., those who refused study participation or who did not respond to the screening invitation). No data will be available to describe non-participating providers or non-selected patients. CHSS cannot verify that all patients who meet the study eligibility criteria are included in the final dataset, and participating providers will initially be limited to submitting a maximum of 10 eCRFs in an aim to minimize provider bias (this maximum number of eCRFs may be increased if necessary, to aid in recruitment following prior approval from Pfizer). However, based on estimates of eligible patients reported by physicians who participated in the short chart review study, we expect the majority of providers to manage 10 or fewer eligible patients. Although bias related 
to selection of patient subsets within practices may occur, physicians will be instructed to 
identify all eligible patients and to select patients chronologically starting with eligible patients who initiated talazoparib the earliest within the study index period.
Additionally, this study may be subject to bias due to missing data. Although physicians will 
be required to record all relevant patient experiences in the medical charts, there may be undercounting of events that are unknown to them due to having occurred outside the office/clinical setting. Further, loss to follow-up may occur if patients transfer care to other providers or clinics. As such, treatments, visits, and outcomes occurring after the date of last visit may be missing. Further, this study involves retrospective extraction of data from medical records. Thus, the accuracy and completeness of the data collected are limited by the quality and nature of data available in the EHR and abstracted into the eCRF. Further, loss to follow-up may occur if patients transfer care to other providers or clinics. As such, treatments, visits, and outcomes occurring after the date of last visit may be missing. Additionally, the follow-up period may not be long enough to observe all disease progression events during therapy.

9.10. Other aspects
Not applicable.
10. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
At all times, patient PHI is kept confidential in accordance with HIPAA. The eCRF will not 
capture an y data related to the patient’s name, full date of birth, social security number , health 
insurance plan number, medical record number, or other such PHI. However, date of disease 
diagnosis, date(s) of treatment(s) administered (including dates of dose changes), date of 
development of health states of interest (e.g., disease progression), and dates of death (if 
available) will be collected. These items are considered PHI under HIPAA. At no time will 
Pfizer be provided with PHI in the form of a dataset or otherwise; all study  results will be 
reported in aggregate. Additionally , exact dates (e.g., of dose changes) will not be reported 
during analysis but will be used to calculate intervals of time between relevant anchor date and 
end dates of interest.
10.1. Patient i nformation 
All parties will comply  with all applicable laws, including laws re garding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of patient personal data. Such 
measures will include omitting patient names or other directl y identifiable data in any  reports, 
publications, or other disclosures, exc ept where required by  applicable laws. 
The personal data will be stored at the study  site inencry pted electronic form and will be
password protected to ensure that only  authorized study  staff have access. The study  site will 
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data 
can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the 
study  site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact 
occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required b y law.
To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal 
data, when study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized partie s, any 
patient names will be removed and will be replaced by  a single, specific, numerical code . All 
other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties will be identified by this 
single, patient -specific code. In case of data transfe r, Pfizer will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality  and protection of patients’ personal data consistent with the vendor contract, 
research agreement and applicable privacy  laws.
10.2. Patient c onsent
As this study  does not involve data subject to privacy  laws according to applicable legal 
requirements, obtaining informed consent from patients by  Pfizer is not required.

International Societ y for Pharmacoepidemiology  (ISPE 2008), the Strengthening the Reporting 
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology  (STROBE) guidelines, and with the ethical 
principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.
11.MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS
This study  protocol requires human review of patient -level unstructured data; unstructured data 
refer to verbatim medical data, including text-based descriptions and visual depictions of 
medical information, such asmedical records, images of physician notes, neurological scans, 
X-rays, or narrative fields in a database . The reviewer is obligated to report AE swith explicit 
attribution to any  Pfizer drug that appear in the reviewed information (defined per the patien t 
population and study  period specified in the protocol). Explicit attribution is not inferred by  a 
temporal relationship bet ween drug administration and an AEbutmust be based on a definite 
statement of causality  by a healthcare provider linking drug administration to the AE.
The requirements for reporting safet y events on the NIS adverse event monitoring (AEM) 
Report Form to Pfizer Safety are as follows:
All serious and non-serious AEs with explicit attribution to any Pfizer drug that appear 
in the reviewed information must be recorded on the eCRF and reported, within 24 
hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safety  using the NI S AEM Report Form.
Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure 
during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of 
efficacy ,and occupational exposure associated with the use of a Pfizer product must 
be reported, within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safet y using the N IS AEM Report 
Form.
For these AE swith an explicit attribution or scenarios involving exposure to a Pfizer product, 
the safet y information identified in the unstructured data reviewed is captured in the Event 
Narrative section of the report form, and constitute sall clinical information known regarding 
these AEs . No follow -up on related AEs will be conducted.

Page 37of 39All the demographic fields on the NIS AEM Report Form may  not necessarily  be completed, 
as the form designates, since not all elements will be available due to privacy  concerns with 
the use of secondary  data sources. While not all demographic fields will be completed, at the 
very least, at least one patient identifier (e.g., gender, age as captured in the narrative field of 
the form) will be reported on the NIS AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be 
considered a valid one in accordance with pharmacovigilance legislation. All identifiers will 
be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35-year-old female...” or “An elderly 
male...” Other identifiers will have been remo ved.      
Additionally , the onset/start dates and stop dates for “Illness”, “Study  Drug”, and “Drug 
Name” may be documented in month/y ear (mmm/yyyy ) format rather than identify ing the 
actual date of occurrence within the month /year of occurrence in the day/month/y ear 
(DD/MMM/YYYY) format.
All research staff members must complete the 
following Pfizer training requirements:   
“YRR Training for Vendors Working onPfizer Studies (excluding interventional 
clinical studies and non-interventional primary  data collection studies with 
sites/investigators) ”
. 
These trainings must be completed byresearch staff members prior to the start of data 
collection . All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature b y the 
trainee) as a record of completion of the training, which must be kept in a retrievable format. 
Copies of all signed training certificates must be provided to Pfizer. Re-training must be 
completed on an annual basis using the most current Your Reporting Responsibilities training  
materials.
12.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
Results from the final analy sis may be submitted in the form of peer-reviewed publications 
and/or presented as an abstract or poster at scientific conferences.
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (e.g., clinical hold) by an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the party  responsible for collecting data 
from the participant is aware of any  new information which might influence the evaluation of 
the benefits and risks of a Pfizer product, Pfizer should be informed immediately .

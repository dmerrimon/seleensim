You are being asked to take part in a research study in the Department of Psychiatry, Duke University 
Medical Center (DUMC), on the neural and behavioral effects of propranolol in adult smokers. Research 
studies are voluntary and include only people who choose to take part. Please read this consent form 
carefully and take your time making your decision. As your study doctor or study staff discusses this 
consent form with you, please ask him/her to explain any words or information that you do not clearly 
understand. We encourage you to talk with your family and friends before you decide to take part in this 
research study. The nature of the study, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other important 
information about the study are listed below.
Please tell the study doctor or study staff if you are taking part in another research study.
A grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is sponsoring this study. Portions of Dr. 
Jason Oliver’s research team salaries will be paid by this grant.
WHO WILL BE MY DOCTOR ON THIS STUDY?
If you decide to participate, Dr. Jason Oliver will be your doctor for the study and will be in contact with 
your regular health care provider throughout the time that you are in the study and afterwards, if needed. 
Dr. Rachel Dew, MD, a member of the study team, will serve as medical monitor for the study.CONCISE SUMMARY
This is a research study to determine the potential effects of propranolol, a common blood pressure 
medication, on smoking behavior. Participants will complete five visits that vary in length from 1 to 
3 hours over a period of about one month. The first visit is a screening visit and involves 
questionnaires, interviews and laboratory. At the second visit, you will practice some study tasks 
and be trained to take pictures of places you visit with a study camera. You will return the camera 
and complete some additional forms and tasks at the third visit. A medical exam will be conducted 
at one of these first three visits. If you complete them successfully, you will be scheduled for an 
MRI visit. You will be asked to abstain from smoking for 24 hours, given a single dose of 
propranolol and receive an MRI scan during which you will view and rate different pictures while 
we measure brain activity. At your last visit, you will take another dose of propranolol and complete 
a computer task during which you will have the opportunity to smoke cigarettes.
Risks for the study include the experience of nicotine withdrawal, bruising, fainting or excess 
bleeding from the blood draw, injury from the MRI if safety precautions are not followed, 
discomfort from answering certain questions, potential for loss of confidentiality and side effects of 
propranolol. A more detailed description is provided in this document.

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of propranolol on adult smokers. Propranolol is 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is a commonly prescribed beta-blocker medicine 
used to treat heart or circulatory conditions, such as high blood pressure and arrhythmia. Propranolol is 
not approved for use to help people quit smoking. In this study, this medication is being investigated to 
examine potential effects on smoking behavior. You are being asked to be in this study because you are 
an adult right-handed smoker who has no plans to quit smoking during the course of this study. The 
drugs that you will be given include propranolol and/or a placebo (a capsule that contains no active 
drug). We will measure your brain activity while you are in a MRI machine after you have taken these 
drugs. You will return back to the office on a separate day and complete some additional tasks after 
taking another dose of the medication.  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately 75 people between the ages of 18 and 55 will be recruited for this study at Duke 
University Medical Center. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form prior to any tests or 
procedures. Then, you will have the following tests and procedures to make sure that you are eligible. 
The first visit will last around 2.5-3 hours. 
General Information: We will need to know your name, age, date of birth, sex, race, address, 
medical history, phone number, and social security number. We will need your social security 
number to process your participant payment. If you choose not to provide your social security 
number, we will not be able to reimburse you for your participation.
Urine Sample Collection: The urine sample will be used to test for drugs of abuse. Some 
prescription drugs can also be detected by this urine drug screen. If you test positive for any of 
the drugs measured by the drug screen, you will not be allowed to participate in this study. 
Expired Breath Collection: Breath samples will be used to measure the CO (carbon monoxide) 
and alcohol in your exhaled breath.
Medical History: You will provide information about your medical history.
Physical Exam: Participants will undergo a full physical exam by the study physician to ensure 
safety of propranolol administration. This will include blood pressure readings and EKG. A 
blood sample will be drawn and submitted for analysis. 
Nicotine Use History: You will provide detailed information about your current and past use 
nicotine. You will also identify places where you do smoke, as well as places where you do not 
smoke.
Psychiatric Screen: You will undergo a psychiatric evaluation for symptoms for psychiatric 
disorders 
MRI Safety Questionnaire: This questionnaire will help determine it if is safe for you to enter the 
MRI scanner.
Mock scanner: You will enter a mock MRI scanner to assess if you do feel comfortable in order 
to complete a real MRI session

The results of the screening tests and procedures will be reviewed by the study staff to determine if you 
continue to qualify for this study. Portions of these exams may occur at the 2nd or 3rd visit depending on 
staff and scheduling. Your responses during some of these tests may be audio recorded. If the results of 
your tests indicate that you cannot continue in the study, your participation in the study will end. If you 
continue to qualify and you feel comfortable in continuing to participate in the study, you will then 
begin the study.
In the next part of the study, you will fill out a series of questionnaires regarding your personality, and 
behavior, and then be trained on how to take pictures using the study camera. You will complete 
practice versions of tasks you will do later. be asked to take at least 5 photographs of smoking and non-
smoking environments as identified earlier. This visit will last around 1.5 hours. At the end of this 
session, you will be scheduled to return for a camera return session.
In the camera return session, we will view the images that you had taken and decid if they are 
appropriate for the study. You will also complete a short computer task. This visit will also last about 
1.5 hours. 
The next visit will be the MRI session. You will be asked to abstain from smoking for 24 hours before 
your scheduled fMRI. You will submit a breath sample to be tested for carbon monoxide to ensure that 
you have abstained. If you do exceed the allowed amount of carbon monoxide measure, you will not be 
allowed to complete the scan. Afterwards, you will be administered either propranolol or a placebo 
medication. A placebo is an inactive substance given in the same forma sat the active drug, propranolol. 
You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either propranolol or placebo. You 
have a 1 in 2 chance of receiving study drug.  For the next 1.5 hours, you fill out questionnaires and your 
blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored. During the scan, you will be viewing images that you 
had photographed, as well as other images. This visit will last about 3 hours. 
The final visit will back in our office that will require you to be abstinent from smoking for six hours 
before your appointment time. As with the last visit, you will be asked to submit a breath sample and if 
you exceed the allowed amount of carbon monoxide, you will not be allowed to complete the visit and 
may be withdrawn from the study. In this visit you will again be administered either propranolol or 
placebo, fill out questionnaires and complete another computer task. You will view pictures of smoking 
locations and will have the opportunity to smoke cigarettes. We will video tape your smoking behavior 
during this part of the session. At the end of this session, we will discuss how much money you have 
earned for the entire study. This last visit will last about 2.5 hours. 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?
All subjects will have a total of 5 visits (1 screening visit, 1 training visit, 1 camera return session, a 
fMRI session, and laboratory session). This study can be completed within 2 – 4 weeks based on 
availability and schedule preferences.

You can choose to stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of any benefits to which you are 
entitled. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to talk to your 
doctor first.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
For Women of Childbearing Potential: 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks, some of 
which may be currently unforeseeable. Therefore, pregnant women will be excluded from the study. If 
you are a woman of childbearing potential, a blood pregnancy test will be done (using 2 teaspoons of 
blood drawn from a vein by needle-stick), and it must be negative before you can continue in this study. 
Urine pregnancy tests will also be conducted prior to receiving the study medications. These tests must 
be negative before you can continue in the study. If sexually active, you must agree to use appropriate 
contraceptive measures for the duration of the study. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) 
surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives 
(such as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or 
diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as 
Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. 
If you do become pregnant during this study or if you have unprotected sex, you must inform your study 
physician immediately. 
Risks of Blood Drawing:
Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include momentary discomfort and/or bruising.
Infection, excess bleeding, clotting or fainting are also possible, although unlikely. The total amount of 
blood drawn for the entire study will not exceed 4 teaspoons (20 ml).
Propranolol Side Effects:
The primary risk associated with this study are the side effects associated with the study medication. 
Common side effects include hypotension, bradycardia (slow heart rate), cold extremities, transient 
fatigue, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, agitation and irritability, dizziness, and Raynaud’s phenomenon 
(e.g. coldness/numbness in the fingers and toes). 
Most of the side effects are minor and resolve quickly on their own. In order to minimize risks, we do 
ask that you give your medical history and completely and accurately as possible. We will monitor these 
risks by closely monitoring you and your blood pressure and heart rate during experimental sessions. 
Effects of Nicotine Withdrawal:
You may experience the following symptoms when you abstain from smoking for the two periods (one 
for 24-hours and another for 6-hours) in the study: cravings for nicotine, anxiety, irritability, 
restlessness, mood changes, nervousness, disruptions of you sleep, drowsiness, trouble concentrating, 
increased appetite, headaches, muscular pain, constipation and fatigue. These may begin almost 
immediately after you stop smoking.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imagining (fMRI) Risks: 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnet and radio waves to make diagnostic medical images 
of the body. There have been no ill effects reported from exposure to the magnetism or radio waves used 
in this test. However, it is possible that harmful effects could be recognized in the future.
A known risk is that the magnet could attract certain kinds of metal. Therefore, we will carefully ask you 
about metal within your body (this includes certain dyes found in tattoos). If you have metal within your 
body, tell us immediately, since it will be dangerous for you to be in an MRI machine. If there is any 
question about potentially hazardous metal within your body, you will be excluded from participating in 
this research study. We will also keep the MRI locked so that no one carrying metal objects can enter 
while you are in the scanner.
The study involves entering a large room in which a magnet is present. You will be placed on a narrow 
bed and then slid into a small tunnel approximately 6 feet in length and 25 inches in diameter. You will 
be asked to lie still for about one hour on this bed and will hear loud noises during this time. Some 
people who are claustrophobic (afraid of being in cramped places like closets or crowded elevators) may 
experience extreme anxiety when placed in a MRI machine. You may be asked to have a harmless 
monitoring device applied during the study. During the study, you will have voice contact with the 
technician in between scans. 
There may be risks, discomforts, drug interactions or side effects that are not yet known. 
Psychiatric Assessment Risks:
This is a research study that involves questions that ask about your mental state which may cause discomfort. 
As researchers, we do not provide mental health services. It is possible that we will not view your responses 
for several days, weeks, or months after you complete the surveys. Therefore, we will not know of any 
immediate risks that you may have for harming yourself or others, including suicidality. Should you decide 
you need assistance at any time while enrolled in this study, please contact the study doctor (919-681-0031) 
or principal investigator (919-668-0093) for clinic referrals, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-
800-273-8255).
Confidentiality:
The information obtained as a result of your participation in this research will not be included in your 
medical record by research staff. Information from which you may be personally identified will be 
maintained in a confidential, locked file at DUMC or on a secured department server accessible only to 
the study. Information will not be disclosed to third parties except with your permission or as may be 
required by law. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep 
your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. Some of the questions we will ask 
you as part of this study may make you feel uncomfortable. You may refuse to answer any of the 
questions and you may take a break at any time during the study. You may stop your participation in this 
study at any time.

There may be risks, discomforts, drug interactions or side effects that are not yet known. Your risk of 
being harmed by participating in this study may increase if you do not give your health history as 
accurately and as completely as you can.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued a Certificate of Confidentiality to 
further protect your privacy.  With this Certificate, the investigators may not disclose research 
information that may identify you in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, 
legislative, or other proceedings, unless you have consented for this use. Research information protected 
by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research unless:  
1) there is a law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable 
diseases but not for legal proceedings); 
2) you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or 
3) the research information is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal 
regulations protecting research subjects. 
Disclosure is required, however, for audit or program evaluation requested by the agency that is funding 
this project or for information that is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 
You should understand that a Confidentiality Certificate does not prevent you or a member of your 
family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If you 
want your research information released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person not 
connected with the research, you must provide consent to allow the researchers to release it. This means 
that you and your family must also actively protect your own privacy.
Finally, you should understand that the investigator is not prevented from taking steps, including 
reporting to authorities, to prevent serious harm to yourself or others.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

state regulations. Reviewers may include from the National Institutes of Health, the Duke University 
Health System Institutional Review Board, and others as appropriate. If any of these groups review your 
research record, they may also need to review your entire medical record.
The study results will be retained in your research record for at least six years after the study is 
completed. At that time either the research information not already in your medical record may be 
destroyed or information identifying you will be removed from such study results at DUHS.  Any 
research information in your medical record will be kept indefinitely.
This information may be further disclosed by the sponsor of this study.  If disclosed by the sponsor, the 
information is no longer covered by federal privacy regulations. If this information is disclosed to 
outside reviewers for audit purposes, it may be further disclosed by them and may not be covered by 
federal privacy regulations.
While the information and data resulting from this study may be presented at scientific meetings or 
published in a scientific journal, your name or other personal information will not be revealed.
Some people or groups who receive your health information might not have to follow the same privacy 
rules. Once your information is shared outside of DUHS, we cannot guarantee that it will remain private. 
If you decide to share private information with anyone not involved in the study, the federal law 
designed to protect your health information privacy may no longer apply to the information you have 
shared.  Other laws may or may not protect sharing of private health information.
All of the laboratory tests and questionnaires are being given only because you are in this study. The 
study results will not be given to you to send or be sent to your physician to include in your medical 
record. Any significant new findings found out during this research, which may change your willingness 
to continue to be in the research, will be given to you.
There are certain situations in which confidentiality may be broken. Possible legal exceptions to 
confidentiality may occur if necessary to protect yourself or others from abuse or neglect, or in cases of 
potential harm to oneself or others. In such cases, confidentiality would only be broken in order to 
protect you or others from significant harm or death.
WHAT ARE THE COSTS?
There will be no additional costs to you as a result of being in this study. We do provide hospital parking 
passes if you choose to drive to your MRI session. Visitor parking is free at our office. 
WHAT ABOUT COMPENSATION?

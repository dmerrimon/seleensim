in SRD part and MRD cohort 1;treatment -naïve wAMD for MRD 
cohort 2; patients within 3 y ears of initial wAMD diagnosis for 
MRD 
cohort 3.
Main in -and exclusion 
criteriaInclusion: SRD and MRD cohort 1: Men and women over the age of 
55 with active choroidal neovascularization ( CNV )secondary  to 
wAMD despite prior anti -VEGF therapies; for MRD cohort 1 only: 
central subfield retinal thickness (CSFT) > 300 microns.
For MRD cohort 2
: Men and women over the age of 55 with 
treatment -naïve CNV secondary  to AMD.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct20161. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of legal blindness in the elderl y 
population of the developed world. Approximately 10% of individuals aged 65 to 74 years, 
and 30% of those aged 75 to 85 y ears, show signs of AMD [ R13-
1509]. Early  stage AMD is 
associated with the accumulation of drusen and disturbances of the retinal pigment epithelium 
(RPE). Morphology , number, and location of drusen relative to macula are indicative of 
disease progression, although over 75% of patients with earl y AMD never progress to either 
of the two forms of advanced AMD over 10 y ears. 
Clinically , advanced AMD is classified into the nonexudative or atrophic form and the 
exudative “wet” or neovascular form and occurs in 15% and 10% of AMD patients 
respectivel y. Wet AMD is the more aggressive and debilitating form of AMD and is caused 
by the growth of abnormal choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV). New vessels sprout 
from the choriocapillaris, grow under the RPE or retina, and leak serum and blood. Fluid 
accumulation in the sub -RPE and subretinal spaces along with the neurosensory  retina 
usually  leads to measurable macular thickening. Involvement of the fovea by  the CNV, 
edema and hemorrhage may  profoundl y impair visual acuity (VA) and loss of vision can be 
precipitous. 
Intravitreall y administered therapies that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
have become the standard of care, and h ave led to significant improvements in lesion 
morphology , vascular leakage, and, most importantly , improvement in VA.
Despite the availabilit y of anti -VEGF therapies, AMD causes 50% of irreversible blindness 
in the developed world today . In man y patients, it is difficult to continue long term treatment 
requiring frequent visits to the retinal specialists. Intravitreal (IVT) injections also present a 
risk to patients and a burden to both patients and caregivers. First, there is the potential for 
serious side effect s associated with each IVT injection procedure, including endophthalmitis, 
retinal detachments, traumatic cataract, and increased intra -ocular pressure (IOP). Second, 
monthly  treatment and monthly  monitoring, which may  continue for a patient’s lifet ime, is a 
substantial burden to patients, ophthalmologists, and the healthcare s ystem. Extensive efforts 
have been undertaken to lower the injection frequency  of anti -VEGF agents in w et Age -
related Macular Degeneration ( wAMD) [R13-4487]. However, unmet medical need still 
exists for new therapies that allow for a reduced frequency  of IVT injections. The second 
major aspect of unmet medical need concerns further improvement in maintenance therap y 
and incremental VAgains over curr ent therapies, especiall y in patients not sufficiently  
responded to the available anti -VEGF treatments.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI 836880 is an anti -angiogenesis agent composed of VEGF - A and angiopoietin 2 (ANG 2) 
binding domains with a third domain that binds to human serum albumin for improved half -
life extension. BI 836880 is highly  potent and showed efficacy  in preclinical animal models 
for pathological retinal angiogenesis and neovascular leakage following IVT injection.
BI 836880 is selective for VEG F-A and A NG2, as the molecule does not bind to the related
growth factors VEGF- B, -C, -D, placental growth factor (PlGF) and angiopoietin1 (ANG 1).
BI836880 inhibits VEGF and Ang2- mediated intracellular signaling and functional activity .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016It was found to be cross reactive to cy nomolgus VEGF, as well as mouse, rat and cy nomolgus
ANG2 which indicates cy nomolgus monkey  as the most suitable species for pharmacological
and toxicological studies.
In rodents, BI 836880 is not binding VEGF but A NG2 only . Nevertheless, BI 836880 is
efficacious in a mouse oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) model on pathological
neoangiogenesis comparable to Ey lea™, a potent inhibitor of the VEGF pathway
[n00253677 ].In cynomolgus monkey s BI 836880 is crossreactive to VEGF and ANG 2. On 
laser induced CNV in cynomolgus monkey s, a disease model for neovascular wAMD, 
BI836880 was superior to Lucentis™ on the reduction of clinically  relevant severe lesions
[n00256189] The potential for super iorclinical efficacy  of dual VEGF and A NG 2 inhibition 
over VEGF inhibition is supported by these preclinical data.
After intravenous administration in the monkey , BI 836880 display ed dose -dependent
pharmacokinetics (PK) (higher clearance and shorter half -life at lower doses; lower clearance 
andlonger half -life at higher doses) [ n00234399] . After IVTadministration in the monkey , 
BI 836880 display ed a biphasic clearance in the vitreous humor , with a short initial half -life 
of 3 day s and a long terminal half- life of 13 day s. The long terminal half -life is likely  due to 
theformation of BI 836880 -albumin complex in the terminal phase [n00258450 ]. After IVT
coadmini stration of BI 836880 and human albumin in rabbit eyes, human albumin extended 
thehalf-life of BI 836880 by  3-fold[n00259128] . The albumin concentration in the human 
vitreous humor is significantly  higher than monkey  vitreou s humor. BI 836880 is expected to 
exist mostly  inthe BI 836880 -albumin complex form in human vitreous humor and the ocular 
half-life of BI836880 in human is predicted to be 21 day s [n00259128].

Brochure (IB) [c21397543 ]. At the time of data cut- off for the current IB (25 March 2022 ), 
the SRD part of the trial described here (1336- 0007) was completed : 15 patients had been 
treated with a single dose of intravitreal BI 836880 and followed up until the end of trial visit 
(EOT). In the ongoing MRD part, 14 patients had received at least one dose of BI 836880
(Table 1.2:
1).Six patients in the SRD part and 10 patients in the MRD part were reported 
with an adverse event (AE) after trial drug administration.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
IVTanti-VEGF injections are the current gold standard for treatment of patients with wet 
AMD. Anti-VEGF therapies are recognized to be effective and fast acting. However, the 
injection frequency  (once every  month or once every  2 months) is a burden and considered to 
be problematic for man y patients to adhere to for a long time. Furthermore, many  wet AMD 
patients do not have vision gain after anti-VEGF treatment and some continue to lose vision .
Treatment with a dual anti
-VEGF/ANG2 antibody is anticipated to have better efficacy  than
current anti -VEGF treatments and also has the potential to allow for a lower injection 
frequency .
This trial will consist of a single rising dose (SRD) part and a multiple rising dose (MRD)
partincluding MRD c ohorts 1 , 2, and 3. Since this is the F irst-in-Human (F iH)application 
with I VT route of administration, the SRD par t and the MRD c ohort 1 of this trial will 
include patients who have not sufficientl y responded to anti -VEGF treatment and still have 
active disease with significant retinal edema after a minimum of three previous injections.
After safet y has been investigated in SRD and the first 3 patients of MRD cohort 1, t he MRD 
cohort 2 will start to evaluate treatment -naïve patients. This treatment -naïve population was 
initially  thought to be the final target population, however, an explo ratory  analy sisof the 
available 
interim data (patients from SRD, MRD cohorts 1 & 2 of the current trial ) suggest s
thatBI836880 may reduc eCSFT, PED, SR HM, and/or PCV in an additional subset of
patients (seeFigure 1.3: 1). These patients included those with wAMD that wasnot 
sufficiently controlled despite receiving frequent standard of care (SoC) treatment .Therefore,
it isexpected that patients previously  receiving frequent SoC treatment every 4 - 8weeks , so 
called “frequent fly ers”(frequentl y treated patients; MRD cohort 3) willhighl y benefit from 
IVT administration of BI 836880 .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016In the SRD part of the trial, 5 rising doses are planned to be administered intravitreously . 
Safety  and tolerability  will be established unless dose -limiting safet y or tolerability  issues are 
noted.
In the MRD part,three multiple dose cohorts will be studied over a 24 week -period. After an 
initial active treatment period of 12 weeks (3 injections in 4 weekly  intervals) patient s will be 
followed up for an additional 12 weeks without further injections to study  the durability  of 
the treatment effect and to identify  the need for additional standar d treatment and the time to 
development of recurrence of any retinal fluid . This will help to guide injection frequency  
intervals in later studies.
The therapeutic benefit or specific adverse events (AE) in patients cannot alway s be 
anticipated during the trial setup. Later on
,there may  be new scientific knowledge about 
biomarkers and other factors contributing to diseases or the action of a drug. In order to be 
able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  donate 
biospecimens for banking. I f the patient agrees, banked samples may  be used for future drug 
development projects, e.g. to identify  patients that are more likel y to benefit from a treatment 
or experience an AE, and thereb y better match patients with therapies or to gain mechanistic 
understanding of drug effects and/or to identify  genetic or other factors associated with 
response to therap y or the risk of adverse drug reactions.
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSES SMENT
Based on available non -clinical data and based on clinical data from other compoun ds with a 
comparable mode of action BI 836880 is assessed to be generally  safe for IVT use in humans 
(c21397543).
This is the first study  using an IVT route of administration for this compound. However, IVT 
administration of a n antibody  that simultaneousl y binds to VEGF and ANG2 ( faricimab, 
previously  referred to as bispecific antibod y RG7716) for treatment of wAMD has previousl y 
been tested in humans in a Phase 1 clinical trial [R18-0309] , and a Phase 2 clinical trial [R21-
0692 ].In the Phase 1 trial, t he co -adminstration of RG7716 was reported to be well tolerated 
and to exhibit a favourable safet y profile overall [R18-0309]. I n addition, there was
preliminary  evidence of improvements in BCVA and anatomic parameters for this mode of

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016action. In the Phase 2 trial, faricimab maintained vision and anatomic improvements 
comparable with SoC in wAMD in treatment naïve patients, resulting in the start o f Phase 3 
trials. These data support that the combination of anti -VEGF and anti -ANG 2 can be used 
safel y in patients with wAMD.
BI recommends the use of material for intraocular drug delivery , which is according to 
standard medical practice. This material is not officially  approved for intraocular drug 
delivery , with associated potential risks. L ong-term experience as standard of medical care 
suggest s a favorable risk-benefit profile. To the best of the sponsor’s knowledge there is 
currentl y no product on t he market, which is officially  approved for intravitreal drug delivery . 
The needles for preparation of the drug and intravitreal injection are usuall y silicone oil 
coated to ease the injection of the needle through the tissue. This carries the potential r isk for 
a silicone oil transfer into the vitreous with the potential risks for occurrence of side effects 
like vitreous floaters or intraocular inflammation. The overall risk for such events is based on 
long-term experience with comparable material and is considered low. However, patients 
should be made aware of this risk, as reflected in the Informed Consent Form (I CF). To the 
best of the sponsor’s knowledge ,there is currently no product on the market, which is 
silicone -free. The recommended s yringes are silicone -oil-free and not considered to carry  this 
risk. The IMP  handling instructions do not mandate the use of materials from certain 
manufacturers and leave the decision to the treating  investigators/sites on which material to 
use if it meets the specif ications as described in the IMP handling instructions for BI 836880.
This trial will include in the SRD part and MRD cohort 1 patients with an insufficient 
response to 
the standard treatment for wAMD ( IVTanti-VEGF therap y). Therefore, although 
this is a newly  developed drug at an earl y stage of testing and an individual benefit cannot be 
guaranteed, trial treatment may  result in an individual benefit to the individual patient. In
addition, due to the long duration of the disease the patient may  directly  benefit from the drug
development based on the results of this trial.
For the MRD cohort 2, treatment- naïve patients will be included based on a positive safety  
assessment as confirmed by  the S afety Monitoring C ommittee (SMC) ,after three patients of 
MRD cohort 1 reach Visit 5, i.e. 4 weeks after the third injection. 
For MRD cohort 3, frequently  treated patients will be included (defined as patients receiving 
anti-VEGF every  4-8weeks on average). These frequently  treated patients are the intended 
final target population for BI 836880, because of the remaining unmet medical need for these 
patients to receive a higher potency  anti
-VEGF therap y. BI 836880 has shown potential 
efficacy  signals in pretreated patients in the SRD /MRD part of the study  and could therefore 
have a role in the treatment of patients needing frequent anti- VEGF therap y.
Thefollowing safet y measures have been implemen tedto mitigate the risk and ensure early 
detection of intraocular inflammation (IOI): fluorescein angiography (FA) imaging will be 
required at screening and wide- angle fundus photograph y with a vitreous haze assessment 
will be required at every  visit. Reports of I OI will be treated as an AE of special interest 
(AESI), see also Section 5.2.8.1.4.
Furthermore, although rare , a potential for drug -induced liver injury (DILI)is under constant 
surveillance b y sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this trialrequires timely detection, 
evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to 
ensure patient s´ safet y, see also Section 5.2.8.1.4, AESIs . The implications of the current 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic are summarized in Section 10.4 .

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This trial will consist of anSRD part followed b y anMRD part. Both parts of t he trial will be 
conducted non- randomized, open -label, and uncontrolled .
SRD part:
The starting dose is 0. 06mg. Dose -escalation will be restricted to a maximum of 200% from 
the previous dose 
up to doses of 0.5 mg, and to a maximum of 100% from the previous dose
from dose 0.5 mg onwards .The maximum planned dose i s 2 mg. For an y dose -escalation 
cohort, at least 3 patient s will be required. However, in the case that only  2 patient s are 
evaluable and neither has experienced a DL Ewithin the evaluation period ( 7days after drug 
administration), then dose- escalation might occur based on these 2 patients if a joint decision 
of the Safet y Monitoring Committee (SMC) , see Section 8.7 is reached. Refer to Figure 3.1: 1
for a schematic representation of the dose escalation. For each dose group a single patient 
will be dosed on day  1 in each cohort, and onl y after a favorable safety and tolerability 
assessment on day  4the remaining 2 patients will be dosed .A Bayesian logistic regression 
model (BLRM) , based on a weakl y inform ative prior distribution, and employ ing the 
escalation with overdos e control (EWOC) principle (see Section 7 ) will be used for guiding 
the dose escalation [R13-4803]. Cohorts of patient s will receive escalating doses of 
BI836880 .Each cohort will consist of newly  enrolled patient s. 
The BLRM provides estimates forthe probability  of observing a nocular DLE for each dose 
level in the study  as patient information becomes available. The correspondi ng methodology  
is described in Section 7.1 and in Appendix 10.3. At any  time in the trial, it will not be 
permitted to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the EWOC principle. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is considered as reached if at least 6 patients have been 
evaluated at a dose level which is the model’s recommendation for the next dose cohort. Note 
the MTD will likely  be the highest feasible dose, 2 mg, rather than the highest tolerable dose 
in a strict sense.

TheSMCrecom mends the size for the next dose escalation cohort. After all patient sin a 
cohort have either experienced a n ocular DLEor have been observed for at least the 7 days 
evaluation period without experiencing a DLE, the Bay esian model will be updated with the 
newly  accumulated data. The overdose risk will then be calculated for each dose, and 
escalation will be permitted to all planned doses which fulfil the EWOC criterion and the 
respective escalation rule. As a sensitivity  anal ysis, the BLRM might also be run again 
shortly  before the SMC meeting, using all data available up to this time point. Based on the 
model results and on additional information (PK, pharmacod ynamics [ PD], patient profiles), 
the members of the SMC will reach a joint decision on the next dose level to be investigated.
If DL Es are observed in the first two consecutive patient s of a previousl y untest ed dose level, 
subsequent enrol ment to that cohort will be stopped. The BLRM will be re-run to confirm 
that the dose level still fulfils the EWOC principle . Based on this information, the SMC will 
evaluate whether the n ext patient swill be enrolled at the same dos e level , or if they  will be 
enrolled at a lower dose level.
The SMC may decide on stopping the dose escalation after the above criterion for MTD is 
fulfilled.
Further patient s may  be included to confirm that the EWOC criterion is still 
fulfilled . 
MRD part :
The MRD part will consist of a first part (1 mg) with 11treatment -resistant patients
(cohort 1),a second part (2 mg) with 4treatment -naïve patients (cohort 2) ,and approximately
12frequent ly treated patients (cohort 3; inclusion criteria defined in Section 3.3.2). These are 
thetwo highest doses established by the SMC as safe and tolerable during the SRD part.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This trial is designed to establ ish a safe and effective dose for further testing in phase II trials. 
The trial consists of separate SRD and MRD parts. This trial will not use a placebo 
comparison because inclusion of a placebo arm would withhold patients with wAMD from an 
effective trea tment for several weeks. The objectives to establish a safe and effec tive dose 
can be met without a placebo comparison.
The SRD dose escalation part is included and designed to avoid exposure of too many  
patients to subtherapeutic doses while on the other hand the goal of safet y and rapid dose 
finding is preserved. 
This part of the trial will already  be done in patients because IVT
injections in healthy  subjects would not be c onsidered appropriate. Dose escalation and 
cohort size will be decided by the 
SMC , guided b y a BLRM with overdose control. 
An EWOC design will increase the chance of treating patients at efficacious doses while

advocated b y the European Medicines Agency  (EMA )guideline on small populations 
[R07-4856] and by  the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) [R13-4881 ].
It is expected that, i n thestudy  population of patients not sufficiently  responding to anti -
VEGF treatment, a reduction of fluid in the retina should be observed onl y after multiple 
treatments. Therefore, two MRD cohorts (3 injections in a monthly  interva l)will be included 
after the SRD part. This part of the trial will generat e additional safet y data after multiple 
dosing and allow for exploration of the time course and durabilit y of treatment effects. These 
data will further support the definition of th e injection frequency  and intervals in later studies.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
This trial will recruit up to 18 patients in the SRD part ( the SRD part was completed with 
15patients) and up to 27 patients in the MRD part (cohort 1, 2 and 3 ). Please refer to 
Section 7.7for details and justification.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trialwill stop at all 
sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patient s has been sc reened. Investigators 
will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional 
patient s for this trial .
A log of all subject s enrolled into the 
trial(i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File ( ISF) at the investigational site irrespective of 
whether they  have been treated with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry

3.3.4 Withdrawal of patient s from therapy or assessments
Subjec ts may potentiall ybe withdrawn from trial treatment or from the trial as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very  different i mplications, please see Section 3.3.4.1 and 
Section 3.3.4.2 below.
Every effort should be made to keep the subject s in the trial :if possible ontreatment , or at 
least to collect important trialdata.
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trialrequirements and procedures prior to first administration of trial 
medication ,as well as the explanation of the consequences of withdrawal. 
The decision to withdraw from trial treatment or from the whole trial as well as the reason
must be documented in the patient files and Case Report Form ( CRF ).
3.3.4.1 Withdrawal from trial treatment
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from trialtreatment if:
The patient wants to withdraw from trialtreatment , without the need to justify  the 
decision.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational 
product or other trial medication .
The patient can no longer be treated with trialmedication for other medical reason s 
(such as surgery , AEs , other diseases, or pregnancy ) .
The patient has repeatedly  shown to be non -compliant with important trialprocedures 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative , is not willing 
or able to stick to the trialrequirements in the future.
Given the patient ’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuation and follow up as outlined in the Flow Chart I , Flow Chart II ,Flow Chart III , 
Flow Chart IV , andSection 6.2 .
For all patient sthe reason for withdrawal from trial treatment (e.g. AEs) must be recorded in 
the CRF .These data will be included in the trialdatabase and reported.

Patient smay withdraw their consent for trial participation at any  time without the need to 
justify  the decision.
This will however mean that no further information may  be collected for the purpose of the 
trial and negative implications for the scientific value may be the consequence. Furthermore,
it may  mean that further patient follow up on safety cannot occur.
If a patient wants to withdraw cons ent,the investigator should explain the difference between 
treatment withdrawal and w ithdrawal of consent for trial participation and explain the options 
for continued follow up after withdrawal from trial treatmen t, please see S ection 3.3.4.1
above .
3.3.4.3 Discontinuation of the trialby the s ponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) reserves the right to discontinue the trialoverall or at a particular 
trialsite at an y time for the following reasons:
1. Fai lure to meet expected enrolment goals overal l or at a particular trialsite.
2. Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating the earlier positive 
benefit -
risk-assessment that could significantly  affect the continuation of the trial.
3. Violation of Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), the trial protocol , or the contract 
impairing the a ppropriate conduct of the trial.
The investigator / the trialsite will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trialtermination (except in case of the third reason).
3.3.5 Replacement of patients
SRD part:
Patients withdrawn before visit 4 for a reason other than aDLE or patients who miss any  visit 
out of V isits 2 to 4are not evaluable for the occurrence of a DLE within 7days after drug 
administration. These patients will be replaced if not decided otherwise by  the SMC ( in the 
scenario that there are already  2 DLE evaluable patients in the current dose group; see 
Section 3.1 ).Patients who come off stud y due to a DL E will not be replaced.
MRD part:
In case some s ubjects do not complete the trial according to the protocol , the trial clinical 
monitor together with the trial pharmacokineticist and the trial statistician are to decide if and 
how many  subjects will be replaced. 
A replacement subject will be assigned aunique study  subject number and will be assigned to 
the same treatment as the subject he or she replaces.

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial
Dose selection was driven by  the invasive mode of administration and the resulting need to 
cover the potential dose range with a limited number of doses (in order to limit the number of 
subjects at risk for adverse reactions related to the mode of administ ration). In addition, the 
lowest dose in the trial should provide a reasonable safet y margin to the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL ) and, on the other hand, have the potential to alread y result in beneficial 
effects to the patient to outweigh the r isk of an AE caused b y the IVT administration.

therapeutics for wAMD [ R18-1168] . In an in -house study  using such a model ( n00256189)
30µg BI 836880 administered IVT into the monkey  eye were interpreted to result in clinically  
meaningful improvement of the respective retinal lesions. The corresponding human dose of 
60µg (0.06 mg) was therefore sele cted as starting dose as it is likely  to already  provide a 
therapeutic benefit over a period of 4 weeks. At the same time this dose is adequatel y below

(human corresponding dose 1000 µg or 1.0 mg) (n00255516, n00258450, n00254368 ) 
leading to a safety  margin of more than 15 fold. 
For the lower doses a higher relative increase to the next dose (200% and 178% ,respectively ) 
was chosen, resulting in dose levels of 0.18 mg and 0.5 mg in order to avoid many  small dose 
steps resulting in an increasing number of trial related IVT injections. For the next dose 
(1.0mg) a smaller relative (100%) increase was chosen. If all previous doses are clinically  
well tolerated one additional dose of 2.0 mg will be tested as one of the development 
objectives is to find a dose that provides an exposure that has the potential for a decreased 
injection frequenc y. 
The provisional dose levels to be assigned to separate cohorts of patients are listed in 
Table 4.1.2: 1.

4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
Recruitment in the trial will be started with the lowest dose group of the SRD part. The MRD 
part will recruit patients only after the SRD part has been completed and safety  of the doses 
has been established. 
In the SRD part, th e dose is planned to be escalated in cohorts at the pre -defined provisional 
dose levels; see Table 4.1. 2: 1. Intermediate or lower dose levels, depending on the number 
of DLEs observed in the study , aslong as they  fulfil the EWOC criterion, may be 
investigated if agreed upon between Investigator and Sponsor. At th e end of each treatment 
cohort, BI  will convene a meeting with the SMC members. At the dose escalation meeting,
the clinical course for each patient inthe current dose cohort will be described in detail. 
Based on that and on the results of the updated BLRM , a decision on the next dose level to be 
tested is made.
In general, r ecruitment will be done successivel y for the dose groups, i.e. if the required
number of patient s for one dose group will be completed and this dose is considered safe 
based on ( the BLRM model and)the clinical course , the recruit ment of the next higher dose

injection 80 mg/m L” and “ Diluent for BI 836880 concentrate for solution for injection 80 
mg/mL ”and “BI 836880 solution for injection 40 mg/mL ”will be provided by  BI. The 
diluent can be used for both drug preparations, “BI 836880 concentrate for solution for 
injection 80 mg/mL” and for “BI 836880 solution for injection 40 mg/mL”, if required. A site 
pharmacist or qualified per sonnel 
will prepare the read y to use drug product according to the 
“Instructions to pharmacist /qualified personnel ”. The instructions will be provided by  BI and 
will be filed in the I SF.

To determine the dose regimen for the next cohort, the available toxicity  information 
(including DLEs and AEs that are not DLEs ), PK, PD, as well as the recommendations from 
the BLRM will be evaluated by  the SMC members at the dose decision meeting. The parties 
must reach a consensus whether further dose escalation is appropriate , or whether to de -
escalat ionand/or expand edrecruitment into particular cohorts is appropriate . Minutes from 
these meetings will be prepared and circulated to the trial team and each investigator for 
comment prior to finalization. The next dose group will only be initiated after further dose 
escalation is considered appropriate b y the SMC (see S ection 4.1.2 for details on dose 
rational eand escalation concept).

baseline is the value at Visit 1. All ophthalmologic examinations will be performed on both 
eyes, as described below.
Central ly collected ophthalmological data ( CFP, OCT/OCT -A) will be transferred from the 
Central Reading Center ( CRC) to the sponsor’s database. The local measurement data will 
remain at the study  sites as source documents.
If clinicall y significant worsening is o bserved in the assessments of efficacy  during the study , 
it will be reported as AEin the eCRF (please also refer to Section 5.2.8 ).
SD-OCT /OCT -Angiography
The retinal lay ers and their thickness can be visualized and measured b y SD-OCT. The 
assessment will be performed by  a qualified person, and only  specified OCT equipment will 
be used. OCT -A is a non -invasive imaging technique that provides high- resolution 
volumetric blood flow information without the use of d ye. The assessment is also performed 
by a qualified person, and only  specified device(s) will be used. 
OCT images will be sent to an independent CRC for evaluation. A detailed manual for OCT
image acquisition and data transmission will be provided.
Visual Acuity  measured by ETDRS letter charts
BCVA will be determined by  using the ETDRS VA chart starting at a test distance of

Single standard 12 lead ECGs (I , II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 – V6) will be recorded at the 
time points described in th e Flow Chart s. Electrode placement will be performed according to 
the method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and wrists) and Wilson (chest leads). The 
recordings will be made using equipment approved or provided b y the centr al ECG vendor. 
They  will be assessed after the subjects have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. 
ECG recordings at planned time points may  be repeated for quality  reasons like alternating 
current artefacts, muscle movements and electrode dislocation. I n this case the repeated ECG 
recordings will be used if quality  was better.
All ECGs will be evaluated by  the cardiologist of the central ECG vendor ,andin addition by 
a qualified healthcare provider at the site , if available . Clinically  relevant abnormal findings 
will be reported either as baseline condition (if identified at the screening visit) or otherwise 
as AEs and will be followed up and/or treated as medically  appropriate. Additional 
(unscheduled) ECGs can be recorded for safet y reasons at any time based on the judgment of 
the investigator. For the screening ECG the evaluation needs to be available prior to the final 
assessment of the in/exclusion criteria. 
All ECGs will be transmitted (either electronically (preferred
) or via a scanned hard- copy) to 
the central ECG vendor in order to enable a centralized and independent re
-evaluation of all 
12-lead ECGs. This re -evaluation will only  be done for the screening ECG if needed or if 
requested b y the sponsor. Abnormalities d etected during this centralised ECG evaluation will 
not necessaril y qualify as AE.
5.2.7
Other safety parameters
MRD cohort 3 only : Fluorescein angiograph y(FA) imaging will be obtained from both ey es 
during Screening by a qualified person according to the imaging manual. Additional FA 
during Visits 2- 8 should be performed at the discretion of the investigator, e.g. if signs of 
inflammation are observed.
5.2.8 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.8.1
Definitions of AEs 
5.2.8.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnor mal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
5.2.8.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which fulfils at le ast one of the 
following criteria :
results in death,

the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe.
requires inpatient hospitalisation or 
requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation,
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect, or
is deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an impor tant medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Examples of such events are intensive tre atment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or 
development of dependency  or abuse.
5.2.8.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in S ection 5.2.8.2, subsection s “AE Collection ”and“AE r eporting to sponsor 
and timelines”.
In accordance with the EMA initiative on I mportant Medical Events, BI has set up a list of 
further AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even though 
they may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system . These events should 
alway s be reported as SAEs as described above .
5.2.8.1.4 Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compou nds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see above .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Ocular 
related event s(applicable to MRD cohorts 2 & 3)
Intraocular inflammation events
oAnterior chamber cells of grade 1+ according to the Standardization of Uveitis 
Nomenclature (SUN) working group (WG) grading scheme (see 
Table 5.2.1: 1)
oSterile inflammation of the vitreous of 1+ according to the NEI Grading of 
vitreous haze (see Table 5.2.8.1.4: 1 below)
Signs of vascular occlusion and inflammation (vasculitis) in the retina, including 
peripheral retinal hemorrhages in the area supplied by  the occ luded vessel 
(hemorrhage of the macula would not be included as this is a sign of wAMD disease)
Visual acuity  decrease of more than 15 letters from the previous visit

Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters:
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin > 2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ 10 fold ULN
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the 
patient s showing t hese lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC 
system .
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures descri bed in the DILI checklist should be followed .
All AEs meeting the criteria for a dose limiting event as defined in Section 5.2.1 are defined 
as AESI sfor this trial .
5.2.8.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usua l 
activities
5.2.8.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concom itant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be ca used by or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect siz e if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication , taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation 
(e.g. situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more 
likely  explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treat ment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.8.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.8.2.1 AE collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  the 
investigator :
From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’sEOT: 
-all AEs (serious and non- serious) and all AESI s.
After the individual patient’s EOT: 
the investigator does not need to activel y monit or the patient for AEs but should only  
report related SAEs and related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware 
ofby any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should however, not 
be reported in the CRF .
5.2.8.2.2 AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately  (within 24 hours) to the sponsor’s

timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions the 
investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With re ceipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
5.2.8.2.3 Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form , if applicable . The investigator should determine the causal 
relationship to the trialmedication .
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF andBI SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  the investigator .
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior to trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only . All (S)AEs, including those 
persisting after individual patient ’s EOT must be followed up until they  have resolved, have 
been assesse d as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.
5.2.8.2.4 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trial medication, the investigator must report a ny drug exposure 
during pregnancy  in a trial participant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  means of Part A of 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form to the 
sponsor ’s unique entry  point.
Similarly , potential drug exposure during pregnancy  must be reported if a partner of a male
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.
Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial
specific information and consent for the pregnant p artner.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trial s (Part B). The ISF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for 
Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trial s and not the SAE form 
is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE 
form must be completed in addition.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This trial will consist of a nSRD part followed b y anMRD part. Both parts of the trial will be 
conducted non- randomized, open -label, and uncontrolled. The main objective is to 
investigate ocular and systemic safet y and tolerability  as well as disease improvement of 
BI836880 after a single IVTinjection and after multiple IVTinjections of several doses.
SRD part:
The dose escalation will be guided b y a Ba yesian 2- parameter logistic regression model with 
overdose control [ R13-4803, R13 - 4806]. For a given dose, the EWOC criterion is that there 
should be less than 25% risk that the true ocular DL E rate is above 0.25.
The model is given as follows:
logit( πd) = log( α) + β*log(d/d*),
where logit( π) = log( π/(1-π)), π drepresents the probability of having a DL E in the evaluation 
period at dose d, d* = 2 mg is the reference dose, allowing for the interpretation of α as the 
odds of a DLE at dose d*, and θ = (log(α), log(β)) with α, β > 0 is the parameter vector of the
model.
The estimated probability  of a DLEat each dose level from the model will be summarized 
using the following intervals:
Target toxicity : [0.00, 0.25 )
Over toxicity : [0.25, 1.00]
The BLRM -recommended dose for the next cohort is the dose level with the highest posterior 
probability  of the DLE rate falling in the target interval [0.00, 0.25) among the doses 
fulfilling EWOC. Thus, it should be unlikely  (<25% posterior probability ) that the DLE rate 
at that dose will exceed 0. 25. However, the maximum allowable dose increment for the 
subsequent cohort will be no more than 200% from the previous dose up to doses of 0.5 mg, 
and to a maximum of 100% from the previous dose from dose 0.5 mg onwards. Dose 
escalation will continue up to th e 2 mg dose as long as the EWOC criterion for the next dose 
level is fulfilled. At the final dose, at least 6 treated patients are required. However, the SMC 
may decide to include additional number of patients at this dose level.
Since a Bay esian approach is applied, a prior distribution f (θ) for the unknown parameter 
vector θ needs to be specified. This prior distribution will be specified as a mixture of three 
multivariate normal distributions, i.e.
f
(θ) = a 1f1(θ) + a 2f2(θ) + a 3f3(θ)
with ai, i = 1, 2, 3 the prior mixture weights (a 1+ a 2+ a3= 1), and fi(θ) = MVN(μ i, Σi) , the 
multivariate normal distribution of the i
-th component with mean vector μ iand covariance 
matrix Σ i, where 
Σ =
   
 ,     ,    ,    
  ,    ,       
 ,   .
Mixture pri or distributions have the advantage that they  allow for specification of different 
logistic dose -toxicity  curves, therefore making the prior more robust.

no study in a comparable population has been conducted. Therefore, the three mixture 
components were established as follows:
1.A weakl y informative prior was derived reflecting the a priori assumption that the median 
DLE rate at the starting dose of 0.06 mg would eq ual 0.01, and the median DL E rate at 
the maximum feasible dose of 2 mg would equal 0.10. This yields μ1= (-2.197 , -0.380). 
The standard deviations were set such that large uncertaint y about the parameter means is 
reflected, and the correlation was set to 0, thus y ielding σ 1,11 = 2, σ 1,22 = 1 and ρ 1= 0, 
respectivel y. The prior weight a 1for the first component was chosen as 0.9.
2.A high -toxicity  weakl y informative prior was derived reflecting the case that the 
compound would be much more toxic than expected
. For this prior component, it was 
assumed that the median DL E rate at the starting dose of 0.06 mg would equal 0.10, and 
the median DLE rate at 2 mg would equal 0.40. These assumptions y ield 
μ2= (-0.405, - 0.671). The standard deviations and correlations were set identical to the 
weakl y informative prior, i.e. σ 2,11 = 2, σ 2,22= 1 and ρ 2= 0, respectivel y. The prior weight 
a2for the second component was chosen as 0.05.
3. A low- toxicity  weakl y informative prior was derived reflecting the case that the 
compound would be much less toxic than expected. For this prior component, it was 
assumed that the median DL E rate at the starting dose of 0.06 mg would equal 0.001, and 
the median DLE at 2 mg would equal 0.01. These assumptions y ield 
μ3= (-4.595, - 0.417). The standard deviations and correlations were set to σ 3,11= 5, 
σ3,22= 0.01, therefore almost fixing the slope parameter to its mean. The correlation was 
set to 0, i.e. ρ 3= 0. The prior weight a 3for the third component was chosen as 0.05.
A summary of the prior distri bution is provided in Table 7.1: 1 . Additionally , the prior 
probabilities of DL Esat different doses, as well as the corresponding probability  of targeted 
and ove rdosing, are shown in Table 7.1: 2. Graphically , the prior medians with 
accompan ying 95% credible intervals are shown in Figure 7.1: 1. As can be seen from both 
Table 7.1: 2 andFigure 7.1: 1 ,the prior medians of the DL Eprobabilities are in line with the 
prior medians derived from the weakl y informative prior, and the uncertainty around the 
medians is large, showing the low amount of information this prior provides. This is also 
supported by  the prior sample size, i.e. the information contain ed in the prior. This is 
approximately  equal to 1.7 patients. A detailed evaluation of the model using h ypothetical 
data scenarios and operating characteristics is provided in Appendix 10.3.

The main anal ysis populations are defined below . Analy ses will be performed by dose/ cohort 
and overall in each trial part. Patients will be anal ysed according to the assigned treatment, 
unless otherwise specified. In the SRD part, patients who are replaced during the DL E
evaluation period will be excluded from the determination of the MTD (see Section 3.1 ).
Important protocol deviations (iPDs) will be defined in the Integrated Quality  and Risk 
Management (IQRM) plan. The handling of patients with iPDswill be described in the 
TSAP.
Treated Set (TS)
The TSwill consist of all patients who were treated with at least one dose of BI836880 .
Full Analysis Set (FAS; only MRD part)
The FAS will consist of all patients who were treated with at least one dose of BI 836880 and 
have baseline and on-treatment CSFT measurements for the study  eye .
Evaluable Responders’ Set (ERS, MRD cohort 3 only)
The ERS will cons ist of all patients who completed three doses of BI 836880 and have SD -
OCT measurements at Week 16 (Visit
6).
In the TSAP, t he FAS and ERS definition smay be updated, and further analy sis data sets 
may be defined .
7.3.1 Primary endpoint 
analyses
No primary  efficacy  endpoint h as been defined for this study .
SRD part:
The primary  safet y endpoint “ Number of patient s with ocular DLEs from drug administration

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct20167.3.4 Safety analyses
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activit ies(MedDRA). 
Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. For BI 836880, the residual effect 
period (REP) after IVT administration is not known. Therefore, a ll AEs with an onset 
between start of treatment and the respective EOT visit willbe assigned to the on-treatment 
period for evaluation. The safet y analysis will be performed b y ‘treatment at onset’.
All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hy pothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment
-emergent AEs, i.e. all 
AEs occurring between start of treatment and the EOT visit .AEs that start before first drug 
intake and deteri orate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by  system organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current version o f the MedDRA at the 
databas e lock.
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarised . Treatment 
groups wil l be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically  relevant 
abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trialand at the end -of-trialevaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.
7.3.5 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses
The derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters is described in detail in the BI SOP 
001-MCS -36-472. The determination of pharmacody namic parameters AUEC , Emax, Eminwill 
follow the principles described for t he respective PK parameters .
All evaluable patient s who received at least one dose of BI 836880 will be included in the 
pharmacokinetic /PDanaly sis. Patient s who are considered as not evaluable will be listed 
with their individual sample concentrations and individual pharmacokinetic/ PDparameters, 
however, will not be included in d escriptive statistics for sample concentrations, 
pharmacokinetic/ PDparameters or other statistical assessment.
Every  effort will be made to include all concentration and re sponse data in an anal ysis. If not 
possible, a case bycase decision is required whether the value should onl y be excluded from 
half-lifeestimation or the complete anal ysis.
If a concentration is only excluded from half- life determination, it will be used for all
other calculations (e.g. descriptive statistics) and for graphical presentation.
If a concentration value is excluded from all calculations, it will not be presented
graphicall y or used for the calculation of descriptive statistics and parameter
determination. However ,the excluded concentration itself will be listed in the Clinical 
Trial Report (CTR )associated with an appropriate flag.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016Concentrations will be used for graphs and calculations in the format that is reported in the
bioanaly tical rep ort. Noncompartmental pharma cokinetic anal yses of the sample
concentration -time data will be performed using a validated software program, e.g. Phoenix
WinNonlin. Only  concentrations within the validated concentration range will be used for the
calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. For pre -dose samples, the actual sampling time
will be set to zero.
Sample concentrations will be plotted graphically versus time for all evaluable subjects as
listed in the drug concentration -time tables. For the presentation of the mean profiles, the 
geometric and arithmetic mean and the planned blood sampling times will be used. If the
actual sampling time deviates significantly  from the planne d time, the corresponding sample
concentration will be excluded from the calcula tion of descriptive statistics.
If the number of 
patient s included allows, the following descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for analy te concentrations as well as for all pharmacokinetic parameters: N, 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, P10, Q1, Q3, P90, 
arithmetic coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation. 
The data format for descriptive statistics of concentrations will be identical with the data 
format of the respective concentrations. The descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be calculated using the individual values with the number of decimal places 
as provided b y the evaluation program. Then the individual values as well as the descriptive 
statistic s will be reported with three significant digits in the CTR .
7.4 I NTERIM ANALYSES
The sponsor will continuously  monitor the safety . In the SRD part, t he dose escalation design 
foresees that the sponsor and the SMC perform regular safet y evaluations. Likewise, in the 
MRD part, the SMC will decide on the dose escalation. Theseevaluat ions will be unmasked 
to dose.
No formal interim anal ysis of efficacy  data is foreseen, although efficacy  data when available 
may be considered as part of the safet y evaluations. A preliminary  anal ysis of efficacy  data 
will be performed after the completion of Visit 5 of the first dose group of the MRD part. The 
preliminary  efficacy  results will be distributed to the Sponsor’s trial team, but they  will not be 
part of the CTR. A prelim inary  anal ysis of PK data will be performed after completion of the 
SRD part.
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING 
DATA
No imputation will be performed on missing efficacy  data. Missing baseline laboratory  
values will be imputed by the respective values from the screening visit. No other 
imputations will be performed on missing data although every  effort will be made to obt ain 
complete information on all AEs , with particular emphasis on potential DLEs.
7.6 RANDOMISATION
No randomisation will be performed. Patients will be assigned to escalating dose groups b y 
order of admission into the trial.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct20167.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
No for mal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this 
explorative study .
For the SRD part, amaximum of 18 patients will be expected for this trial based on the 
number of dose levels/cohorts that are tested. Fewer patients mig ht be needed based on the 
recommendation of the SMC and the criteria specified (see Section 7.1). However, the actual 
number of patients will depend on the number of dose cohorts tested. Based on the simulation 
study  to evaluate operating characteristics of the BL RM (see Appendix 10.3 ),about
18 evaluable patients are expected to be treated in th e dose escalation part for the model to 
have reasonable operating characteristics relating to its MTD recommendation.
For the MRD part cohort 1 and c ohort 2, a size of 1 0 subjects per dose group is in general 
considered as sufficient for the exploratory ev aluation of multiple dose safety  and PK.The 
drop out rate is expected to be higher for the treatment- naïve patients in cohort 2 as compared 
to the treatment -resistant patients in cohort 1. To allow for dropouts , 10 to 12 patients will be 
included in MRD cohort 1 and approximately  16patients will be included in MRD cohort 2
and 3 combined (in total appro ximately 42patients in the trial ).In case some subjects do not 
complete the trial according to the protocol, the trial clinical monitor together with th e trial 
pharmacokineticist and the trial statistician are to decide if and how man y subjects will be 
replaced.
Further, b ased on results from [ R18-0309] for a comparable patient group and drug product, 
and based on the inclusion criteria for the current trial, it is assumed that the actual percent 
decrease in CSFT at W eek 12 isabove 25%. InTable 7.7: 1 , the probability to obser ve a 
median percent decrease in CSFT at W eek 12 in different pre -defined regions is display ed for 
a set of scenarios, and for sample sizes 10 and 15, assuming a normal distribution for the 
percent decrease with standard deviation 16 (also based on the abov e publication). These 
results are based on simulations using R Version 3.5.1. Details on the simulation program can 
be found in the TMF.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016For example, if the true median percent decrease in CSFT at Week 12 was 25% , the 
probability  to observe a median percent decrease in CSFT at Week 12 of at least 20% would 
be around 80%. In contrast, if the true median percent decrease in CSFT at Week 12 wasonly 
13%, then the probabilit y to observe a median percent decrease of at least 20% would be 
around 12% .
For the MRD cohort 3, no formal sample size calculation has been applied . It is expected that 
using approximately  12 patients will be sufficient for this cohort .

process should be properly  documented in the source documentation.
8.2 D ATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A quality  assurance audit/inspection of thi s trialmay be conducted b y the sponsor ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by IRB /IECor by  regulatory  authorities. The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the investigator ’s trial-related files and correspondence, 
and the informed c onsent docume ntation of this clinical trial .
8.3 RECORDS
CRF sfor individual patient s will be provided by  the sponsor .For drug accountability , refer to 
Section 4.1.8.
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow good doc umentation practices and be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
The c urrent medical history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case the investigator must make three documented attempts to retrieve 
previous medical records. If this fails a verbal history  from the patient , documented in their 
medical records, would be acceptable.
During the site visit the sponsor’s Clinical Research Associate ( CRA )or auditor must be 
granted a ccess to the original patient file (please see Section 8.3.2 ). The investigator must 
ensure tha t all patient identifiers (e .g. patient ’sname, initials, address, phone number, social 
securit y number) have properly  been removed or redacted from an y copy of the patient s’
source documents before sending them to the sponsor .
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations )
Patient participation in the trial(substance, trialnumber, patient number, date patient
was informed)
Dates of patient ’s visits, including dispensing of trialmedication
Medical history  (including trialindication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medication history
AEs and outcome events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if avai lable))
SAEs (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Concomitant therap y (start date, changes)

Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there mu
st be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trialparticipant 
meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet an y exclusion criteria. The absence of 
records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing 
conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not 
make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The sponsor will monitor the conduct of the trialby regular on- site monitoring visits and/or 
remote monitoring calls and in- house data quality review. The frequency  of site monitoring 
will be determined by assessing all characteristics of the trial, including its nature, objective, 
methodology  and the d egree of an y deviations of the intervention from normal clinical 
practice.
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB /IEC review 
and regulatory  inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source
documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which 
must be available at all times for review b y the CRA , auditor and regulatory  inspector 
(e.g. FDA). They  may  review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy  of the data will 
be verified b y direct comparison with the source documen ts described in S ection 8.3.1 .The 
sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
An adaptive approach to clinical trialmonitoring will be utilised. The sponsor will perform a 
risk assessment of the trialto determine the extent and nature of monitoring required in order
to ensure the reliability  and robustness of the results. Regular review of risk reports will 
provide sponsor oversight dur ing trialconduct and direct monitoring activities to the areas of 
greatest risk which have the most potential impact to patient safet y and data quality .
The investigator /institution will allow on -site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review an d regulatory  inspections. Direct access should be granted to all source documents 
(paper and e -records) including progress notes, copies of laboratory  and medical test results
. 
The CRA and auditor may  review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy  of the data 
will be verified b y direct comparison with the source documents described in Section 8.3.1 . 
The sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and ICH GCP.
An adaptive approach to clinical trialmonitoring will be utilised. This is initiated by  an 
assessment of the risk associated with the trialcombined with identification of critical data 
and processes. An Integrated Qualit y and Risk Management Plan documents the strategies 
involved with the implementati on of onsite, offsite and central monitoring activities in order 
to direct focus to the areas of greatest risk which have the most potential impact to patient
safet y and data qualit y. Trial oversight is achieved by  regular review of a report of risk which 
then influences an y monitoring adaptations. 
The investigator /institution will allow on -site trial -related monitoring, audits, I RB/IEC 
review and regulatory  inspections. Direct a ccess should be granted to all s ource documents

10.3 STATISTICAL APPENDIX INCLUDING MODEL PERFORMANCE AND 
DATA SCENARIOS
A BLRM with overdose control will be used to guide dose escalation in this study . The 
BLRM is introduced in Section 7.1, which also specifies the prior for the model. After 
patients in each cohort have completed the evaluation period of 7days, the prior distribution 
will be updated through Gibbs sampling procedures with the accumulated DL E data from the 
evaluation period. Posterior probabilities for the rate of DLEs will be summarised from the

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016BLRM. Selection of the next dose will be based on these probabilities as well as on other 
safet y and laboratory data.
The purpose of this statistical appe ndix is to present performance metrics (operating 
characteristics) that illustrate the precision of the design in estimating the MTD (see 
Section 3.1 ) under various dose- toxicity  relationships through computer simulation. These 
results are summarized in Table 10.3: 3 . In addition, recommendations of the next dose level
by the BLRM with overdose control principle are provided under various hy pothetical 
outcome scenarios in early cohorts ,to show how it facilitates on -study  dose -escalation 
decisions (see T able 10.3 : 1).For simplicity  reasons, a cohort size of 3 patients who are all 
evaluable is assumed. 
Hypothetical data scenarios
Hypothetical data scenarios a re shown in T able 10.3 : 1. These scenarios reflect potential on-
study  data constellations and related escalation as allowed by  the model and the planned dose 
groups . It is assumed that each cohort has exactl y three patients who are all evaluable. For 
each scenario, the probability  of overdose for the current dose, as well as the next potential 
dose and related probabilities of target dos ingand over -dosing are shown.
For example, scenario 1 represents the case that no DL E is obse rved in 3 patients at the 
starting dose of 0.06 mg. In this case, the next planned dose permitted b y the model and the 
200% escalation rule is 0.18 mg. In contrast, scenario 2 assumes that there is one DLE 
observed in the first dose group. Th is would mean overtoxicity  from the beginning, and the 
recommendation would be to stop the trial.  
In scenario 3, there is no DL E after the first 2 dose groups, which would allow the trial to 
continue to the next dose level. In scenario 4, the first DL
E occurs in dose group 0.18 mg. 
Then the recommendation would be to repeat that dose. Scenario 5 shows that the trial would 
continue to the next dose level 0.5 mg if no additional DLE was obser ved in the 0.18 mg dose 
group. 
However, if there was another DLE (as in scenar io 6), then the recommendation would be to 
go back to dose 0.06 mg. If there was no further DLE then (scenario 7), one could go up 
again to dose 0.18 mg. Escalation to the next dose group would only  be allowed in case there 
was no further DLE in this dose group in additional 6 patients (see scenarios 8 and 9). 
Scenario 10 shows the case where the trial runs through up to the highest possible dose group 
2 mg without an y DLE and having observed a total of 18 patients (6 were required for the 
MTD). Scenarios 11 and 12 show that it is even possible to have one DLE in the 2 mg dose 
group and still to complete the trial with a total of 18 patients. However, if there were 2 DLEs 
in the highest dose group, then the model would recommend to return to dose 1 mg (scen ario 
13).

Operating characteristics are a way  to assess the long -run behaviour of a model by illustrating 
the precision of the design in estimating the MTD . Under an assumed true dose -toxicity  
curve, metrics such as the probability  of recommending a dose with true DL Erate in the 
target interval can be approxima ted via simulation. Table 10.3: 2 describes 6assumed true 
dose-toxicity  scenarios which were used to assess the operating characteristics of the model. 
These scenarios reflect a wide range of possible cases as follows:
Scenario 1: aligned with prior medi ans
Scenario 2: aligned with prior means
Scenario 
3: high -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 4: low -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 5: non- logistic dose -toxicity  scenario
Scenario 6: low -toxicity followed b y high -toxicity

For each of these scenarios, 1000 trials were simulated. Each cohort consisted of 3 patients 
and dose escalation complied with the following rule:
Escalate to the maximum dose which satisfies the overdose criterion and is ≤ 200% 
increase from the current dose . 
The MTD was considered reached if at least 6 patients have been evaluated at a dose level 
which is the model’s recommendation for the next do
se cohort. A minimum number of 
15patients in the trial was required, and the maximum allowed patient number was 21.
It was then assessed how often a dose was declared as MTD with true DL Erate in the 
targeted or in the overdos ingrange. Furthermore, the a verage, minimum and maximum 
number of patients per trial and the average number of DLEs per trial are reported. Results 
are shown in Table 10. 3: 3.

In scenario 1, which reflects the case that the true dose- toxicity  is aligned with prior me dians,
94.4% of the simulated trials declared a dose as MTD with true DLT rate in the targeted 
toxicity  range . Note that 5.6% of the simulated trials stop pedeither be cause there was no 
MTD determined after 21 patients had been observed (3.5%) or because of high toxicity  
(2.1%). This latter is mostly  due to the cases that 1 DL T is observed out of 3 patients at the 
starting dose of 0.06 mg. In realit y, this situation would rarel y happen as the safet y profile of 
starting dose is expected to be good. 
In scenario 2 , the assumed dose toxicities are higher than in scenario 1. This results in a 
higher percentage of early  stopped trials (about 30%). In this case, about 70% of the trials 
would end with an estimated MTD within the targeted toxicity  range , but none in the 
overdosing range
.
In Scenario 3 (high -toxicity  scenario), onl y 38.8 % of the trials trials declared a dose as MTD 
with true DLT rate in the targeted toxicity  range. In 17.1% of the trials, the estimated MTD 
was in the overdosing range. Scenario 4(low-toxicity scenario) shows the best results ,as 
would be expected. 
Scenarios 5 and 6 showed worse operating characeristics; however , they  are reasonable given 
thequite large deviat
ions from the underl ying BLRM. 
The mean patient numbers range from 13.6 patients (Scenario 3) to 18.7 patients (Scenario 
6),and the maximum number of patients was 21. Therefore, the patient numbers are as 
expected and increase when moving away  from the high
-toxicity  scenario.
By reviewin g the metrics presented in Table 10.3 : 3, it can be seen that the model is generall y
conservative due to the overdose control criteria. In all scenarios except for the no n-logistic 
case (scenario 5) , the probabilities of recomme nding a dose with true P(DLT) ≥ 25 as MTD

On-study  recommendations based on the model are consistent with the clinical decision 
making process, and should be considered in conjunctio n with other available clinical

10.4 IMPLICATIONS OF CORO NAVIRUS DISEASE 2019
At the time of evalua ting the fourth dose group of the SRD part in this trial, the COVID-19 
pandemic emerged with worldwide impact on daily  life. To allow for thorough evaluation of 
potential additional risks to trial participants in the course of this pandemic, the trial was 
temporaril y put on hold in March 2020. At that timepoint, a total of ten patient shad been 
treated with one single intravitreal injection of BI 836880. Available data did not show dose-
limiting events, drug -related adverse events, nor sy stemic adverse events.
The trial has been re -initiated in July  2020 after potential additional risks for study  
participants with regard to COVID- 19 have been evaluated. 
Currently , there is no evidence that based on the pharmacological mechanism and existing 
non-clinic al data the compound may  increase the risk of progression of COVID -19 infection. 
No effects related to this MoA on the immune sy stem are currently  known. In conclusion, no 
change on the Benefit -Risk assessment of the compound in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic is foreseen.
The current study  population is potentially  at higher risk of COVID -19 infection due to 
background or concomitant diseases. As such, risk mitigation measures, such as measures to 
reduce patients’ exposure will be implemented, if req uired. Enrolment will only  happen when 
the local situation allows for patients to travel to the trial site, and all precautionary  measures 
(e.g. use of protective personal/patients equipment) will be implemented, in line with local 
instructions and recomme
ndations.
The investigators will take the totality  of information related to each single patient and the 
local COVID -19 situation into consideration when performing the individual benefit-risk 
assessment on a case -by-case basis. Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon 
each patient’s (continued) participation in the trial. BI as the sponsor, where required, will 
support the investigator sin their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the investigator 
may decide to implement protocol d eviations where this protects the safety , wellbeing and/or 
is in the best interest of the patient.

Section to be changed 1.2 Drug Profile
Description of change Adaptation of the AE and PK section as follows : 
‘In the SRD part of the trial described here (1336 -
0007), 15 patients had been treated with 
intravitreal BI 836880 and followed up until the 
end of trial visit. Six patients were reported with 
an AE after trial drug administration; all of the 
corresponding 6 AEs were ey e disorders 
(conjunctival haemorrhage in the stud y eye, 
subretinal fluid in the study  eye, dry  eye in the 
study  eye, 2 vitreous floaters in the study  eye, 
neovascular AMD in the fellow ey e). None of the 
reported AEs was judged as related to BI°836880 
by investigators or fulfilled criteria for dose-
limiting events. The AEs of neovascular AMD 
and of subretinal fluid were reported as of 
moderate intensit y, the other AEs were rated as 
mild. The AE of neovascular AMD in the fellow 
eye was considered serious. All AEs but the 
neovascular AMD, the subretinal fluid and the 
dry eye were recovered by  the end of follow up. 
A preliminary  pharmacokinetic anal ysis of the 
available data from the SRD part of 1336 -0007 
was conducted. The plasma exposure (C maxand 
AUC) increased in a dose proportional manner 
and reached gMean C maxof 88.0 ng/mL and 
gMean AUC 0-∞of 20 900 ng ·h/mL for the 2 mg 
dose. Compared with the exposure after 
intravenous administration of 720 mg BI
836880, 
the exposure after intra vitreal administration was 
very low (<1/1000).
In the MRD part of the trial, two patients of the 
MRD cohort 1 received three intravitreal doses 
and one patient of the MRD cohort 1 received 
two intravitreal doses of BI 836880 at the time of 
a data cut -off on 28 July 2021. Two patients were 
reported with an AE after trial drug 
administration; one of the corresponding 2 AEs 
was an ey e disorder (vitreous floaters in the study 
eye). None of the reported AEs was judged as 
related to BI°836880 b y investigators or fulfilled 
criteria for dose -limiting events. Both AEs were 
reported as of mild intensity .’

Description of change Adaption of the paragraph referring to which 
patients will be included, as follows: ‘ This trial 
will consist of a single rising dose (SRD) part and 
a multiple rising dose (MRD) partincluding 
MRD cohorts 1 and 2. Because this is the Fist -in-
Human (FiH) application with I VT route of 
administration, the SRD part and the MRD cohort 
1 of this trial will include patients who have not 
sufficiently  responded to anti -VEGF treatment 
and still have active disease with significant 
retinal edema after a minimum of three previous 
injections. After safet y has been investigated in 
SRD and first 3 patients of MRD cohort 1, the 
MRD cohort 2 will start to evaluate treatment -
naïve patients: this populat ion will be the final 
target population, as it is expected to include the 
patients that can receive the biggest benefit with 
IVT administration of BI 836880.’
Rationale for change Rationale for the inclusion of treatment -naïve 
patients in the MRD cohort 2.
Section to be changed 1.4 Benefit -Risk Assessment ; 9. References
Description of change Adaptation of the information on RG7716 and 
addition of reference R21 -0692:  ‘However, IVT 
administration of an antibody  that simultaneousl y 
binds to VEGF and ANG 2 (faricimab, previousl y 
referred to as bispecific antibody  RG7716) for 
treatment of wAMD has previously  been tested in 
humans in a Phase 1 clinical trial [R18
-0309], and 
a Phase 2 clinical trial [R21-0692] . In the Phase 1 
trial, the co -adminstration of RG7716 was 
reported to be well tolerated and to exhibit a 
favourable safety  profile overall [R18
-0309]. I n 
addition, there was preliminary  evidence of 
improvements in BCVA and anatomic parameters 
for this mode of action. In the Phase 2 trial, 
faricimab maintained vision and anatomic 
improvements comparable with SoC in wAMD in 
treatment naïve patients, resulting in the start of 
Phase 3 trials.
These data support that the combination of anti -
VEGF and anti -ANG2 can be used safel y in 
patients with wAMD ref ractory  to anti- VEGF 
monotherap yand in treatment- naïve patients.’

Section to be changed 1.4 Benefit -Risk Assessment
Description of change Addition of: ‘BI recommends the use of material 
for intraocular drug delivery , which is according 
to   standard medical practice. This material is not 
officiall y approved for intraocular drug delivery, 
with a ssociated potential risks. L ong-term 
experience as standard of medical care suggest a 
favorable risk-benefit profile. To the best of the 
sponsor’s knowledge there is currently  no product 
on the market, which is officiall y approved for 
intravitreal drug del ivery. 
The needles for preparation of the drug and 
intravitreal injection are usually  silicone oil 
coated to ease the injection of the needle through 
the tissue. This carries the potential risk for a 
silicone oil transfer into the vitreous with the 
potent ial risks for occurrence of side effects like 
vitreous floaters or intraocular inflammation. The 
overall risk for such events is based on long- term 
experience with comparable material, and is 
considered low. However, patients should be 
made aware of this r isk, as reflected in the 
Informed Consent Form (I CF). To the best of the 
sponsor’s knowledge there is currently  no product 
on the market, which is silicone -free. The 
recommended s yringes are silicone -oil-free and 
not considered to carry  this risk. 
The IMP  handling instructions do not mandate 
the use of materials from certain manufacturers 
and leave the decision to the 
treating  investigators/sites on which material to 
use if it meets the specifications as described in 
the IMP handling instructions for BI 83
6880.’
Rationale for change Following release of a caution statement by  
Becton Dickinson (BD), who supply  materials for 
use in this trial, a risk- benefit evaluation and 
associated mitigation steps was performed and 
incorporated into the trial protocol.

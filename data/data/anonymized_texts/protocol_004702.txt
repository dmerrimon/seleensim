 Introduction  
 Background and Significance  
 
Health Issue Addressed  
Hypertension (HTN) is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms and is one of the key causes 
for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Sympathetically mediated cardiovascular responses to exercise 
(over activation of group III/IV skeletal muscle afferents, sympathoexcitation) are exaggerated in adults 
with HTN  (10). These abnormally large changes in hemodynamics during exercise (exercise -induced 
HTN) increase the risk for adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events during or immediately 
following a bout of exercise  (6, 18, 23) . Importantly, HTN used to be considered a man’s disease, 
however, women following menopause, are now at a greater risk for CVD compared with men  (23). 
Despite the greater increase of HTN in postmenopausal women, the sex difference in the exercise 
pressor response (EPR) in adults with HT N is unclear. Further, treatment guidelines for HTN 
management remain inconsistent, particularly for young and aged women  (23). Therefore, there is a 
critical need  to understand if the EPR is differentially regulated in postmenopausal women with HTN 
and to determine an effective early intervention that can target exercise -induced hypertension in these 
women.  
Gap in Knowledge Addressed  
Generally, suggested non-pharmacological methods utilized to treat HTN usually include change in diet 
and exercise, but  unfortunately, exercise is risky for HTN patients that experience  exaggerated 
sympathoexcitation in response to exercise  (6, 10, 18) . So, there is a lar ge gap in knowledge in regards 
to the best non -pharmacological method for reducing BP in HTN patients. As such, we propose a novel 
treatment that is in current use for pain disorders (12), but may serve as a promising treatment for HTN. 
Spinal cord stimulation (S CS) works by modulating afferent input at the dorsal column of the spinal cord 
and causes vasodilation in the peripheral blood vessels  (5). Therefore, the use of SCS can be an 
innovative technique to reduce systemic effects of sympathoexcitatory afferent feedback from the active 
skeletal muscle, and thereby increase peripheral vasodilation and reduce blood press ure (BP) in adults 
with HT N. This will be a pilot study and the generated data will justify conducting larger clinical trial s. 
Sex Differences in HTN  
The prevalence of HTN is higher in men until after menopause in women when the prevalence of HTN 
surpasses  that of age -matched men (23). In the world, 25% of adult women are hypertensive, and in the 
United States, >75% of women over 60  years of age are hypertensive  (4, 21) . Aging is associated with 
elevated sympathetic activity. As such, sympathetic activity was found to be lower in women than in 
men among subjects <49 yrs., but the same in men and women among those th at were ≥50 yrs (14). 
Importantly, sympathetic activity is greater in postmenopausal compared with age -matched 
premenopausal women (14). In summary, the prevalence of HTN is higher in older women and 
sympathetically mediated increases in BP may be of more importance, demonstrating the need for 
investigating sex differences in  the exercise blood pre ssure response in adults with  HTN.   
Exercise Pressor Reflex in HTN  
HTN can be characterized by chronic elevations in sympathetic nerve activity (13) which contributes to 
the abnormal augmented exercise pressor reflex (19). The afferent arm of this reflex is composed of 
mechanically (group III) and metabolically (group IV) sensitive skeletal mu scle afferents which are 
known to become overactive or more sensitive in HTN  (7, 15) . As such, the autonomic response to 
exercise is altered, generating exaggerated increases in BP, heart rate, and SVR. Therefore, the risk 
for experiencing a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event during or immediately after exercise is  
greatly ele vated  (6, 10, 18) . This circumstance is regrettable as it limits the safety of exercise as a

treatment for HTN; a treatment with demonstrated potential for lowering BP and improving 
cardiovascular health  (3).  
Current Treatments in HTN  
Despite the extensive list of major morbidity and mortality trials of antihypertensive agents  (20), 
guidelines remain inconsistent for HTN management. Although a large variety of pharmacologic agents 
that, alone and in combination, are highly effective in lowering BP, ~50% of adults with HTN cannot be 
controlled with the drug treatment a nd lifestyle modification alone  (1). Importantly, exercise is a 
treatment to lower BP and improve cardiovascular health, however with the increased risk of adverse 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events during or immediately following a bout of exer cise, it limits the 
safety of exercise as a prescription. Further, while antihypertensive methods are similar between men 
and women, HTN may be less well controlled in older women (23). There is, therefore, a critical need  to 
determine a non -pharmacological treatment that can be used as an adjunct to exerci se and lifestyle 
modifications for adults with HTN.  
Spinal Cord Stimulation  
Modulation of afferent feedback via  
SCS has been used successfully for 
decades as a treatment for chronic 
pain.  Each year, more than 14,000 
SCS implantations are performed 
worldwide (22). This proposal 
however, seeks to test S CS as a 
novel non -pharmacological therapy 
for adults with HTN. The putative 
mechanism is that lumbar SCS 
produces vasodilation in the 
vasculature of the lower limbs and 
feet, mediated by antidromic 
activation of sensory fibers and 
decreased sympathetic out flow(22). 
Initial experiments to investigate the 
influenc e of SCS on BP in young 
healthy , demonstrated that SCS is 
safe and effective in young healthy 
adults during exercise (Figure 2).  
This protocol will be the first to 
investigate the influence of epidural 
SCS on peripheral locomotor afferent 
feedback (group III/IV) during 
exercise in HTN and if there is a sex 
difference in the response to SCS.  
 
1. Specific Aims/Study Objectives  
Specific Aim 1  
To investigate the EPR during a lower -extremity dynamic exercise in postmenopausal women 
with HTN.  There is evidence to suggest that 1) premenopausal women have a blunted EPR compared 
with young men and postmenopausal women and 2) hormone therapy reduces t he EPR in 
postmenopausal women. Hypothesis : postmenopausal women with HTN, not receiving hormone 
therapy, will have a greater EPR compared with men with HTN during a lower -extremity exercise.  
Version Date: 11/27/2018   Page 7 of 20 
 Specific Aim 2  
To determine if lumbar epidural SCS reduces BP d uring the EPR in postmenopausal women 
with HTN.  Considerable evidence has accumulated over the last decade demonstrating that the EPR 
contributes appreciably to the abnormally augmented cardiovascular response to exercise in HTN. 
Hypothesis:  SCS will cause  a greater reduction in the EPR in hypertensive postmenopausal women 
compared with hypertensive men and this attenuation will be greater with high frequency stimulation.  
2. Investigational Device  
The Precision Spectra system will consist of a an external tria l (ETS) spinal cord stimulation system , 
temporary percutaneous leads  and lead extensions, each packaged as a separate kit. The 
percutaneous and surgical paddle leads function as a component of the Precision SCS system by 
delivering electrical stimulation to the nerve structures in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. Although 
this has typically been indicated for reductions in pain in chronic lumbar and lower leg pain patients, we 
will implant the leads in the same region of the lumbar spine, but will ass ess how spinal cord stimulation 
modulates blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance in adults with HTN . 
Features of the Precision spectra SCS System Include:  
 Stimulation electrode field navigation  
 32 independent current -controlled channels of stimulation (32 contacts + the implantable pulse 
generator)  
 Two 16 contact Infinion leads  
 High-range parameter capability  
 No detectable latex  
 
Leads  
The percutaneous leads function as a component of the Precision SCS system by delivery electri cal 
stimulation to the nerve structures in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord, resulting in an inhibition of 
pain sensation.  
Percutaneous Leads  
The Infinion™ 16 percutaneous lead is available in lengths of 50 cm and 70 cm. Each lead has 16 
contacts locat ed near the distal end. Each contact is 3 mm in length and is spaced 1 mm from the 
adjacent contact.  
The intended purpose of this device is to investigate if spinal cord stimulation of the lumbar spine can 
modulate blood pressure and systemic vascular resi stance in hypertension  patients. The physician will 
be provided with a new Precision Kit for each participant. The physician s that will be inserting the leads 
have been adequately trained to do so and are already performing this procedure at the University  of 
Minnesota  for chronic pain indications.  
3. Study Design  
 Study Design  
This is a single center study  conducted at the University of Minnesota , enrolling up to sixty subjects ( 30 
men and 30 post-menopausal women) . Subjects will be a assigned  to one of the two study arms, 
(Dynamic Exercise or Spinal C ord Stimulation)  and then crossover to the other arm after the initial 
assignment is complete.   However , if the screening  MRI/CT or blood work  determines the subject is not 
a candidate for spinal cord stimulation  or if the participant decides they would like to participate in the 
Version Date: 11/27/2018   Page 8 of 20 
 exercise arm of the study but not the spinal cord stimulation arm,  then they  will be assigned to the 
Dynamic Exercise  arm only.

 Screening and Baseline  
After consenting to the study, subject demographics and eligibility  will be confirmed by the principal 
investigator (PI). Subject Eligibility assessments include : 
 Vitals (blood pressure and heart rate), height and weight  
 Participants can be taking up to 2 medications on the Inclusion list in Medication table  
 Medical history  
 For Women: confirmation of menopause by FSH,  or history of oophorectomy  
 Complete blood count (CBC) and INR (determine any anticoagulation concerns)  
 Completion of Activity and Health questionnaire  
 VO 2 peak testing  
 Screening Lumbar MRI or CT  
 Patients  will be asked to track their medication u sing the pill count sheet  
      For women for whom menopause has not been confirmed: A urine pregnancy test  
  
A screening lumbar MRI  or CT  is done to ensure that there are no anatomical anomalies in or around 
the epidural area consistent with standard clinical prac tice that would prevent epidural stimulator lead 
placement. If the participant is contraindicated for MRI, they will have the option to undergo a CT scan 
to assess eligibility.  If the participant requests a medication before the MRI  or CT , a study team 
physician will be contacted and the medication will be prescribed and administered.  Medication such 
as, Ativan  or Valium (0.5 mg to 20 mg) will be prescribed to the participant. The participant will be 
asked to not consume solid foods for 6 hours prior to taking medication and liquids for 2 hours up to 
taking medication.  
Subjects will be assigned to one of the study arms  once screening is complete . However, if the MRI or 
CT determines they are not able to undergo spinal cord stimulation, they may only parti cipate in the 
Dynamic Exercise session.  
Screening for the study will continue until each study arm has 20 post-menopausal women and 20 age-
matched men, and to allow or subject attrition for a total of 60 enrolled subjects.

 Figure 4.  Protocol for Exercise and Spinal Cord Stimulation Session  
 
Spinal Cord Stimulat ion (SCS) Trial  Lead Placement  
SCS leads will be temporarily placed  in the lumbar/thoracic epidural space in a manner that is standard 
for the clinical placement of trial leads  in humans. Insertion of the lumbar SCS leads and arterial 
catheter will be conducted by qualified anesthesiologist  or neurosurgeon . 
SCS lead placement will occur  in a sterile environment. This is done using local anesthesia with (2%) 
lidocaine  or a similar drug  and fluoroscopy to guide lead placement. Subjects lay prone and their low 
back is injected with lidocaine to numb the area. Another needle is placed into t he epidural space within 
the spinal canal. Once the needle is properly in position, the SCS leads are passed through the needle 
and placed in the correct position via fluoroscopy (Figure 5A). A second lead may be placed in the 
same manner. Once the leads a re placed, they will be connected to an external trial stimulator that 
provides stimulation current to the implanted lead. Stimulation produces a light, often pleasant tingling 
sensation in the legs and back, also known as paresthesia. Once the placement i s complete, the 
needles are removed from the back and the stimulator leads left in place and 
secured with transparent tape (Figure 5B). Once the experiment is complete, 
the leads are removed by gently pulling them out  by the physician with a 
bandage applie d to the wound site.    
Arterial catheter placement  
An indwelling 20 gauge arterial catheter will be placed in the radial artery of 
the participant’s nondominant hand  by an anesthesiologist or an 
anesthesiology resident . The catheter will be placed (after an Allen's test 
demonstrates adequate ulnar blood flow) using aseptic technique via 
ultrasound guidance after local anesthesia with lidocaine.  It is flushed 
continuously at 3 cc/hr w/sterile saline.  
After electrode place ment, an arterial catheter is placed in the radial artery for 
intra-arterial BP recording. The subject s are then escorted to the exercise 
laboratory to start the exercise protocol  (described below) . 
Upon completion  of the study, th e arterial line will be removed  by a physician  
or a UMP  nurse  who is trained to in managing and removing arterial lines . Pressure will be held on the 
arterial site for 10 min.  These procedures will take place in the Phillips Wangensteen Building (PWB) M 
Health  Clinical Research Un it (CRU ). 
Anesthesiologists have extensive experience with arterial line and lead placement and removal as well 
as blood draws.  Anesthesiology residents are well trained to place arterial lines and have experience 
with this procedure.  
Transport of participants from surgical suite to exercise suite . The leads will be secured to the 
participant’s  skin via transparent adhesive ( tegaderm ) (Figure 5B), to have a visual of the implant site at 
all times. The arterial line will be secured to the arm via teg aderm, a gauze roll or coban upon physician 
discretion. The arterial line will be connected to one of the transducers of a portable flowtrac device  Figure 5A . Fluoroscopy

 (Edwards Life Sciences, Irving CA)  for continuous blood pressure monitoring during transport . The 
second tra nsducer of the flowtrac device will be connected to an AD equipment (ADInstruments 
Inc.,Colorado Springs, CO) to measure the pressure waveform online and later help with the BP data 
analysis offline . The participant will be transported via wheelchair to th e PWB M Health  CRU  via a 
service corridor which allows for aboth a direct rouite and one that is out of the general public walkway. 
The PWB M Health CRU is where the exercise lab is located.  The participant will be escorted  by the PI 
of the study  and an anesthesiologist, anesthesiology resident or Dr. Park. Continuous blood pressure 
and heart rate will be monitored throughout the exercise portion of the study.  The PI has extensive 
experience with exercise studies in clinical populations , in particular, th ose with heart conditions .  
Exercise 30% VO2 Peak with Stimulation  
Exercise takes place on a cycle ergometer where the  subject will cycle at 30% of peak work. In order to 
further stimulate group III/IV afferents, thigh tourniquets are placed on the proxima l thigh bilaterally and 
inflated intermittently to pressures of 80 mmHg. The stimulator frequency is turned off, and on at two 
different frequencies (100 Hz and 1 KHz) (randomized) throughout the exercise. Blood pressure, heart 
rate, ventilation (VE) and g as exchange are measured throughout the exercise. Cardiac output, 
catecholamines and lactate are measured intermittently throughout. The rationale for these measures is 
described below.  
After the exercise, the SCS leads and radial arterial catheter are re moved . 
4. Measures  
Peak Oxygen Consumption Testing (VO2  peak) and submaximal exercise  (Both studies)  A modified 
graded cycle ergometry protocol will be used to determine workload during the visit. Intensity will 
increase by 40 watts/3 minutes until volitional  fatigue  (9).  
After SCS lead insertion  on a subsequent visit , subject s will be escorted to the exercise laboratory 
where they will exercise on a cycle ergometer at a low intensity (30% VO2peak)  (8)..  
Cardiac Output and SVR ( Both Studies): Cardiac output (CO) will be measured using noninvasively 
with device Nexfin (Edwards Life Sciences, Irving CA)  during the dynamic exercise session and 
invasively with the flowtrac device during the dynamic exercise and stimulation session  (Edwards Life 
Sciences, Irving CA) . Cardiac output will be measured to provide a complete picture of vascular 
resistance, SVR=BP/CO.  
Gas Exchange and Venti lation (VE) ( Both Studies): VO2, volume of carbon dioxide produced (VCO2), 
and VE will be measured using a low resistance open circuit automated metabolic system (Medical 
Graphics Co., St. Paul, MN) .Gas exchange and VE parameters will provide information r egarding 
exercise performance and metabolic workload during exercise testing. These measures are indicative 
of health status in patients  (16).  
Perceived Exertion and Dyspnea ( Both Studies ): Measure ments to determine  if perceived exertion and 
dyspnea are reduced with SCS. Dyspnea will be measured using the modified Borg analog/visual (0 -
10) scale  (2). Perceived exertion will be measured by rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale on the 
Borg (6 -20) scale  (2). Labored breathing (dyspnea) and sensations of fatigue (perceived exertion) are 
two common complaints in patients with CVD.  
Intra-arterial BP ( Spinal Cord Stimulation Stud y): This catheter allows for continuous real -time intra -
arterial mea surement of beat -to-beat BP. Blood pressure is the primary outcome measure. As such, 
intra-arterial  BP recording is considered the most accurate (17).  
Version Date: 11/27/2018   Page 15 of 20 
 Catecholamines , lactate and blood gases (Spinal Cord Stimulation Study ): The arterial catheter 
provides access to arte rial blood for these measurements. Catecholamines (epinephrine, 
norepinephrine and dopamine) are a measurement of sympathetic activity , lactate is a metabolic by -
product from muscle contraction  and blood gases will provide information on arterial O 2 and CO 2 during 
exercise .  
ECG (Both Studies):  Subject s are instrumented with a 12 lead ECG for the measurement of heart rate 
and rhythm. These measurements are crucial for understanding if SCS reduces sympathetic activity 
and metabolite production during exercis e. 
5. Analysis Plan   
General Statistical Methods.  Subjects  will undergo submaximal exercise and ergoreceptor activation 
with SCS at different frequency parameters to target afferent neural feedback. Continuous variables will 
be presented as mean s ±SD. Categorical variables will be presented as number (% population). 
Distribution normality will be assessed and transformations or non -parametric methods will be used as 
appropriate. Analyses will be conducted with SPSS (v19 or higher).  
Primary Outcome  Analysis.  The one -minute mean BP measured at the end of the three frequency 
challenges will be compared using a repeated measures (on subject) ANCOVA model. The primary 
hypothesis will test if the pooled effect of the active frequencies (f1, f2) is signif icantly different from the 
BP with the device inactive. Post hoc comparisons of the individual frequencies will also be conducted 
as a part of the optimization approach. It is not known if the dose -response relationship is monotonic 
(i.e., higher frequency  is superior in all subjects). Therefore, further analysis will be done to determine 
the association between the BP and frequency of SCS to reveal the dose -response curve.  
Additional analysis will be conducted on an age -matched subgroup consisting of 10 p ostmenopausal 
women and 10 age -matched men.    
6. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 Data  
Authorized study staff and investigators who have gone through HIPAA, CITI, and other data security 
training through the University of Minnesota will be collecting, managing , and analyzing data. 
Cardiovascular variables will be monitored through by use of an electrocardiogram, an intra -arterial 
catheter  using flowtrac (Edward Life Sciences)  and data from these instruments will be outputted to  
PowerLab  (AD instruments) for of fline analysis . Cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance will be 
measured and recorded by using the flowtrac device (Edwards Life  Sciences, Irving CA) . Gas 
exchange and ventilation variables by use of a low resistance open cir cuit automated metabolic system. 
After each study visit, subject data will be labeled by way of a random numbering system in order to 
anonymize the data. The data will be stored and locked in a filing cabinet. There will be a list that will 
link random num bering with the subject names in a computer file on a University of Minnesota 
computer  that is secured with needing a password to access. Only study team members will be able to 
access this data.   
In accordance with governmental regulations, study records will be kept for a minimum of three years 
following the completion of the study. After that time and if there is no longer a need for the records, the 
records will be destroyed.  
 Confidentiality  
Each subject’s data will be coded so that it is not identifia ble to the person. The code will be secured in 
a locked file and on computer which will have a secure password.  Blood samples will be stored in the 
Genomics Center in coded format.

 Potential Risks  
 Maximal Exercise Testing Protocol:  A graded exercise protocol will be used on an upright cycle 
ergometer to volitional fatigue. The protocol will be discontinued immediately if any one of the 
following occur:  
1) subject  desire to stop,  
2) drop in systolic blood pressure > 10 mmHg with increasing workload when accompanied 
with evidence of ischemia,  
3) severe angina,  
4) sustained ventricular tachycardia,  
5) ST segment elevation > 1.0 mm in leads without diagnostic Q waves,  
6) technical  difficulties in monitoring ECG or systolic blood pressure or  
7) completion of data collection.  
 
The protocol will also be discontinued if any two of the following occur:  
1) failure of heart rate to increase with increasing workload,  
2) plateau in VO 2,  
3) RER > 1.10,  
4) perceived exertion > 18 (Borg 6 -20 point scale),  
5) systolic blood pressure > 250 mmHg, and 6) increased nervous system symptoms (e.g. 
ataxia, dizziness or syncope).  
 
Risks of maximal exercise include : leg pain and fatigue, shortness  of breath and general 
exhaustion.  
 Spinal Cord Stimulator Placement:  Placement of spinal leads  will occur under local anesthesia 
(2% lidocaine). Therefore , minimal pain will be felt with electrode placement. There may be 
bruising or bleeding at the needle puncture site. There is a risk for infection at the insertion site 
which is extremely rare in healthy patients. Soreness at the needle site may occur once the 
local wears off. This is typically very minor and either requires no treatment or simple over -the-
counter treatments. On an extremely rare occasion, nerve root/spinal cord trauma with the 
placement may occur that may lead to paralysis.  
o There is also a less than 1% risk of dural puncture and a “spinal headache.” Spinal 
headaches may be present for 1 -5 days and usually resolve with conservative therapy 
(rest, fluids, and analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen). A procedure known 
as a “blood patch” may be needed where the subject’s own blood will be injected using 
similar techniques as the placement of the leads . This procedure is safe and very 
effective in treating spinal headaches. This risk is lower when the procedure is 
performed by a highly experienced individual.  
o There is no increased risk of walking with a spinal cord stimulator. Indeed, walking 
distance is used as a measure for patient outcomes with spinal cord stimulation (11). 
Less is known about exercise and SCS. In our previous study at the Mayo Clinic, 
however, patients were able to endure an intense ischemic exercise with SCS without 
adverse events (unpublished).  
 Placement of arterial catheters:  Risks of placing a catheter include infection or clot. These 
complications are extremely rare and unlikely to occur in ambulatory subjects undergoing 
catheterization for a few hours. A more common complication is a hematoma  at the site of the 
Version Date: 11/27/2018   Page 17 of 20 
 catheter placement. The physician  may use ultrasound to guide the placement of the catheter, 
which significantly reduces this risk.  
 Surface Electrodes (electrocardiography, ECG): The adhesive from the electrodes may cause 
slight irritat ion to the skin. In rare occasions, the adhesive electrodes may cause an allergic 
reaction.  
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Subjects will undergo an MRI safety screening questionnaire to 
ensure they have no contraindications to the MRI environment. This propo sal includes post -
menopausal women only, however  pregnancy  screening will be done  prior to  the lumbar  MRI 
only if menopausal status hasn’t been confirmed at the time of screening.    
 X-ray, CT,  and Fluoroscopy: The placement of spinal leads  will occur under fluoroscopy. 
Subjects will be exposed to low -levels of radiation.  The amount of radiation that will be used 
has a low risk of harmful effects.  The average amount of radiation that the average person 
would receive from fluoroscopy  is approximately 1/3  (1mSv) and CT is 2  and 2/3  times  
(8mSv)  of that received from natural sources of radiation by a Minnesota resident  in one 
year (3 mSv).     
 Sedative Use: With the use of sedatives a participant may experience dizziness, daytime 
drowsiness, dry mouth, change in appetite, blurred vision, diarrhea, or constipation, burning or 
tingling in the hands, arms or legs and unsteadiness.  In rare case s of over -sedation , 
cardiovascular or respiratory depression may occur.  
 Risks of transport from hospital to PWB CRU are minimized by: the study team, including the PI 
and physician transporting the participant safely between the two buildings using the service 
corridor which allows for both a direct route and one that is out of the general public walkway. 
Details of the transport of part icipant are located in section 3 of protocol.  
 Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigators will observe for adverse events at each session and conduct an interview at of 
each session to determine whether an adverse event has occurred since the previous sessi on.   In 
addition, a follow -up phone call will be placed to each subject 2 -3 days after the completion of the 
exercise and stimulation session to determine if any adverse events had occurred after the 
participant left the study.  
 Serious Adverse Events (SA E) –  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence , whether related to the study device or 
procedure or not, that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
o Refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event: it 
does not refer to and event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
 Requires hospitalization > 24 hours  
 Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
 Results in fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
The relationship of the SAE to the study device and/or procedure will be evaluated by then 
investigator according to the following definitions:  
Version Date: 11/27/2018   Page 18 of 20 
  Unrelated:  AE is not related to the study -specific devices or procedures  
 Probably Related: AE has a strong temperal relationship to the study –specific devices or 
procedures, or another etiology is unlikely  
 Unknown: Relationship of the study -specific devices or proc edure and alternative etiology is 
unknown  
 
Data for t hose SAEs determined to be “probably related” to the study devices or procedures , whether 
“expected” or “unexpected” will be collected and  an emergent DSMB meeting will be held to determine 
if the study stopping rule criteria has been met. (section 7.4 and 7.5)  
 
Otherwise all SAEs will be reported in summary form at the time of IRB continuing review.    
 Unexpected Adverse Device Events (UA DE)  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously  identified in nature, 
severity , or degree of incidence in the investigati onal plan or application (including a supplementary 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Problems/events that are unanticipated and involve ne w or increased risk to subjects should be 
reported to the IRB within 5 working days if, in the opinion of the PI, they are possibly, probably or 
definitely related to the research procedures.  
 
Those serious, unanticipated problems/events that the PI deems  unlikely or not related and do NOT 
meet the IRB’s definition of UPIRTSO and should be reported in summary form at the time of IRB 
continuing review.  
 
 Expected Adverse Events (AE)  
Those adverse events identified as Potential Risks (section 9.2) will be co llected and reported in 
summary form at the time of IRB continuing review     Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The DSMB will consist of one physician, one faculty member familiar with spinal  stimulation and one 
biostatistician. None of the Board members will be directly involved with the study.  The DSMB will meet 
semiannually  to review all reportable events .  If a SAE related to the study devices or procedures occur, 
an emergent DSMB meeting will held to assess whether the event meets th e stopping rule criteria.  
 
 Stopping Rules  
If a SAE occurs, that is deemed by the PI as being related to the study devices  or study procedure ; 
the study will be put on hold and reviewed by the DSMB to determine whether the study can continue.  
    Protocol Deviations/Violations  
Any deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an 
emergency shall be reported to the IRB within 5 working days after the emergency occurred. 
Otherwise, deviations not meeting UP IRTSO criteria  should be reported in summary form at the time of 
IRB continuing review.

1. Background  
 
The human skin aging process is characterized by thinning of the dermis, atrophy of the 
extracellular matrix, and reduced collagen synthesis [1]. Loss of collagen in the dermis is of 
aesthetic concern, as it is the main structural suppo rt in the dermis and its loss results in skin 
laxity. Photo -damaged skin, mostly due to UVR, causes degradation of elastic fibers , which is 
histologically seen as disorganized tangles of elastin. Additionally, as we age, skin tends to 
appear more dry due t o its poor hydration and turgor capacity [1]. The use of minimally invasive 
aesthetic treatments in reducing signs of aging has been gaining in popularity over surgical 
treatments in recent years [2]. Several energy types including, laser, radiofrequency, infr ared, 
and ultrasound, have been developed for facial rejuvenation [3]. These treatments induce 
controlled thermal damage to the dermis and cause collagen contraction and neocollagenesis 
resulting in skin tightening over several months [2]. The effects of facial rejuvenation treatments 
on collagen have been well defined in literature,  however, the role of elastin in facial 
rejuvenation has not been well studied.  
 
In facial skin aging, the skin loses elasticity and begins to sag. Minimally invasive bipolar 
radiofrequency produces a controlled thermal injury in a fractional manner witho ut damaging 
the dermal -epidermal junction, epidermis or subcutis [5]. Radiofrequency, unlike lasers, are 
chromophore -independent providing better penetration than lasers, and spare sweat glands, 
sebaceous glands, and hair follicles [5,6] .  
 
The InMode Morpheus 8 System is a bipolar fractional radiofrequency device which uses 
microneedles and thermal heat to stimulate neocollagenesis and neoelasto gene sis.  
 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   This study intends to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the In Mode Morpheus 8 System to 
treat skin on the lower face and assess its effect on skin quality and dermal lines.  This device 
has been FDA cleared for full body subdermal adipose tissue remodeling . 
 
There are alternative treatments that have demonstrated surface changes of the skin and 
improvement  in dermal lines. We feel that the In Mode Morpheus 8 may be able to produce 
clinically significant improvement in the quality of facial and neck skin  as well as fine lines and 
wrinkles  in an office -based setting with limited downtime.  This device has been used in the 
Department of Plastic Surgery clinic off -label for the past six months for this purpose.  
Additionally, our research team conducted a study using Ulthera, an ultrasound device, 
approximately 10 years ago; the results of this study led to its FD A approval for the treatment 
of lax neck skin.  We are also finishing a study looking at another bipolar radiofrequency, 
microneedling device.   
 
2. Purpose  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a bipolar fractional 
radiofrequency treatment via use of the In Mode Morpheus 8 System to achieve skin texture and 
quality change and to treat  facial fine lines and wrinkles  of the lower face .  
 
3. Study D esign  
 
This is a single center, unblinded, non -randomized, non -controlled study designed to follow a 
total of up to thirteen  (13) qualified and consenting subjects receiv ing 4 bipolar fractional 
radiofrequency microneedling treatment of the lower face, once every 4-6 weeks for a total of  
4 treatments , under an IRB approved protocol. Following these  treatments, patients will have 
follow -up visits at 3 -months,  and 6 -months post -treatment.  The effects of  bipolar fractional 
radiofrequency treatments v ia the In Mode Morpheus8 System will be determined by subjective 
and objective analysis through clinician and subject assessments.   
 
Overall assessment of clinical outcome and safety will be based on clinic visits and evaluation of 
pre- and post -procedural photos.  These photos wil l be identifiable full face photos, and subjects 
will be adequately informed of such.  One unblinded clinician’s assessments of satisfaction will 
be characterized using the Lemperle Wrinkle Assessment Scale, a four -point Allergan ski n fine 
line scale and a four -point Allergan Skin Roughness scale at baseline, 3 month follow up and 6 
month follow up visits. The five -point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) will also be 
used at 3 month and 6 month follow up visits. Additionally, evaluation of pre - and post - 
procedural photos will be performed compar ing baseline and follow ups by blinded raters.  In 
conjunction with standard and close -up photography, subjects will also have photos taken using 
the VISIA Imaging system and will underg o high -resolution ultrasonography, transepidermal 
water loss (TEWL) measurements and/or BTC 2000 measurements for exploratory purposes. 
High -resolution ultrasound will be utilized for assessment of skin thickness and density. TEWL 
measurements are taken vi a the Bio Aquaflux and will be used to evaluate barrier function of 
the skin epidermal layer to determine progress of epidermal healing after treatment and BTC 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   2000 will be used to measure skin laxity, viscoelastic deformation, stiffness, energy absorption , 
elasticity and deformation values of skin.  Additionally consenting subjects will undergo skin 
biopsies at the treatment site to better qualify the measurements and results from the items 
mentioned above. Micro -biopsies using 0.33mm size punches will be u sed to extract core 
tissues pre - and post -treatment for histological evaluation (tissue structure, elastin, collagen 
and hyaluronic acid expression) and gene expression assessment (elastin, other major ECM 
molecules and elastin related genes).  
 
From these exploratory procedures the improvement in skin quality and dermal lines of the 
lower face and jawline can be evaluated in comparison to pre -treatment assessments.  
 
4. Study Population  
 
This is a single -site study at UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in the Department of 
Plastic Surgery. Up to thirteen  (13) subjects will be enrolled and treated .  
 
4.1. Subject Enrollment  
Subjects who are interested in treatment for facial fine lines and  wrinkles  will be recruited 
for the study.  Prospective patients will be screened to check if they are acceptable 
candidates . Subjects meeting eligibility requirements will be scheduled for a n official  
screening visit. Additionally, if subjects express an interest in the procedure during a clinic 
appointment with Dr. Kenkel or Dr. Culver, he or she may discuss the study with them and 
assess the treatment area.  If a subject is deemed a good candidate, Dr. Kenkel or Dr. C ulver 
will connect the patient with a research coordinator or delegated member of their research 
team to answer any further questions. Potential subjects will have the study explained to 
them, will be asked about their willingness to be involved in the stu dy, and their willingness 
to sign an informed consent form. Included in this interview will be questioning from the 
investigator or staff member about any privacy concerns the individual may have . 
 
4.2. Informed Consent Form  
An IRB-approved  informed  consent  form  (ICF),  explaining  the purpose,  design,  risks  and 
duration  of the study,  will be given  to each  candidate  subject  before  participation  in any study  
procedures.   The candidate  subject  will be given  as much  time  as needed  to read  the ICF and 
will have  the opportunity  to have  any study -related  questions  answered  to their  satisfaction  
prior  to signing  the ICF.  An original  signed  copy  for each  subject  participating  in the study  will 
be retained  in the study  file and each  subject  will receive  a signed  copy.   By signing  the 
consent  form,  subjects  indicate  that they  are willing  to have  their  full-face  photograph  and 
acknowledge  that these  photos  may  be used  for scientific  publication.  If the subjects  decline  
permission  to be photogr aphed,  they  may  not participate  in the study  since  the photographic  
documentation  of treatment  outcome  is an important  measure  of evaluation.  The candidate  
subject  will be ineligible  to participate  in this study  without  a signed  ICF.

studies and the other for gene expression studies  
a. Biopsies will only be taken at th e first Treatment Visit, no others, to be used 
for baseline measurements.  
 
The procedure will be performed in our clinic following standard of care procedures. After 
allowing 10 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect, the skin will be cleansed and prepp ed 
with an antiseptic. A trained staff member will apply a topical anesthetic (benzocaine, 
lidocaine, tetracaine) and shortly thereafter a local anesthetic (1% xylocaine with 
epinephrine or equivalent) will be injected for additional pain control. The trea tment 
parameters will be determined by the treating physician and will be based on the patients’  
skin texture, thickness, and lines. In general, the skin of the lower face will be treated at 
several depths , with two successive passes per depth, ranging fro m 1-4 mm. In most areas 
all four depths will be used except when the skin is thin where depths of 1 -3 mm will be 
utilized. In most cases a 12 - and 24 -point tip will be utilized and then followed by the use of 
the resurfacing tip.  Energy settings will be chosen by the treating physician based on the 
patients’  skin texture, thickness, and lines.  The settings will range from 20 -40.   
 
 The following activities will be performed on all subjects:  
 
1. The study treatment (bipolar fractional  radiofrequency) per study treatment 
guidelines provided

11.7. Imaging Procedures  
Prior to  photography procedures, clinic personnel will ensure that subjects have a clean face 
and neck with no makeup as described in the study procedures. Subjects will remove any 
jewelry from the area(s) to be photographed and equilibrate for at least 15 minutes  to 
ambient conditions within the clinic before any photographs are taken. Subjects will be 
provided with a headband or hair tie to keep hair away from the face .  
 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   Subjects will be instructed to adopt neutral, non -smiling expressions with their eyes gently  
closed for VISIA. Subjects will be carefully positioned for each photograph, directly facing 
the camera for the center view and turned at a 45° angle for the right and left side views.  
1 VISIA Complexion Analysis  
Digital images will be taken of each applicable subject with fine lines and wrinkles 
on the face using the VISIA Complexion Analysis System at baseline , 3-months 
post -treatment, and 6 -months post -treatment. Each subject will have a total of 3 
full-face ima ges taken (right side, left side, and center view) using the following 
lighting conditions:  
Standard lighting 1: visible (bright)  
Standard lighting 2: visible (flat)  
Cross -polarized : 
UV-NF 
2 NIKON D7100

utilized for evaluation of fine lines and wrinkles. These photographs will be taken 
utilizing the Nikon D7100 at baseline, 3 -months post -treatment, and 6 -months 
post -treatment.  
 
11.8. Noninvasive Procedures  
Biox Aquaflux  will be used to measure transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements 
which evaluate barrier function of the skin epidermal layer to determine progress of 
epidermal healing after treatment. The BTC 2000 will be used to measure skin laxity, 
viscoelastic de formation, stiffness, energy absorption, elasticity, and deformation values of 
skin.  All procedures will be performed  on the submental area.   
 
11.9. Skin Biopsies  
Two 0.33 mm punch biops ies will be taken from the cheek adjacent to the lateral upper lip 
at Visit  2, Visit 6 and Visit 7. Prior to biopsy the area will be cleaned with alcohol and a local 
numbing agent, 0.5% -1% Lidocaine with epinephrine, will be used to anesthetize the area 
being biopsied . If bleeding is present, pressure will be held on the biopsy site until bleeding 
stops.  Immediately after collection, biopsies for histology and gene expression will be put in 
4% PFA and RNA -Later solution, respectively. Biopsies will be stored in a cooler  for transfer 
to the Plastic Surgery Research Lab at UTSW for molecular analysis.  
 
11.10.  Blinded Evaluation  
Blinded evaluation will be performed by three qualified, non -treating clinicians to 
determine if the InMode Morpheus8 System is effective in improving the  appearance of 
facial and neck skin quality and dermal lines.  
 
At study conclusion, the Principal Investigator will select three blinded , physician  evaluators 
to assess photos of subjects taken pre - and post -treatment.  The evaluators will be trained 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   by the PI or research team member  on the grading scales in order to independently review 
photographs for each subject.  The evaluators  will be  blinded to subject information and will 
only know that the study consisted of multiple treatment visits an d follow up visits at 3 
months and 6 months. They will be provided a set of photos taken at three different visits  – 
pre-treatment , 3 month post -treatment and 6 month post -treatment  – in a randomized and 
unidentifiable order. No information will be provide d that may allow them to determine the 
baseline from follow up imaging. Evaluators will be asked to assess the  sets of pictures  using 
the Lemperle Wrinkle, Allergan Fine Lines and Allergan Skin Roughness scales . After 
completion of the scales, the raters  will be unblinded and asked to complete the Clinical 
Global Aesthetics Improved Scale (CGAIS).  
 
The source documents will be prepared and distributed to the blinded evaluators by a 
member of the study staff.  A decreased score for each assessment will indicate an 
improvement  for the indicated parameters.  
 
12. Statistical Methods of Analysis  
This initial study will include change from baseline analysis.  
 
The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be a paired comparison of baseline to all 
applicable post -baseline time points using data obtained from transepidermal water loss 
assessments, high resolution ultrasonography, BTC 2000 measurements, biops y results, and 3D 
imaging results.  Photographs and 3D video of treated skin at follow -up visits will be compared 
to baseline for blinded scoring evaluations.  Mean of the change from baseline (defined as post -
baseline value minus baseline value) will be estimated at post -baseline time points for 
applicable parameters.  
 
The following will be calculated and re ported for each evaluation parameter at the applicable 
post -baseline time point(s):  
Percent mean change from 
baseline =  (visit mean score – baseline mean score) 
x 100  
baseline mean score  
 
For Clinician ’s Global Aesthetic Improvement Assessment, the null hypothesis that the mean 
score is equal to 4 (no change) will be tested.  
 
13. Non -Significant Risk Determination  
In accordance with the definition of “Significant Risk Device” provided in the U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations 21 CFR 812.3, the study device to be used in this research study has been 
determined to be a Non -Significant Risk (NSR) device based on the following:  
a)  It is not an implant  
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   b)  It is not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human 
life and do not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of 
a subject  
c)  It is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or  
     treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health  
d)  Use of the device poses no risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject  
 
14. Device Description  
The In Mode Morpheus8 System is a minimally invasive bipolar radiofrequency (RF) 
microneedling device FDA -cleared for full -body adipose tissue remodeling.  The fractional RF 
device, with adjustable penetration depth and energy delivery, contains 12 -24 coated needles.  
During treatment, these needles penetrate and deliver thermal energy into the subdermal 
tissue, leading to coagulation of fat and contraction o f the reticular dermis and surrounding 
connective tissue.  Additionally, it is theorized that the thermal injury caused by the RF energy 
initiates the wound healing process, stimulating neocollagenesis, elastogenesis, and 
angiogenesis.

15. Potential Risks  
Blistering, burning, and infection: (Rare)  
A crust, blister or superficial wound can occur at the treatment area.  The risk of 
infection will be minimized by proper wound care.  
 
Bruising:  (Rare)  
A mild bruising may occur at the treatment area as a result of radiofrequency 
exposure. This is usually transient and resolves in a few hours to few days.  
 
Transient edema and/or erythema : (Occasionally)  

IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   May develop within the irradiated areas but are usually temporary and fade within 
24-72 hours.  
  
Pigmentary changes: (Rare)  
Radiofrequency exposure can cause pigmentary changes such as hyper - (and 
hypopigm entation. Although this is usually temporary, it may be permanent on 
rare occasions. Sun avoidance and/or the use of a total sun block (SPF 30 or higher) 
will help minimize the intensity and duration of any pigmentary changes.  
 
Scarring: (Rare)  
As with any form of energy exposure, there is a small risk of scarring. However, 
this is minimized by proper technique and wound care.  
 
Allergic Reaction: (Rare)  
There is a possibility of an allergic or toxic reaction to anesthesia used to numb 
the areas. Subject s will be questioned with regard to any history of allergies and 
carefully monitored for signs of allergic reaction.  
 
Biopsy  
Risks associated with biopsy include: 1) scarring - a small risk of scarring, which can be 
mitigated by proper technique and wound care; 2) allergic reaction - there is a possibility of an 
allergic or toxic reaction to anesthesia used to numb the areas. Subjects will be questioned with 
regard to any history of allergies and carefully monitored for signs of allergic reaction . 
 
Photogra phy 
The subject may be uncomfortable with sitting still for an extended period of 
time or from turning his/her body in various positions. Subjects may be sensitive 
to the bright and repeating flashes from the camera, which can sometimes cause 
headaches, ir ritation of the eyes, discomfort, aftereffects such as seeing spots, 
and in rare cases, could stimulate a migraine headache or epileptic seizure.  
 
Photographs include a risk of identification, as these will be full face photos. 
Privacy will be protected to  the greatest extent possible. Photos will only be 
identified by a unique subject identification number that contains no personal 
identifying information. All photos will be stored on a password secure drive, 
with only access by research personnel. For res earch purposes, photos may be 
used in scientific publications.  
 
Noninvasive procedures (exploratory)  
1. Biox Aquaflux will be used to measure transepidermal  water loss (TEWL) 
measurements which evaluate barrier function of the skin epidermal layer 
to determine progress of epidermal healing after treatment. The standard 
time for TEWL measurements should take approximately 5 minutes.  
 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted    
2. The BTC 2000 will be use d to measure skin laxity, viscoelastic deformation, 
stiffness, energy absorption, elasticity, and deformation values of skin. The 
standard time for BTC 2000 should take approximately 5 minutes.   
 
3. The DUB Skin Scanner, a high -resolution ultrasound, will be  used to assess 
skin thickness, epidermal thickness,  and skin density. The standard time 
for DUB should take approximately 5 minutes.  
 
All these test s are considered noninvasive , and no risks are anticipated.  
 
16. Potential Benefits  
Subjects may benefit by hav ing an overall improvement in quality and texture of the skin as well 
as the presence of dermal lines of the lower face. There may be a benefit to the medical 
community by demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a new technology in the 
management of skin quality of the lower face and jawline as well in the treatment of dermal 
lines .  This technology may have advantages over existing technologies currently in use (lasers, 
ultrasound, etc.) because of its combination of bipolar fractional radiofrequency and 
microneedling technology. This technology may lead to better clinical outcomes  for an 
understudied area.  
 
17. Adverse Events  
17.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or 
other persons,  whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect (defined 
below) on health or safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused  by, or 
associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol; or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, s afety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that:  
a) led to death,  
b) resulted in life -threatening illness or injury  
c) resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function  
d) resulted in in hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
e)   resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to 
body structure or body function, or  
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   f) led to fetal distress, fetal death, congenital abnormality,  or birth defect  
 
17.2. Reporting  
Adverse events, and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) are collected from the 
time of subject consent until the subject exits the study. A description of the adverse event 
or device event, date of onset, severity, action taken, relations hip to study treatment and 
outcome are documented in the case report form.   
 
The Investigator will submit to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated adverse 
device effect (UADE)) as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days afte r 
the investigator first learns of the event (CFR 812.150(a)(1)).  
 
18. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring  
For this protocol, which involves the use of a non -significant risk device, the Investigator will be 
responsible for the conduct of the study including accrual, subject experience, attrition, 
patterns of expected adverse events and/or unexpected adverse ev ents, any protocol 
deviations or violations, and any changes in the risk/benefit analysis.   
 
Subjects will be asked about any adverse events throughout the study by the study staff. 
Subjects will be asked to contact the study staff if adverse events devel op between visits.  An 
unscheduled visit will be arranged so that the Investigator can clinically evaluate and 
photograph these findings. All subjects will be discontinued from the study if their problem 
remains unchanged/becomes worse. The Investigator ca n decide to stop the study if he/she 
believes that the participants’ participation is no longer safe or if another treatment may be 
more helpful. The IRB or FDA may stop the research for the safety of the participants.  These 
adverse events will be documen ted and reported as required for compliance with applicable 
regulations.   
 
All study records and information will be identified by the subject number. All subject 
identifiers will be removed from all documents. The link between subject name and study ID 
number will be kept in separate password -protected files at the study site. Documents 
containing identifying information will be kept in locked files in the research staff’s locked 
office. All electronic study data will be password protected with access lim ited to members of 
the research team. No direct identifying information will be shared with any outside entities, 
unless required by regulatory agencies (FDA and IRB).  Electronic data (electronic data entry - 
Case Report Forms) , if used , will be password protected.   
 
Photographs of the subject’s face will be taken at Enrollment/Treatment and Follow -Up  
visits. These photographs will be identified by subject numbers. Subject confidentiality will be 
protected to the greatest extent possible.  Quantitative s urface area assessments will be done 
on lateral 3D images taken at baseline and compared with 3D images obtained at all follow -up 
visits.  
 
IM Redacted    
IM Redacted   This study will be performed in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act. These guideline s will be followed specifically with regards to the privacy and confidentiality 
of subject care and study records.  Personnel associated with Investigator’s office and the 
governing Institutional Review Board, have the right to review the data, including p hotographs, 
collected during this study.   
 
19. Protocol Deviations  
Emergency deviations (deviations necessary to avoid immediate apparent harm or protect life 
or physical well -being of subjects or others) and major deviations as defined by the reviewing 
IRB w ill be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of occurrence. All deviations will be 
tracked and summarized in the progress report for the next continuing IRB review.  
 
20. Sources of Research Material  
Demographics and medical history will include age, gend er, weight, height, BMI, skin type, 
recent sun exposure, allergies, current medications, major illnesses, photographs, adverse 
events and treatment. Additionally, ultrasound images, TEWL measurements, OTC images, BTC 
2000 measurements, and biopsies will be  obtained.  
 
High resolution ultrasound will be used to assess skin thickness and density. The standard time 
for use of high -resolution ultrasound should take approximately 5 minutes. Transepidermal 
water loss (TEWL) measurements will be used to evaluate ba rrier function of the skin epidermal 
layer to determine progress of epidermal healing after treatment. The standard time for TEWL 
measurements should take approximately 5 minutes. The BTC 2000 will be used to measure 
skin laxity, viscoelastic deformation, stiffness, energy absorption, elasticity, and deformation 
values of skin. The standard time for BTC 2000 should take approximately 5 minutes.  
 
Biopsies will be taken using 0.33mm biopsy punches of the submental area. Biopsies will allow 
investigators to co rrelate changes seen in skin measurements with histology and gene 
expression. Time for two biopsies will take approximately five minutes. Biopsies for histology 
will be fixed immediately after collection in 4% PFA followed by paraffin embedding. Biopsies 
for gene expression will be put in RNA -Later solution and transferred to the Plastic Surgery 
Research Lab for gene expression analysis. Whole genome sequencing will not be performed, 
we will only be analyzing proteins and RNA expression related to collagen,  elastin, and the 
extracellular matrix production.

2.0 Background
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of disorders charaterized by progressive 
pancytopenia due to impaired cellular differentiation and increased apoptosis, with a tendency to convert to acute leukemia [1]. The disease typically affects individuals over 65 years of age, and it is thought to result from multiple mutations affecting the hematopoietic stem cell. There is a wide clinical spectrum of MDS ranging from moderate anemia with normal neutrophil and platelet counts, to frank leukemia with a clinical course that can range from a few months to many years. Treatment options are limited. Only bone marrow transplantation offers a cure although there are significant treatment-related adverse events that can result from this procedure [2].
In the U.S. there are currently 2 drugs approved for the treatment of (non 5q-) MDS: azacitidine and 
decitabine (referred to collectively as hypomethylating agents). Both drugs are active although the objective response rates they produce are low [3]. In the case of azacitidine a recent large randomized study demonstrated a survival benefit for azacitidine-treated patients compared to those who received conventional care (including best supportive care) [4]. Although either of these drugs are among the best availabe outside clinical trials, they are not curative and typically patients relapse either on therapy or shortly after completion of therapy.  SGI-110 is a second generation hypomethylating agent with significantly increased activity than azacitidine or decitabine and is being investigated at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC Protocol # 2010-0615).
These patients who have either not responded to or relapsed from treatment with hypomethylating agents 
carry a dismal prognosis with a median survival of less than 6 months, a 1-year survival probability of less than 30% and a likelihood of response to conventional therapies (e.g. cytarabine of around 20%) [5]. Hence, new approaches are needed for patients in this situation.
Clofarabine is a second generation purine nucleoside analog that incorporates two halogen atoms, 
chlorine and fluorine, resulting in resistance to both adenosine deaminase degradation and phosphorolysis [6]. Studies of clofarabine (both i.v. and p.o.) have demonstrated activity in patients with higher risk MDS [7]. In addition, we have previously shown the feasibility and efficacy of the combination 
of lower dose clofarabine (30 mg/m
2/day) with low-dose cytarabine in patients with high-risk MDS and 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which was more active than single agent clofarabine [8]. 
Here we propose to take this approach of the combination of clofarabine with low-dose cytarabine and 
use this combination to treat patients with higher-risk MDS who have failed to respond to hypomethylating agents.These patients are facing a huge unmet medical need.
3.0 Background Drug Information
3.1 Clofarabine
Clofarabine is FDA approved for children with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 
2011-0660
November 15, 2013
Page 3
therefore commercially available.
Clofarabine is formulated at a concentration of 1mg/mL in sodium chloride (9mg/mL), United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) or European Pharmacopeia (EP) and water for injection, USP or EP, quantity sufficient (qs) to 1 mL. Clofarabine is supplied in 20-mL flint vials contain 20 mL (20 mg) of solution. The pH range of the solution is 4.5 to 7.5. The solution is clear and practically colorless, is preservative free, and is free from foreign matter. 
Vials containing undiluted clofarabine should be stored at room temperature (15
° to 25° C; 59° to 77° F). 
Ongoing shelf-life stability studies indicate that clofarabine is stable for 36 months at 25 °C and 60% 
relative humidity and for 6 months at 40 °C (+/- 2 °C) and 75% (+/- 5%) relative humidity. 
Clofarabine for injection should be filtered through a sterile 0.2 microM syringe and then further diluted 
with 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP or EP for a final concentration of 0.15 to 0.4 mg/mL prior to IV infusion. The resulting admixture may be stored at room temperature, but must be used within 24 hours of preparation. Clofarabine will be administered as a 1- to 2-hour IV infusion as tolerated. To prevent drug incompatibilities, no other medications should be infused concurrently throught he same IV lines as clofarabine. Also, no blood products should be administered at the same time as clofarabine.
3.2 Cytarabine (Ara-C)
Cytarabine is available commercially.
Cytarabine is a deoxycytidine analog that is metabolized to cytarabine triphosphate, a substance that 
inhibits DNA polymerase. It is S phase specific, and thus affects DNA synthesis. It has an initial plasma half-life of about 15 minutes, with a secondary phase of about 2 hours, and is rapidly catabolized by hepatic cytidine deaminases to Ara-U.
Cytarabine injection, an antineoplastic is a sterile solution of cytarabine for intravenous administration. 
Each mL contains 20 mg cytarabine in 100 mg (20 mg/mL) single dose vials and 100 mg cytarabine in 2 g (100 mg/mL) single dose vial.
Cytarabine comes as 20 mg/mL (5, 25 and 50 mL vials) and 100 mg/ml solutions (20 mL vial), in addition 
to several vial sizes of powder for solution (100 mg, 500 mg, 1 g, 2 g). 
Cytarabine to be prepared as per institutional standards based on product availability.
3.3 Expected Toxicities
Myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, skin rash with blisters (particularly hand-foot 
syndrome), Steven-Johnson's syndrome, fatigue, mental status changes/coma, allergic reactions (including fever, muscle aches, edema, dyspnea), congestive heart failure, conjunctivitis, and anorexia. Pancreatitis, liver failure, kidney failure. Infections.
Autoimmune reactions (antiplatelet antibodies, erythema nodosum) and/or chemical imbalances in the 
blood, lethargy, malaise, asthenia, alopecia, peritonitis, anorexia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, hyperbilirubinemia, increase of SGPT and/or SGOT, abdominal pain or cramping.
3.4 Drug Supply
Clofarabine is approved by the FDA for use in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and will be used off 
label in higher-risk MDS in this study. Ara-C (cytarabine) is approved for use in patients with AML but will

5.0 Treatment Plan
5.1 Study Treatment
Patients may receive up to 3 cycles of induction therapy and up to 12 cycles of consolidation. 
Treatment will be terminated if patients exhibit evidence of treatment failure, disease progression, experience clinically significant toxicity, or the investigator determines that discontinuation of treatment is in the best interest of the patient. 
Patients will be treated with study drugs based on a calculation determined from the patient's BSA. Body 
surface area (BSA) will be calculated before each cycle and will be based on the patient's height (measured at baseline) and weight (measured each cycle).
Patients will be instructed to self-administer cytarabine at home and return unused drug to be handled 
and processed by the dispensing pharmacy.
In order to lower the risk of pregnancy, patients of child bearing potential must agree to use 
acceptable forms of birth control until at least 8 weeks after the last dose of therapy is administered. If patients are already using birth control, they must check with the study doctor or a member of the study staff to make sure that it is considered one of the acceptable forms to use in this study. Examples of effective birth control include condoms or diaphragms with spermicidal jelly, and birth control methods that are taken by mouth, injected, or implanted.
Exepct for the first cycle, treatment can be administered at MDACC or through the supervision of the 
home physician.
5.1.1 Induction
Clofarabine 10 mg/m2 as a 1-2 hours i.v. infusion. daily for 5 days (days 1-5)
Cytarabine 20 mg s.c. twice daily for 7 days (days 1-7)
Cytarabine should be administered 3 to 6 hours following the start of the clofarabine infusions.
Cycles are repeated every 4 to 8 weeks depending on resolution of toxicities. No dose reductions, delays, 
or modifications are required for hematologic toxicities during the induction cycles. It is assumed that low counts at diagnosis are due to involvement by the disease process and require therapy for improvement. Patients who receive repeated induction cycles have persistent disease and thus no recovery of hematologic parameters can be expected.
2011-0660
November 15, 2013
Page 6
Patients can receive up to a maximum of 3 induction cycles as long as they have stable disease and do 
not progress. If patients have not achieved at least a hematologic improvement after three cycles, they should be taken off study. Patients with at least hematologic improvement can continue the consolidation. Patients with any response less than CR or CRp before completion of three induction cycles can complete all three induction cycles in an effort to maximize their response prior to moving on with the consolidation if this is considered in the best interest of a particular patient.
5.1.2 Consolidation
Clofarabine 10 mg/m2 as a 1-2 hours i.v. infusion daily for 3 days (days 1-3)
Cytarabine 20 mg s.c. twice daily for 5 days (days 1-5)
Cytarabine should be administered 3 to 6 hours following the start of the clofarabine infusions.
Cycles are repeated every 4 to 8 weeks depending on hematopoietic recovery and resolution of toxicities. 
The maximum number of consolidation cycles is 12. Patients who continue with treatment after a delay for any reason other than toxicity or adverse event must restart treatment by Day 84 after Day 1 of the previous cycle. Patients can start after day 84 if discussed with and approved by the Principal Investigator.
5.1.3. Supportive Measures During Treatment
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care are to be given throughout the study as 
indicated by the treating physician's assessment of the patient's medical need and by the institutional guidelines. Administration of antiemetics during drug administration is strongly recommended. 
It is recommended that the patient's fluid status and hepatic and renal function be carefully monitored 
daily during the drug administration period. 
Management of Capillary Leak Syndrome
In pediatric studies, during or shortly after IV clofarabine administration a few patients developed signs 
and symptoms consistent with capillary leak syndrome. In these heavily pretreated patients, it has been difficult to separate potential drug-related cases of capillary leak syndrome from concurrent medical conditions such as infections/sepsis, progressive disease, or other underlying problems resulting from prior antileukemic therapies.
For these reasons, during and after each dose of clofarabine investigators should assess patients for the 
onset of the following signs or symptoms >/= grade 2:
- Tachypnea or other evidence of respiratory distress;
- Unexplained hypotension; and/or- Unexplained tachycardia
If one or more of these signs or symptoms occurs during study drug infusion, clofarabine administration is 
to be interrupted or held as clinically indicated. It is recognized that the total infusion time for this clofarabine dose in this circumstance may exceed 1 hour. Thus, if the patient's condition stabilizes or improves, clofarabine administration may resume. Pretreatment with steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 100 mg/day or its equivalent or dexamethasone 20 mg/day as part of an anti-emetic regimen) is recommended for all subsequent doses during the remainder of that treatment cycle and for all subsequent treatment cycles.
5.2 Dose Modifications
2011-0660
November 15, 2013
Page 7
Dose modifications can be made for one drug only if the investigator is reasonably confident that the 
toxicity relates to that particular drug. If that distinction cannot be made, the doses of both drugs should be modified.
Missed doses of clofarabine and/or cytarabine can be made up on subsequent days if felt to be in the 
best interest of the patient.
5.2.1 Hematologic (Blood/Bone Marrow) Toxicity
No dose reductions, delays, or modifications are required for hematologic toxicities during the induction 
cycles. It is assumed that low counts at diagnosis are due to involvement by the disease process and require therapy for improvement. Patients who are considered for reinduction have persistent disease and thus no recovery of hematologic parameters can be expected in the absence of further therapy.
Patients who achieve a CR/CRp should receive the consolidation cycles no sooner than 28 days from 
Day 1 of the previous cycle, provided the ANC has recovered to >/= 1.0 x 10
9/L and the platelet count >/= 
50 x 109/L (in case of CR). For patients in CRp where the platelet count by definition has not recovered, 
no limits are set to continue. If the peripheral count recovery is delayed beyond 42 days from Day 1 of the 
prior cycle and the delay is presumed to be secondary to the therapy, the study drug doses for the next cycle should be reduced by 25%.
5.2.2 Non-Hematologic Toxicity
Patients who experience a > grade 1 drug-related non-hematologic toxicity or drug-related asymptomatic 
grade 2 elevations of creatinine, bilirubin, amylase, lipase  during any week of treatment should have clofarabine held until recovery to grade 1 before starting treatment. Grade 3 drug-related toxicities that result in delays or omissions must resolve to grade 1 before starting treatment. Dose omissions due to toxicities that occur during the treatment can be made up as per the treating physician's discretion and if this is felt to be in the best interest of the patient. 
5.2.2.1 InfectionsIf a patient develops a clinically significant infection of any grade, initiation of treatment cycles will be 
delayed or withheld until the infection is clinically controlled (e.g., the patient is afebrile and with improving signs/symptoms). Treatment (i.e., subsequent cycles) may then resume at the full dose. At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic therapy to prevent recurrence of infection can be instituted as clinically indicated.
5.2.2.2 Non-infectious, drug-relateda) First or second occurrence of a drug-related >/= grade 3 toxicity:If toxicity recovers to Grade 1 within 35 days from the onset of the toxicity
: study therapy is to be 
restarted at 25% reduction with no alteration in schedule from the previous doses for all subsequent 
cycles.*
If toxicity does not  recover to Grade 1 within 35 days from the onset of toxicity : the patient should not 
receive additional study drug.*
* Excludes NCI CTC grade 2 alopecia and >/= grade 3 anorexia, transient elevations in hepatic 
transaminases or alkaline phosphatase based on institutional normals without clinical significance, and nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or mucositis that resolves (with or without supportive care) to < grade 2 within 72 hours of onset to grade 3.

b) 3rd Occurrence of a drug-related non-infectious event(s): Grade 3 toxicity:
The patient should not receive any additional treatment.
5.3 Supportive Care
5.3.1 Blood Products
All blood products are to be irradiated and leukocyte-reduced according to institutional guidelines. 
5.3.2 Infection Prophylaxis
The use of prophylactic antibacterial, antifungals, and antiviral agents is recommended according to 
standard of care. 
5.3.3 Colony Stimulating Factors
Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) can be administered at 
the treating physician's discretion and judgment.
5.3.4 Concomitant Therapy
No systemic concomitant cytotoxic therapy or investigational therapy is allowed during the study. 
To the extent possible, use of nephrotoxic (e.g., vancomycin, amphotericin B, etc) and hepatotoxic (e.g., 
voriconazole, cyclosporine, etc) agents is strongly discouraged and is to be avoided during clofarabine administration for all treatment cycles unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
6.0 Pretreatment evaluation
History and physical.
CBC with differential and platelets, chemistry profile (total bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGPT or SGOT, 
uric acid, LDH, potassium, magnesium) within 14 days of therapy start.
Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy within 28 days of therapy start. The bone marrow evaluation must 
include cytogenetic studies except for situations where cytogenetic analysis was not added to a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy and the stage/prognostic group of the MDS can be ascertained as higher risk based on the available information (eg, blasts and/or degree of cytopenias).
Pregnancy (urine or blood) test for women of childbearing potential within two weeks of start of therapy. 
Child bearing potential is defined as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization.
7.0 Evaluation During Study
CBC with differential and platelet counts at least weekly while on therapy and every 4 to 8 weeks 
thereafter as long as on study. No differential is needed if the WBC is < 1.0 x 109/L.
Chemistry profile (at least creatinine, SGOT or SGPT, total bilirubin, potassium, magnesium) 
every two weeks while on therapy, then every 4 to 8 weeks as long as on study.
2011-0660
November 15, 2013
Page 9
Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy at the end of course 1 (day 28 +/- 7 days). If a patient is not 
in remission at this point, further bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy can be scheduled as per the investigator's discretion and mandated by the development of the peripheral blood counts.
No repeat bone marrow is necessary if non-response or progressive disease can be 
unequivocally diagnosed from peripheral blood tests, or, in patients with a WBC <
 0.3 if the bone 
marrow test is considered non-contributory by the investigator at any time point.
Follow up marrow tests should include cytogenetic analysis for those patients who had 
abnormalities prior to therapy start.
Repeat physical examination (problem focused) prior to administration of each courseAfter completion of therapy and as long as still on study, patients will return to MD Anderson 
Cancer Center for repeat physical examination (problem focused), repeat CBC with differential and platelet count, and chemistry profile (at least creatinine, SGOT or SGPT, total bilirubin, potassium, magnesium) every 6 months (+/- 2 months). A CBC with differential and platelet count should be checked every one to two months, but these blood tests may be done locally.

10.0 Data Monitoring Plan
This is a single arm phase II study in patients with MDS who have failed therapy with or are intolerant of 
hypomethylating agents. 
Primary objective: complete response (CR); overall survival.
Secondary objective: duration of response; relapse-free survival; safety. 
It will be postulated that the treatment can achieve a CR rate of 20% and a median overall survival time of 
6 months.
A maximum of 80 patient will be accrued at a rate of 2 to 5 patients per month (maximum accrual period  
3.33 yrs). The CR, overall survival and toxicity will be monitored during the study, and all data will be used to update the prior distributions for toxicity and efficacy parameters. The study will be stopped for toxicity and futility based on the following stopping rules. 
Efficacy monitoring
Complete response and overall survival will be monitored separately. The method of Thall, Simon, and 
Estey [9] will be used to monitor response and Bayesian time-to-event model [10] will be used to monitor overall survival.
a. CR
CR will be monitored in all pts using the method of Thall et al.[9]  Denote the probability of CR by PE.  
We assume PE ~ beta (0.4, 1.6).  We will stop the trial if at any point that there is < 1% chance that the CR rate is > 20%. Stopping boundaries corresponding to this stopping rule and operating characteristics are listed in tables 1a and 1b. CR in the 4 months after the treatment will be included in the primary analysis.

b. Overall survival 
Bayesian time-to-event model will be used to monitor the overall survival [10]. Let Te and Ts represent 
the overall survival time for the study and the historical treatment, respectively. We assume Te|Me and Ts|Ms follow an exponential distribution with median Me and Ms, respectively. We further assume that the prior for Ms follows Inverse Gamma (IG) (35, 204) to reflect our knowledge of overall survival from the historical data,  which has a mean of 6 months and a variance of 1.09. The prior for Me is assumed to be IG (3,12), which has the same mean as Ms but with a much larger variance (36) to reflect much greater uncertainty about the median time to progression of the study treatment.

The study will be monitored after the first 14 pts have been enrolled and then be repeated every month. 
The study will be stopped early if, based on the available data, we have little reason to believe that the median OS is 6 months or more. Formally, we’ll stop the study early if there is < 5% chance that the median OS is 6 months or more. The operating characteristics of this decision rule are shown in the following table:

6 0.079 76 (80,80)
7 0.024 79 (80,80)
Toxicity Monitoring 
Toxicity will be monitored in all pts using the method of Thall et al 1995 [9]. Toxicity is defined as 
non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities during the treatment course. Denote the probability of toxicity by E, where study drug related toxicity is defined as any Grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicities.  We assume E ~ beta (0.6, 1.4).  We will stop the trail if at any point Pr(E > 0.30 | data)  >0.95, i.e. if at any time during the study, we determine that there is > 95% chance that the study drug related toxicity rate is > 30%. Toxicity monitoring will be done in cohorts and the trial will be stopped if (number of toxicity observed / among number of patients) >/= 6/10, 8/15, 10/20, 12/25, 14/30, 16/35, 18/40, 19/45, 21/50, 23/55, 25/60, 26/65, 28/70, 30/75, and 31/80. 
Table 3: The operating characteristics for toxicity monitoring are summarized in the following table

0.4 0.755 10 15 36 79 80
0.5 0.99 10 10 15 25 41
Early termination of the study can be caused by either lack of efficacy or  too much toxicity. If the efficacy 
and toxicity are considered jointly, the stopping pr obabilities will be higher than the probabilities shown in 
Tables 1 to 3. Table 4 shows several scenarios of the joint stopping probabilities assuming that efficacy and toxicity are 
independent.

Trial Conduct
The Department of Biostatistics will provide and maintain a website ("Clinical Trial Conduct") for 
monitoring of the overall survival. The Clincal Trial Conduct website resides on a secure server, and access is gained through usernames and passwords provided to personnel responsible for enrolling patients and updating patient data. The website is accessed through a browser using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.
Personnel responsible for enrolling patients on trials will be trained in the use of the trial website, with 
emphasis on the importance of timely updating of follow-up times and recording of events. The monitoring rules for the overall survival will be automatically evaluated each time patient data are updated on the trial website. If the stopping rule is met, the study statistician, research nurse, and principal investigator will each receive an email notification that the stopping boundary has been met.
Analysis Plan
For discrete or categorical data, descriptive statistics will include tabluations of frequencies. For 
continuous data, summary statistics including n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will be computed. The posterior CR rate and its 95% credible intervals will be estimated. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the probability of the overall survival.
11.0 Reporting Requirements
Please refer to Appendix D (Leukemia-specific adverse event recording guidelines) and Appendix E (Expected adverse events in leukemia).
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)
A serious adverse event is – any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
· Death
· A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.· Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization· A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.· A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may 
be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
· All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.

· Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until 30 days 
after the last dose of drug. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory test have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.

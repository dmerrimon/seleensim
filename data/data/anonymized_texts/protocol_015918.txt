ALN-PCS SC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-16-02
                                Protocol Amendment 1  The Medicines Company 
Confidential 4 Study Design:   This study  will be a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter pilot study in subject s with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia . Informed consent (and verbal assent if subject is < 18 years of age ) 
will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study -specific procedures.  
Subjects who meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be instructed to continue to follow a NCEP Adult 
Treatment Panel III (or comparable) diet  [Appendix C ] and be required to maintain their current lipid lowering 
drug therapy for the duration of the study.  
In this study, 8 -10 subjects will be enrolled and receive open label ALN -PCS SC 300mg SC. Dosing interval will 
be determined by PCSK9 level at Days 60  or 90 or rate of change of PCSK9 betwee n Days 60 and 90.  
On Day 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled  and receive the first SC administration of ALN -PCS SC. After first 
study drug administration, the subject will be observed in the clinic for at least 4  hours post injection before being 
discharg ed. Subjects will return at day 14  and day 30 and then at monthly intervals . If a second dose of study 
drug is deemed necessary  (depending on the degree of suppression of serum PCSK9 as compared to baseline) , 
subjects will receive this dose  at Day 90 or 104, based on PCSK9 levels from the previous visit . 
Study visits will include  collection of AE and SAE data, vital signs , ECGs , concomitant medication, and 
laboratory tests. See Section  6.1 for a detailed list of assessments. The study also includes collection of biomarker 
(pharmacodynamics)  samples  for efficacy  and, where approved by the independent ethics committee and/or 
institutional review board (IE C/IRB) and applicable regulatory and other authorities, all subjects will be invited to 
consent to pharmacogenetics analyses, unless underlying causal mutations of HoFH are well documented by a 
validated specialized laboratory.   
Efficacy assessments will include measure ment of  the effects of ALN -PCS SC on levels of LDL -C, other 
lipoproteins including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), non -
HDL -C, very low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL -C), apolipoprote in A1 (Apo -A1), apolipoprotein B 
(Apo -B), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and PCSK9.  
Formation of anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) will be assessed on Day 1 (prior to and 4 hours after the injection) and 
on subsequent visits until the end-of-study ( EOS) .  
The EOS visit  and the last estimation of lipids will occur at Day 180.  Following Day 180 subjects will continue 
in the study until the observed LDL -C reduction is less than 20% of the absolute reduction from baseline to Day 
90.Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits.  The decision to initiate a Phase III study  will be
defined as an observed mean 15% or greater reduction in LDL -C. A number of factors may influence the 
proportion of subjects achieving this metric, in particular the specific LDL receptor mutation(s) or other causative 
mutations of HoFH  studied. Given the small sample size, such issues will be taken into careful consid eration 
prior to making the final decision.   
The efficacy and safety/ tolerability data from this study will be reviewed by a Safety Committee (SC) on an 
ongoing basis, and the r esults will be used to guide the decision to initiate a phase III study.  A recommendation 
may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these reviews.

Test Drug, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch Number(s ):  
The study drug  (ALN -PCS SC) will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection as a formulation of 
ALN -60212. It will be supplied as a sterile 100 mg vial (200 mg/mL solution) for SC injection.  
ALN -PCS SC will be administered as a single SC in jection of 300mg on Day 1. If mean serum PCSK9 levels are 
not suppressed by > 70% at Day 60 or 90, as compared to baseline , a second dose of 300mg will be administered 
at the next visit at Day 90 or 104 respectively .  
Duration of Treatment : The expected duration of the subjects’ involvement in the study will be approximately 
208 days, which includes screening, study drug administration, and the follow -up period  through EOS . However 
additional follow -up visits may occur every 30 days until Day 300 for subjects whose LDL -C reduction is less 
than 20% of the absolute reduction from baseline to Day 90 (for a maximum duration up to 328 days ). If ALN -
PCS SC is found to be effective in lowering LDL -C in HoFH, a subsequent  study may follow for subjects 
participating in the study.  
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration :  There is no reference therapy in this study.

ODUCTION 
This protocol describes a study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ALN-PCS SC in 
subjec
ts with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 
This study
 will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
1.1. Background 
1.1.1. Disease Overview 
Acc
ording to the World Health Organization (WHO), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), comprised mainly of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, is the leading cause of 
death worldwide, resulting in 17 million deaths annually [ WHO Cardiovascular Statistics, 2011 ]. 
Data from the INTERHEART case-control study estimates that 45% of myocardial infarctions 
(MI) in Western Europe and 35% of myocardial infarctions in Central and Eastern Europe are 
due to abnormalities in blood lipids [ Yusef et al, 2004 ]. In particular, elevated LDL-C has been 
shown in mult
iple studies to be one of the major risk factors for CHD with a continuous and 
graded relationship between plasma LDL-C concentration and CHD risk. For every 30 mg/dL 
(0.78 mmol/L) change in LDL-C, the relative risk for CHD changes by approximately 30% 
[Grundy
 et al, 2004]. In addition, a large meta-analysis of 21 statin studies concluded that for 
ever
y 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C (with statin therapy) there is an approximate 
22% reduc
tion in cardiovascular events [ CTTC et al, 2010] . While statins are the treatment of 
choice for hyperlipidemia and the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD there is still a 
need for additional lipid-lowering therapies for patients who do not reach target L DL-C levels or 
sufficient percent reductions in LDL-C to attenuate their ASCVD risk. Furthermore, in many 
patients, statin therapy cannot be optimized as patients are either intolerant of statins due to side 
effects (most commonly muscle pain, myopathy myositis) or because of other adverse effects 
such as elevations in liver enzymes. These limitations of contemporary therapy are particularly 
relevant among patients with pre-existing ASCVD such as diabetes, or patients with familial 
hypercholesterolemia who are at the highest risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events, and hence 
require the most intensive and aggressive management of hypercholesterolemia [ Davidson et al, 
2005; Nag et al, 2007; Reiner et al, 2011; Stone et al, 2014] . Among these high-risk subjects, less 
than 50% achieved the target LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL at 6 months post-statin treatment 
despite close monitoring and drug regimen optimization [ Foley et al, 2003; Kearney et al, 2008; 
CTTC et al, 2010; Foody et al, 2010 ]. Thus, there remains a clear unmet medical need for 
lowering LDL-C, especially in certain patient populations.  
1.1.2. PCSK9 Biology and Target Rationale 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a member of the subtilisin serine 
protease family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 is predominantly expressed by the 
liver and is critical for the down regulation of hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR) expression [ Mousavi et al, 2009 ]. LDL-C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in 
humans with gain of function mutations in PCSK9, classifying them as having severe familial 
ALN-PCS SC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-16-02
                                Protocol Amendment 1  The Medicines Company 
Confidential 16 hype
rcholesterolemia [ Abifadel et al, 2003 ]. Data from genetic association studies have 
identified loss of function alleles in human PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein levels and 
lower LDL-C levels [Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009 ]. In one published 
study, heterozygous individuals (carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) 
had significantly lower LDL-C with median levels of approximately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) 
[Cohen e
t al, 2006 ]. Over a 15-year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering 
in LDL-C levels translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow-up publications 
describe two adult individuals who are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of 
PCS
K9. These individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL-C levels ≤20 
mg/dL, and yet are otherwise healthy [ Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007 ]. Additionally, recent 
human clinical trials with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of LDL-
C in healthy volunteers and across a range of high CV risk populations and with elevated LDL- C 
both with and without statins [ Banerjee et al, 2012 ; Dias et al, 2012; Milazzo et al, 2012 ; Raal et 
al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 2012 ; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012 ; Hooper et al, 2013 ]. Thus, the 
overa
ll scientific and clinical data suggests that PCSK9 is a well-validated drug target whose 
inhibition results in significant LDL-C lowering without otherwise negatively impacting overall 
health, most recently culminating in the approval of two monoclonal agents to inhibit PCSK9. 
1.1.3. Mechanism of RNA Interference 
Ribonucle
ic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for 
regulating gene expression that is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Typically, 
synthetic siRNAs are 19-base to 25-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered 
duplex with a two-
 to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’ ends. Such siRNAs can 
be desig
ned to target an endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When 
introduced into cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme complex 
called the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently binds to its 
complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the suppression of 
the target protein encoded by the mRNA [ Elbashir et al, 2001 ].  
Since unmodified siRNAs are rapidly eliminated and do not achieve significant tissue 
distribution upon systemic administration [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ], various formulations are 
currently used to target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into the 
relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal models 
(including in rodents and nonhuman primates [NHP]) and humans employs intravenous delivery 
of siRNA in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations [ Soutschek et al, 2004 ; Morrissey et al, 2005 ; 
Geisbert et al, 2006 ; Judge et al, 2006 ; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; Coelho et al, 2013 ; Tabernero 
et al, 2013]. Another approach for liver-specific gene silencing is subcutaneously administered 
siRNA conjugated to a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) carbohydrate ligand [ Ashwell and 
Morell, 1974 ]. Conjugation of a triantennary GalNAc ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte 
binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in 
engagement of the RNAi pathway and down regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple 
doses of subcutaneously administered siRNA-GalNAc conjugates have been used to target 
transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis. ALN-TTRCSC has 
been found to be generally safe and well tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over 
40 healthy volunteers and 18 subjects with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy and senile

1.2. ALN-PCS SC, an R
NAi Therapeutic for Hypercholesterolemia 
ALN-PCS SC Solution for Injection (subcutaneous [SC] use) is comprised of the PCSK9 siRNA, 
ALN
-60212, formulated in phosphate buffer. The PCSK9 siRNA is a chemically synthesized 
double stranded oligonucleotide covalently linked to a ligand containing GalNAc residues. This 
synthetic investigational RNAi therapeutic has been designed to suppress the liver production of 
PCSK9 when administered via SC injection. Inhibition of PCSK9 synthesis through an RNAi 
mechanism has the potential to lower tissue and circulating plasma PCSK9 protein levels, 
resulting in higher expression of LDLR in the liver, and consequently lower LDL-C levels in the 
blood stream. The initial proposed indication for ALN-PCS SC is the treatment of subjects with 
hype
rcholesterolemia who are not achieving therapeutic LDL-C goals despite maximally 
tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, or for subjects who are intolerant of statins. 
1.2.1. Nonclinical Stud ies 
The safety pharmacology and toxicology of ALN- PCS SC was evaluated in a series of in vitro 
and in vivo nonc
linical studies. 
The drug substance in ALN-PCS SC (ALN-60212) is designed to match the human and 
cynomol
gous monkey mRNA transcripts for PCSK9, sharing a substantial partial match to the 
rat PCSK9 mRNA. ALN-60212 was informatically identified from a large collection of possible 
siRNAs tar
geting PCSK9 based on its predicted potency and selectivity. ALN-PCS SC reduced 
the expre
ssion of PCSK9 in Hep3B liver cells with an IC 50 of 20pM and inhibited hPCSK9 
serum protein levels in a Tg mouse model with a single dose ED 50 of approximately 2 mg/kg and 
an ED 80 dose of a
pproximately 6 mg/kg. In single and multi-dose regimen studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, A
LN-PCS SC exhibited dose-dependent sustainable suppression of PCSK9 protein that 
was par
alleled by lowering of serum LDL-C with the same kinetics. The time to reach PCSK9 
and LDL-C nadir was approximately 20 days and t here was no difference in time to nadir between 
different dose levels.  In single dose studies the maximal mean PCSK9 and LDL-C inhibition was 
85% and 68%, respectively, which was observed at the two highest doses of ALN-PCS SC
administered (6 and 10 mg/kg); however, the duration of PCSK9 silencing and LDL-C lowering 
was markedly extended at the higher 10 mg/kg dose. In mu lti-dose studies the maximal mean 
PCSK9 and LDL-C inhibition was 93% and 74%, respectively, which was similar to those 
observed in the single dose study. Following discontinuation of ALN-PCS SC administration, 
recove
ry of PCSK9 levels was slow, returning to baseline after 100 days in the single dose study 
and only showing partial recovery between doses in the multi-dose regimen. There were no 
ALN
-PCS SC related changes to the levels of HDL-C or triglycerides in any of the groups.  As 
expe
cted, total cholesterol levels were reduced by up to 30% reflecting the decrease in LDL- C. 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant repeat dose studies of 4 and 15 weeks duration have 
been c
onducted in rats and monkeys. These studies included toxicokinetic analysis of ALN-
PCS SC in plasma and in tissues including the liver which is the target organ, and the kidney 
which is the
 main organ of elimination.

                                Protocol Amendment 1  The Medicines Company 
Confidential 18 The GL
P 4 week toxicology studies in rats and monkeys involved every other week 
administration of ALN-PCS SC at dose levels of 10, 50 and 250 mg/kg and once a week 
administration of 10 mg/kg for rats and 30 mg/kg for monkeys. The GLP 15 week toxicology 
studies in rats and monkeys involved once monthly administration of ALN-PCS SC at dose levels 
of 10, 50 and 250 m
g/kg and once every other week administration of 125 mg/kg for rats and 25 
mg/kg for monkeys. Each toxicology study also included an 8 week treatment free recovery 
period for all dose groups. ALN-PCS SC was well tolerated in all studies and there were no dose 
limiti
ng toxicities. The most common findings were related to the pharmacological effects of 
ALN-PCS SC on lipid profiles. There were consistent decreases in low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (
LDL-C) and total cholesterol which were expected. Histopathological findings 
included vac
uolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys and the 
presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These 
microscopic findings were not associated with changes in clinical pathology parameters and are 
consistent wit
h class effects of oligonucleotides and were not considered adverse. In a non-GLP 
dose ran
ge finding (DRF) study conducted in monkeys, ALN-PCS SC did not stimulate pro-
inflamma
tory cytokines, activate complement or impact coagulation. ALN-PCS SC also did not 
stimula
te pro-inflammatory cytokines following single dose administration to mice. In a 
cardiovascular and respiratory study in telemetered conscious cynomolgus monkeys ALN-PCS SC 
had no immediate or delayed effects on clinical observations, qualitative or quantitative ECG 
parameters, hemodynamic parameters, respiration rate, or body temperature at any dose level. In 
addition, ALN-PCS SC did not induce gene mutations or chromosomal damage in a battery of in 
vitro and in vi
vo genotoxicity studies. 
Further information is in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.2.2. Clinical Studies 
One P
hase I study has been conducted to date (Study ALN-PCS SC -001). This was a randomized, 
single-
blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation and multiple-dose study of ALN-PCS SC 
administered SC to subjects with elevated LDL-C. The study was conducted in two phases: a 
single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple dose (MD) phase. During the SAD phase, 
24 subjects were assigned to either receive placebo or one of five doses of ALN-PCS ranging 
from 25 mg
 to 800 mg. Those who received doses of at least 100 mg saw their LDL-C drop at 
least 40%; at the 500 mg
 dose, LDL-C levels dropped as much as 78%. At 140 days after the 
treatment was given, subjects still had an average LDL-C reduction of about 40%. 
In the MD pha
se, 45 subjects received multiple doses of either ALN-PCS (125mg weekly x4, 
250 mg bi-
weekly x2, 300 mg and 500 mg  twice given 1 month apart) or placebo. These subjects 
had maxim
al LDL-C reductions of 80% and average LDL-C reductions of 50% to 60%. To date, 
the drug appears to be generally safe and well tolerated. One subject on statin comedication had 
elevated liver enzymes with ALT >4x the upper limit of normal (ULN), which resolved on 
stopping the statin. 
One Phase II dose finding study (MDCO-PCS-15-01) is currently ongoing. This study is a 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to compare the effect of different doses of 
ALN-P
CSSC given as single or multiple subcutaneous injections in subjects with high 
cardiovascular risk and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Randomization 
has been completed and follow up is ongoing. An interim analysis will be performed after all

nts have completed the Day 90 visit in order to select the dose for subsequent studies. A 
regular review of safety is performed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee and to date 
no safety concerns have been reported and no changes to the protocol have been requested. 
1.2.3. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
Subjec
ts taking part in this clinical study will receive guideline recommended standard of care as 
background therapy (including maximally-tolerated statin therapy and/or other LDL-C lowering 
therapies ) when administered ALN-PCS SC. Reduction of LDL-C has been associated with 
reduced CV risk both by epidemiology and in controlled clinical trials. The safety profile 
observed to date is considered acceptable for this clinical trial. 
An expanded risk-benefit summary is provided in the IB. 
1.3. Study Rationale 
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare and life-threatening disease 
characterized by markedly elevated circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) and accelerated, premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). The first 
major CV events often occur during adolescence, although angina pectoris, myocardial infarction 
and death have been reported in early childhood. Historically thought to affect one in a million, 
new research indicates that HoFH prevalence is likely to be higher, with as many as one in 
160,000 to 300,000 people affected. There may be as many as 40,000 people world-wide with 
HoFH. Due to the severity of the condition, early diagnosis and initiation of lipid-lowering 
treatment is critical. However, even at the highest doses of the most efficacious statins, only 
modest reductions in LDL C plasma levels, of 10-25%, are observed. Combination of statin plus 
ezetimibe can produce a further decrease in LDL-C levels of 10-15%. Combination with other 
lipid-lowering treatments such as ALN- PCS SC may therefore provide an important adjunctive 
therap
y in HoFH [ Cuchel et al 2014 ]. 
Previous
 studies using PCSK9-targeting siRNAs formulated in LNPs (ALN-PCS02) or using 
PCSK9 antibodies, and one Phase I study with ALN-PCS SC in which subjects received single-
doses asc
ending from 25 mg to 800 mg, have demonstrated that substantial lowering of PCSK9 
is safe and well-tolerated in humans. Doses for the Phase I study were calculated using the rat 
and monkey NOAELs based on body weight and body surface area (mg/m2). Collectively, the 
results of nonclinical studies with ALN-PCS SC supported a starting dose of 25 mg for subjects 
participating
 in the SAD phase of the previous Phase I study. 
In Phase I Study ALN-PCS SC-001, clinically significant reductions in LDL-C levels were seen 
with single 
ALN-PCS SC doses as low as 25 mg with larger decreases seen with higher doses and 
a plateau at 300 mg. Subjects at ALN-PCS SC doses of 300 mg or higher had maximal LDL- C 
reducti
ons of up to 78.1% and average least squares mean group nadir reductions of 50 to 59%. 
In the MD phase, 45 subjects received multiple doses of either ALN-PCS (125 mg weekly x4, 
250 mg biweekly, 300 mg and 500 mg twice given 1 month apart)  or placebo. Subjects at ALN- 
PCS SC dose
s of 300 mg or higher had maximal LDL-C reductions of 83% and average least 
squares mea
n group nadir LDL-C reductions of 53.4% to 59.9 % at all dose levels tested.   
Based on the interim results of the Phase I Study ALN-PCS SC -001, where maximum effect on 
LDL
-C was seen by 84 days and a significant effect was still observed at 180 days, this study has

signed to test the efficacy and duration of effect of 300mg of ALN- PCS SC  in subjects 
with HoFH. This wi
ll allow dose selection for a subsequent Phase III study in HoFH. The dosing 
regim
ens used in this study are therefore fully supported by the findings of the Phase I study.

L DESIGN 
3.1. Type/Design of Trial 
This study will be a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter pilot study in subjects with 
homozyg
ous familial hypercholesterolemia.  Informed consent (and verbal assent if subject is 
< 18 y
ears of age) will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study-specific 
procedures.   
Subjec
ts who meet study  inclusion/exclusion criteria will be instructed to continue to follow a 
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (or comparable) diet 
[Appendix C ] and will be required to maintain their current lipid lowering drug therapy for the 
duration of
 the study. 
In this study, 8-10 subjects will be enroll ed and receive open label ALN-PCS SC 300mg SC. 
Dosing int
erval will be determined by PCSK9 level at Day 60 or 90 or rate of change of PCSK9 
betwee
n Days 60 and 90.  
On Day 1, eli
gible subjects will be enrolled and receive the first SC administration of ALN-
PCS SC. Af
ter first study drug administration, the subject will be observed in the clinic for at least 
4 hours post injection before being discharged. Subjects will return at Day 14 and Day 30  and 
then at m
onthly intervals. If a second dose of study drug is deemed necessary (if mean serum 
PCSK9 levels are not suppressed by > 70% at Day 60 or 90, as compared to baseline), subjects 
will rec
eive this dose at Day 90 or 104 respectively, based on PCSK9 levels from the previous 
visit. 
Study
 visits will include collection of AE and SAE data, vital signs, ECGs, concomitant 
medication, and laboratory tests. See Sec tion 6.1 for a detailed list of assessments. The study also 
includes coll
ection of biomarker samples and, where approved by the independent ethics 
committee and/or institutional review board (IEC/IRB) and applicable regulatory and other 
authorities, all subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetics analyses, unless 
underlying causal  mutations of HoFH are well documented by a validated specialized  laborator y.  
Efficacy assessments will include measurement of the effects of ALN- PCSSC on levels of LDL-
C, other li
poproteins including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), 
apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), apolipoprotein B (Apo-B), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and PCSK9.  
Formation of anti-drug antibodies ( ADA) will be assessed on Day 1 (prior to and 4 hours after 
the injection) and on subsequent visits until the end-of-study (EOS).  
The EOS
 visit and the last estimation of lipids will occur at Day 180. Following Day 180 
subjects will continue in the study until the observed LDL-C reduction is less than 20% of the 
absolute reduction from baseline to Day 90. Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned 
visits.  
The decision to initiate a Phase III study  will be defined as an observed mean 15% or greater 
reduction in LDL-C. A number of factors may influence the proportion of subjects achieving this 
metric, in partic
ular the specific LDL receptor mutation(s) or other causative mutations of HoFH

n the small sample size for this part of the study, such issues will be taken into 
careful consideration prior to making the final decision.  
The eff
icacy and safety/ tolerability data from this study will be reviewed by a Safety Committee 
(SC) on an ongoing basis, and the results will be used to guide the decision to initiate a Phase III 
study. A r
ecommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these reviews.

4.4. Withdrawal Criteria 
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatment without prejudice.  The 
investigator can discontinue any subject at any time if medically necessary. It will be 
documented whether or not each subject completed the clinical study. If for any subject study 
treatment or observations were discontinued, the reason will be recorded and the Sponsor should 
be notified promptly. Reasons that a subject may discontinue participation in a clinical study are 
considered to constitute one of the following: 
Adverse event(s)
Death
Subject withdrew consent
Physician decision
Lost to follow-up
Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the investigator or designee will make every 
possible attempt to confer with the Sponsor and the SC before discontinuing the subject. 
It is imperative to obtain complete follow-up data for all subjects whether or not they receive 
their study treatment or have discontinued ALN-PCS SC. All data coll ected up until the time of 
subject withdrawal is to be entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF).  In addition, 
every attempt should be made to collect follow-up information except for those subjects who 
specifically withdraw consent to release of such information.  All procedures and laboratory 
specimens or tests requested for evaluation following administration of ALN-PCS SC should be 
carried out when possible whether or not a subject continues to receive treatment according the 
protocol. Subjects will not be replaced in this trial.

In the 
event a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study medication (eg, receives first 
injection and not second injection if indicated), the investigator will inform the Medical Monitor 
and the Sponsor immedia
tely. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the subject will remain 
under the supervision of the investigator for protocol-specified safety follow up procedures. The 
SC may be notified.  
It is imperative to obtain complete follow-up data for all enrolled subjects whether or not they

ERSE EVENTS 
8.1. Definitions 
8.1.1. Adverse Event 
Adverse
 Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an 
abnormal l
aboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Planned hospital admissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease that existed 
before the study drug was given or the subject was randomized in a clinical study are not to be 
considered AEs. 
Adverse 
events or abnormal test findings will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the 
abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Sponsor/Investigator. 
8.1.2. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
Results in death,
Is life-threatening, i.e., the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death),
Result
s in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or
disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of
life,
Requires in-subject hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization,
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
Is another medically significant event where medical and scientific judgement should
be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious
reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or
might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in
hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. Any suspected transmission
via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse
reaction.

Confidential 44 8.1.3. Medication Errors 
Medica
tion error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
drug as per instructions in the protocol.  Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories as 
follows: 
wrong study drug;
wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount,
including above the maximum or under the minimum recommended dose );
wrong route of administration;
wrong subject (i.e. not administered to the intended subject)
8.2. EVA
LUATING ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.2.1. AE Severity  
The severity of an AE will be assessed by the investigator.  The investigator should ensure that 
any subject experiencing an AE receives appropriate medical support until the event resolves. 
Adverse events (AE) will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on the case 
report form.  The intensity of an AE is defined as follows: 
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity. 
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity. 
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is an estimate or 
measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of adverse 
subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not necessarily be 
considered serious and a serious AE need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that 
persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a 
myocardial infarction (MI) that may be considered minor could also be an SAE if it prolonged 
hospitalization. 
8.2.2. Study Drug Causality  
The relationship of an AE to study treatment (i.e. ALN-PCS SC) will be assessed with 
consideration to the following criteria: 
Temporal relationship to the initiation of study medication
Response of the event to withdrawal of study medication
AE profile of concomitant therapies
Clinical circumstances during which the AE occurred
Subject’s clinical condition and medical history
ALN-PCS SC Clinical Study Protocol MDCO-PCS-16-02
Protocol Amendment 1 The Medicines Company 
Confidential 45 Categoriza
tion of causality will be designated by the investigator as stated below: 
Reasonable possibility  - There are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship 
between the event and t he study drug.   
No Reasonable possibility  - There are few to no facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship between the event and the study drug. 
8.2.3. Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESIs) 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the Sponsor’s study drug or program, which warrants ongoing monitoring 
and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor. Such an event might warrant further 
investigation in order to characterize and understand it. 
The following AESI(s) have been identified for the study drug ALN-PCS SC in this protocol. 
Injec
tion site reactions (ISR)
Injec
tion site reactions including individual signs or symptoms at the injection site reported 
following study drug administration will be collected as an AESI. 
The grade (severity) of injection site reaction will be determined by the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria of Injection Site Reaction (General disorders and 
administration site conditions) (see Table 2).  
Table 2:
 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) of Inject ion 
Site Reaction

8.3. PROCED
URE FOR ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
8.3.1. Procedure for Non-Serious Adverse Event Recording 
All non-serious AEs that occur during the designated study period from enrollment up to EOS 
must be assessed and recorded on the source documents and eCRF, regardless of causal 
relationship t
o the study drug.   
8.3.2. Procedure for Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
All SAEs that oc
cur during the designated study period from enrollment up to EOS must be 
reported to t
he Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance Department (GPV) within 24 hours of 
awareness of the event using the provided study specific SAE/AESI Report Form.  In addition to 
completing the SAE/AESI Report Form, each SAE/AESI must be entered on the appropriate 
page of the case report form (CRF ).   
The investigator must assess the causality for each SAE/AESI. 
The Sponsor will contact the investigator, if necessary, to clarify any of the event information. 
The investigator should provide any follow-up information for the event to the Sponsor on an 
updated SAE/AESI report form as soon as it becomes available. 
If the investigator is notified of a SAE/AESI that occurs post-study period, that he or she wishes 
to report to the Sponsor (e.g., an event suspected to be causally related to study drug), the event 
should be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate, if required by local regulations or procedures, the investigator should report 
these events to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national 
regulatory authority in addition to the Sponsor. 
8.3.3. Procedure for Medication Error Reporting For Study Drug 
Medicati
on errors with or without an associated AE need to be recorded as medication errors in 
the eCRF as described in Section 8.1.3. 
Medicati
on errors with an associated SAE need to be recorded as medication errors in the eCRF 
and reported to the Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance Department as described in 
Section 8.3.2. 
8.3.4. Procedure For Reporting Adverse Events Of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Injection Site Reaction has been identified as an AESI for the study product(s) in this protocol as 
per Section 8.2.3. The SAE/AESI form should be utilized for reporting the AESI even if a 
serious outcome ma
y not apply, and the form should indicate that the reported event is an AESI. 
Non-serious AESIs should be reported to the Sponsor within 72 hours and serious AESIs should

Confidential 47 be report
ed to the Sponsor within 24 hours. In both instances, the reporting procedure provided 
in Section 8.3.2 should be followed.  
8.3.5. Procedure For Reporting Pregnancies Exposure 
Occ
urrences of pregnancy in a study subject or study subject’s partner should be reported within 
24 hours using the Pregnancy Reporting Form. In cases where a pregnancy occurs with a Serious 
Adverse Ev
ent, the Serious Adverse Event reporting form should be used to report the 
SAE/AES
I and the Pregnancy Reporting form should be used to report the pregnancy. When a 
pregnancy occurs without any concurrent SAE, the Pregnancy Reporting Form may be submitted 
alone.  The pregnancy must be followed through to outcome of pregnancy.  Any pregnancy 
discovered from the time of consent to follow-up needs to be reported. 
8.3.6. Procedure For Reporting Special Situations 
The oc
currence of a Special Situation event, defined in Sec tion 8.2.4 , must be report ed to the 
Sponsor as pe
r Section 8.3.2 , Procedure for Serious Adverse Event Reporting. Note: The Special 
S
ituations event does not need to be serious to be reported on the SAE/AESI Report form.

 COLLECTION 
An electronic data capture (EDC) system which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant will be used for 
this trial.  All users will be trained on the technical features of the EDC as well as the content of 
the eCRF by qualified personnel prior to gaining access to the EDC.  A UserID/Password will be 
granted after training.  This ID is not to be shared amongst the study staff.  All users must have a 
unique account to enter or review data.  The eCRF should be filled out by the site 3 days after 
each visit.  It is not expected that the eCRF will serve as source for any data collected in this 
trial.  If there is a reason for a site to do so, it must be approved by Sponsor and documented in 
the site files. 
Prior to the database being locked, the investigator or designee will review, approve and 
sign/date each completed eCRF.  This signature serves as attestation of the Investigator’s 
responsibility for ensuring that all data entered into the eCRF are complete, accurate and 
authentic.  After the end of the trial, a copy of the data will be provided to the site.  This copy 
will contain the final data, an audit trail of activity on the data, and any queries and answers that 
were posted for data clarification. 
For this study, the End of Trial will be defined as the last visit of the last subject.

ICAL PLAN
This is an 8-10 subject non-randomized pilot study. Subjects with homozygous familial 
hype
rcholesterolemia will be recruited from approximately 5 sites globally.  Subjects that qualify 
for entr
y into the study will be enrolled to receive ALN-PCS SC.  The primary  objective of this 
study is to characterize the effect of 90 and 180 days of subcutaneous ALN-PCS SC on the percent 
chan
ge from Day 1 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with homozygous 
famili
al hypercholesterolemia.  A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) document will provide 
more detailed specifications in data analysis and presentation. 
The primary hypothesis is that ALN-PCS SC, when used in combination with maximally tolerated 
statin therapy with or without ezetimibe, will be well-tolerated, will suppress circulating PCSK9 
>70% and will result in reduction of LDL-C, defined as mean percent change from Day 1 
following 90 and 180 days of treatment, in subjects with homozygous familial 
hypercholeste
rolemia.  
10.1. Sample Size  
The sample size was chosen based on clinical considerations. 
10.2. Randomization 
This study is non-randomized. 
10.3. General Statistical Considerations and Definitions 
10.3.1. General Statistical Methods 
All study-collected data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics, 
graphs, and/or raw data listings. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), minimum 
(min) and maximum (max) values. Analysis of categorical variables will include frequency and 
percentage. 
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation or standard error, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables, the

ety Population 
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment classification will be based 
on the actual treatment received. This will be the primary population for the safety analyses. 
The primar
y analysis set is the modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT), which will include all enrolled 
subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug. Unless specified otherwise, the mITT 
will be the de
fault analysis set in this study. 
10.3.3. Analysis Windows and Baseline 
The observational period for the study includes the screening period (Day -28 to Day -1) , 
treatm
ent and follow up period (Day 1 to Day 180), additional follow up period (up to Day 300, 
only for
 subjects in whom LDL -C reduction is less than 20% of the absolute reduction from 
baseline to Day 90). Any event occurring beyond the defined observational period, even if 
colle
cted on the CRF, will not be included in the planned statistical analysis.  However, all data, 
including that reported after the defined observational period, will be included in the subject data 
listings.   
Unless otherwise specified, for evaluations that are collected at multiple occasions prior to 
initia
tion of study drug administration, the latest evaluation will be considered the "Baseline" 
evaluation for
 analysis.

ety Analysis 
Safety summaries will include the incidence of adverse events, summaries of laboratory 
parameters (including shift tables), vital signs, ECGs and anti-drug antibodies. 
10.4.4.1. Adverse Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used for coding adverse 
events (AE
s).  An AE (classified by preferred term) occurring during the study drug treatment 
period will be counted as a treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it is not present at baseline 
or if it is present at baseline but increased in severity during the treatment period. 
The number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each preferred term will be tabulated 
by system-organ class, by system-organ class and severity, and by system-organ class and 
relationship t
o study drug.  If more than one event occurred with the same preferred term for the 
same subject, the subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe 
or related occurrence for the summary by severity, or relationship to study drug, respectively. 
10.4.4.2. Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory values will be summarized by treatment group, including changes and percent 
changes from Day 1 at each time point. Analyses will also be performed for each lab parameter 
by treatment group for incidence rates of potentially clinical significant (PCS) values for subjects 
without PCS value at baseline. 
10.4.4.3. Vital Signs  
Change and percent change from baseline in vital signs will be summarized descriptively at each 
scheduled time point by treatment group.

ENDIX A. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION 
MOTOR FUNCTION 
When assessing motor function, from a neurological perspective, the assessment should focus on 
arm and leg movement. You should consider the following: 
1. Muscle size
2. Muscle tone
3. Muscle strength
4. Involuntary movements
5. Posture, gait
Symmetry is the most important consideration when identifying focal findings. Compare one 
side of the body to the other when performing your assessment. 
Limb assessment of a conscious subject usually involves a grading of strength. 
Grade Strength 
Grade strength Description  
5 Full range of motion against gravity and resistance; normal muscle strength  
4 Full range of motion against gravity and a moderate amount of resistance; slight weakness  
3 Full range of motion against gravity only, moderate muscle weakness  
2 Full range of motion when gravity is eliminated, severe weakness  
1 A weak muscle contraction is palpated, but no movement is noted, very severe  weakness  
0 Complete paralysis  
NB: In a conscious subject, the single best test to quickly identify motor weakness is the “drift 
test”. Have the subject hold their arms outward at 90 degrees from the body. With palms up, 
have the 
subject close their eyes and hold the arms for a couple of minutes. “Drifting” will occur 
if one side is wea
k. 
Lower Extremities 
Assess the subject in a supine position. Ask him/her to separate both legs to test for hip 
abducti
on. Then ask the subject to bring the legs back together to test for hip adduction. Sit the 
subjec
t on the side of the bed to assess knee flexion and extension. Ask the subject to flex and 
extend the
 knee. If able to do this, apply resistance as these movements are repeated. Test plantar 
and dorsiflexion by having the subject push down against your hand with their foot and then pull 
up against
 your hand with their foot. Remember to compare the left side to the right side. 
Upper Extremities 
Assess ability to flex elbow (biceps) and straighten (triceps). Assess ability to raise shoulders and 
return to a re
sting position. Assess wrist flexion and extension. Test each function with

e. For focused upper extremity assessment, assess each digit for flexion, extension and 
lateral movement. 
SENSORY FUNCTION 
When assessing sensory function remember that there are three main pathways for sensation and 
they should be compared bilaterally: 
1. Pain and temperature sensation
2. Position sense (proprioception)
3. Light touch
Pain can be assessed using a sterile pin. Light touch can be assessed with a cotton wisp. To test 
proprioception, grasp the subject's index finger from the middle joint and move it side to side and 
up and down. Have the subject identify the direction of movement. Repeat this using the great 
toe. 
Se
nsory Tests: 
A number of tests for lesions of the sensory cortex can be done. Examples include the following: 
Stereognosis : The abil ity to recognize an object by feel. Place a common object in the persons
hand and ask them to identify the object. 
Graphesthesis: “Dra w” a number in the palm of the person’s hand and ask them to identify the
number. 
Two-Point Discrimination: Simult aneously apply two pin pricks to the skin surface.
Continually repeat the test while bringing the two pins closer together, until the individual can no 
longer identify two separate stimuli. The finger tips are the most sensitive location for 
recognizing two point differences while the upper arms, thighs and back are the least sensitive. 
Extinction: Touch the same spot on both sides of the body at the same time (eg, the left and
right forearms). Ask the individual to describe how many spots are being touched. Normally, 
both sides are felt; with sensory lesions the individual will sense only one. 
Point Locations: Touch the surface of the skin and remove the stimulus quickly. Ask the
individual to touch the spot where the sensation was felt. Sensory lesions can impair accurate 
identification, even if they retain their sensation of light touch. 
TONE and REFLEXES 
Upper motor neuron problems (brain and spinal cord) are associated with increased tone. Lower 
motor neuron problems are associated with decreased tone. 
Look at the muscles on each side of the body in pairs. Assess for symmetry of bulk. 
Evaluation of the stretch reflexes assesses the intactness of the spinal reflex arc at various spinal 
cord levels. The limb should be relaxed while applying a short and snappy blow with a reflex 
hammer. Hold the hammer loosely in a relaxed manner, making a wrist action. Allow the 
hammer to bounce.

0 No response  
1+ Diminished, low normal  
2+ Average, normal  
3+ Brisker than normal  
4+ Very brisk, hyperactive  
Lower motor neuron disease is associated with 0 or 1+, upper motor neuron disease is associated 
with 3+ or 4+. 
Biceps Reflex (C5 – C6) 
Support t
he forearm on the examiners forearm. Place your thumb on the bicep tendon (located in 
the front of the bend of the elbow; midline to the anticubital fossa). Tap on your thumb to 
stimulate a response. 
Triceps Reflex (C7-C8) 
Have the individual bend their elbow while pointing their arm downward at 90 degrees. Support 
the upper arm so that the arm hangs loosely and “goes dead”. Tap on the triceps tendon located 
just above the elbow bend (funny bone). 
Brachioradialis Reflex (C5-C6): 
Hold the person’s thumb so that the forearm relaxes. Strike the forearm about 2-3 cm above the 
radial styloid process (located along the thumb side of the wrist, about 2-3 cm above the round 
bone at the bend of the wrist). Normally, the forearm with flex and supinate. 
Quadr
iceps Reflex (Knee jerk) L2 – L4  
Allow the lower leg
s to dangle freely. Place one hand on the quadriceps. Strike just below the 
knee cap. The lower leg normally will extend and the quadriceps will contract. 
If the subject is supine: Stand on one side of the bed. Place the examiners forearm under the 
thigh c
losest to the examiner, lifting the leg up. Reach under the thigh and place the hand on the 
thigh of the opposite leg, just above the knee cap. Tap the knee closest to the examiner, (the one 
that has been lifted up with the examiners forearm). 
Achilles Reflex (ankle jerks) L5 – S2: 
Flex the kne
e and externally rotate the hip. Dorsiflex the foot and strike the Achilles tendon of 
the heel. In conscious subjects, kneeling on a chair can help to relax the foot. 
Heel Lift 
While the subject is supine, bend the knee and support the leg under the thigh. Have the leg “go 
dead”. B
riskly jerk the leg to lift the heel of the bed. Normally, the leg will remain relaxed and 
the heel will slide upward; increased tone will cause the heel and leg to stiffen and lift off the 
bed.

Confidential 64 Babin
ski Response: 
Dorsiflexion of the great toe with fanning of remaining toes is a positive Babinski response. This 
indicates upper motor neuron disease. It is normal in infants. 
CEREBELLAR FUNCTION 
The cerebellum is responsible for muscle coordination and balance on the same side. To test 
cerebellar function use the following tests: 
1. Finger to finger test: have the subject touch their index finger to your index finger (repeat
several times). 
2. Finger to nose test: perform with eyes open and then eyes closed.
3. Tandem walking: heel to toe on a straight line.
4. Romberg test: stand with feet together and arms at their sides. Have subject close his/her eyes
and maintain this position for 10 seconds. If the subject begins to sway, have them open their 
eye
s. If swaying continues, the test is “positive” or suggestive of cerebellum problems. 
Dizziness that occurs in response to position changes is usually blood pressure initiated. If the 
subject sways during a Romberg test, but stops when the eyes are opened, the problem is 
probably
 visual or CN VIII (vestibular).

[collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that
subject (minutes to several hours): 
a. I
nvolvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-
tongue-uvula)

ENDIX C. TLC DIET 
Definition 
Although there are several diets that will result in lowered LDL cholesterol, the National 
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) set forth guidelines for medical professionals to follow 
when instructing patients on a medical nutrition option for lowering cholesterol. Termed the TLC 
diet or the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet it emphasizes heart healthy lifestyle choices. 
The Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet (TLC) is a cholesterol lowering diet that refers to a 
cholesterol-lowering treatment that lowers a person’s low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level and 
raises their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level enough to reduce their risk of a heart attack or 
other chronic disease caused by hardening of the arteries. 
The TLC diet follows these dietary guidelines 
Less than 7% of the day’s total calories from saturated fat.
25-35% of the day’s total calories from fat.
Less t
han 200 milligrams of dietary cholesterol a day.
_________________________________________________________________________ 
TLC diet tips  
Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts  
Limit the total amount of meat to 5 ounces or less per day
Choose chicken and turkey without skin or remove skin before eating
Eat fish, like cod, that has less saturated fat than either chicken or meat
Dry pe
as and beans and tofu (bean curd) are great meat substitutes
Limit egg yolks to no more than 2 yolks per week, including egg yolks in baked goods
Substitute egg whites for whole eggs
Milk, Yogurt, and Cheese  
Eat 2 to 3 servings per day of low-fat or nonfat dairy products
Choose varieties that have 3 grams of fat or less per ounce, including low-fat (1%) or
nonfat cottage cheese
Buy frozen desserts that are lower in saturated fat, like ice milk, low-fat frozen yogurt,
sorbet
Try low-fat or nonfat sour cream or cream cheese blends

and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine and Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in 
Young Children  
Phase:  Phase 4  
Population:  Up to 280 children , 12-16 months of age,  who will receiv e 13-valent 
conjugate pneumococcal  vaccine ( PCV13 ), Diphtheria Toxoid, Tetanus 
Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (DTaP), and  inactivated influenza 
vaccine ( IIV) during the 2017- 2018 influenza season  
Clinical Sites:  Two:  Duke  University (Lead); Kaiser Permanente  (Contributing ) 
Study Duration:  8 months  during the  2017- 2018 influenza season  
 
Participa nt 
Duration:  Up to 37 days  
Description of 
Study Procedures:  This is a prospective, randomized, open -label clinical trial . Young 
children will be randomized (1:1) to receive either simultaneous 
administration o f PCV13 , DTaP , and IIV  vaccines (Visit 1)  followed by a 
health education visit without vaccination  ~ 2 weeks later (Visit 2) , or 
sequential administration of PCV13  and DTaP  (Visit 1) followed by IIV  
and health education ~ 2 weeks later (Visit 2) . 
 
Parents or a legal authorized representative (LAR) will assess fever and 
other solicited systemic adverse events  on the day of, the next 7 days  
(through Day 8) following Visit 1 and Visit 2 using either a web-based 
data collection system  or a paper diary card.  Febrile seizure and serious 
adverse events will be captured  during the entire study period.  
Parental/LAR perceptions about their child’s vaccine schedule will be 
assessed  on the 8th day following Visit 2 . 
Objectives : Primary Objective (PO):  
PO 1:  To compare the proportions of children with fever following 
simultaneous versus sequential vaccination with PCV13, DTaP, and IIV 
during 2 visits. Children in the sequential vaccination group will receive 
PCV13 and DTaP at Visit 1 followed by IIV and health education at Visit 
2.   Children in the simultaneous vaccination group will receive PCV13, 
DTaP, and IIV at Visit 1, followed by a health education visit without 
vaccination at Visit 2.  Fever will be assessed on the visit day  of, and the 
day after (days 1 -2) each visit.

9 1 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background 
 
Fever  is commonly observed in children following receipt of their routine immunizations.1 
The CDC vaccine  information state ments (VIS) designate fever as a  side effect following  
numerous  childhood vaccines  including:  Hepatitis B; diphtheria, tetanus , and acellular  
pertus sis (DTaP); Haemophilus i nfluenza type B (Hib);  13-valent  conjugate 
pneumococcal  (PCV13);  inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); measles , mumps, and 
rubella (MMR);  varicella;  and measles , mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current -vis.html }.  While the  exact mechanisms 
and functions of fever are not completely understood, some have suggested fever has a 
beneficial role in response to infection 2. However, in the context of immunization, fever 
is considered an adverse event that leads to increased medical visits, and can contribute 
to reluctance to vaccinate 3. 
In most cases,  the fever following childhood vaccination is mild and resolves  within  a few 
days; however,  in a small proportion of cases,  fever  can be clinically severe .  For young 
children, fever following immunizations can also trigger the occurrence of a febrile 
seizure (FS)  which is the most common neurological event in childhood 4. As also noted 
in the VIS, FS  occur as a potential  side effect following several different vaccines 
including  MMR,  varicella,  and MMRV vaccines.  In addition, the VIS for IIV notes that 
young children receiving IIV along with PCV13 or DTaP may be more likely to have a 
FS.  Likewise, the VIS for PCV13 notes that children receiving IIV at the same time as 
PCV13 may be more likely to have a FS.   The DTaP VIS discusses fever in children with 
a history of seizure,  but FS  are not specifically mentioned as a potential complication.  
While a potential complication of fever following pediatric vaccinations, FS  can also 
occur in the setting of other fever triggering illnesses in young children.  Typically, FS  
are most commonly  observed in children between 6 months and 3 years  of age with the 
peak  occurrence at 18 months of age.5 Approximately, 2-5% of children experience at 
least one FS before the age of 5 years  6.  Besides a prior FS, a family history of FS is 
also a risk factor for FS occurrence  7. For children experiencing a FS, the recurrence 
rate is generally believed to be 30% but may approach 50% in the youngest children. 
Although  generally  considered a benign condition,  the occurrence  of a FS can be quite 
frightening  and anxiety  provoking in parents  of these children.  
The current statements regarding risks for FS  following IIV and PCV13 vaccines, as 
noted above, were included in the VIS following clinical and study observations made 
during the 2010- 2011 influenza season.  In 2010 an increased risk of FS  was noted 
among southern hemisphere children within 24 hours of receiving CSL influenza 
vaccine.8  With a heightened awareness after the southern hemisphere experience, 
during the 2010- 2011 influenza season,  the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS) detected a signal for an increased occurrence of FS  among children younger 
than 2 years of age who had received IIV.9  As Fluzone was the only US licensed 
vaccine for children of this age, the increased occurrence was specific to this IIV 
product. A study by the  Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to assess FS after the 2010-
2011 influenza vaccine noted an elevated risk of FS on the day of and day following 
(days 1-2) the first dose of trivalent influenza vaccine (I IV3).10 The risk was elevated for 
both IIV3 and PCV13 and was highest when I IV3 was co -administered with PCV13.  
Among children 6 to 59 months of age  in this VSD study , 16 month- olds had the highest 
risk for FS.  The VSD continued with additional studies to further explore this 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
10 association.  A subsequent  analysis  by VSD for the 2013- 2014  and 2014 -2015 seasons  
noted an increased  FS risk on the day of and day following the ﬁrst dose of IIV3 during 
the 2014– 2015 season in children aged 6– 23 months.11  An analysis including both 
seasons noted that the relative risk of FS  was signiﬁcantly elevated for IIV3 and IIV4 
with concomitant PCV13 vaccination and not for IIV3 or IIV4 alone. Finally, the VSD did 
a study of children 6 through 23 months of age during the periods from 2006 to 2011 . 
The concomitant administration of IIV3  + PCV and I IV3 + DTaP -containing vaccines 
had higher risks of FS than when the vaccines were given independently. The 
concomitant administration of PCV + DTaP  + IIV-containing vaccines had the highest 
relative risk.  These increased risks with concomitant vaccination were observed in all 
influenza seasons studied.12 A separate study conducted by the Post -Licensure Rapid  
Immunization Safety Monitoring Program  (PRISM)  was unable to confirm  the VSD 
findings  and did not detect  an increased  risk of FS for 2010– 2011  IIV3 or PCV13,  when 
adjusting for concomitant  vaccines.13  It is unclear  why the VSD and PRISM  studies  did 
not find comparable results.    
As an elevated risk of FS has been  noted , particularly  with concomitant  administration  
of PCV13  and IIV, one would expect  to observe higher  rates  of fever  when PCV13  is 
administered  with IIV compared  to when they are administered separately.   An 
observational  study  conducted by Clinical Immunization  Safety  Assessment  (CISA ) 
investigators  in 2011 -2012,  a season  during  which  the vaccine was unchanged  from 
2010- 2011 when higher  rates  of FS were  detected,  noted that on day of and day 
following  vaccination,  children aged  6-23 months,  receiving  IIV3 and PCV13  
simultaneously  had higher  rates  of fever  than those  receiving  IIV3 or PCV13  without  the 
other  product .14 Temperatures  were  measured using  a temporal  artery  thermometer.  
The proportion of children with fever ≥ 38°C in the 1 -2 days after vaccination was 7.5% 
in those receiving IIV3 alone, 9.5 % in those receiving PCV13 alone and 37.6%, in 
those receiving both vaccines. This effect was greater following the first dose of IIV3 
when compared to the second dose.  These data lend support to findings of the VSD 
investigatio ns suggesting a higher rate of FS occurring after concomitant administration 
of PCV13 and IIV.  In addition, in an early 2003 study of IIV in children 6 through 23 
months of age, we noted the percentage of children with axillary temperatures > 37.8°C 
within 3 days of IIV was 7% when IIV3 was given concomitantly with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, 4% when given with any diphtheria- tetanus toxoid- acellular pertussis 
combination vaccine, and 5% when given alone.15 
1.2 Summary & Rationale  
 
Fever after vaccination is relatively common and may serve as a pr oxy for febrile seizure 
risk.  Given the uncertainties about the association of simultaneously administered 
PCV13, DTaP, and IIV in young children  and risk for febrile seizure, a prospective 
randomized clinical study could provide much- needed data on risks of increased fever 
and hence the potential  for the development of FS . Although one potential strategy for 
preventing FS is the use of antipyretic medications around the time of vaccination, the 
use of antipyretics to prevent FS  in the setting of feve r has not been shown to be an 
effective strategy.16 Furthermore, an antipyretic strategy to prevent FS  following 
vaccination has yet to be proven to work and has the potential for blunting of vaccine 
immune responses particularly for PCV and DTaP vaccines.17  An alternate strategy is 
administering vaccines sequentially rather than concomitantly when their concomitant 
use has been shown to result in more fever and resulting FS . Furthermore, c linics 
frequently administer influenza vaccine as  a stand -alone vacci ne; among children who 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
11 received IIV in the VSD 2010- 11 study, 54% of children received it alone.  10  It is likely to 
be logistically  feasible to separate visits between influenza vaccine and other non -
influenza childhood vaccines; this could be done without a child becoming delayed on 
the recommended immunization sc hedule.  Parents and providers would benefit from 
knowing if separating the IIV vaccine from other recommended vaccines actually 
reduces fever and hence the overall  risk for febrile seizure after vaccination or if it just 
spreads the risk over two time poi nts.   
 
We therefore propose to conduct a study to assess fever following simultaneous vs. 
sequential PCV13, DTaP  and IIV  administration in children of an age of peak FS risk.   
This study  will provide evidence that may  help healthcare providers who care for children 
at high risk for FS make vaccination decisions.   The current study will not include 
children at high risk of FS, as anecdotally it has been noted that some of these children 
per recommendations from their pr ovider may already be receiving PCV13/DTaP and IIV 
sequentially.  Although the study will not include these at risk children, the findings will   
provide indirect evidence on whether spacing IIV and other childhood vaccines over two 
visits might potentially be useful as a strategy to prevent fever and febrile seizures after 
inactivated vaccines in children at high risk for febrile seizure.   This study could help 
quantify the number of additional fevers, if any, which occur after simultaneous vs 
sequential vaccination.  This information would also provide anticipatory guidance to 
parents about fever after simultaneous vaccination .   
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
Primary Objective  (PO):  
PO 1: To compare the proportions of children with fever following simultaneous versus 
sequential vaccination with PCV13, DTaP, and IIV during two visits. Children in the 
sequential vaccination group will receive PCV13 and DTaP at Visit 1 followed by IIV and 
health education at Visit 2.    Children in the simultaneous vaccination group will receive 
PCV13, DTaP, and IIV at Visit 1, followed by a health education visit without vaccination 
at Visit 2.  Fever will be assessed on the visit day  of, and the day after (days  1-2) each 
visit. 
The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of children with fever will be higher in 
children after the simultaneous vs. the sequential schedule.  
Secondary Objectives (SO):  
SO 1: To compare the proportions of children with fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 
1 and Visit 2 separately, in the simultaneous versus sequential vaccination group.  
 
SO 2 : To compare the clinical importance of fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the simultaneous versus sequential group. Clinical 
importance is assessed based on severity of fever, duration of fever, and medical care 
utilization for fever.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Main study design  
 
This study  is a prospective, randomized open- label clinical trial that will be conducted 
during the 2017- 2018 influenza season.  Results from the 2017- 2018  influenza season 
will help guide whether this study  will be repeated during the 2018 -2019 influenza 
season under  a new protocol .   During the 2017- 2018 season,  approximately 280 
children will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente  
Northern California . Eligible children will be randomized to receive simultaneous or 
sequentially administered US -licensed PCV13,  US-licensed DTaP  vaccine,  and US-
licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Children in the simultaneous group will 
receive PCV13, DTaP, and IIV vaccines at Visit  1, and then return for a health education  
visit without vaccination about 2 weeks later (Visit 2).  Children in the sequential group 
will receive both PCV13 and DTaP without IIV at Visit 1, and then will receive IIV and 
health education about 2 weeks later (Visit 2).  Parents will record the  occurrence of 
fever, solicited adverse events, medical care utilization, and receipt of antipy retics over 8 
days following Visit 1 and Visit 2. In addition, febrile seizures  and serious adverse events  
will be recorded for the entire study period ( from enrollment through 8 days following the 
Visit 2 ) will be assessed through parental report and char t review . 
 
Young children aged 12- 16 months  will be enrolled over a period of approximately 7 
months.  Children will be followed for up to 37  days following enrollment.   The first 10 
children enrolled at Duke University Medical Center will be enrolled in a study pilot to 
quickly assess study feasibility benchmarks and make protocol adjustments if 
necessary.   Data from pilot participants will also contribute to the analysis of primary, 
secondary and exploratory outcomes.

5.2 Parent /LAR Permission Process (Informed Consent)  
The consent process will take place in research or clinic exam rooms behind closed 
doors to assure privacy of the prospective participant.  Study staff will be available to 
answer all parent questions before and after permission is obtained.  Parent(s)/LAR(s) 
will be given as much time as needed after being approached about their child 
participating in the study and needing to decide whether or not to participate.  We 
anticipate that the initial consent discussion, including presenting the information in the 
consent document and answering questions will take about 30 minutes.   
Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will have the opportunity to take the consent form home and discuss 
the document with other family members or friends.  During the consent process , it will 
be stressed that participation is voluntary and that parents can withdraw permission for 
their child to participate at any time.  Permission will not be obtained from 
parent(s)/LAR(s)  who do not read, who are blind, or who do not read/understand 
English. Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will be given a copy of the signed informed consent to take 
home with them.  The original copy of the consent will be kept in the study records and a 
third copy will be included in the child’s medical record per local requirements . Eligibility 
will also be assessed.  
 
5.3 Demographic Information, Medical History, Immunization History  
The participant’s age, race/ethnicity, day care attendance and the number of other 
children in the household will be obtained from parent/guardian report at the time of 
enrollment. The insurance payer status for the child will be obtained from the electronic 
health record (EHR).  The participant’s medical history including: birthweight; history of 
prematurity ; seizure disorder (including febrile seizure history and family history of febrile 
seizure in sibling or parent) ; significant medical c onditions (cardi ac disease, pulmonary 
disease including asthma or recurrent wheezing or chronic lung conditions, renal 
disease, diabetes, anemia, hemoglobinopathies)  and concomitant medications taken 
within 2 weeks of enrollment will be obtained by review of the electroni c health record 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
24 (EHR) and will be reviewed and confirmed by the parent/guardian at the time of 
enrollment.  Concomitant medications , history of intercurrent hospitalizations or febrile 
seizures  will also be verified at Visit 2.  
 
Information on prior histor y of IIV  receipt and on prior receipt of Diphtheria Tetanus 
Toxoid (DT), Diphtheria, Tetanus and acellular Pertussis vaccine (DTaP), and PCV13 
will be obtained at the time of study enrollment. The EHR and/or respective 
immunization registry will be reviewed for vaccination information. R esearch staff will 
document the vaccine, product brand, and date of administration of prior doses of IIV, 
DTaP, and PCV13 received.  If the information is not available in the EHR or 
immunization registry, a written r ecord documenting prior receipt of these vaccines 
would be considered acceptable.   
Vaccines received as part of the study and concomitant immuniz ation received during 
the study, will be documented by the research staff.  Documentation will include: product  
brand, lot number, site and date/time of vaccine administered during study participation.  
 
At the end of the study, the medical record will be reviewed to assess and record the 
occurrence of any serious adverse events or febrile seizures that occurred during the 
period of study enrollment.  
 
5.4 Temporal Artery Temperature  Measurement  and Fever Assessments  
Participants’ t emperatures will be taken using a digital temporal artery thermometer that 
will be provided to each parent /LAR  during enrollment  to use for t he study and keep for 
use following the study . The initial temperature will be recorded in the clinic and study 
staff will demonstrate proper use of the thermometer to the parent. Temperatures will be 
collected during both Visit 1 and Visit 2.  Thereafter, parent(s)/LAR(s) will measure and 
record the participant’s temperature at approximately the same time each day 
(preferably after 6:00 PM or right before participant goes to bed) beginning on Day 1 
(day of vacc ination) and will do so through Day 8 following Visits 1 and 2.  In addition, 
parents will be instructed to take a temperature using a temporal artery thermometer if 
their child feels warm or feverish at any time from Days 1- 8 after Visit 1 and 2 and to 
record the temperature on the memory aid.  Temperature measurements will be done for 
both the simultaneous and sequential groups in a similar fashion such that those 
children in the simultaneous group, who do not receive vaccinations at Visit 2, will also 
have temperatures measured.  If at any time a temperature ≥ 100.4°F ( ≥ 38°C) or ≤ 95°F 
(≤ 35°F) is recorded, a second measurement will be taken  within 20 minutes .  The 
highest of those two temperature measurements will be recorded. If more than one 
temperatu re is take n on the same day  (prior to bedtime) , the highest temperature for that 
day should be recorded on either the paper memory aid or entered into REDCap. Any 
temperature measured after your child’s bedtime memory aid  entry has been completed, 
should be considered for the next day’s memory aid  entry.  
 
All temperatures will be measured using a temporal artery thermometer (Exergen 
Medical Scanner Model TAT -2000C)18,19.  Although parents may elect to use an 
alternate method for measuring temperatures, they will be required to measure temporal 
artery temperature measurements as specified above.  
 
For this study, temperat ures will be documented using either the electronic memory aid 
through REDCap or the paper memory aid. The preferred method for documentation in 
this study is REDCap.  All parent(s)/LAR(s) will be encouraged to use the paper memory 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
25 aid as a tool to initial ly record temperatures and then enter information into REDCap. 
However, they can directly enter temperature information into REDCap if desired without 
using paper.  For parents electing to use REDCap, missing or out of range temperature 
data will be verifi ed with the parent(s)/LARS on day 3 and missing data will be obtained 
on day 9 as needed following Visits 1 and 2. For parents electing to use paper memory 
aids only, temperature data will be verified on day 3 following Visits 1 and 2. 
Parents/LAR using the paper memory aid alone will submit the Visit 1 memory aid to 
study staff during Visit 2, and will mail the Visit 2 memory aid to the study team following 
the 8 -day post -visit 2 period. The study team will review the paper memory aid at the 
time of receipt. 
 
For parent(s)/LAR(s)  entering data into REDCap, if there are data discrepancies for 
temperatures entered directl y into REDCap or obtained over the phone, the information 
provided by the parent in REDCap will be counted as the correct temperature 
inform ation unless verified as otherwise by study staff.  
 
For parent(s)/LAR(s)  using only the paper memory aid, if there are data discrepancies 
for temperatures recorded on the memory aid or obtained over the phone, the 
information provided by the parent on the memory aid will be counted as the correct 
temperature information unless verified as otherwise by study staff.  
5.5 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
This is a n open -label, prospective, randomized study for young children  who are to 
receive PCV13, DTaP  and IIV vaccines.  The specific vaccines administered are  based 
on availability from manufacturers  prior to the 201 7-2018  influenza season  (see section 
5.5.3) .  
 
5.5.1  Randomization  
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either PCV13, DTaP and IIV  
simultaneously or sequentially (PC V13 and DTaP followed by IIV ~2 weeks later ) using a 
permuted block randomization scheme stratified by study site (i.e. Duke University 
Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente Northern California). The first 10 children 
enrolled in the pilot at Duke University will be randomized in a block of 10 such that 5 
children will receive simultaneous vaccination and 5 will receive sequential vaccination.  
The project statistician at Duke University will generate permuted block randomization 
schemes, which will be uploaded to REDCap. The randomization schedule will not be 
available to the study staff, so the next randomization allocation will not be known before 
randomization occurs. Follo wing confirmation of study eligibility criteria during Visit 1, 
participant randomization will be through REDCap with treatment allocation recorded on 
the CRF.  
5.5.2  Blinding  
This study will be open label and study staff and subjects will not be blinded to treat ment 
arm assignments . 
 
Vaccine (Supply, Storage, and Administration) and Educational Materials  
Vaccine Supply and Storage 
For consistency, the same formulations of DTaP, IIV and PCV13 vaccines will be used 
throughout this study to the extent feasible.  There are multiple products on the market 
for DTaP and IIV vaccines.  In the United States,  only one PCV13 product (Wyeth 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
26 Pharmaceuticals, Inc ) is licensed (package inserts, available at 
https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm ) 
   
Because Duke and Kaiser Study  clinics may not stock the same  DTaP and IIV products 
in their routine supply, DTaP  and IIV (single dose vials or prefilled syringes) will b e 
purchased for this study  using contract Task Order funds. DTaP and IIV will be 
maintained either at the respective primary research center or their affiliated clinic sites 
in a monitored medication refrigerator  at 2-8°C in accordance with package insert 
guidelines .  Study supplied vaccines should be segregated from the clinic’s routine 
vaccine supply.  Study supplied vaccine may be transported between the primary 
research center and clinic sites using each site’s Standard Operating Procedure for 
Study Pro duct Transport as long as the cold chain is maintained.  
• Infanrix® (GSK) will be purchased for use as the DTaP  vaccine to be 
administered in this study. However, if there are vaccine supply issues at the 
time of the conduct of this study, Daptacel® (Sanofi) may be purchased and used 
in the place of Infanrix®.  
• 2017- 2018 Quadrivalent Fluzone® (Sanofi) will be purchased for use as the IIV  
administered  in this study. If not available, an alternate US licensed IIV with an 
indication for this age group w ill be used.  
• PCV13 (Wyeth) will be used as in this study. This is the only US FDA licensed 
PCV13 product available.  Because both study sites routinely use the Wyeth 
PCV13 vaccine in their clinics, PCV13 will be supplied by the participant’s clinic 
site from their usual vaccine supply  for use in the study  and will not be 
purchased using contract Task Order funds . PCV13 will be maintained at the 
respective clinic sites in a monitored medication refrigerator at 2- 8°C in 
accordance with package insert guidelines and clinic standard operating 
procedures. The cost of PCV13 will be billed to patient’s insurance.    
Vaccine Administration  
• To as sure adherence to study randomization assignment, US licensed 
PCV13, DTaP,  and IIV vaccines will be administered as study procedures . 
Young children meeting eligibility criteria for the study will either receive  
1) A single intramuscular (IM) 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 vaccine, 
a single IM 0.5 mL dose of DTaP  vaccine and a single IM 
0.25 or 0.50 mL dose (depending upon IIV product used but 
used according to package insert directions) of IIV at Visit 1 
(simultaneous vaccination group)  
OR 
2) A single IM 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 vaccine and a single IM 
0.5 mL dose of DT aP at Visit 1 , followed by a single IM 0.25 
or 0.50 mL dose (depending upon IIV product used but 
used according to package insert directions) of IIV vaccine 
~ 2 weeks  later (sequential vaccination group).  
 
• Following randomization assignment within the electronic data capture system, 
a licensed provider (RN, NP, PA, MD) from the study team will administer all 
vaccines . IIV and DTaP will be administered in the vastus lateralis muscle 
(anterolateral thigh).  PCV13 and other concomitantly administered vaccines  
will be administered in the other vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh). 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
27 Concomitant vaccines such as MMR, Varicella and MMRV vaccine may be 
administered in either thigh or in the deltoid area as well, consistent with ACIP  
General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/general -recs/index.html  
 
When more than one vaccine is given in the same limb, 1 inch or more should 
separate the injection sites, if possible, so that any local reactions can be 
differentiated. Concomitant vaccine administration will be allowed at Visit 1 but 
not Visit 2 unless deemed a personal or public health priority by the health care 
provider caring  for this patient or the study team. Influenza vaccine may be 
administered outside of the study window in case of public health emergency 
or personal exposure.  
 
• Emergency  manag ement supplies  will be availa ble for initia l treatment of an 
allergic reaction if needed. Children will be observed in the respective clinic 
area by study staff for 15 minutes post -vaccination.   
• The vaccine brand, manufacturer, lot number, expiration date, site of 
administration, and date/time of administration will be recorded on t he case 
report form ( CRF). Vaccination information will also be entered into the 
Immunization Registry and Medical Record.  
•  Receipt and disposition of study supplied DTaP and IIV  will recorded on the 
study product accountability log.  
•  Following adm inistration,  used study  syringes will  be disposed of accor ding 
to the respective clinic sites stan dard operating procedure.  
  
Educational Materials Provided to Parent(s)/LAR(s)  at Visit 2 
 A brief educational intervention will be provided to all parent(s)/LAR(s) .  
Parent (s)/LAR(s) will be provided  educational materials regarding  dental care for young 
children.  A handout posted on the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry website 
regarding caries prevention in young children 
(http://www.mychildrensteeth.org/education/parent_fact_sheet_on_caries_bacteria/ ) will 
be given to parent(s)/LAR(s) .   Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will also be provided with a free small 
soft bristle toothbrush for their child.  
5.6 Solicited Systemic Adverse Events (Days 1- 8 Following Visits 1 and 2)  
Temperature and other solicited systemic adverse events will be assessed and 
documented by parent(s)/LAR(s) after Visit 1 and Visit 2.  Beginning on the evening of 
Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Day 1), parent(s)/LAR(s) will measure and record their child’s 
temporal artery temperature using the study -supplied thermometer as described in more 
detail in Section 5.4.   
Parent(s)/LAR(s) will r ate solicited systemic adverse events (other than fever) according 
to grading in Table 2  beginning on the evening of Study Visits 1 and 2 (Day 1) and for 
the next 7 days following the study visits (i.e. through Day 8).  Each of the following 
symptoms fussi ness or irritability, change in eating habits and sleepiness, should be 
assessed each day.  For the day of vaccination, symptoms should be assessed from the 
time of vaccination until the time information is recorded.  For each subsequent day 
through Day 8 symptoms should be assessed from the time information is recorded on 
the previous day until the time it is recorded on the subsequent day. Grading for the child 
solicited systemic symptoms will be recorded on the study -supplied paper memory aid.  
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
28 Parent(s)/ LAR(s)  will be instructed to notify child’s primary care provider promptly in 
addition to study staff using the 24- hour contact number provided in the memory aid in 
the event of any severe (Grade 3) temperature elevation or solicited systemic adverse 
event . Parent(s)/LAR(s)  who at any time report severe solicited adverse events or 
express any concern about symptoms/unsolicited events  to the study team  will be 
encouraged to follow up with their child’s primary care provider. Study staff will assist 
with coordination of referral appointments as necessary.

For this study, solicited adverse events will be documented  using either the electronic 
memory aid through REDCap or the paper memory aid. The preferred method for 
documentation in this study is REDCap.  All parent(s)/LAR(s) will be encouraged to use 
the paper memory aid as a tool to initially record solicited adv erse events and then enter 
information into REDCap. However, they can directly enter solicited adverse event 
information into REDCap if desired without using paper.  For parents electing to use 
REDCap, missing solicited adverse event data will be verified with the parent(s)/LARS 
on day 9 as needed following Visits 1 and 2. Parents/LAR using the paper memory aid 
alone will submit the Visit 1 memory aid to study staff during Visit 2, and will mail the 
study Visit 2 memory aid to the study team following the 8- day post -visit 2 period.  The 
study team will review the paper memory aid at the time of receipt.   
 
For parent(s)/LAR(s) entering data into REDCap, if there are data discrepancies for 
solicited adverse event entered directly into REDCap or obtained over the phone, the 
information provided by the parent in REDCap will be counted as the correct information 
unless verified as otherwise by study staff.  
 
For parent(s)/LAR(s) using only the paper memory aid, if there are data discrepancies 
for solicited adverse events recorded on the memory aid, the information on the memory 
aid should be taken as the correct adverse event information unless verified as 
otherwise by study staff.

29 5.7 Medical Care Utilization, Antipyretic Use, and Febrile Seizures (Days 1- 8 
Following Visits 1 and 2)  
Parent(s)/LAR(s) will record medical care  utilization, use of antipyretic medications, and 
febrile seizure occurrence ( Table 3)  beginning on the evening of Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Day 
1) and for the next 7 days following the study visits (through Day 8).  On the evening of 
Visit 1 and Visit 2, medical care utilization related to fever, use of antipyretic 
medications, and febr ile seizure occurrence should be rated from the time of Visit 1 or 2 
until the information is recorded.  For each subsequent day through Day 8, these factors 
should be assessed from the time the information is recorded on one day to the time 
information is  recorded on the next day.

For this study, medical care utilization, antipyretic use and the occurrence of febrile 
seizures will be documented using either the electronic memory aid through REDCap or 
the paper memory aid. The preferred method for documentation in this study is 
REDCap.  All parent(s)/LAR(s) will be encouraged to use the paper memory aid as a tool 
to initially record information  and then enter information into REDCap;  however,  they can 
directly enter information into REDCap if desired without using paper.  For parents 
electing to use REDCap, missing data will be verified with the parent(s)/LARS on day 9 
as needed following Visits 1 and 2. Parents/LAR using the paper memory aid alone will 
submit the Visit  1 memory aid to study staff during Visit 2, and will mail the study Visit 2 
memory aid to the study team following the 8- day post -visit 2 period.  The study team 
will review the pap er memory aid  at the time of receipt.  
 
For parent(s)/LAR(s) entering data into REDCap, if there are data discrepancies for 
information entered directly into REDCap or obtained over the phone, then information 
provided by the parent in REDCap will be counted as the correct information unless 
verified as otherwise by study staff.

March 2, 2018  
30  
For parent(s)/LAR(s) using only the paper memory aid, if there are data discrepancies 
for information on the memory aid, the information on the memory aid should be taken  
as the correct information unless verified as otherwise by study staff.  
5.8 Additional Safety Assessment s (Visit 1 Day  1 – Visit 2 Day 8)  
While completing the memory aid and during the in- person visit (Visit 2), 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be prompted to report unsolicited serious adverse events (SAEs)  
and occurrence of febrile seizures . This will include asking : Has your child been seen for 
any medical visits? Has your child been evaluated in an emergency department or 
admitted to the hospital? If so,  state reason why .” Parent(s)/LAR(s)  who at any time 
express any concern about symptoms  or serious unsolicited events will be encouraged 
to follow up with their child’s  primary care provider. Study staff will assist with 
coordination of referral appointments as necessary.  
Medical records will be obtained and reviewed for any medical appointment /s other than 
for routine scheduled visits (preventive care visits or planned specialty care visits) , 
febrile seizures, and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) from Visit 1  Day 1 through  Visit 2 
Day 8.  
IIV, PCV13 and DTaP  administration for children are routinely recommended such that 
we do not anticipate having a significant issue with SAEs. However, we will monitor 
study participants for SAEs during the protocol -defined surveillance period from 
enrollment through 8  days following Visit 2 . An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one 
of the following conditions:  
• Results  in death  during  the period of protocol -defined surve illance   
• Is life -threatening (defined as im mediate risk of death  at the time of the  event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitaliz ation during  the period of protocol -defined surveillance 
(other than routine scheduled hospital admission )  
• Results  in a persi stent or signif icant disability/in capacity  
• Any other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require hospitalization,  may be considered  an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical  judgment, the  event  may jeopardize the subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the  outcomes listed  above.  Examples  of such  
medical  events  include allergic bronchospasm  requiring  intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room  or at home,  
 
Study site investigators will assess relatedness to study vaccine (related, possibly 
related, unlikely related, or not related) for SAEs and febrile seizure.  A febrile 
seizure judged to be related to a non- study vaccine would not be considered related 
to, or probably  related to vaccine.  SAEs will be reported to the CDC’s Immunization 
Safety Office  within 48 hours of study staff awareness of the event, and the 
respective institutional review boards  or human subject reviewing officials at DUHS , 
Kaiser  and CDC  per local IRB reporting requirements.   If indicated, SAEs will be 
reported through the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 
https://vaers.hhs.gov/index .   
Given that this study involves administering US-licensed vaccines that are included 
as part of routine clinical care,  there will not be a designated  data safety  monitoring  
board for this  study. If deemed necessary, we will designate an independent safety 
monitor with relevant expertise,  in collaboration with the CDC.

31 5.9 Parental P erceptions  
At Visit 2, we will provide  parent(s)/LAR(s)  electing to use the paper memory aid with a 
paper survey to be completed 8 days after V isit 2 about their preferences regarding 
receiving influenza vaccine at the same time or separately from other routinely 
administered pediatric vaccines. Parents/LARs electing to use REDCap will receive the 
survey electronically at Day 9 following Visit 2 to be c ompleted over the internet using 
REDCap.  W e will collect information about the  parent’s relationship to the child (mother, 
father, guardian) . Parent (s)/LAR(s)  using the paper survey  will mail it to the study team  
and the data will be entered into REDCap by study staff upon receipt  of the survey.   If 
survey information is not obtained in REDCap  or sent by mail, the information may be 
obtained over the phone.  
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
In collaboration with the CDC and Kaiser Permanente Northern California sites, t he 
research team at Duke will oversee the statistical anal ysis. The first 10 children enrolled 
in the study are considered part of a pilot to assess study feasibility and make 
adjustments in study design if necessary .  As such we will measure some key feasibility 
benchmarks as noted in Table 4.  Children enrolled in the feasibility component of the 
study will be included in the main study.  
 
The main study is designed based on prior data14 suggesting that the proportion of 
children who have fever on day 1 and/ or day 2 after the first and/ or second visit in the 
sequential group will be approximately 18% and that the proportion of children with fever 
observed following simultaneous administration during the comparable time periods will 
be at least twice as high (36%) .  
For analysis, data wil l reside on a secure Duke server  maintained by Duke Health 
Technology Solutions (DHTS) .  For the study, a database will be developed and a 
dataset for the study without personal identifiers will be made available to the CDC upon 
request.  
6.1 Sample Size and Po wer Estimation  
 
Allowing for a 10% drop out rate  given an initial N=280,  there should be approximately 
252 children enrolled into the study . If the true proportion of children  who have fever on 
day 1 and/ or day 2 after the first and/ or second visit  in the simultaneous group is 36% Table 4: Benchmarks for Pilot  
Benchmark  Target  
Valid t emperature obtained for D1 following Visit 1  80% 
Valid temperature obtained for D2 following Visit 1  80% 
Completion of Visit 2  80% 
Valid t emperature obtained for D1 following Visit 2 80% 
Valid temperature obtained for D2 following Visit 2  80% 
The thermometer was easy or very easy to use  80% 
Reporting child’s information (temperature and side effects) to the study team was 
easy or very easy  80%

March 2, 2018  
32 and the true proportion in the sequential group is 18% , then there is 90% power to reject 
the null hypothesis of no difference with N=126 per group with a two- sided alpha 0.05 
level.  This is based upon using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis to  
control for sites.  
6.2 Analysis Plan  
 
6.2.1  Study Populations  – There will be two study populations , the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
and Per Protocol populations .  The ITT Population includes any participant that 
was enrolled, randomized into the study, and received at least one study vaccine 
at Visit 1.  The Per Protocol  Population is a subset of the ITT Population 
excluding those participants  who do not provide valid temperature data on days 1 
and 2 following Visit 1 and Visit 2  and those with major protocol violations  as 
determined by the  study investigators . Statistical analyses will be performed for 
both study populations, or the ITT Population only if no participants are excluded 
from the Per Protocol  Population.   
 
6.2.2  Primary Objective 1  – To compare the proportions of children with fever following 
simultaneous versus sequential vaccination with PCV13, DTaP, and IIV during 2 
visits. Children in the sequential vaccination group  will receive PCV13 and DTaP 
at Visit 1 followed by IIV and health education at Visit 2.    Children in the 
simultaneous vaccination group  will receive PCV13, DTaP, and IIV at Visit 1, 
followed by a health education visit without vaccination at Visit 2.  Fever will be 
assessed on the visit day of, and the day after (days 1- 2) each visit.  
 
Temperatures will be measured in children on the evening of, and for 7 subsequent 
evenings following Visit 1 and Visit 2.  For the primary objective we will compare the 
proportions of children with fever (Temperature ≥ 38.0°C or ≥ 100.4° F) on day 1 
and/or day 2 following Visit 1 and Visit 2 between the simultaneous and the sequential 
vaccination groups.   Fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after either visit will be counted as 
positive for this analysis. The proportions will be compared using a Mantel -Haenszal 
statistic in a stratified analysis by site to control for the randomization blocks at the 
two-sided alpha 0.05 level.  The relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval for the occurrence fever will also be calculated.  
 
6.2.3  Secondary Ob jective  1 – To compare the proportions of children with fever on 
day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 separately, in the simultaneous versus 
sequential vaccination group.   
 
For this secondary objective we will present the proportions of children with any fever on 
day 1 and/or day 2 following vaccination for Visit  1 and separately for Visit  2.  Fever on 
day 1 and/or day 2 after either visit will be counted as positive for this  analysis. 
Proportions at each visit will be compared between the simultaneous and the sequential 
vaccination groups using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis by site to 
control for the randomization blocks. The relative risk and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval for the occurrence of any fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 
and/or  Visit 2 will also be calculated.  
 
 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
33 6.2.4  Secondary Objective 2 – To compare the clinical importance of fever on day 1 
and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the 
simultaneous versus sequential group. Clinical importance is assessed based on 
severity of fever, duration of fever, and medical care utilization for fever.  
 
To evaluate the severity  of fever, we will present the proportions of children with the 
highest level of fever defined as  Grade 2 and/or 3 (≥ 38.6°C and/or ≥  39.6°C) on day 1  
or day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2  and Visit 1  and 2 combined by simultaneous and 
sequential vaccination groups.  
 
To evaluate the duration of fever, the following analysis will be performed :  The mean 
duration of any fever  (in days)  will be  compared by simultaneous and sequential 
vaccination groups  for children with fever that began on days 1 or 2 following Visit 1, 
Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined. Each consecutive day of fever on the memory aid will 
be counted per child per visit.  Thus,  a child could contribute a maximum of 8 days per 
study vis it, should a fever be reported at each day on the memory aid.  
 
Furthermore , we will present and compare the proportion of children with medical care 
utilization for fever (telephone contact, medical office  visit, emergency dep artment visit 
or hospital admi ssion ) on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 
combined.   
   
Proportions will be compared between the simultaneous and the sequential vaccination 
groups using a Mantel -Haenszal  statistic in a stratified analysis by center to control for 
the randomization blocks . The duration of fever will be compared between groups using 
a Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test. No adjustments will be made to the alpha 
level ( two-sided alpha=0.05) for these secondary objectives.  
 
6.2.5  Exploratory  Objective s 
 
For exploratory objective 1 t he average peak temperature on day 1 and/or 2 following 
Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined will be presented by simultaneous and 
sequential vaccination groups.  To evaluate the duration of fever ,the number of fever 
degree- days on day 1 or 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined will be 
presented by simultaneous and sequential vaccination groups.   Comparisons will be 
made using a Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  
 
For exploratory objective 2 we will present  the use of antipyretics for fever on day 1 
and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the simultaneous 
versus sequential group in tables f or presentation.  The proportion of children with 
antipyretic use on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined 
will be compared  using  a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis  by site 
between  the simultaneous and sequential vaccination groups.  
 
Exploratory objective 3 that evaluates the level of severity of fever  at various time points , 
will be presented and compared using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis 
by site. 
 
Exploratory objectives 4 and 5 evaluate fever on days 3- 8 and the  clinical importance of 
fever  on days 3 -8, respectively .  We will present and compare the proportions in 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
34 objectives 4 and 5 using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis by site  to 
control for the randomizati on blocks . We will adjust for MMR and MMRV receipt at Visit 1 
if necessary when analyzing the following outcome measures - EOM 5.1, EOM 5.2, and 
EOM 5.3 due to the possibility that a measles -containing vaccine may be administered 
at Visit 1 to infants in both the simultaneous and sequential group.  Also for objective 5, 
we will present and compare t he mean duration of any fever  starting  on days 3 -8 using a 
Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test .  Other analysis to further evaluate the clinical 
importance of fever onset 3 -8 days after Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 will be performed if 
necessary.  
 
Adverse event tables and listings will be prepared to assess Exploratory Objective 6 and 
7.  The group proportions of  solicited systemic adverse events  (excluding fever) 
occurring 1- 8 days after Visit 1 and 2 will be compared as described above using a 
Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis .  The  Mantel -Haenszal statistic  will also 
be used for  group proportions of febrile seizure, and serious adverse events determined 
to be related to vaccination.   If the cell sizes are too small (i.e., less than 5) then Fisher’s 
exact test will be used.  
 
Summary tables of acceptability will be produced to addr ess Exploratory Objective 8.  
Likert scale questions will be compared between the study groups using an extended 
Mantel -Haenszal mean score statistic  in a stratified analysis.    
 
No adjustments will be made to the alpha level  (two-sided alpha=0.05)  for these 
exploratory analyses.  
 
6.2.6  Sensitivity Analyses  
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed under two conditions: 1) to exclude those who 
received antipyretics on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 ; 2) to extend 
the risk window for fever to day 3 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 .  These sensitivity analyses will 
be performed for the primary objective in both study populations (ITT and Per Protocol).  
The statistical comparison will be made  using a Mantel -Haenszal  statistic in a stratified 
analysis by center to control for the randomization blocks .  No adjustments will be made 
to the alpha level ( two-sided alpha=0.05) for these sensitivity analyses.  
    
6.3 Data Management  
The amount of data that will be collected for the proposed project will be substantial and 
will require a sophisticated, practical and flexible system that can accommodate different 
modes of data collection and several separate linked surveys. The novel Vanderbilt -
designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research information, 
the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  platform, will be used to design study 
forms, including the reaction forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect 
information from study subjects. This system will be used by Duke  and Kaiser  for data 
management.  All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human 
subjects and requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. After initial 
set-up, the work load required for electronic data collection will be substantially reduced 
(description of REDCap resources below).20  Duke investigators have previously used 
the REDCap system for collection and analysis of large quantities of da ta. Participants 
will be given the option to fill out their reactogenicity diary either directly i n the REDCap 
system or on paper. The preferred method of data capture for this study is REDCap.  
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
35 Regardless of the method of data entry chosen, all parents(s) /LAR(s) will be encouraged 
to use the paper memory aid to initially record information. Parents(s)/LAR(s) who 
choose the paper form will receive phone call s or be contacted by e- mail on Day 3 
(Visits 1A, 2A) to collect the fever  information recorded on their diary card, which will 
then be entered by study personnel ont o a paper CRF.  Participants who choose to enter 
the information directly into REDCap will receive phone calls  or be contacted by e- mail 
as needed on Day 3 and/or Day 9  if they fail to enter their  fever  information  for Days 1 
and 2 or if they are missing information for days 1 -8 respectively.  All study -related 
documents containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, case report 
forms, memory aids (Appendi ces A-D) completed by study participants, will be 
maintained in secure research offices at Duke and Kaiser , which are accessible to 
research staff only.  
 
6.3.1  Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Investigators within the NIH -funded Clinical and Tr anslational Research Unit at 
Vanderbilt have developed REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/ ), to collect and manage 
data for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed 
around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs 
and rapidly develop secure, web- based applications for collection, management and 
sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a 
single study metadata ta ble referenced by presentation- level operational modules. 
Based on this abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient 
manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. 
The concept of metadata -driven application development is well established, and the 
critical factor for successful data collection lie1 s in creating a simple workflow 
methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata 
in an efficient manner.  Of particular interest for this project, a subcomponent of REDCap, 
the REDCap Survey is designed for studies where data are collected directly from the 
research participant. This will be used with the web- based r eaction forms that will be 
completed by the study subjects.  Both products include secure institutional data hosting 
and include full audit -trails in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act ( HIPAA)  security requirements. The RED Cap Consortium is 
compr ised of 2318 active institutions .  The REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects 
with over 89,000 users spanning numerous research focus areas across the consortium.  
The current project will use this software application for the des ign of electronic forms to 
collect information from study participants, to link the baseline data, sample collection 
date, and laboratory results in an automated database family, to perform data cleaning 
and data quality assurance efficiently, and to desig n an analytical dataset for the 
analysis of the project data.  
 
Data will be entered into the REDCap database by parents or  by members of the study 
team, from Duke and Kaiser  using the paper case report forms utilized to record data 
collected as part of study procedures.  Study investigators will be responsible for 
assuring that all paper records are securely stored according to the requirements of their 
IRBs.  The study inves tigators will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the data 
entered from the paper forms into REDCap.  Only the assigned identifiers will be used in 
REDCap. Therefore, personal health identifiers will not appear in the REDCap database.  
 
In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -
in filters and checks for consistency of the data including range and limit checks, 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
36 branching logic and pull down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -
specifi ed list will be implemented and performed automatically to minimize data entry 
error. The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a 
regular basis. The data and related analytical datasets will also be stored at the lead and 
contributing sites  with secured password- protected computers. Coded data without 
personal identifiers  will be made available to the CDC and transferred using a secure 
transfer method.   
6.4 Role of the CDC Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University  and Kaiser Permanente as 
Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract . The Duke University  PI (Emmanuel “Chip” 
Walter ) will oversee the study  in partnership with the Kaiser Permanente  PI (Nicola 
Klein) .  CDC staff will collaborate with both sites to develop the protocol, conduct the 
study, ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services 
public health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC may 
receive access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information.  
 
7    HUMAN SUBJECTS  
7.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
 
Duke and Kaiser  investigators will be responsible for submitting the protocol, informed 
consent  (Appendix A), memory aids  (Appendix B), recruitment letters, flyers  
(Appendix C), and any written or verbally conveyed materials  (Appendix  D) specific to 
this project to their institutional review boards.   CDC staff will be responsible for 
submitting materials to the CD C for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .   
  
To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent  and 
HIPAA authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of 
potential subjects while recording identifiable private health information (PHI)  prior to 
obtaining the subject’s consent.  This information will be obtained from review of the 
electronic scheduling and medical record systems in the clinics  in order to determine 
eligibility for st udy enrollment. We will review information only the minimum amount of 
information necessary to determine potential eligibility, e.g. to consent will be used to 
recruit and screen only. Use of PHI in this manner involves no more than minimal risk to 
subject s and no information will leave the study sites . 
 
Continuing reviews will be submitted to the IRBs on an annual basis.  P rotocol 
deviations or concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to the overseeing 
IRB in accordance with institutional r equirements . 
7.2 Sources of Material  
Medical history, immunization history  and concomitant medication history  will be 
obtained from the medical record and from patient report.  Demographic information will 
be obtained from the medical record and patient report.  Subjects will record solicited 
adverse reactogenicity events and any medical intervention sought on the day of and 7  
additional  days following Visit 1 and Visit 2  on the memory aid (Appendix B).  Memory 
aid inf ormation will be reported to the study team during a telephone call or in the web-
based REDC ap system. The research staff will assess temperature.   Medical records 
will be reviewed  to assess for the occurrence of febrile seizures or serious adverse 
events during the entire study period.  
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
37 7.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
PCV13, DTaP  and IIV are FDA licensed vaccines approved for use in children 12 -16 
months of age . These vaccines are standard clinical practice and recommended by the 
CDC and ACIP .  Participants will be provided with the  CDC Vaccine Information 
Statements (VIS) for PCV13, DTaP and IIV  (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -
statements/dtap.html  and http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -
statements/pcv13.html ).  
 
IIV risks include minor problems  such as soreness, redness, swelling , or pain  where the 
shot was given, hoarseness , sore, red or itchy eyes , cough, fever , aches , headache, 
itching , fatigue, all of which usually occur within 1- 2 days of vaccination and are self -
limiting. Syncope (fainting) can occ ur in association with administration of injectable 
vaccines  but is less likely in young children. More serious problems  including a small 
increased risk of Guillain -Barré Syndrome  estimated at 1 or 2 additional cases per 
million people vaccinated. This is  much lower than the risk of severe complications from 
influenza infection , which can be prevented by IIV .  In addition, any medication can 
cause a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, which is estimated at ~ 1 in a million 
doses of IIV  (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/flu.html ). 
 
DTaP  risks include mild problems such as redness, swelling, and pain where the shot 
was given, redness or swelling wher e the shot was given, fever, chills,  sore joints,  
headache, body aches,  fatigue , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache, rash, and 
swollen glands, all of which usually occur within 1- 2 days of vaccination and are self -
limiting. Moderate problems include higher severity of mild problems and swelling of the 
entire arm or leg  in which the injection was given. Rarely, local injection site symptoms 
limit the ability to perform usual activities and require medical attention.  
 
PCV13 risks include mild problems s uch as drowsiness, temporary loss of appetite, 
redness, swelling, or tenderness where the shot was given, fever, increase in fussiness 
and irritability. Young children may be at increased risk for febrile seizure.  
 
Problems that could happen after any injected vaccine:  
• People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting 
or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused 
by a fall. Subjects should inform their doctor should they feel dizzy , or have vision 
changes or ringing in the ears.  This is unlikely in small children.   
• Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a 
vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses,  and would happen 
within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any medicine, 
there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death.  
 
• The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not make 
specific  recommendations about simultaneous or sequential administration of 
PCV13, DTa P and IIV for young children.  However, based on the ACIP 
General Recommendations, PCV13, DTaP and IIV (all inactivated vaccines) 
may be administered to young children either simultaneously or 
sequentially.   The current General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization 
(assessed at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip- recs/general -
recs/i ndex.html  
 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
38 Simultaneous administration of vaccines is defined as administering more than one 
vaccine on the same clinic day, at different anatomic sites, and not combined in the 
same syringe. Experimental evidence and extensive clinical experience provide the 
scientific basis for administering vaccines simultaneously. Simultaneously administering 
all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the time of a visit increases the probability 
that a child, adolescent, or adult will be vaccinated fully by the appropriate age.    
Pneumococcal conjugate, D iphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis 
(DTaP ), and quadrivalent  inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV) can be administered 
simultaneously.   
 
There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality about information obtained as part of 
this study.  There is a potential risk of a short delay in influenza protection by delaying the 
receipt of influenza vaccine 2 weeks.  If parents are concerned that  their child has an 
influenza- like illness (characterized by fever and irritability, cough, sore throat, or 
vomiting), they should seek care for their child with their child’s health care provider. If 
their child’s provider suspects or determines that thei r child has influenza, there are 
medications to treat influenza illness and their provider may opt to treat their child with 
one of these medications.   
 
7.4 Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
7.4.1  Protections against Risk 
Subjects will be counseled on possible side effects following vaccination and followed 
closely during the 8 days post -vaccination for assessment of moderate to severe 
systemic reactogenicity.  Subjects with a prior history o f any severe reaction following 
IIV, PCV1 3 or DTaP  will be excluded from study enrollment.  
Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. 
Computerized participant information will be kept in password protected files on secured 
servers.   Paper case report  forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study 
personnel.   Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifiable 
participant information.  
 
7.4.2  ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
The project  is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov . ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  
 
7.5 Human Subjects  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator and study team will 
comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, Good Clinical Practices, and ethical 
principles. The parent or LAR must sign and date the written informed consent form prior 
to initiation of any study procedure.  
 
7.5.1  Vulnerable Subjects Research 
Vulnerable subjects  
Children are a vulnerable research population and require additional protections when 
they are potential research subjects. This is a minimal risk study, involving the 
administration of routine childhood vaccinations in a manner that is consistent with ACIP 
recommendations.   Because this study is no more than minimal risk , the permission of 
Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children  Version 3.0 
March 2, 2018  
39 only one parent/LAR will be obtained.   Because the children are so young, 12  through 
16 months, they are not capable of providing assent.

2 PROTOCOL OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  
a) PO 1: To compare the proportions of children with fever following simultaneous versus 
sequential vaccination with PCV13, DTaP, and IIV during 2 visits. Children in the 
sequential vaccination group will receive PCV13 and DTaP at Visit 1 followed by IIV and 
health education at Visit 2.    Children in the simultaneous vaccination group will receive 
PCV13, DTaP, and IIV at Visit 1, followed by a health education visit without vaccination 
at Visit 2.  Fever will be assessed on the visit day of, and the day after ( days 1 -2) each 
visit.  
2.2 Secondary  
a) SO 1:  To compare the proportions of children with fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 
1 and Visit 2 separately, in the simultaneous versus sequential vaccination group.  
b) SO 2:  To compare the clinical importance of fever  on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 
and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the simultaneous versus sequential group. 
Clinical importance is assessed based on severity of fever, duration of fever, and 
medical care utilization for fever.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Study Description 
This study is a prospective, randomized open- label clinical trial that will be conducted during 
the 2017- 2018 influenza season.  During the 2017- 2018 season, approximately 280 children 
will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center and Kaiser Permanent e Northern California. 
Young children aged 12- 16 months will be enrolled over a period of approximately 7 months. 
Children will be followed for up to 37 days following enrollment. Eligible children will be 
randomized to receive simultaneous or sequentially administered US -licensed PCV13, US -
licensed DTaP vaccine, and US -licensed inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Children in the 
simultaneous group will receive PCV13, DTaP, and IIV  vaccines at Visit 1, and then return for 
a health education visit without vaccination about 2 weeks later (Visit 2).  Children in the 
sequential group will receive both PCV13 and DTaP without IIV at Visit 1, and then will receive 
IIV and health education about 2 weeks later (Visit 2).  At Visit 1, children may also receive 
age- appropriate vaccines as recommended in the ACIP childhood immunization schedule.  
After Visit 1, non- study vaccines (U.S. l icensed or investigational) are prohibited unless 
deemed a  personal or public health priority by the health care provider caring for this patient 
or the study team.  
Parents will record the occurrence of fever, solicited adverse events, medical care utilization, 
and receipt of antipyretics over 8 days following Vi sit 1 and Visit 2. In addition, febrile seizures 
and serious adverse events will be recorded for the entire study period (from enrollment 
through 8 days following the Visit 2) and will be assessed through parental report and chart 
review.  
The first 10 chi ldren enrolled at Duke University Medical Center will be enrolled in a study pilot 
to quickly assess study feasibility benchmarks and make protocol adjustments if necessary.  
Data from pilot participants will also contribute to the analysis of primary, sec ondary and 
exploratory outcomes.  
4.2 Sample Size and Power  
Allowing for a 10% drop out rate  given an initial N=280,  there should be approximately 252 
children enrolled into the study . If the true proportion of children who have fever on day 1 
and/or day 2 after the first and/or second visit  in the simultaneous group is 36% and the true 
proportion in the sequential group is 18% , then there is 90% power to reject the null hypothesis 
of no difference with N=126 per group with a two- sided alpha 0.05 level.  This is  based upon 
using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis to control for sites.  
4.3 Randomization 
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either PCV13, DTaP and IIV  simultaneously 
or sequentially (PC V13 and DTaP followed by IIV ~2 weeks later) using a permuted block 
randomization scheme stratified by study site (i.e., Duke University Medical Center and Kaiser 
Permanente Northern California). The first 10 children enrolled in the pilot at Duke University 
will be randomized in a block of 10 such that 5 children will receive simultaneous vaccination 
and 5 will receive sequential vaccination.  The project statistician at Duke University will 
generate permuted block randomization schemes, which will be uploaded to REDCap. The 
randomization schedule will not be available to the study staff, so the next randomization 
CISA Fever SAP  V1.0  Page 6 of 17 Revised: February 06 , 2018  
 allocation will not be known before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of study 
eligibility criteria during Visit 1, participant randomization will be through REDCap with 
treatment allocation recorded on the CRF.  This study will be open label and study staff and  
subjects will not be blinded to treatment arm assignments.  
5 PARAMETERS OF ANALYS IS 
5.1 Data Collection and Storage  
Data will be handled according to the Duke Vaccine and Trials Unit SOP (DVTU M010) .  Data 
will be captured on paper CRFs and entered into the REDCap database. Diary data may be 
entered directly into REDCap, if the parent of the participant chooses to use this method.    
5.2 Analytic Issues  
There are two sites participating in the study and analysis of the primary objective will be 
stratified by site to account for this unit of randomization.  Secondary data objectives may be 
stratified by site when applicable.  There is one primary objective  evaluated at the alpha 0.05 
level and no adjustments to the alpha level will be made for secondary and exploratory 
analyses.  
6 ANALYSIS  POPULATION S 
6.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  
The ITT Population includes any participant that was enrolled,  randomized into the study , and 
received at least one study vaccine at Visit 1 .   
6.2 Per Protocol  
The Per Protocol  Population is a subset of the ITT Population which excludes  participants  
who do not provide valid temperature data on days 1 and 2 following Vis it 1 and Visit 2  and/or 
participants  with major protocol violations , as determined by the study investigators . The list 
of major protocol violations is located in A ppendix 1.  
Statistical analyses will be performed for both study populations, or the ITT Population only if 
no participants are excluded from  the Per Protocol  Population.   
7 BASELINE DATA AND FL OW CHART  
7.1 Presentation of Baseline Data  
The follow ing baseline data will be presented by site and vaccination group:  age, gender, 
gestational age, day care attendance, number of children living in the home, insurance payer 
status, ethnicity, race , receipt of first dose of influenza vaccine, receipt of inactivated influenz a 
vaccine at Visit 1, and receipt of live vaccines at Visit 1.  Summary statistics (e.g., mean,  
median,  standard deviation, interquartile range) will be presented for continuous variables.  
Categorical variables will be described with frequencies and percentages.   
7.2 Flow Chart  
The number of enrolled participants will be presented in a flow chart by site and vaccination 
group.  The number of visits completed and missed will be presented, along with a breakdown 
of the two analysis populations.   
CISA Fever SAP  V1.0  Page 7 of 17 Revised: February 06 , 2018  
 8 ANALYSIS OF ST UDY OBJECTIVES  
8.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective (PO 1) of the study is to compare the p roportion of children with fever 
(temperature ≥ 38.0°C or ≥ 100.4°F) on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1 and/or Visit 2.  
This information is captured on the memory aid form which is captured in the REDCap 
database.  Fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after either visit will be counted as positive (1) for this 
analysis and no fever reported will be negative (0). The proportions will be compared between 
the simultaneous versus the sequential group using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified 
analysis by site to control for the randomization blocks at the two -sided alpha 0.05 level.  The 
relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval for the occurrence fever will also be 
calculated.  
8.2 Secondary Objectives 
There are two secondary objectives for this study.   
a) The first secondary objective (SO 1)  is to compare the proport ions of children with 
fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 separately, in the simultaneous 
versus sequential vaccination group.  Fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after either visit will 
be counted as positive (1) for this analysis and no fever r eported will be negative (0). 
Proportions at each visit will be compared between the simultaneous and the 
sequential vaccination groups using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis 
by site to control for the randomization blocks. The relative  risk and corresponding 
95% confidence interval for the occurrence of any fever on day 1 and/or day 2 after 
Visit 1 and Visit 2  separately  will also be calculated. There are two separate statistical 
tests being performed at the alpha 0.05 level.  
 
b) The seco ndary objective  (SO 2)  is to compare the clinical importance of fever on day 
1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the simultaneous 
versus sequential group. Clinical importance is assessed based on severity of fever, 
duration of fever, and medical care utilization for fever.   This information is captured 
on the memory aid form in the REDCap database.   
 
1. Severity  of fever: To evaluate the severity  of fever, we will present the 
proportions of children with the highest le vel of fever defined as  Grade 2 and/or 
3 (≥ 38.6°C) on day 1 or day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2  and Visit 1  and 2 
combined by simultaneous and sequential vaccination groups.  
 
2. Duration of fever:  To evaluate the duration of fever, the following analysis wi ll 
be performed:  The mean duration of any fever  (in days) will be  compared by 
simultaneous and sequential vaccination groups  for children with fever that 
began on days 1 or 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined. Each 
consecutive day of fever on the memory aid will be counted per child per visit.  
Thus, a child could contribute a maximum of 8 days per study vis it, should a 
fever be reported at each day on the memory aid.   A child hav ing fever on day 
1, no fever on day 2, and fever on day 3 only has 1 day of fever.  
 
3. Medical care utilization for fever:  We will present and compare the proportion 
of children with m edical care utilization for fever (telephone contact, medical 
CISA Fever SAP  V1.0  Page 8 of 17 Revised: February 06 , 2018  
 office visit, emergency department visit or hospital admission) on day 1 and/or 
day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined.  Medical utilization 
for fever will be counted as posi tive for this analysis if onset of fever on day 1 
and/or day 2 plus medical utilization on day 1, day 2 or day 3 after fever .  
Medical care related to fever will be determined by report on the diary.  
Proportions  will be compared between the simultaneous and the sequential vaccination 
groups using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic  (three tests)  in a stratified analysis by site  to 
control for the randomization blocks. The duration of fever  will be compared between 
groups using a Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test (three tests) .  
No adjustments will be made to the alpha level (two- sided alpha=0.05) for these secondary 
objectives.  
8.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
There are eight  exploratory  objectives for this study.   
a) The first exploratory  objective (EO 1) is to compare the height and duration of fever on 
day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the 
simultaneous versus sequential group.  The average peak temperature of each child 
with fever  during the risk window of days 1 and 2  (temperature ≥ 38.0°C or ≥ 100.4°F) 
and the total number of fever degree- days (temperature ≥ 38.0°C or ≥ 100.4°F)  
following Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 1 and 2 combined will be presented by simultaneous 
and sequential vaccination groups.   These six comparis ons will be made using a 
Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  
 
b) The second exploratory objective (EO 2) is to compare the use of antipyretics for fever 
on day 1 and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined) in the 
simultaneous versus se quential group.   The use of antipyretics for fever on day 1 
and/or day 2 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and combined)  will be presented for 
the simultaneous versus sequential group  in tables.  These three proportion s of 
children with antipyretic use  on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1, Visit 2 , and Visit 1 
and Visit 2 combined will be compared using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified 
analysis  by site between  the simultaneous and sequential vaccination groups.  
 
c) The third exploratory objective (EO 3) is to describe and compare the level of severity 
of fever following Visit 1 and Visit 2 separately , in the simultaneous versus sequential 
group.  Fever will also be assessed at different levels of severity (Grades 1, 2, and 3) 
on day 1 and/ or day 2 and days 3 -8 following Visit 1  and separately for  Visit 2.  The 
grade levels are defined in Table 2.

CISA Fever SAP  V1.0  Page 9 of 17 Revised: February 06 , 201 8 
 There will be six (day 1 and/or day 2, days 3- 8, and days 1 -8 following Visit 1  and 
separately for  Visit 2 ) statistical comparisons performed at the alpha 0.05 level. These 
group comparisons will be made using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic (row mean scores 
difference with standardized midranks scores  [modified ridit scores]) in a stratified 
analysis by site to co ntrol for the randomization blocks.  
 
d) The fourth exploratory objective (EO 4) is to compare the proportions of children with 
fever on at least one day during days 3 -8 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and 
combined) in the simultaneous versus sequential group.  This information is captured 
on the memory aid form in the REDCap database. There will be three statistical 
comparisons performed at the alpha 0.05 level.  These group comparisons will be 
made using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analys is by site  to control for the 
randomization blocks.  
 
e) The fifth exploratory objective (EO 5) is to compare the clinical importance of fever 
occurring on at least one day during days 3-8 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and 
combined) in the simultaneous  versus sequential group. Clinical importance is 
assessed based on severity of fever, duration of fever, and medical care utilization for 
fever . This information is captured on the memory aid form in the REDCap database.  
 
1. Severity  of fever:   To evaluate the severity of fever, the p roportions of children 
with moderate/severe fever (GRADE 2 and/or 3 see Table 2 above ) on at least 
one day during days 3- 8 following Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 1 and Visit 2 
combined will be presented in a tabular format. Thi s group comparison  will be 
made using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis by site  to control 
for the randomization blocks.  
 
2. Duration of fever:  To evaluate the duration of fever, the a verage number of 
consecutive day s of fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C or ≥ 100.4°F) per subject for 
fever starting on day 3-8 following Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 1 and Visit 2 
combined will be calculated.  A fever starting on day 3- 8 could continue through 
day 8.  The mean duration of any fever will be presented in days for children 
with fever that began on days 3 -8 after Visit 1 and Visit 2 (separately and 
combined) . Each consecutive day of fever on the memory aid will be counted 
per child per visit.  Thus, a child could contribute a maximum of 6 days per 
study visit, should a fever be reported at each day on the memory aid.   The 
longest duration of any fever occurring for a child will be counted for that child.  
e.g.  If a child has fever on days 3 and 4, no fever on day 5,  and fever occurring 
on days 6, 7 , and 8 the duration of fever will be counted as 3 days for that child.  
 
There will be three statistical comparisons performed (mean duration of any 
fever starting on days 3 -8 following Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 1 and Visit 2 
combined) at the alpha 0.05 level.  These group comparisons will be made 
using a Mann- Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test.  
 
3. Medical care utilization for fever: The p roportion of children with medical care 
utilization determined by report on the diary  (telephone call, medical office visit, 
emergency department visit, or hospital admission) for fever on at least one 
CISA Fever SAP  V1.0  Page 10 of 17 Revised: February 06 , 2018  
 day during days 3 -8 following Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 1 and Visit 2 combined,  
will be presented in tables or the simultaneous versus sequential group.  There 
will be three statistical comparisons performed.  These group comparisons will 
be made using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis by site to 
control for the randomization blocks.  
 
f) The sixth exploratory objecti ve (EO 6 ) is to describe and compare the occurrence of 
solicited systemic adverse events  (excluding fever) on days 1 -8 after Visit 1 and Visit 
2 in the simul taneous versus sequential group . Table 3 below lists the solicited adverse 
events to be collected.

Listings of all solicited adverse events will be produced showing vaccination group, 
date of onset, date of resolution, and highest grade level.   The frequency and 
percentage of the highest grade level for participants will be presented by each of the 
three solicited adverse events.  There will be three statistical comparisons made  using 
a Mantel -Haenszal statistic (row mean scores difference with standardized midranks 
scores  [modified ridit scores ]) in a stratified analysis by site  to control for the 
randomization blocks . 
g) The seventh  exploratory objective (EO 7) is to describe and compare the occurrence 
of febrile seizure and/or  serious adverse events during the period of enrollment (i.e., 
from Visit 1 through 8 days after Visit 2) in the simultaneous versus sequential group.  
Listings of all febrile seizure and /or serious adverse ev ents will be produced showing 
vaccination group, description, relatedness, date of onset, date of resolution, and SAE 
category.  The frequency of the occurrence of febrile seizure and/or  serious adverse 
events  by vaccination group will be compared using a Fisher’s Exact test because the 
expected number of events is very low  (i.e., small cell counts) .   
 
h) The eighth exploratory objective (EO 8) is to describe and compare the perceptions 
among parents/ legally authorized representatives (LARs) of the simultaneous versus  
sequential schedule experience .   Summary tables of acceptability will be produced by 
vaccination group.  Likert scale questions will be compared between the vaccination  
groups using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic (row mean scores difference with 
standardized midranks scrores [modified ridit scroes]) in a stratified analysis by site to 
control for the randomization blocks .

 No adjustments will be made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05) for these exploratory 
analyses.  
8.4 Potential Adjustments to Exploratory Objectives 
a) It might be necessary to adjust for MMR and MMRV receipt at Visit 1 for the following 
outcome measures: EOM 3.2, EOM 3.3, EOM  4.1, EOM  4.3, EOM 5 .1 and EOM 5 .2.   This 
is due to the possibility that a measles -containing vaccine may be administered at Visit 1 
to infants in both the simultaneous and sequential group.   If there is an imbalance 
(detected by a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a stratified analysis by  site) between the 
vaccination  groups in the percentages of MMR and/or MMRV receipt at Visit 1, the 
aforementioned exploratory outcome measures will be evaluated by subgroups of those 
with MMR and/or MMRV receipt at Visit 1 and those without MMR and/or MMRV receipt 
at Visit 1.  
9 SENSITIVI TY ANALYSES  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed under t hree conditions:  
• to exclude those who received antipyretics on day 1 and/or day 2 following Visit 1 and/or  
Visit 2 . 
• to extend the risk window for fever to day 3 after Visit 1 and Visit 2.    
• to com pare the effect of the first versus second dose of current seasonal influenza vaccine  
These sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary objective in both study populations 
(ITT and Per Protocol).  The statistical comparison will be made using a  Mantel -Haenszal statistic 
in a stratified analysis by site to control for the randomization blocks .  No adjustments will be 
made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05) for these sensitivity analyses.

Purpose: To define major protocol violations  that will be used to establish the Per Protocol 
Population for the Fever after Simultaneous versus Sequential Vaccination in Young Children 
study  
Background: Per the protocol analysis plan there will be two study populations, the Intent -to-
Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol populations.  The ITT Population includes any participant that was 
enrolled,  randomized into the study , and received at least one study vaccine at Visit 1 .  The Per 
Protocol Po pulation is a subset of the ITT Population excluding those participants who do not 
provide valid temperature data on days 1 and 2 following Visit 1 and Visit 2 and those with major 
protocol violations as determined by the study investigators. Statistical analyses will be performed 
for both study populations, or the ITT Population only if no participants are excluded from the Per 
Protocol Population.  
This document stands to serve as a general guideline for the study investigators to a priori define 
major pr otocol violations.  Participants with major protocol violations will not be included in the 
Per Protocol Population.

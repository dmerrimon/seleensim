SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER:   
 The pivotal trial of Iloprost demonstrated that in the 
Iloprost arm nearly 40% had 10% improvement in 6MWD, 50% had improved FC, and 17% had both
1. 
From these data we calculate that 73% had either 10% improvement in 6MWD or improved functional status. Assuming metformin or the exercise arm will have similar response rate, and the placebo group will have 40% response rate, thought to be due to traini ng 
effect potentially, we need 35 per group to have 80% power at 0.05 type I error rate. For the metformin and exercise combination group, an additive or synergistic effect between the two interventions will put its response rate above 73%. Thus the combination vs. placebo comparison will have at least 80%, likely better power. From past experience coupled with the low risk, low side effect profile interventions, we estimate a dropout rate of less than 10%
1. We will 
enroll 40 subjects to ensure 35 completed subjects per group. The total target enrollment is 160 over 4.5 years.  
DATA ANALYSIS:  
The primary analyses will focus on metformin vs placebo, exercise vs placebo, and metformin + exercise vs placebo comparisons on the primary endpoint. Since the evaluation of metformin or exercise will be reported as if they were independent studies and the combination arm versus placebo comparison serves to corroborate findings of the two separate comparisons, in addition to evaluating an 
additive or synergistic effect, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons. For binary endpoints, the 
Pearson chi -square or Fischer’s exact test will be 
used to assess between treatment arms difference. Logistic regressions will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 6MWD, functional status,

considering the number of parameters in the model 
and the number of responders in the sample.  Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using either two-sample t -test or ANOVA, or non -parametric 
methods Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or Kruskal -Wallis 
test. Multivariable regressions (general linear models) will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such baseline 6MWD, functional status, and age.  We have designed the study to minimize the potential for missing data. Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of 35 per group.  Nevertheless, in the event we have missing data, a multiple- imputation 
procedure as implemented in the areglmpute  function 
in the Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0-10) will be used to assess the impact of missing data. The analyses with imputation will mainly serve as sensitivity analyses.

Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    Abstract 
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive 
pulmonary vascular obliteration, right heart failure and death. Despite several approved 
therapies, none are curative or address the primary molecular drivers of this highly morbid disease. Work by our group and others has highlighted the role of metabolic dysregulation such as mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and cardiac lipotoxicity in PAH. We have published that glucose intolerance is common in human PAH and impacts survival. We have also assessed the effects of insulin- mediated 
mitochondrial lipid metabolism on the right ventricle (RV) and demonstrated that lipid deposition may be a key feature of RV dysfunction in PAH. Important questions remain: do interventions against insulin resistance improve PAH? Are there specific patients most likely to benefit from interventions against insulin resistance? Drug therapy, e.g. metformin, and exercise are the major currently practical interventions against insulin resistance in PAH. Further, we and others have published that PAH patients are highly 
sedentary with reduced skeletal muscle function, suggesting that activity may be a modifiable feature of PAH. Exercise is known to be safe in PAH, but implementation in the US is limited by  access to care. Our group recently showed that linking activity 
monitoring, e.g. fitbit, with automated, personalized text prompts to encourage activity led to a 300% increase in step counts. This approach may provide an innovative, inexpensive mechanism to increase activity in PAH, and thereby reduce insulin resistance. The mechanisms by which these insulin- sensitizing interventions may 
improve 6MWD and outcomes in PAH is unknown, however.  
 
 We propose to test the hypothesis that interventions to improve insulin resistance 
will improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class in PAH. We propose three 
specific aims to test this 1) A prospective 2x2 factorial design 12- week clinical trial of 
metformin or placebo and activity intervention or usual care to assess effect on six 
minute walk and WHO functional class, 2) Assessment of the interventions in Aim 1 in a 
subset of patients on RV and peripheral muscle function and lipid content and marker s 
of pulmonary vascular disease to define how these interventions may work in PAH and 3) Identify and prospectively test peripheral blood markers of metformin response in PAH.  The broad goals of this work are to demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms of interventions against insulin resistance in PAH and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from these interventions, moving to precision medicine in PAH.

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  18 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    Background  & Significance  
1.1 Morbidity, mortality, and limitations of medical therapy in pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  
PAH is a highly morbid disease1. Despite great progress in understanding disease 
mechanisms and nine FDA -approved drugs for PAH, contemporary data show that 
patients live on average 7 years after diagnosis1,2. The six minute walk test (6MWT) 
distance has been used as a  surrogate marker of drug efficacy in PAH, with a 
minimally important distance of about 33m3. Most drug therapy for PAH improves 
6MWT distance approximately 30 -40m4-8, indicating that current PAH therapies only 
modestly improve exercise capacity. Importantly,  distance walked correlates directly 
with quality of life and mortality9-12. Recent work has demonstrated a key role for 
insulin resistance in PAH2-6, but whether interventions against insulin resistance 
improve outcomes, such as six 6MWD or NYHA Functional Class (FC), is presently 
unknown. These data highlight the need for additional interventions to improve 
clinical outcomes in PAH.  
1.2 Insulin resistance in PAH . 
Insulin  resistance has been demonstrated to be common in PAH and associated with 
worse six minute walk distance and mortality, perhaps due to promotion of right ventricular dysfunction through lipotoxicity
13-18.  It is presently unknown if interventions 
against insulin resistance may impact short - or long- term outcomes in PAH. Insulin 
resistance can be ameliorated by weight loss, exercise and medications .  Aside from 
bariatric surgery, weight loss is often difficult to achieve and PAH patients have increased mortality associated with surgery. Exercise and medical therapies aimed at insulin resistance have not been studied previously in PAH.   
1.3 Functional impairment and efficacy of exercise.  
Patients with PAH have severely reduced exercise capacity when measured by 6MWT distance or cardiopulmonary exercise testing
9-12, 20-22. At diagnosis, most PAH patients 
are NYHA functional class III with symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath with less than ordinary activity
23. Although once thought to be potentially dangerous24, recent 
studies show exercise to be safe and effective at improving functional capacity. It is important to consider that in the context of PAH, “exercise” is equivalent to a mild or moderate increase in physical activity, such as sustained walking. Thus, the two terms can be used interchangeably in reference to this population. In a landmark study, Mereles et al. tested an intensive physical activity program in patients with severe PAH on stable therapy
25. The intervention arm underwent three weeks of inpatient 
rehabilitation involving several hours per day of supervised walking, bicycle ergometer training, and dumbbell training followed by a 12 week home program. In the control 
group, the three inpatient weeks involved counseling, relaxation therapy, and activities 
of daily living. 6MWT distance in the intervention arm increased by 96±61 meters versus a decrease of -15±54 meters in the control group (p<0.0001). Importantly, the effect of 
exercise on functional  capacity and quality of life is additive to standard medical 
therapy. Since this trial, others have validated the efficacy of inpatient exercise programs in PAH
26-29. All of these studies have been performed in Europe where 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  19 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    inpatient (and outpatient) rehabilitation is covered by insurance or national health 
services. In the United States, major insurers and Medicare do not currently reimburse cardiopulmonary rehabilitation for pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, an inpatient physical activity program is infeasible in the United States
30. Moreover, the intensity of 
these interventions and requirement for travel make them impractical for many patients and poorly scalable to the general PAH population. These studies provide import ant 
evidence for the efficacy of increasing physical activity, but the methods present significant obstacles to widespread adoption, underscoring the need for more pragmatic interventions.  
1.4 Mechanisms of the beneficial effects of physical activity in PAH.  
The mechanisms by which physical activity improves 6MWT distance and quality of life in PAH are unknown. In the Mereles trial and subsequent studies, an increase in exercise capacity was associated with a very
 modest reduction in estimated 
pulmonary arterial pressure (3- 5mmHg), suggesting that physical activity does not 
ameliorate pulmonary vascular disease25. Potential alternative mechanisms include 
improvement in RV function, systemic metabolism, and/or skeletal muscle function. Although increased pulmona ry blood flow has
 been observed after training 
programs in PAH patients24, the effects on RV function were not described. Thus, it 
is unknown if improved pulmonary flow is due to enhanced RV function. Insulin resistance is common in
 PAH (even in lean patients) and linked to pulmonary 
vascular disease and RV dysfunction1,13- 14, 16, 32. Increased  physical activity may 
improve insulin resistance, thereby potentially improving pulmonary vascular and/or RV function. Finally, skeletal muscle metabolism is abnormal in PAH patients, exhibited by lipid deposition and impaired mitochondrial function
2,33- 36. Skeletal 
muscle dysfunction contributes to reduced functional capacity in PAH29,36. Physical 
activity improves skeletal muscle function in PAH29,37,38, but has not been tested in 
the context of an unsupervised, pragmatic randomized trial. This study will be the first to probe several potential mechanisms of improved exercise capacity in the context of a randomized physical activity interventio n in the PAH population . 
1.5 Mobi le health tools to promote behavioral change.  
Mobile health (mHealth) technology has been used to promote behavioral change in a wide range of chronic conditions. Physical inactivity is a known modifiable cardiovascular risk factor
39, yet less than half of the US adult population meets the 
goal of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity40. A 2012 Cochrane 
review confirmed the efficacy of telephone and web- based interventions to increase 
physical activity41. Recent  advances in mHealth technology – particularly the 
widespread use of Bluetooth compatible accelerometers – now allow remote 
monitoring of physical activity and real time data tracking. Wearable accelerometers 
provide accurate measurements of steps and activity in three dimensions. These devices are popular with consumers and often recommended by physicians, but there are very limited data on their effectiveness at increasing
 activity42-44. The 
Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Management (TEXT ME) trial demonstrated that a personalized,
 text-based intervention in subjects with coronary heart  disease 
resulted significant reductions in LDL, blood pressure, and smoking and an increase 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  20 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    in physical activity45. Also  recently, our Co -investigators demonstrated in the 
mActive trial that combining behavioral change based text messages with activity 
tracking led to a marked increase in step counts and aerobic activity46. A key 
innovation of the mActive trial was the addition of “smart” texting that adapted to real time activity data. Behavioral change elements such as coaching texts appear to be a necessary addition to simple activity tracking
44. A mHealth activity 
intervention is an attractive approach in PAH  for several reasons: 1) PAH is 
associated with baseline functional impairment and proven efficacy of physical activity; 2) no requirement for proximity to a major hospital or rehabilitation facility;
 
3) cost-effective intervention compared with standard therapy;  and 4) highly  
amenable  to a multi -site trial, which is critical for Phase  III studies in a rare disease. 
Given the success of similar interventions in other populations, testing of a mHealth 
intervention in PAH seems  warranted.  
1.6 Metformin in PAH  
We have nearly completed an 8 week open label dose escalation (max dose 1g BID) study of metformin. Thus far we have enrolled 16 patients. There have been no serious 
adverse events thought related to the metformin exposure. One patient needed adjustment of diuretics and all patients have complained of mild diarrhea, with two requiring dose adjustment of metformin. Only one patient did not eventually reach the goal dose.   In order to preserve the integrity of the study, we have not analyzed the primary endpoints aside from safety. In a preliminary review of MRS -quantified lipid 
content and found a numeric reduction in RV triglyceride content after treatment with metformin. These data suggest that RV lipid deposition may be reversed by metformin therapy and strongly support safety in a broad range of PAH patients with mild and severe disease.

1.10 Study Arm Assignment, Randomization, and Subject Retention  
Participants will be assigned to either intervention, both interventions,  or no 
intervention arms after the run- in period in a random manner until 40 participa nts 
are enrolled into each arm. Permuted block randomization stratified by WHO 
functional class (I/II vs. III) will be used to ensure approximate balance of treatment 
groups within each stratum over time. Based on our previous studies in PAH subjects in our catchment area, African Americans will represent approximate ly 
16% of the study population. Randomization will be performed in small blocks, 
which vary in size. Investigators will be unaware of the size or order of the blocks.
 
Projected dropout during the 12 week study has been incorporated into the power calculations. The Data Safety Monitor Board may be unblinded at any time to 
investigate possible adverse events. Procedures for r eporting adverse events are 
outlined in section 7.0. 
The group randomization code will be maintained by the research coordinator. The code is to be broken only if knowledge of group assignment for that subject is required to initiate appropriate therapy of an adverse event (AE) or if the safety of the subjec t is at 
serious risk without knowledge of the group assignment. The decision to unmask will be made by the PI  and/or Co- PI. The Data Safety Monitoring Board will be notified as soon 
as possible . 
Study Designs  
1.11 Overview  
We propose a phase II, 2x2 factorial randomized, blinded trial testing metformin versus placebo and an mHealth intervention (mHealth) versus usual care of 12 weeks.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  25 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    1.12 Monitoring Device  
The Fitbit Charge HR tri -axial accelerometer will be used to continuously gather data on 
physical activity, heart rate, and sleep. This device provides feedback in units of activity 
(steps, stairs climbed, activity time, and exercise time) and heart rate (per second when active, per 5 seconds when inactive). It has been validated against research devices in free-living conditions and is relatively inexpen sive.
 
1.13 Fitbit Application and Data Management  
During enrollment, study personnel will install the Fitbit on the subject's smartphone, paired via Bluetooth 4.0 to the Fitbit Charge HR. The Fitabase subscription service (https://www.fitabase.com/) will be used to create a study dashboard, enabling real -time 
monitoring of battery charge, device syncing, and physical activity variables allowing real-time monitoring of participant compliance with the study protocol. Fitabase is a 
HIPPA compliant  platform that can link and aggregate the Application Programming 
Interfaces of the Fitbit Charge HR. Real time activity data will be transmitted from the subject’s smartphone to our mHealth platform via cellular network. The Charge HR has 
a battery life of 5 days and recharges in 1- 2 hours. Subjects will be instructed to leave 
the app running and Bluetooth enabled for the duration of the trial.  
 
1.14 mHealth Intervention 
Our HIPPA compliant texting platform is linked to the Fitbit Application Program Interface. Real time activity data will be transmitted from the subject’s smartphone to our mHealth platform via cellular network. Subjects  assigned to the texting arm  
will receive 3 texts/day in sync with their preferred morning, lunch, and evening leisure schedule, which is defined at enrollment. These texts will use personal, disease- specific, and provider information (
Table 1) to deliver 2 types of messages 
customized to the current step count and sent in equal proportion. Messages are designed to facilitate self -awareness, reinforce step targets, and link physical 
activity  with a reward or memorable cue.
Booster:
 
“Megan, you were pretty active yesterday! You got 8994 steps, which is close to your goal of 10,000. There are immediate 
benefits to exercise: you will feel better and have more  energy!”  
Positive reinforcement:
 
“Jon, you are on track to have a VERY ACTIVE day! Already halfway to your target  of 10,000 steps – 
Outstanding
Subjects  in both study arms  may 
receive additional texts during the 
day for reminders about charging,

about the importance of wearing their device from a secure email address created 
for this study. Subjects can email this account with study questions. If there is loss of data transmission for a full day, subjects will be emailed with a reminder to wear their device and/or reestablish a connection with their phone. After 3 days of absent data, another email reminder will be sent and the study coordinator will call the subject to determine the cause. If subjects have regularly scheduled clinic visits with their treating physician, they will be counseled not to reveal their group assignment . 
1.15 Run- in Period and Step Count Targets  
We will use a two- week run -in period, which will improve our ability to identify a true 
baseline step count and reduce dropout after randomization. Participants will wear the Fitbit Charge HR device 24 hours a day for seven days a week (excluding only bathing or showering) to determine their baseline daily step count. We will assume a Hawthorne or observer effect during the first week of the run- in period and discard 
this data. The baseline daily step count will be calculated as total steps during run-in Week 2 divided by 7 days . Randomization will occur after the run-in phase to 
account for potential dropout during this period.
 Participants displaying 
noncompliance during the run- in period will not be randomized. Noncompliance will be 
defined as having more than one bad data or no data day per week. However, depending on the reason for noncompliance, this requirement may be waived at the 
discretion of the PI and study team . 
The initial daily step target  Weeks 1 -4 for the intervention group will be 20% higher 
than the run- in baseline value. For example, if the run-in daily step count is 2,000 
steps/day, the daily step target for Weeks 1- 4 will be 2,400 steps/day. An increment 
of 20% was selected because it reflects the average increase in treadmill workload achieved over 4 weeks in chronic obstructive lung disease patients with PH who attend pulmonary rehabilitation at our facility. Average daily step counts during Week 4 will be calculated and used to define the target (20% above the Week 4 
average) for Weeks 5- 8. The daily target for Weeks 9- 12 will be calculated in the 
same manner. New targets will be communicated with patients via text  message.  If 
outliers are observed, we reserve the right to adjust the increase in the daily step target. Outliers will be identified based on preset qualifications for days providing 
good data.   
1.16 Metformin  or
  Placebo  
Subjects will receive metformin 500mg or equivalent placebo tablets via overnight shipment in adequate time for week 1. Patients will titrate the medication as follows: 1 Every Day  x 5 days, 1 BID x 5 days, 1 TID x 5 days, and then 2 BID for the 
duration of the trial. This titration schedule is based on the excellent tolerability from our pilot study. Patients in the placebo group will have matching sugar pills prepared by the research pharmacy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Medication should be t aken by participants all the way up to their Visit #2 date.

Data Collection 
1.18 Consent  
Written consent or e- consent will be obtained for enrollment from participants. For each 
consent process, study personnel will discuss the details of the study, the risks and benefits, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities if they choose to participate in the trial and their right to refuse to participate. It will be made clear that their clinical care will not be affected by their decision. Subjects will be permitted to provide verbal consent over the phone prior to being scheduled for a screening visit. Documentation of verbal 
consent will be noted. Written consent or e- consent will be obtained at the screening 
visit or before.  
 
For e- consent, the patient consent process will be conducted using a REDCap- based 
electronic consent form.  The consent form has been developed in REDCap, a secure, 
web-based, HIPAA- compliant, data collection platform with a user management system 
allowing  project owners to grant and control varying levels of access to data collection 
instruments and data (e.g. read only, de- identified -only data views) for other users.  
Potential participants will participate in the consent process by either:
 
1.)  Being approached in- person at a Vanderbilt Clinic and accessing the REDCap 
survey via iPad or other portable electronic device and/or  
2.) Self-initiated access of consent forms on personal portable electronic devices 
using posted QR codes or web- links on study posters, brochures, or websites.  
Self-initiated accessing of consent forms may occur in clinic or at home.  
During the in- person consent process, patients will be consented by a member of the 
key study personnel.  
For self -initiated consent, contact information will be provided (email and phone) for 
prospective patients to contact a member of the key study personnel with questions, prior to consent.  
Patient signatures will be obtained using a typed signature.   Upon completion of the 
consent, patients will be provided with a copy of their version of the consent document 
by printing a pdf copy of the consent form in clinic or at their screening visit.  
 
1.19 Study Visits and Contacts  
This study will consist of two visits: screening  (-2 week) and week 12. The screening 
and week 12 visit are both estimated to take approximately 4-6 hours  each. Patients will

1.22 Secondary Out come Measures  
 Body Weight and BMI  
a. Body Weight  
b. Body Mass Index (BMI)   
                          BMI = weight in kilogram/(height in meters)2 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  34 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    
 Six Minute Walk Distance  
Walking is the most basic form of exercise and is integral to daily activities. The 6MWT 
is a standardized, timed submaximal test of unencouraged, self -determined distance 
walked which is reliable and valid49. Standardized test methods and scripted and timed 
statements have been established in prior  studies of PAH3,9-12,20- 22.The 6MWT will be 
administered according to the Thoracic Society guidelines23,49. The 6MWT will be 
performed at screening and 12 weeks  visits . The subject will be instructed to wear 
comfortable clothing and shoes. The test will be performed at approximately the same 
time of day at each visit. In addition, Borg dyspnea Score, oxygen saturation, and heart rate will be recorded at the beginning and conclusion of each test.  
 The Borg Dyspnea Score  
In order to assess exercise capacity, the Borg score for dyspnea and overall fatigue will be recorded before and after subjects complete the six -minute walk, performed at 
screening and week 12 visits . This score is a measure the physical activity intensity 
level based on the subject's perceived exertion. Subjects will rate at resting and peak exercise.  
 Quality o f Life Questionnaire  (emPHasis –10) 
The emPHasis -10 is a pulmonary hypertension -specific questionnaire  to assess 
health related quality of life. It covers breathlessness, fatigue and lack of energy, 
social restrictions, and concerns regarding effects on patient’s significant others, 
such as family and friends50. Each item is scored on a semantic differential six -point 
scale (0 -5), with contrasting adjectives at each end. A total emPHasis -10 score is 
derived using simple aggregation of the 10 items. emPHasis -10 scores range from 
0 to 50, higher scores indicate worse quality of life50. Subjects will complete the 
emPHasis -10 survey at screening and week 12 visits.  
 WHO Functional Class 
The WHO functional classification for PAH has been modified from the well -known 
New York Heart Association functional classification. This functional classification is based on symptoms, with Class I being defined by no symptoms, Class II as having mild li mitation in physical activity, Class III as having markedly limited physical 
activity and Class IV as being unable to perform any physical activity. The WHO functional class will be assessed at screening and week 12 visits . 
 Step Counts and Physical Activity  
Wearable accelerometers can provide accurate measurements of steps and activity in three dimensions.  
Acceleromet ry is a direct measure of physical activity in patients’ day -to-day lives.  Step 
counts and physical activity will be measured using the Fitbit Charge HR monitor, a lightweight device that has a three- axis acceleration sensor, altimeter, vibration motor, 
and optical heart rate monitor. This device provides feedback in units of activity (steps, stairs climbed, activity time, and exercise time) and heart rate (per second when active, 
per 5 seconds when inactive). Initialization and data download will be performed using the Fitbit Application Program Interface. Step counts will be (1) tracked by the Fitbit 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  35 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    Charge HR device, (2) transmitted to the participant’s smartphone via Bluetooth, and (3) 
finally transmitted from the subject’s smartphone to our mHealth platform via cellular network.  
Subjects will begin wearing the Fitbit on the day of their screening visit and will wear it for the next 14 weeks. Participants will wear the Fitbit Charge HR device 24 hours a day for seven days a week (excluding only bathing/ showering and charging) , starting on the 
day after the screening visit and for the next 17 weeks. In addition to absolute step counts, we will assess frequency of goal attainment, daily  aerobic time (total time spent 
walking continuously for > 10 minutes without breaking for > 1 minut e), and total daily 
activity (time spent above 3 metabolic equivalents)  
 Resting Heart Rate  
Resting heart rate will be monitored regularly using the activity tracking device (per second when active, per 5 seconds when inactive). In addition, subject's heart rate will be measured will be recorded before and after subjects complete the six -minute walk 
test. This will provide resting and peak exercise heart rate at baseline and week 12.  
 Blood Biomarkers  
a. HOMA- IR 
Insulin resistance will be quantified using the homeostasic  model assessment of 
insulin resistance (HOMA -IR), which estimates insulin resistance through fasting 
plasma insulin and glucose ratios, at screening  and 12 weeks.  
b. Lipid Metabolism  
Altered lipid metabolism reflects insulin resistance.  Fasting plasma lipid metabolites will be evaluated via non -targeted metabolomics screen. Mass spectroscopy of 
approximately 300 metabolites across all major metabolic pathways will be performed at scre ening and 12 weeks.  
c. Fatty Acid Metabolism  
Elevated circulating fatty acids and acylcarnitines contribute to 
RV lipotoxicity  and 
indicate insulin resistance associated with pulmonary hypertension.  To evaluate the 
effect of this intervention on fatty acid metabolism, we will measure fasting long-chain fatty acid and acylcarnitine profiles using mass spectrometry at screening  and 
12 weeks.  
d. Plasma and Urine Estradiol and Estrogen Metabolites  
Estrogen metabolites are associated with pulmonary hypertension in human PAH subjects. Estrogen metabolism we will be evaluated by measuring plasma estradiol (E2) and estrogen metabolites, including 2ME and 16αOHE, 
using mass spectrometry at 
screening  and 12 weeks.  
e. Plasma NT -proBNP  
Plasma NT -proBNP reflects right ventricular function in PAH and is a strong 
predictor of outcome in PAH. BNP will be assessed at screening  and 12 weeks.  
f. Amino Acids and Metabolomics  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  36 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    We and others have observed in cross -sectional studies that PAH is associated 
with insulin resistance and lipid abnormalities. Metabolites associated with insulin 
resistance and lipid metabolism have not been examined in the context of a clinical trial tar geting insulin resistance. Changes in amino acids and metabolomic profiles 
with metformin and physical activity may provide insight into the mechanisms by which these interventions may improve insulin resistance (and outcomes) in patients with PAH.  
g. Safety Labs  
A comprehensive panel, complete blood count, hemoglobin A1c , and a urine 
pregnancy test will be assessed at screening and 12 weeks.  
 Transthoracic Echocardiographic Measures 
We will assess RV free wall longitudinal strain and other parameters as secondary 
endpoints  via transthoracic echocardiography . The ultimate determinant of outcome in 
subjects with PAH is right ventricular function, so we have focused on metrics, which are predictors of survival in PAH, including RV strain and qualitative RV function.  The 
following metrics will be obtained: 1) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); 2) RV & LV ejection fraction
51; 3) RV fractional area change; 4) tricuspid annular velocity 
(S’);  5) tricuspid regurgitant (TR) velocity; 6) RV systolic pressure (estimated from the 
equation: RV systolic pressure = 4(maximum TR velocity)2 + right atrial pressure); 7) 
right atrial pressure52; 8) RV & LV diastolic function53; 9) RV free wall longitudinal 
strain54-55. All measurements will be performed according to the American Society  of 
Echocardiography guidelines51-53. 
 Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS)  
a. Cardiac Proton MRS  
Patients will undergo cardiac metabolic assessment in the VUIIS using a Philips 3 Tesla system at screening and week 12 visits. Lipid content of right ventricle will be measured 
by proton MRS
56. Electrocardiographic and respiratory gating are used at end-systole 
and end expiration to minimize motion artifact. A 2x1x3cm3 voxel is placed over the 
interventricular septum to avoid contamination from epicardial fat. Water (suppressed and unsuppressed) spectra are collected to serve as an internal reference for chemical shift offset and fat concentration
97. PRESS spectra (echo time, 30 ms) with and without 
water suppression are performed to quantify fat measurements98. Peak amplitudes of 
water and fat are measured using spectral processing software (Spectroview; Philips Medical Systems) . Lipid content is expressed as percent triglyceride (%TG) versus 
water content, using the formula: signal amplitude of triglyceride divided by signal amplitude of water x 100. The usual components of a cardiac MRI will also be obtained from the MRS scan. Data will be analyzed by a blinded observer (Brittain).  
b. Skeletal Muscle Proton MRI and MRS  
After a 4 to 6 hour fast, patients will undergo skeletal muscle metabolic assessment in the VUIIS using a Philips 3 Tesla system  at screening and week 12 visits .  Subjects will 
lie supine in the magnet with their thigh placed in a 
1H-MRS volume coil.  Transverse T1 
weighted MR images are obtained to permit accurate placement of the 1H-MRS voxel  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  37 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    and to calculate the quadriceps cross -sectional area. A 10x10x10mm3 voxel is placed in 
the quadriceps  muscle and water and lipid spectra are obtained by a point -resolved 
spectroscopy sequence.  Finally, whole- body fat -water images will be acquired.  
Lipid content and composition will be analyzed as described for the R V57-58. Lipid 
content is expressed as percent triglyceride (%TG) versus water content, using the 
formula: signal amplitude of triglyceride divided by signal amplitude of water x 100.  To 
calculate the quadriceps contractile tissue cross -sectional area, the maximum cross -
sectional area will be calculated and adjusted by the fat percentage in the same slice.  
 Skeletal Muscle Function  
After the MRI and MRS, the patients will undergo a skeletal muscle function test 
using a workout chair that  will take place in VUIIS. Equipment used will 
include a leg -extension Ergometer chair  including lumbar support and 
seatbelt straps , that will allow us to measure the strength of a patient’s leg 
kick. This device will solely be used for research purposes. It is not being 
used to diagnose or treat disease and is not intended to be marketed for commercial use. The muscle fatigue protocol has demonstrated the ability to 
induce fatigue in the quadriceps muscles in both patients and healthy controls. Key outcomes of the protocol include measures of absolute muscle strength (i.e. maximal knee extensor torque) before, d uring, and following 
exercise.  Percent loss in maximal voluntary contraction magnitude during 
the fatigue protocol serves as the primary measure of fatigability.  
a. Strength  
We will assess leg extensor  muscle strength using an isometric  dynamometer as 
previously published29 , both at the screening and the week 12 visits .  
The test procedures are as follows: The subject will warm up with about 5 minutes of an activity involving the thigh muscles, such as self -paced walking, low -resistance 
pedaling, or low -resistance leg extension exercise.  Then the subject  will sit in a custom -
built strength testing exercise chair with the hip and knees at about 90 degrees of flexion, and the right leg fastened to a kick bar capable of measuring force. Two shoulder straps and a waist strap will be placed around the subject to minimize the use of muscles other than the knee extensors. We will train the subject to perform muscle contractions with the quadriceps muscles with good technique, including the avoidance of a Valsalva maneuver. This will involve about 5- 10 submaximal or maximal 
contractions , each separated by up to 2 minute s of rest . The subjects will then perform 
3-5 maximum voluntary contractions (MVC s), each lasting 4 seconds and being 
separated by about 3 minutes of rest.  The highest value recorded from three 
contractions performed using good technique and closely matched in force output will 
be used for the muscle strength endpoint.  The total time required for strength testing 
procedures is expected to be about 60 minutes.  
 
b. Fatigue  
We will assess leg extensor  muscle fatigue using a progressive, submaximal isometric 
exercise protocol, both at the screening and week 12 visits .  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  38 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    The test procedures are as follows: The fatigue protocol requires the subject to perform 
6 sets of submaximal contractions in which s/he matches the effort level to a target intensity. Training the subject to perform the effort -matching procedure will typi cally 
require about 5- 10 trials for practice. Each trial will be separated by about 2 minutes of 
rest. After the subject is able to match his/her effort level to the target intensity, s/he will be allowed about 5 minutes of rest. During the fatigue protocol , the subject will perform 
6 sets of 12 contractions with a 40% duty cycle (4s contraction and 6s relaxation), and each set of contractions will be followed by an MVC. The initial submaximal target force 
will be 20% of the previously measured MVC (section 1.22.11.a) and will be 
incremented by 10% every set until 70% MVC. After the subject completes the fatigue protocol, s/he will perform a single MVC every 3 minutes through a total of 12 minutes of recovery time. The total time required for the fatigue protocol is expected to be between 45 and 60 minutes.  
Fatigue will be expressed as % drop in MVC  during the fatigue protocol compared with 
the pre- fatigue MVC force. Recovery will be expressed as the % recovery of MVC force 
that was lost during the fatigue protocol at the 12 minute time point. Secondary analyses of force recovery will occur for the 3, 6, and 9 minute time points.  
 Responders vs. Non -Responders.  
a. Definitions  
Patients enrolled in our ongoing metformin pilot study will be divided into responders and nonresponders based on the primary endpoint of Aim 1. Clinical differences will be 
compared between groups, e.g. age, sex, BMI, PAH subtype, prevalent comorbidities, 6MWD, RV function and RV lipid content.  Differences in molecular characteristics 
profiles will be compared between groups. Fasting plasma (before and after drug exposure)  from our ongoing metformin pilot study will be used to perform metabolomic 
profiling  via mass spectroscopy of approximately 300 metabolites across all major 
metabolic pathway, measuring all amino acids and including lipidomics.  
 
 
b. Predictive Capacity  
We will validate the metrics  gathered from clinical and molecular characteristics  of 
responders and non- responders . We will test predictive capacity in response to 
mHealth, metformin, or both interventions.   
 Fidelity of Data Collection a nd Text Transmission  
In order to analyze the fidelity of the intervention, we will assess data collection and text 
transmission.  Endpoints evaluating fidelity of data collection will be percent day s with 
incomplete activity data and percent weeks with at least 6 days of activity data. The 
endpoint evaluating text transmission will be defined as percent total texts successfully 
delivered.  Data for these endpoints will be gathered by the Fitbit Charge HR, 
transmitted to the subject’s smartphone via Bluetooth, and then sent out to our mHealth 
platform via cellular network.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  39 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    
 Other Feasibility Endpoints  
a. Drop Out Rates   
b. Patient Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction will be assessed using a 
customized survey developed for A Mobile Health Intervention in 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  trial and adapted for the PAH 
population.  
c. Side effects and tolerability of interventions  including metformin. 
 Medication Regimen Escalation/Reduction 
The addition of new therapy for PAH indicates disease worsening (or subsequent) right heart failure. New PAH -specific medications added to the subjects’ medical regimen 
and the dates when added will be recorded during the study. Often, specific PAH medicat ions which are administered at a stable dose have increased dosing with clinical 
worsening (specifically, prostacyclin analog therapy). All dose changes will therefore be recorded.  
 Hospitalization for PAH progression or right -sided heart failure  
A hospital admission due to PAH progression and/or right -sided heart failure will be 
defined as a hospitalization because of lower extremity edema or dyspnea and/or PAH symptoms (e.g., syncope) refractory to outpatient increases in dose or frequency of diuretics or specific PAH medications.  
We will record all hospitalizations during the time of the study. Records from each hospitalization will be obtained by the local study coordinator. These records will be reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which is unrelated to the study.  
 Death  
Cardiovascular D eath: We define as cardiovascular death:  
1) sudden death 
2) death preceded by  either one of the following: 
a) cardiogenic shock defined by either:  
i. hypotension resulting in a failure to maintain normal renal  
ii.  cerebral function for >15 minutes prior to death)  
b) heart failure symptoms or signs requiring one of the following: 
i. intravenous therapy or oxygen in the hospital  
ii. confinement to bed  
in the absence of secondary causes (such as systemic infection or dysfunction of intravenous or subcutaneous medication delivery devices) or alternative causes of death.  
Non-Cardiovascular D eath: A death which does not meet the criteria above will be 
considered a non- cardiovascular death.  
Statis tical Considerations  
1.23 Study design 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  40 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    The proposed research project involves primary and several secondary objectives. To 
address these aims, we will conduct a single- blind ed, randomized, parallel group trial. 
Step counts, activity,  6MWT, emPHasis -10, echo, proton MRS, muscle function test,  
and blood sampling will be performed at screening and 12 weeks . Disposition of 
subjects and screening comparisons  will be reported.   
Summaries of all subjects screened, recruited, and randomized and the number who complete the week 12 visit post-randomization will be provided, according to the 
CONSORT guidelines. The treatment groups will be compared at baseline with respect 
to demographics and baseline measurements related to efficacy and safety without 
formal statistical testing. 
1.24 Statistical Analysis  
The primary analyses will focus on metformin vs placebo, exercise vs placebo, and metformin + exercise vs placebo comparisons on the primary endpoint. Since the evaluation of metformin or exercise will be reported as if they were independent studies and the combination arm versus placebo comparison serves to corroborate findings of the two separate comparisons, in addition to evaluating an additive or synergistic effect, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons. For binary endpoints, the Pearson chi -squa re or Fischer’s exact test will be used to assess between 
treatment arms difference. Logistic regressions will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 6MWD, functional status, age, and study cite. Model over -fitting will be avoided by 
considering the number of parameters in the model and the number of responders in the sample.  Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using either two -sample t -test 
or ANOVA, or non- parametric methods Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or Kruskal -Wallis 
test. Multivariable regressions (general linear models) will be conducted to examine the treatment effect while adjusting for important covariates such as baseline 
6MWD, functional status, age, and study site.  We have designed the study to minimize the potential for missing data. Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of 35 per group.  Nevertheless, in the event we have missing data, a multiple -imputation procedure as implemented in the areglmpute function in the 
Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0- 10) will be used to assess the impact 
of missing data. The analyses with imputation will mainly serve as sensitivity analyses .  
1.25 Missing Data and Dropouts  
For all endpoints, the primary analysis will be intention -to-treat (ITT) : all subjects 
randomized with a post -intervention endpoint measurement will be included. For 
endpoints based on measurements collected at the end of the study, individuals who do not complete follow -up cannot be included in analyses of those endpoints.  
Subjects who stop study interventions at any point of the study but agree to come 
back for the final data collection will be invited to do so to facilitate the ITT analysis.  
A per -protocol analysis will be conducted as a secondary ana lysis for the primary 
endpoints. Any subject who is identified as a major protocol violator will not be included. Major protocol violators will be defined as subjects randomized but non- compliant with wearing the accelerometer (i.e.  missing ≥ ½ of total days)  and others 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  41 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    identified by a committee not related to the study (XXX usually the study team 
determines a list of protocol violators before data un- blinding, but this is a single 
blinded study and that Anna and Evan know who gets what and the endpoints, that complicates  it a bit) .  
Subjects who drop out will be replaced up to a total of 35 per group. 
Built-in alerts 
will be triggered if there is a prolonged lapse in data transmission in real -time activity 
tracking. Protocols to email, then call subjects will be followed to determine the cause of missing data and find a solution. The Fitbit device will store data for 28 days so even if 
data is not being transmitted, it will not be lost. A stock of new devices will be kept on 
hand to overnight ship  to subject s if the Fitbit device fails to capture data or stops 
working.  
In the event of missing data, we will conservatively impute missing data to perform 
analyses with and without imputed missing data to corroborate findings. 
Conservative imputation strategies could include assuming worst case scenario for subjects on the intervention, best case for subjects on the control, or assuming the observed mean of the control group for the subjects on the intervention.  A multiple 
imputation procedure implemented in the aregImpute function in the Hmisc package in R (R Package; Version 3.0-10) will be used. The analysis with imputation will 
serve primarily as a sensitivity analysis.  The potential drop- out is considered in the 
power calculation to minimize its impact.  
1.26 Statistical Power  
The pivotal trial of Iloprost demonstrated that in the Iloprost arm nearly 40% had 10% improvement in 6MWD, 50% had improved FC, and 17% had both
1. From these data 
we calculate that 73% had either 10% improvement in 6MWD or improved functional status. Assuming metformin or the exercise arm will have similar response rate, and the placebo group will have 40% response rate, thought to be due to training effect potentially, we need 35 per group to have 80% power at 0.05 type I error rate. For the metformin and exercise combination group, an additive or synergistic effect between the two interventions will put its response rate above 73%. Thus,  the combination vs. 
placebo comparison will have at least 80%, likely better power. From past experience coupled with the low risk, low side effect profile interventions, we estimate a dropout rate of less than 10%
1. We will enroll 40 subjects to ensure 35 completed subjects per 
group. The total target enrollment is 160 over 4.5 years.  
1.27 Interim Monitoring Guidelines  
We have not planned formal  interim analyses for efficacy and therefore there are no 
stopping rules for efficacy for this trial. This is a Phase II trial which will be useful in supporting future studies of the intervention even if null. This project will have a DSMB who may consider whether to stop the trial or not if there is an increased risk of adverse events or toxicity.  
1.28 Protocol Violations  
Serious protocol violations such as discontinuation of the intervention unrelated to AEs 
will be carefully recorded and regularly reviewed by the Principal Investigator. Remedial 
changes in procedure will be recommended where feasible to reduce the incidence of 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  42 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    such violations. When known, the causes and circumstances of all violations will be 
documented for future secondary analyses and interpretation. Because all primary 
analyses will be intent -to-treat, it is essential that violations be kept to a minimum 
especially where it is possible to influence their rate of occurrence.  
Study R isks and Discomforts  
1.29 Activity Tracking  
Digital activity tracking and text messaging do not present any obvious medical risk. Participants will be told that the text messaging system does not substitute interaction with health care providers and cannot address emergency situations. The PI will report in a timely fashion to the IRB any unanticipated problem or major study deviation.  
1.30 Echocardiography  
There are no risks to this ultrasound procedure aside from minor discomfort related to placement of the ultrasound probe on the chest.  
1.31 Venipuncture 
The protocol requires patients to have blood drawn for research purposes. The risks of drawing blood are uncommon and may include bleeding, minor infection and bruising. Commonly, having blood drawn is painful, and rarely can lead to infection at the site of 
the blood draw. The amount of blood drawn is small, and represents an exceedingly small percentage of the amount of the total blood volume and will not represent a significant risk to the patient.  
1.32 MR Spectroscopy  
A portion of the patients will have MR spectroscopy which is not associated with meaningful risk of harm to patients when patients with contraindications such as metal implants are excluded. Prior to undergoing the study procedure, enrollees will be queried about the potential presence of implanted metal by trained personnel and will 
not undergo this procedure if concerns arise. Claustrophobic subjects may be 
administered an anxiolytic if the subject has taken this medication in the past without concern. The muscle strength and function test have no known risks, but they may be lengthy , uncomfortable, or make subjects feel tired.  
1.33 Metformin   
This drug has been on the market for several decades and is considered first line therapy for diabetes mellitus type 2. Moreover, it has been used extensively in non-hyperglycemic patients with polycystic ovarian disease. Additional studies of the safety of metformin in heart failure have been published. The pertinent risk of metformin is 
development of lactic acidosis. This  risk has been reported primarily in patients with 
abnormal renal or hepatic function, thus we have chosen to exclude these populations  
from the study . Additional concerns include hypoglycemia, though this is a rare risk of 
this drug, and gastrointestinal distress .  Patients will be educated on the signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and advised to contact study staff immediately if any arise.

baseline, week 1, week 3, week 6, week, 9, week 12, week 15, and week 17 through 
either a visit or phone conversation. At these points, side effects that limit dose 
adjustment will be assessed. If patients report significant gastrointestinal effects, 
metformin will not be increased as would otherwise occur in the protocol. If symptoms persist further, the dose will be dropped by 500 mg daily to the highest tolerated dose.    
The most common adverse reactions experienced are:  
• >10% of patients:  diarrhea (instant release tablet: 12% to 53%; extended release 
tablet: 10% to 17%), nausea/vomiting (instant release tablet: 7% to 26%; 
extended release tablet: 7% to 9%), flatulence (12%), Weakness (9%)  
• 1% to 10%:  chest discomfort, flushing, palpitation, headache (6%), chills, 
dizziness, lightheadedness, rash, hypoglycemia, Indigestion (7%), abdominal 
discomfort (6%), abdominal distention, abnormal stools, constipation, dyspepsia/ 
heartburn, taste disorder, myalgia, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
decreased vitamin B 12 levels (7%), increased diaphoresis, flu- like syndrome, nail 
disorder  
• <1% (Limited to important or life- threatening): lactic acidosis, leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis, megaloblastic anemia, pneumonitis  
• Contraindications  to the use of metformin are: hypersensitivity to metformin or any 
component of the formulation; renal disease or renal dysfunction (serum 
creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL in males or ≥1.4 mg/dL in females) or abnormal creatinine 
clearance from any cause, including shock, acute myocardial infarction, or 
septicemia; acute or chronic metabolic acidosis with or without coma (including 
diabetic ketoacidosis)  
 Boxed Warning    
A boxed warning has been issued for metformin related to the risk of developing lactic acidosis.  The risk is increased in patients with acute congestive heart failure, dehydration, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic or renal impairment, or sepsis.  Conditions that increase the risk of lactic acidosis on metformin treatment are all exclusion criteria for this study.  Based on our pilot trial with no lactic acidosis in enrollees thus far, we do not anticipate this to be a significant complication. If clinical ly 
significant lactic acidosis is diagnosed for clinical indications, the DSMB and IRB will be notified as per protocol.  
 Iodinated Contrast  
Metformin therapy will be discontinued prior to or at the time of intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media (potential for acute alteration in renal function) should a subject require contrast during the course of this study. Metformin will be withheld for 48 hours after the radiologic study and restarted only after renal function has been confirmed as normal.  Patients will be encouraged to delay any elective radiologic studies requiring iodinated contrast until the conclusion of the study.   
1.34 Privacy  
As noted, we will advise participants to set their phone to password protected mode. Due to the nature of text messaging technology, there is a small potential privacy risk 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  44 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    when communicating through text messages. Text message communications are not 
encrypted and therefore this information can be read if intercepted while in transit. Although we have a strict confidentiality policy and the technology system we use to deliver  text messages meets or exceed HIPAA standards, there is a possibility for the 
text messaging communications to be intercepted or accessed without the participant’s authorization. Once delivered to the participant’s mobile device, text messages are under his or her control and are his or her responsibility. By agreeing to participate in this study, participants accept this technology risk and release the research team, Vanderbilt, and Johns Hopkins from any liability arising from the use of text message communications in this program.  
1.35 Financial Risk  
Participants will only pay for text messages according to their mobile phone service plan.  The intent of this study is to test the real world feasibility of this intervention in a 
PAH population across a range of disease severity. Therefore, there will  be no early 
stopping rules. As stated in the consent form and reviewed at the time of enrollment, subjects may end participation at any time without prejudice.  
Quality Control 
Design strategies and monitoring activities throughout the study will ensure the integrity and high quality of the data. Design strategies include randomization of treatment assignment and training and certification of personnel. The rigorous monitoring program 
includes data queries and performance monitoring over the time of the trial.  
 
1.36 Personnel Training  
Prior to randomization of the first subject in the study protocol, each site PI will ensure that staff has completed appropriate training and that all documentation including sIRB 
approval (and local IRB approvals, if required) is completed and available. The purpose of training is to ensure that study personnel are carrying out the protocol in a consistent way and are adhering to good clinical practice guidelines. Staff will have current Human Subjects Training Certification on file. Before enrollment begins, study coordinators and research assistants who will perform the outcome assessments will be trained in all procedures, including completion of case- report forms (CRFs). 
1.37 Coordinating Cen
 ter (CC)  
The coordinating center (CC)  will be Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The 
coordinating center will be the central site responsible for organizing and managing activities and logistics for all collaborative components of  the study, including oversight, 
and coordination of the multi -site study design, evaluation of progress, and data 
storage. The coordinating center will develop standard operating procedures for how 
each site collects data, plans for project management, subject recruitment and 
retention,  performance milestones, scientific conduct of the trial, and dissemination of 
results.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  45 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    1.38 Data Quality  
The site PI and study coordinator  will constitute the first line of monitoring of the safety 
of the human participants. They will perform continuous monitoring of data quality and 
completion of CRFs.  Surveillance for AEs will consist of questioning subjects about 
potential AEs at every study contact, having subjects report any adverse event to the 
study team, and having subjects undergo vital sign checks and physical exams during each study visit.  The CC will create computer modules to identify discrepancies and 
incomplete data. These reports are tracked until each problem is resolved and corrected in the database.  
Periodic audits of each enrollment site will be conducted by the lead site.  The monitoring staff will review database forms and source documents to ensure that the information on the forms is complete and consistent with the source documents. All consent forms will be audited. All study personnel are required to read the consent form 
and protocol.  
Project team members at Vanderbilt listed as Key Study Personnel with existing electronic health record (EHR) system access rights will make use of REDCap Clinical Data Pull (CDP) tools. These tools are designed to enable transfer of relevant study -
related data from the Vanderbilt Research Derivative and/or di rectly from the EHR into 
REDCap.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring and Reporting  
1.39 Consent  
Written consent will be obtained for enrollment from participants. For each consent process, study personnel will discuss the details of the study, the risks and benefits, and the subject’s rights and responsibilities if they choose to participate in the trial and their right to refuse to participate.  It will be made clear that their clinical care will not be affected by their decision.  Subjects will be permitted to provide verbal consent over the phone prior to being scheduled for a screening visit. Documentation of verbal consent 
will be noted.  Written consent will be obtained at the screening visit or before.   
1.40 Institutional Review Board process  
The CC and Field Centers will rely on a single IRB (sIRB) of record ( Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center ’s IRB) and obtain approval and reliance agreements.  When 
sIRB approval is obtained, site specific ICFs will be sent to the CC along with the notice 
of approval. These materials must be on file in the CC before a center can begin 
enrolling participants into the clinical trial.  
1.41 Designated Medical Director  
Dr. Meredith Pugh will serve as the medical director for this trial. Dr. Pugh serves as an 
attending physician in the Vanderbilt Medical Intensive Care Unit, the inpatient consult service, and the pulmonary hypertension service.  Dr. Pugh has outpatient clinics where she sees a variety of general pulmonary diseases and pulmonary vascular disease. She will be invited to attend weekly meetings with the PI  and study personnel. She will be

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  46 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    available to discuss adverse events with the PI  and respond to safety concerns from 
subjects or study personnel.  
1.42 Monitoring  
During phone calls  and study visits, study personnel will review a checklist of signs or 
symptoms to detect any evidence of over -exertion or disease progression. Subjects will 
also be given a list of symptoms with definitions in lay language that may be related to 
overexertion and will be instructed to contact study personnel if symptoms arise. The list will include questions about excessive breathlessness with exertion, dizziness, presyncope/syncope, excessive fatigue, muscle soreness, increased use of as needed diuretics, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Any positive responses will be reviewed with the medical director who will discuss these concerns with the subject to determine whether the symptoms are related to the intervention. If symptoms are likely attributable to the intervention, we will record it as an adverse event and decrease the 
step count goal to a tolerable level, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the 
judgement of the medical director. All serious adverse events will be reported to the DSMB, Vanderbilt  Institutional Review Board, and NIH as described in Section 10.5.4. 
1.43 Data Safety Monitor Board (D SMB)  
An independent Data Safety Monitor Board (DSMB) will monitor the trial. The aims of 
the DSMB are to safeguard the interests of the trial's participants, potential participants, and investigators, to ensure the safety of the trial's interventions, to monitor the trial's overall conduct, and protect the trial's validity and credibility. The DSMB membership will be determined by the University of Kentucky that will conduct these activities with the addition of an ad hoc content expert in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Members have been chosen because of their experience in clinical trials and/or clinical expertise, and have been approved by the PI and the team of Co- Investigators. The members are 
independent of the trial (e.g., not be involved with the trial in any other way or have any involvement that could impact the trial).  All meetings of the University of Kentucky 
DSMB are in person with either teleconference of the PAH content expert or in person visit per the determination of the DSMB. The DSMB will aim to meet every 4 months to 
review safety data per their standing schedule. The need for additional meetings will be 
agreed upon by the DSMB  during their initial meeting. The PI will attend all meetings via 
teleconference unless a closed session is requested by the DSMB Chair.  The DSMB 
will be blinded to intervention group during open sessions and unblinded during closed 
sessions . The DSMB will report  its recommendations in writing to the PI.  Possible 
recommendations include continuation of trial as planned with no action needed or advice on and proposal of protocol changes. If the trial is to continue without modifications, then the report from the DSMB should include a summary paragraph suitable for distribution.  No interim analysis is planned. In addition to communicating its 
preliminary recommendations at the end of the meeting, the DSMB will report formally in writing to the PI  within 1 week of said meeting.  Unless the DSMB is recommending that 
the trial protocol be changed in some way, the letter to the PI should not reveal any 
confidential information.

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  47 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    Safety and Adverse Events  
1.44 Definitions  
 Unanticipated Problem (UP ) 
 Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
i. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
ii. related or possibly related to participation in the research (Possibly related to 
participation in the research means there is a reasonable possibility that the AE, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
iii. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.     
 Adverse E vent (AE)   
Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormal ity: 
i. results in study withdrawal  
ii. is associated with a serious AE  
iii. is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
iv. leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
v. is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)   
Adverse reactions are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
i. fatal 
ii. life-threatening  
iii. requires or prolongs hospital stay  
iv. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
v. a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
vi. an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For ex ample, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- subject hospitalization or  
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious. All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious AEs.

Protocol Version #: 6 .1  48 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    
 Suspected Adverse Reaction   
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse event.  For reporting purposes, "reasonable possibility" means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug/investigational  product and 
the adverse event.  
 Internal Adverse Event   
Adverse events experienced by subjects enrolled by the investigator(s) at their own Field Center.  
 External Adverse Event   
Adverse events experienced by subjects enrolled by investigators at other Field Centers 
in the clinical trial.  
1.45 Classifying AEs  
 Severity  
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAEv4.0) .  Grade refers to the s everity (intensity) of the AE:  
If the intensity of an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
i. CTCAEv4 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
ii. CTCAEv4 Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is 
indicated; limiting to age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; 
instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
iii. CTCAEv4 Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is indicated; disabling; limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
iv. CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is 
indicated.  
v. CTCAEv4 Grade 5: death due to an AE.  
In this grading system, severity is not equivalent to seriousness.  For example, a SAE would be any event which was life- threatening or disabling (Grade 4) or fatal (Grade 5) 
or was moderate- severe (Grade 2- 3) and required or prolonged hospitalization.  
 Expectedness  
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  49 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    OHRP defines an unexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects 
participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not 
consistent with either:  
i. the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in 
the research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the 
current IRB -approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources 
of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
ii. the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition   of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 Relatedness  
i. Definite: the AE is clearly related to the research procedures  
ii. Probably: the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
iii. Possible: the AE may be related to the research procedures  
iv. Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
v. Unrelated: the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research.    
For each identified AE, an AE entry on the appropriate form will be completed using the above classifications as soon as possible, updating as necessary. Reporting procedures should be started immediately (within 24 hours)  upon learning of a SAE or UP.  
1.46 Interpretation of D efi
 nitions  
 AE and UP Reporting Period 
The study period during which AEs must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as 21 days following the last 
administration of study treatment ( week 15 phone call).   
 Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.   
 Post-study AE  
All unresolved SAEs or AEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study or study drug should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  50 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    subject is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, 
the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratories will not be drawn unless clinically indicated.  A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following conditions is 
met:  
i. The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
ii. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
iii. The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious AE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.  Neither the condition, hospitalization, 
prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
AEs and SAEs which do not fall under the expedited reporting procedure requirements will be reported by the CC to the sIRB during yearly renewals and to the DSMB and 
NHLBI at scheduled or ad hoc meetings upon request. The Field Center  
Investigator/designee should keep originals or photocopies of all relevant  
documentation, including facsimile confirmations, and file them in the participant's file. All Field Center Investigator s should ensure that  all routine AE(s) are reported to ensure 
the CC has accurate data for periodic or annual reporting requirements  to the sIRB . 
 
 
 
1.47 Expedited Reporting P roc
 edures  
The Field Center Investigator should notify the CC, in an expedited manner, of those 
events listed in the table below related to study participation. The CC will then notify the sIRB, DSMB and NHLBI.

Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    • Protocol name and number  
• Subject identifiers  
• Demographic data 
• Nature of the event  
• Severity of the event  
• Probable relationship (causality) of AE to study procedure 
• Date and time of AE onset  
• Date and time of AE resolution, if available  
• Concomitant medications that the participant was taking for an underlying 
medical condition or disease and the therapeutic agents used for the treatment of the adverse event  
• Clinical assessment of participant conducted at time of SAE/AE  
• Results of any laboratory and/or diagnostic procedures, and treatment  
• Follow- up plan  
• Outcome  
• Autopsy findings (if appropriate)  
The Field Center Investigator will provide details about the AE to the CC as they become available. If additional information cannot be obtained for whatever reason, this will be documented. The Field Center Investigator should inform the CC when no other information is expected. The Field Center Investigator should provide the CC with a logical, complete, and accurate narrative description of the AE based upon the above information. The Field Center Investigator should promptly determine an assessment of causality.  
The CC will report this information to the sIRB for initial assessment and subsequent reporting will occur as outlined on the table. The sIRB will communicate to the CCC (and the local IRBs) if the event requires revisions to the informed consent form or o ther 
measures. The sIRB will work with the local IRB and CCC to determine if any corrective actions should be initiated as a result. A formal determination will be provided to the sIRB within 1 business week and the CCC will inform all Field Center Investigators of the corrective action (e.g., revision of informed consent form, protocol, CRF). The CCC will also report any qualifying events to the DSMB and NHLBI as noted in the schedule. The CCC and any Field Center Investigator should file copies of all cor respondence 
with the sIRB in the appropriate section of the Trial Master File or site study regulatory file. 
 Other R eportable E vents: 
The following events are also reportable to the sIRB:  
• Any AE that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by the sIRB to 
assure protection of human subjects.  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of the research study is of no therapeutic value.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  53 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    • Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior sIRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by the research team.  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opinion of the investigator placed one or more participants at increased risk, or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
1.48 Subject W it
 hdrawal  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study entirely at any time for any reason without prejudice to future medical care by the investigator or other physician. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study in the event of concurrent illness, AEs, or other reasons deemed to be in the subject’s best interest.  
A subject should be withdrawn from the study if there is:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• PI determination that the subject should be withdrawn for safety  
In order to preserve the integrity of the intention- to-treat analysis, even if the subject is 
withdrawn from the treatment portion of the protocol (either due to subject, physician, or investigator decision), it is imperative to continue with the scheduled follow- up 
assessments both for the safety of the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of compliance with study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial.  
1.49 Unblinding of Intervention A ss
 ignment  
Unblinding of the PI  for a specific subject will be considered, prior to the formal study 
unblinding, only if the following circumstances are met: 1) knowledge of the treatment assignment is required to initiate appropriate therapy for an AE or 2) if the safety of the subject  is at serious risk if the treatment is continued without the knowledge of treatment 
assignment. The decision to unmask will be made by the Field Center,  and Medical 
Monitor . The DSMB must be notified of the decision as soon as possible.  
Confidentiality of Study Data   
In this study, each patient will be assigned a unique Participant ID number (PID) when 
his/her demographic and race/ethnicity information is entered for the first time. Follow -
up data are subsequently entered as needed when a patient has a clinic visit. The unique PID number remains with each patient permanently and is matched with all new 
data entered. The PID number and patient identifiers are directly linked in the study database.  
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  54 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    The CC at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center  will also generate a Global Unique 
Identifier (GUID) for each subject using a NIH tool client. This is an identifying code 
assigned to a single research participant so that data can be compiled between 
research studies without using personally identifiable information (PII), even if the data are collected at different locations or by different studies. The GUID is created using PII (including, current name, legal given name given at birth (first, middle, and last), date of birth, city of birth, state of birth, country of birth, and physical sex at birth). Data including the GUID (without other identifiers) is considered de- identified by the NIH and 
OHRP. Personal identifying information used to generate the GUID will be erased by the study staff  after the GUID is created at the end of the study.  
The potential for data sharing has been included in the informed consent. Data releases to investigators for approved research purposes and analyses (after review and approval by the Publications and Presentations Committee and approval by sIRB and 
execution of a Data Use Agreement) will be stripped of identifiers using a “Safe Harbor” approach. If an approved investigator has conducted a separate study in which a shared participant has also consented to the use of a GUID then this will be retained in the data release; however, for all other data releases the GUID will be removed.  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  
of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Several mechanisms will be in place to maintain confidentiality. All of the data will be reported in aggregate. Each subject in all phases of the study will be assigned a unique study Participant Identification (PID) number to be used on all data forms, st udy 
records, and blood samples. A list of patient names and code numbers will be maintained separately in locked file cabinets or on password protected computers. Only the investigators and project staff will have access to this information. No other personally identifiable information will be available. We will also obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH for this study before consent of the first patient.  
1.50 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
Consent forms, medical history data, and study data are stored in secured files, either in locked file cabinets or in a locked room separate from medical records and coded such 
that all subject identifiers have been removed. As an additional precaution all  HIPAA 
regulated information is stored in an electronic file separate from other study data. Only 
mHealth+Met PAH                                                                                                               Protocol 
Protocol Version #: 6 .1  55 
Protocol Date: 12. 26.21    approved study staff (determined by the PI) will be given authorization to access the 
database. Bio- specimens are processed and labeled with barcode labels that include 
the subjects electronically generated study code and date of sample collection. The bio-specimens are stored in locked freezers in the study Laboratory; only approved study staff has access to the keys for each freezer. Access to the electronic freezer inventory of the specimens is kept on a secure password protected computer.  
1.51 Follow- up and 
 Record Retention  
The duration of this study is estimated to be 5 years. The duration of record retention 
will be at least 6 years after study completion, but the possibility exists for indefinite archival of study information via the REDCap database.  Should the outcome of this 
study prompt future investigations, the participants may be contacted to obtain follow -up 
information and invited to participate in additional studies.  
Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted sIRB in agreement with local legal prescriptions for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the sIRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the NIH before commencement of this study.   
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for 
review and approval by the sIRB for the study (and to Field Center IRBs if necessary for 
local content review).  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent 
form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the 
investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.

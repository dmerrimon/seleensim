2 Background Information 
2.1 Indication and population description
Sculptra Aesthetic is indicated for use in immune competent people as single regimen for correction of 
shallow to deep nasolabial fold contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles.
Study 43USSA1812ext is an extension to pivotal study 43USSA1812 to assess the long-term 
effectiveness and safety of Sculptra Aesthetic for the treatment of cheek wrinkles. Safety and 
effectiveness data for both study groups (A and B) will be collected for up to 12 m onths . In all, subjects 
will be followed for 24 months after baseline in pivotal study 43USSA1812.
2.2 Study product Profile
2.2.1 Investigational product description
Sculptra Aesthetic is a poly -L-lactic acid implant in the form of a suspension, which is reconstituted from 
a sterile dry powder by the addition of sterile water for injection. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is the main 
active ingredient from which the product has achieved its intended purpose. Sodium 
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) acts as a suspending agent for maintaining an even distribution of PLLA 
particles following reconstitution. Mannitol enhance s the lyophiliz ation process and provides the 
suspension with a consistency tha t is suitable for injection.
Each vial of dry powder contains 150 mg PLLA, 90 mg CMC and 127.5 mg non -pyrogenic mannitol – in 
total a vial weight of 367 .5 mg
 and is per approved label to be reconstituted prior to use by the addition 
of 5 mL of SWFI to form a sterile non-p yrogenic suspension. (2) In this study, commercially available 
Sculptra Aesthetic label ed for the study will be used and reconstitution will be made with 8 mL of SWFI 
with addition of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine prior to injection. It has been recommended by experienced 
physicians to evaluate alternative reconstitution procedures for Sculptra Aesthetic compared to the

incidence of nodule and papule formation. (3).
2.2.1.1 Non-clinical documentation
2.2.1.2 Clinical documentation
Please refer to the Sculptra Aesthetic Instructions for Use (IFU) document. The study specific IFU 
summarizes the adverse effects experienced with Sculptra Aesthetic injections along with precautions that 
can minimize these potential complications. For intravascular complications and recommended 
treatments, refer to the Intravascular Treatment Protocol.
Please refer to the study Report of Prior Investigations (ROPI) for a description of performed non -clinical 
and clinical studies and results with Sculptra Aesthetic .
2.3 Study rationale and justification for design
This study is an extension of study 43USSA1812, which evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Sculptra 
Aesthetic for treatment of cheek wrinkles, with the objective of an expanded label indication. The purpose 
of this extension of the study is to evaluate long -term safety and effectiveness data of Sculptra Aesthetic
beyond the Month 12duration ofthe pivotal study 43USSA1812 , to help characterize the long-term safety  
and effectiveness profile of the more dilute suspension. 
2.4 Risks and benefits
Anticipated benefits for subjects treated with Sculptra Aesthetic for the correction of cheek wrinkles 
include restoration of a more youthful appearance, relatively long-lasting effects thatwould reduce the 
need for frequent touch-up procedures. Another benefit is better knowledge about the safety profile for 
Sculptra Aesthetic in the new reconstitution volume, including assessment of the risks for late onset 
papules , nodules, and granuloma as well as other potential adverse event cases associated with Sculptra 
Aesthetic .
The benefit of Sculptra Aesthetic for correction of cheek wrinkles is also being evaluated in the ongoing, 
post-approval US clinical study (US10321) . (4)Although treatment in the cheek area was secondary to 
treatment in the nasolabial folds in this study , the interim data results support that treatment for cheek  
wrinkles is effective and well tolerated .
Since the initial approval of Sculptra Aesthetic in 1999 (EU), the amount of SWFI used to reconstitute 
Sculptra Aesthetic has gradually increased. Based on medical literature and physician experience, 
practitioners have reported improved clinical outcomes with increased reconstitution volumes that are up 
to two times higher than the volume recommended by the manufacturer and usually in combination with 
anesthetic solutions, like lidocaine 2%. ( 3, 5) It has also been suggested, that a reduction in frequency of 
nodules/papules can be achieved with an increased reconstitution volume. ( 6, 7). 
Most recently , the increased reconstitution volume for treatment of nasolabial folds wasevaluated in study 
43USSA1705. 
Risks with Sculptra Aesthetic as with any other injectable implant include infections, perforation of blood 
vessels, trauma to nerves and lumps. The most common reported adverse events (AEs) after Sculptra 
Aesthetic treatments are formation of papules and nodules, swelling, mass/induration , of which most 
resolve with time.
Infection, and damage to body struc tures such as nerves or blood vessels at the injection site, have also 
been reported. Rare but serious AEs associated with the intravascular injection of soft tissue fillers in the 
face have been reported and include temporary or permanent vision impairment, blindness, cerebral

structures.
Assessments for visual disturbance have been implemented at baseline, all treatment and all f ollow -up 
visits with specific instructions to immediately see an ophthalmologist or retina expert should any visual 
disturbance event occur. Moreover , only study Investigators qualified by education and experience, and 
who are skilled in the use of soft tissue fillers from their clinical practice and involvement in clinical 
research, and with a firm knowledge of the vascular anatomy and understanding of the depth and plane 
of injection as well as knowledge of the signs and symptoms and management of potenti al 
complications, will be chosen in order to assure proper device implantation and management of study 
risk. 
For intravascular complications or embolic event s, the treating physician should provide prompt medical 
attention and follow relevant clinical practice guidelines (8)for handling these symptoms. The treating 
physician should also review the Intravascular Treatment Protocol provided separately as a supportive
tool.
Lidocaine can, in rare cases, give allergic reaction s, and therefore subjects with known allergy or 
hypersensitivity to local anesthetics should not be included in the study.Additional information about reported AEs and anticipated risks are included in the study Instructions 
for use (IFU) and ROPI. Stopping rules for the study are include d in Section 8.6.8 .Given the anticipated 
low level of acceptable AEs inconnection with the injection and the protocol required safety assessments ,
it was determined the risk-benefi t assessment for use of Sculptra Aesthetic using investigational 
reconstitution and injection procedures for correction of cheek wrinkles appears to offer a clinical benefit 
at reasonable risk.
3 Objectives and Endpoints
3.1 Effectiveness objective and endpoints
The objective is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of Sculptra Aesthetic in the correction of cheek 
wrinkles.
Effectiveness endpoints include:
Responder rate, using the  (GCWS)  asassessed live by the 
Blinded Evaluator at Month s 19, 21 and 24.
A responder is defined as a subject with at least 1 grade improvement from pre-treatment on both 
cheek sconcurrently .
Responder rate, using the  (GCWS) c, as assessed live by the 
Blinded Evaluator, at Month s 19, 21 and 24.
Percentage of subjects having at least “Improved” according to the Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale (GAIS) on both sides of the face combined, asassessed live by the subject and the Treating 
Investigator separately at all visits following Month 12 in pivotal study 43USSA1812 .
Percentage of subjects responding in each response category for each question in the subject 
satisfaction questionnaire at all visits following Month 12 in pivotal study 43USSA1812 .
Change from pre-treatment in subject satisfaction using the Satisfaction with Cheeks FACE -Q 
questionnaire with Outcome Rasch transformed total scores as well as proportion of subjects in each 
response category for each of the individual questions at all visits following Month 12in pivotal study 
43USSA1812 .
Note: Pre -treatment = Month 12 (pre -treatment) for Group A subjects (those originally randomized to 
the Control Group in pivotal study 43USSA1812). Pre -treatment = Day 1 for Group B subjects (those 
origi nally randomized to the Treatment Group in pivotal study 43USSA1812).

4 Design of the Study
4.1 General outline
This is a 12-month extension of the prospective, randomized, evaluator - blinded, 
no-treatment 
controlled study 43USSA1812.
Subjects originally randomized to Control Group (approximately 50 subjects) in the pivotal study willbe 
offered treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic in the extension study.   This group of subj ects is designated as 
Group A within this protocol.   
Subjects originally randomized to Treatment Group (approximately 100 subjects) in the pivotal study
will be continued to be followed up during the extension study without further treatment. This group of 
subjects is designated as Group B within this protocol.  
Safet y and effectiveness data will be collected for up to 24 months in subjects randomized to the 
Treatment Group (who are not treated in the extension study) and for up to 12 months in subjects 
randomized to the Control Group (who are treated in the extension study) . In all, subjects will be followed 
for 24 months after the baseline visit in the pivotal study .
Note: One month is defined as 4 weeks in the study.

Page 20of 60Concomitant therapies are defined as follows:
Any therapy ongoing at the time the subject exited study 43USSA1812 ,Month 12 .
Any changes to existing therapies (such as changes in dose or formulation) during the course 
of the study, or
Any new therapies started after exiting study 43USSA1812 Month 12 .
4.6.2 Categories
The following three c ategories are to be considered for concomitant therapies:
Drugs/therapies including but not limited to prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), birth control 
pills/patches/hormonal devices, vitamins, herbal medicines/supplements, and homeopathic 
preparations.
Medical and surgical procedures including, but not limited to dental work, such as root canals or 
sinus surgery
Aesthetic procedures including, Resurfacing (laser, photomodulation, light, radiofrequency, 
ultrasound, chemical peel, dermabrasion, or other a blative/non -ablative procedures, needling or 
mesotherapy, cryotherapy, neurotoxin injections, lipolytic injections (e.g. dexycholic acid or other 
lipolytic substances), previous tissue augmenting therapy, contouring or revitalization treatment 
in the face .
4.6.3 Recording
Concomitant therapies are to be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate form in the eCRF. 
Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit. Any new concomitant 
therapy or modification of an existing therapy may be linked to an AE. A corresponding AE form must 
be completed to account for the change in therapy, except in some cases such as therapy used for 
prophylaxis, or dose modification for a chronic condition. 
4.6.4 Authorized concomitant therapies 
Unle ss listed in prohibited concomitant therapies (Section 4.6.5 ) all therapies are authorized.
4.6.5 Prohibited concomitant therapies 
The following therapies are prohibited during the study because they may interfere with the effectiveness
and/or safety assessment of the study product(s) and/or injection procedure:
Anticoagulants or inhibitors of platelet aggregation that have the ability to prolong bleeding times 
(e.g. aspir in, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), Omega -3 or Vitamin E should 
not be used within 14 days before any treatment to avoid increased bruising or bleeding at 
injection sites. Omega 3 and Vitamin E are acceptable only as part of a standard multivitamin 
formulation.
Chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents (inhaled corticosteroids allowed) or 
immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies or antiviral treatment for HIV or 
Hepatitis C). 
Prescribed corticosteroids or prescription retinoids for topical use in the treatment area or systemic 
use. 
Planned aesthetic facial plastic surgery (e.g. surgery to either the upper or lower lip, facelift, 
rhinoplasty, facial liposuction etc.) or cosmetic procedures (e.g. lifting threads, tissue grafting, 
tissue augmentation with permanent implants, silicone, or fat)
Treatment/procedure in the face that would interfere with the study injections and/or study 
assessments or exposes the study subject to undue risk by study participation, e.g.:

b.with Calcium Hydroxyapatite (CaHa), Poly L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) or permanent (non-
biodegradable
Participation in any interventional clinical study. 
The study product contains lidocaine, but additional local anesthesia may be used. Lidocaine 
should however be used with caution in subjects receiving other local anesthetics or agents 
structurally related to amide- type anesthetics, e.g. certain anti -arrhythmics, as the systemic toxic 
effects can be additive.
If a prohibited therapy becomes a necessary treatment for the safety or best interest of the subject, the 
Sponsor should be notified, time permitting, to discuss possible alternatives prior to administration ofa 
prohibited therapy.If a subject receives prohibited therapy during the clinical study, the Sponsor should be notified to discuss 
the pertinence and the modalities for the subject to continue in the clinical study.

Page 33of 605.4 Subject number
Prior to any study procedures being conducted, the subject must sign the informed consent form. Each 
subject who has signed the informed consent form will keep the same subject number as in study  
43USSA1812 . The subject number, subject name, and other information sufficient to link the eCRF to 
the medical records (e.g. national identification number, chart number, etc.) shall be recorded.
For the duration of the clinical study, each subject will be identified using the subject number for all 
documentation and discussion. 
5.5 Withdrawal of subjects
Each subject should be advised in the ICF that the subject has the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, for any reason, without prejudice.  Subjects may also be discontinued from this study if the 
investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best interest to do so, and may be withdrawn at the 
investigator discretion at any time.  
The withdrawal criteria are:
Med icalReasons If the subject suffers from a medical condition and/or adverse events 
that, in the judgment of the Investigator makes it medically necessary to 
withdraw the subject. The specific rationale for Investigator -initiated 
withdrawal of a subject for medical reasons should document the 
specific condition for withdrawing the subject.
Withdrawal by 
Subject:Includes consent withdrawal, subject relocation, schedule conflicts. A subject can withdraw their consent to participate in the study at their own 
request or be withdrawn from participation in the study at the request of 
their legally authorized representative at any time for any reason.
Lost to follow -up: If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort shall 
be made to contact that subject, confirm with three documented phone 
calls and a certified letter (delivery receipt requested) without answer before declaring the subject lost to follow -up.
Other: This category is to be used for a subject who discontinues due to a reason o ther than as specified in the pre- defined categories above. 
Explain the reason for discontinuation.
The reason and date for withdraw al should be documented in the subject’s source document sand 
eCRFs.  When possible, an explanatory comment should be adde d to further explain the reason for 
the withdrawal.  If withdrawal of a subject occurs during a regular study visit, the eCRF for that specific visit shall be completed as far as possible.  
If withdrawal of a subject occurs between regular study visits, t he subject should when possible 
(irrespective of the reason for withdrawal) be scheduled for a termination visit to document subject 
outcome for the secondary endpoints.
If a subject is withdrawn from the study, all data collected until the time of withdrawal will be used 
in the analyses. Subjects who receive product and are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will 
not be replaced. For AEs still ongoing at the time of withdrawal, see Section 8.6.11 .

6.4.2 Reference product
Reference product is not applicable. 
6.4.3 Product accountability
The study product will be released to the Investigator or his/her authorized designee after study 
approvals have been received from the FDA and IRB and the CTA has been signed by all parties.
The Investigator must ensure that the study products are kept in a secure location, with access limited 
to those authorized by the Investigator.
The study products must be traceable from the manufacturer to their use in subjects until return or 
disposal. It is therefore important that the Investigator maintains accurate product accountability 
records , i.e. documentation of the physical location of all investigational products, deliveries, and 
return of investigational products between the Sponsor and the Investigator, and documentation of 
administration of product to the subject.
When the study is com pleted, all unused or expired investigational product at each study site shall be 
returned to the Sponsor representative for destruction, or be destroyed locally at the site if 
documented as agreed with Sponsor.
Any malfunctioning investigational products shall be reported as described in Section 8.7.3. 
Products deliberately or accidentally destroyed during shipment or at a study site shall be accounted 
for and documented. Used vials, syringes, needles, and any unused material must be disc arded 
immediately after the treatment session and must not be reused due to risk for contamination of the 
unused material and the associated risks including infections according to standard procedures at the 
site. Disposal of hazardous material, i.e. syringes and needles must conform to applicable laws and
regulations.
The study products must not be used outside of the study.
All study products sent to the Investigator will be accounted for and no unauthorized use is 
permitted.

6.5.1 Treatment procedure
The investigational product is reserved for use by Treating Investigators who are experienced in 
treating cheek wrinkles.  
Before treatment, the subject will be informed about the expected post -treatment e vents thatshould 
be recorded in the subject diary and potential risks involved with the treatment and when to contact 
the Investigator in case of emerging symptoms.
The investigational product is reserved for use by doctors trained in the appropriate injection 
technique. Injection procedures are associ ated with a risk of infection. Aseptic technique and
standa rd practice to prevent cross -infections should be observed at all times including the use of 
disposable gloves during the injection procedure. All traces of make -up in the treatment area should 
be removed prior to any injection. The treatment site should be cleaned with a suitable antiseptic
solution. Anice pack can be applied on the site for a short period. Topical orlocal injection 
anesthesia ma y be used to further reduce pain on injection. If (topical or local) anesthetic or ice is 
used, the area should be cleaned after anesthetic is removed. The use of anesthetic or ice should be recorded in the source documentation and on the eCRFs.
Sculptra Aesthetic (sterile, freeze -dried, injectable poly -L-lactic acid) is available in 367.5 mg dose 
vials and will be reconstituted prior to use by the addition of 8 ml of SWFI at the investigational site 
following the reconstitution instructions in the study IFU.
Immediately prior to injection, 1 mL of 2% lidoc aine shall be added to make a total volume of 9 mL 
and the vial should be shaken
For intravascular complications or embolic events, the treating physician should provide prompt 
medical attention and follow relevant clinical practice guidelines (8)for handling these symptoms. 
The treating physician should also review the Intravascular Treatment Protocol provided separately as 
a supportive tool.
Sculptra Aesthetic will be administered using a 25G needle. Injections will be made subdermally, i.e. 
in the subcutaneous and supraperiosteal region. A maximum of 18 mL (2 vials) of Sculptra Aesthetic 
will be administered per treatment session with a maximum of 9 mL (1 vial) per cheek, evenly distributed within the treatment area. 
In this study, the study products will be administered in the Treatment area defined within the 
following anatomical borders:
oSuperior border - from top of tragus to top of alar crease
oMedial border -from top of the alar crease, along the NLF to th e inferior border of 
the mandibular ramus
oInferior border - from medial border at mandibular ramus to angle of mandibular 
ramus
Lateral border -from angle of mandibular ramus to top of tragus Injection technique
The injection technique is important fortheaestheticeffectofthetreatment. It is recommended to use 
a standard inj ection technique for all subjects per site to limit variability due to technique. Before 
product is injected, aspiration should be done to avoid intravascular injection.
The injection technique is at the discretion of the investigator, proposed techniques are:
Antegrade linear threading : also called push- ahead technique as some product is pushed ahead 
of the needle. Once the needle is in place, the product is injected ahead wh ile inserting the 
needle in the tissue.
Retrograde linear threading : the needle is threaded into the tissue at the appropriate depth, and 
the product in injected as a straight line on withdrawal of the needle

treated, this should occur prior to the first injection of the study product and before each additional 
treatment.  Camera equipment will be provided by the Sponsor or their designee and standardized 
photographs should be taken. Instructions for photography are provided in a separate photography 
manual . Baseline photographs may be used as a reference in the assessment of GAIS by the Treating 
Investigator and subject.  Photographs may also be taken to document AEs at the Treating Investigator’s 
discretion.  Any personnel who were not previously trained in the photographic equipment and 
technique will be trained in the same manner as for study 43USSA1812 ,prior to extension study start.  
8 Safety Assessments
Safety assessments for this study include an evaluation and an interview of the subjects at each visit to 
obtain information about any medical occurrence that meets the definition of an AE, a subject diary,

Page 44of 60pregnancy tests , cheek firmness, function and symmet ry, device palpability ( pre-treatment assessment 
excluded for those in Group A ), mass forma tion, cheek sensation and visual function assessments 
(Group A only).
8.1 Assessment of AEs by direct questioning to subject and evaluation of subject
Each subject should be questioned about AEs at each visit following enrollment (i.e. Informed 
consent).  Definition and Repor ting requirements are found in Section 8.6. 
Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination 
by the investigator or designee, which should include visual inspection of the treatment area.  AES must be documented in the source document and eCRF without regard for cause or relation to 
investigational product.  If in the process of the interview, additional information regarding medical history or pre- planned medical or surgical procedures is revealed, it must be documented n the source 
document(s) and the eCRF.  
It is the responsibility of the Treating Investigator to determine severity of the AE and relatedness of 
the event to the study product and/or injection procedures.  Adverse Events must be reported as outlined below in Section 8.6.5 .
8.2 Subject Diary Data
A subject diary will be dispensed to all subjects receiving treatment in the extension study for daily 
completion for 28 days beginning on injection day for each treatment with direct questioning for pain, 
tenderness, redness, bruising, swelling, itching, lumps/bumps and “other ”. 
The subject will also be specifically instructed to record presence of any of the following symptoms in 
the “other” section; Changes in vision (i.e. loss of vision, blurriness, double vision, pain in or around your eye, blindness, blind spots, problems moving your eyes), Skin changing color around the eyelids, 
Crusty or scabby skin around the eyelids, Pa in, Headache, Fever, Dizziness, Confusion, Weakness or 
numbness in the arms or legs, Changes to consciousness or alertness, Difficulty speaking/ speech 
impairment or Face droop . The diary will include specific instructions to seek immediate medical 
attenti on if any of these symptoms or signs are observed.
Diary data will be counted and displayed separately from other AE data.
8.3 Laboratory assessments
For all women eligible for treatment and of childbearing potential, including those currently using 
contraception, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at each treatment visit prior to injection. The 
test result must be negative for the subject to receive any treatment with study product.  The test 
result will be documented in source data and the eCRF.
8.4 Visual Function assessments
Visual function assessments will only be performed for subjects receiving treatment in the extension 
study (Group A).  These assessments will be performed both prior to and post injection of the study 
product at all treatment visits and will also be performed at each follow up visits .  Th epost-treatment

Page 45of 60assessments should be performed 30 min after the injections are completed. In the event of blindness or 
any significant ophtha lmic sign or symptom, subjects are to undergo immediate evaluation by an 
ophthalmologist or a retina specialist . All incidences of visual disturbances, regardless of relationship 
to study product or seriousness, are considered Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and include 
but are not lim ited to the following: any loss of vision, blurry vision, double vision, pain in or around 
the eye, blind spot orshadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes. AESI’s should be reported (using 
the Adverse Event Clarification Form) within 24 hours of awareness . Please refer to recording 
instructions in S ection 8.6.6 .
8.4.1 Snellen visual acuity test 
A Snellen Eye Chart will be used to assess visual acuity for distance vision.  Visual Acuity will be 
conducted using the subject’s best distance correction (e.g. with contacts or spectacles) at a distance of 
6 feet from  the chart.  Each eye will be m easured separately by either using an occluder or having the 
subject cover one eyeat a time.  The subject will be asked to start reading the letters at the top of the 
chart working their way to the bottom.  The smallest row of letters that the subject can read will indicate 
their visual acuity listed on the chart.  Snellen Visual Acuity will be recorded in their sourc e 
documentation and eCRF.  If there are two or more visual acuity line changes during the course of 
study, these should be reviewed and assessed by the Investigator for a potential adverse event.
8.4.2 Extraocular muscle function test
Extraocular muscle function testing examines the function of the eye muscles.  This test observes the 
movement of the eyes in six specific directions to evaluate weakness or other problem s in the 
extraocular muscles.  The subject will be asked to sit or stand with their head up and looking straight 
ahead.  The assessor will hold a pen or other object approximately 16 inches in front of the subject’s 
face.  The assessor will then move the object in several directions and ask the subject to follow it with their eyes, without moving the ir head.  Normal or Abnormal will be recorded in the source 
documentation and eCRF.  Changes in movement of the eyes during the course of the study should be reviewed and assessed by the Investigator for a potential adverse event.
8.4.3 Confrontation visual fiel d
The Confrontation Visual Field test will be used to assess the subject’s peripheral vision.  The examiner will sit facing the subject, about 3 to 4 feet away from the subject and ask the subject to fix 
their gaze on the examiner’s eye.  The examiner will hold their arms straight out to the side and bring 
their hands into the subject’s visual field from the sides in each quadrant.  The subject will signal as soon as the hand is seen.  Results will be recorded as normal or abnormal in the source documentati on 
and eCRF.  Changes in the visual field of the eyes during the course of the study should be reviewed and assessed by the Investigator for a potential adverse event.
8.5 Other safety assessments –All Subjects
At all physical visits, a study staff member who is qualified by training and experience to perform 
safety assessments, will assess each subject’s cheek sensation ; firmness and symmetry; and mass 
formation. For subjects in Group A, product palpability assessments will be performed at each 
physical visit after treatment with the study product .  For those in Group B, product palpability will be 
performed at each physical visit.
8.5.1 Cheek sensation 
Cheek sensation will be tested at all physical study visits using two methods:
1)Monofilament test -assessing the subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a 0.4G 
monofilament on 3 points on right and left cheek 
and

Page 46of 602) Cotton Wisp test - assessing the subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a cotton wisp on 3 
points on the right and left cheek. The 3 different points on each side will be tested randomly. 
Subjects will be blindfolded and asked to acknowledge sensation or lack of sensation at each 
point. Any lack of sensation should be further assessed by the Investigator for confirmation o f any 
potential adverse event. 
8.5.2 Cheek firmness , symmetry and function
At all physical visits, a study staff member who is qualified by training and experience to perform safety assessments will assess each subject’s cheek firmness, symmetry (with face at rest and with 
eyes tightly closed), and function (puff cheeks, broad sm ile, and chewing motion). These parameters 
will be rated as “Normal” or “A bnormal.” Anyabnormal result should be further assessed by the 
Investigator for confirmation of any potential adverse event.   
8.5.3 Mass formation 
Mass formation in the cheeks will be assessed by a study staff member that is qualified by training and 
experience to perform safety assessments at Enrollment andat all physical visits. Mass formation will 
be defined as lumps or aggregation of coherent material. An assessment of mass formation is to be 
recorded as an adverse event.
8.5.4 Device palpability -All Subjects
Device palpability will be assessed at post treatment visits for Group A subjects and at all physical 
visits for those in Group B , andwill assess whether or not the palpability is the normal expected feel. 
An unexpected feel is to be recorded as an adverse event.   
8.6 Adverse events
8.6.1 Definition of an adverse event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons
1, whether or not related to 
the study product. 
This definition includes:
a)events related to the investigational product or the reference product
b)events related to the procedures involved
8.6.2 Definition of a serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
a)led to death,
b)led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in
1.a life -threatening2illness or injury, or
                                                
1For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational product.
2The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it

3.in-patient or prolonged hospitalization3, or
4.medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, 
c)led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should be a predisposition to 
report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see Section 8.6.5 ).
8.6.3 Definition of unanticipated adverse effect 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the investigational product, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the right, safet y or welfare 
of the subject (see US requirement CFR 812.3 (s).
8.6.4 Recording instructions
Each subject with an AE occurring after enrollment through study exit should be fully recorded in the 
source document(s) for further transcription into the eCRF.  Each subject should be questioned about 
AEs at each study visit following enrollment .  The question asked should be: “Since your last clinical 
visit; have you had any health problems ?”Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and 
symptoms detected durin g each examination or from a laboratory test, observations made by the study 
site personnel, subject diaries, or spontaneous reports from the subjects or their relatives. 
When an AE is related to a device deficiency (refer to Section 8.7 ), including technical device 
malfunction, the AE shall be recorded on the AE form/module in the eCRF and the technical 
complaint shall be reported separately on the clinical study complaint form ,provided separately in the 
investigator file, and the eCRF.
Investigators, or other study site personnel, shall record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology and avoiding abbrevi ations)
b)Affected area
c)Start date   (first day with symptoms)
d)Stop date (last day with symptoms)
e)Intensity (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section 8.6.4.1 )
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Section 8.6)
g)Causal relationship to study product or study product injection procedure (yes or no)
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non -pharmacological treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subje ct withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE (ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ stable, not 
recovered at the end of the study)
                                                
were more severe. (Source: ICH -E2A clinical safety data management : definitions and standards for expedited 
reporting ).
3Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the CSP, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).

contain full information or if it is made without using the SAE form the fully completed and signed 
SAE form shall be e- mailed to the CRO. A copy of the fully completed SAE form shallbe kept at the 
site. The blinded evalua tor should perform live effectiveness assessments only and not discuss the 
treatment or any potential adverse events with the patient. 
In addition, the PI shall report SAEs to the responsible IRB without undue delay. The PI is 
responsible for checking wha t reporting procedures are applicable for his/her IRB regarding SAEs and 
final report of the outcome of the study and to comply with such reporting procedures during the 
study period.
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting to the RA, if applicable and ac cording to national 
regulations. 
8.6.8 Stopping Rule
Injections at an investigational site will be temporarily halted if an SAE occurs for a vascular embolic 
event that leads to skin necrosis, vision loss, or stroke and is determined by the Investigator to be 
directly or possibly related to the investigational device or injection procedure.  The SAE will be 
investigated by the Sponsor. 
If the Sponsor’s investigation concludes:• The SAE was unanticipated, directly related to the investigational product or device injection 
procedure, and presents an unreasonable risk to study subjects, injections will be immediately 
suspended for all study sites until the event can be properly char acterized and an appropriate 
treatment strategy is established to prevent recurrence of the unanticipated event.  All 
Investigators will be notified of the suspension.  The IRB and RA will also be notified.  
• If the SAE does not meet the above criteria, then injections in the study will continue.  
8.6.9 Reporting of unanticipated adverse device effects 
The Investigator shall submit to the sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during the study as soon as possible , but in no event later than 10 
working days after the investigator first learns of the effect (see US requirement 21 CFR 812:150 (a.), for contact details, see Section 8.6.7 . 
8.6.10 Follow -up of unresolved events ongoing at termination of the study
All serious as well as non- serious AEs with a causal relationship to the study product or treatment 
procedure and ongoing at study end, shall be followed up after the subject's participation in the study is over. Such events shall be followed -up after the last study visit until resolved, assessed as chronic 
or stable, or subject is lost to follow up. Follow -up information shall be reported on the AE fol low-up 
form.
8.6.11 Reporting and follow -up of events occurring after subject termination of the study
All adverse events with a causal relationship to the study products or treatment procedure that the Investigator becomes aware of, serious as well as non -serious, with onset after the study termination 
(subject’s last study visit) shall be reported to the Sponsor. The report should as a minimum include 
the information described in Section 8.6.4. The report can be sent via e- mail according to contact 
details specified in Section 8.6.7.
8.6.12 Pregnancy
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE.

If the Investigator or the Sponsor assesses that the device deficiency could have led to a SAE the 
Sponsor is responsible for reporting the device deficiency to RA and the PI is responsible for 
reporting it to the IRB.
The deficient study product shall be kept by the study site until the Sponsor has confirmed whether 
the product shall be returned to Sponsor for further study or if it can be destroyed at the study site.
9 Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to enter 
clinical data information into a database, efficiently and avoiding errors. The data management routine includes procedures for database set -up and management, data entry and verification, data 
validation, and documentation of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in the process. The data management process will be described in detail in the data management plan 
(DMP).
The database, the data entry screens a nd program will be designed in accordance with the CIP and the 
CRF template. Data validation will be performed by computerized logical checks and manual review. 
Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) Drug and 
medi cal dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) dictionaries as specified in the DMP. Safety 
data (SAE and if applicable AE of special interest) in the clinical database will be reconciled against the data in the safety database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study data will be 
transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write- protected. Statis tical analyses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.
9.2 Electronic case report forms 
An electronic data capture application, compliant with regulatory requirements for software validation 
US FDA 21CFR11 will be used to collect, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study 
data. An eCRF is required and shall be completed electronically for each screened subject (screening 
visit) and enrolled subjects (subsequent visits). 
The eCRF includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, 
to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inac curate. Study data shall be entered directly 
from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before inclusion of the first subject.
Authorized study site personnel designated by the PI shall complete data collection. Appropriate 
training an d security measures shall be completed with all authorized investigation site personnel 
prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any subject.
The study data is the sole property of the Sponsor and shall not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written permission from the 
Sponsor. At the end of the study, electronic data are kept at the Sponsor and a copy (provided by the 
vendor) at the study site as part of the Investigator file.
Any delegation of collection of data shall be specified and recorded.

Page 53of 609.2.1 Data entry
All data shall be entered in English. The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the 
subjects participating in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs shall be completed as soon as possible during 
or after the subject’s visit. The subject’s identity must always remain confidential, i.e. the name and address of the subjects must not be registered in the eCRFs or in the database. The Investigator must 
verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator shall indicate this 
in the eCRF. The Investigator shall electronically sign off the study data. By signing, the Investigator takes responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and legibility of the data reported to the Sponsor 
in the eCRF.
9.2.2 The query process
The monitor shall review the eCRFs and eval uate them for completeness and consistency. Each eCRF 
shall be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations shall be made by the PI or his/her 
autho rized designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once study data have been 
submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who made th e change, together with time 
and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsible for entering study data into 
the eCRF shall be determined in advance. If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, 
either by the Sponsor or by its representatives, the responsible data manager or monitor shall raise a 
query in the electronic data capture application. The query shall state the question or data to be 
changed and shall be resolved in the system by the PI or his/her authorized d esignee. The appropriate 
study site personnel shall answer the queries in the eCRF within a reasonable timeframe Answered 
queries will be audit trailed by the electronic data capture application meaning that the name of study 
site personnel, time, and date is logged. Answered queries will then be closed by the appropriate study 
personnel (i.e. data manager, site monitor, etc.)
9.2.3 User identification
Electronic CRF records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, by 
means of their unique UserID. Specified records shall be electronically signed by the Investigator to 
document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate. This will be facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique UserID and password; d ate and time stamps will be 
added automatically at time of electronic signature. If an entry in an eCRF requires change, the correction shall be made in accordance with the relevant software procedures. 
9.2.4 Audit trail
All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail and a reason for the change shall be stated. 
Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will be locked.
9.3 Source documents
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate t othe subject’s 
medical history, that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion andexclusion criteria, and 
all records covering the subject’s participation in the study. They include laboratory notes, 
memoranda, material dispensing records, sub ject files, etc.
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. Source data should be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry and should be explained if necessary.
Source documents shall be made available for inspection by the monitor at each monitoring visit. 
The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for each subject for whom signed informed consent has been collected.

Page 57of 60The study shall include collection and processing of personal data as specified in the Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) on the protection of individuals with regard to 
the processing of personal data. For the purposes of the study, Sponsor will be considered the data 
controller, and Institution and PI will both be considered data processors.
12 Quality Control and Quality Assurance
12.1 Quality control
On-site monitoring of the study will be arranged by the Sponsor according to GCP guidel ines to 
verify that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the reported data are accurate, 
complete, verifiable from source documents, and that the conduct of the study complies with the 
approved CIP, subsequent amendment(s), GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
Any CIP deviation shall be documented appropriately, verified, discussed, and collected by the 
monitor and appropriate actions will be taken. The PI is responsible for promptly reporting any 
deviations from the CIP that affects the rights, safety or well -being of the subject or the scientific 
integrity of the study, including those that occur under emergency circumstances, to the Sponsor as 
well as the IRB if required by national regulations. Deviations will be reviewed to determine the need 
to amend the CIP or to terminate the study.
12.2 Quality assurance
The study site may be subject to quality assurance audit by the Sponsor as well as inspection by 
appropriate RA. It is important that the PI and other relevant study site p ersonnel are available during 
the monitoring visits, possible audits, and inspections, and that sufficient time is devoted to the monitoring process.
Each participating member of the study site team shall provide a curriculum vitae (CV) or equivalent 
that demonstrates their qualifications to conduct the study.
It is the responsibility of the PI to ensure that all personnel involved in the study are fully informed of 
all relevant aspects of the study, including detailed knowledge of and training in all proce dures to be 
followed. All Investigators and other responsible persons shall be listed together with their function in 
the study on the signature and delegation log.
12.3 Changes to the clinical investigational plan
The PI and other site personnel involved in th e study must not implement any changes to the CIP 
without agreement with the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval from the IRB and 
RA, if applicable, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects. All 
changes to the fi nal CIP must be documented in a dated and version- controlled written protocol 
amendmen t. However, administrative changes may be documented in the Sponsor file without 
requiring a protocol amendment. The Sponsor will assess if the changes require prior FDA 
approval, and inform the Investigator when such approval has been received.
13 Financing, Indemnification, and Insurance
The CTA outlines the compensation and payment terms of the study. The CTA must be signed before 
the first subject is screened in the study. If there are differences between the CTA and the CIP 
regarding certain rights and obligations, the CTA is the prevailing document. Q -Med AB’s obligations 
in this clinical study are covered by Galderma’s global general liability program. An insurance
certificate will be provided upon request. The Institution/PI is obligated to maintain insurance 
coverage for their obligations in the clinical study according to the CTA.

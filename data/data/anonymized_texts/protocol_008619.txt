 1. INTRODUCTION  
The clinical diagnosis of patients with dementia is challenging and is frequently 
inaccurate compared to pathological diagnosis at autopsy.  Although A lzheimer’s disease 
(AD)  is the most common cause of dementia, other etiologies including Fronto -Temporal 
Dementia (FTD), vascular d ementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies occur in a 
substantial number of cases, (Barker et al. 2002) and there may be substantial overlap in 
the clinical presentation of these disorders. In clinico-pathological studies, 10 - 20% of patie nts diagnosed with AD in life did not have pathology consistent with the disease at 
autopsy (Lim et al. 1999, Mayeux et al. 1998, Ranginwala et al. 2008).  Conversely, a recent study showed that 40% of dementia patients diagnosed with a disorder other than AD by an expert neur ologist in life had AD pathology (i.e., AD or mixed dementia) on 
post mortem examination (Beach et al. 2012).  Accurate antemortem  diagnos
 is can be particularly challenging in FTD given the clinical 
and pathologic heterogeneity of the disease (Rabinovici and Miller 2010). Most cases of FTD can be classified into two major pathologic categories: (1) diseases that involve tau deposition (FTD -Tau) and (2) conditions associated with tau-negative, ubiquitin and 
TDP43 -positive inclusions (FTD-TDP) (Mackenzie et al. 2010). In a minority of cases, 
FTD -Tau can be predicted during life with high accuracy based on the presence of a 
known mutation in the MAPT gene, or based on a highly correlated clinical phenotype (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) - Richardson’s Syndrome) (Josephs et al. 
2006).  However, the relationships between other FTD clinical phenotypes and pathologic subtypes are far less predictable (Forman et al. 2006, Hodges et al. 2004, Josephs et al. 2011, Kertesz et al. 2005). For example, the underlying histopathology in patients with behavioral- variant FTD (bvFTD), the most common clinical FTD 
syndrome, is split equally bet ween FTD -Tau and FTD-TDP (Josephs et al. 2011) and 
there are currently no known reliable methods to distinguish the two during life. Accurately determining the underlying neuropathology during life is a critical need to enhance the development and testing of biologically specific drugs targeting tau or TDP.  
 
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by Siemens Molecular Imaging Biomarker 
Research group) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates  (Xia et al., 2013).  Autoradiography results  using 
tissue sections from human brains showed a strong signal in the grey matter of cortical slices from tau positive brains , but weak or no binding in tau negative, Aβ positive, or tau 
and Aβ negative tissue.   Scatchard analysis  based on this heterogeneous autoradiography 
assay  yielded an estimated K
d of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified 
PHF tau  isolated brains of AD patients  yielded a K d value of 0.7 nM. 
 
AV-1451 was assessed in competitive binding assays against a panel of 72 of the most 
common centr
al nervous system ( CNS ) targets  and no clinically relevant inhibition was 
seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the i n vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo  cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD).  Nonetheless, until

Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A19: “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Subjects with 
Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 11 of 39 
 sufficient human cardiovascular safety data are available, initial clinical studies will 
exclude subjects with a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking 
drugs known to prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo  safety pharmacology studies were also conducted in rats to determine potential 
effect
s on the CNS and respiratory systems. I n these studies no clinically relevant effects 
were reported at doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non- radioactive 
AV-1451 has been tested in single and repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog.  In 
each of these studies the no obser vable adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were the highest 
doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).   
Potential genotoxicity of non- radioacti ve AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro and in vivo  
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   
However, in the in vivo  rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -1451 showed no evidence of genotoxicity. The different results in the 
in vitro  genotoxicity assays and the in vivo  micronucleus study are likely related to 
differences in the exposure conditions encountered by the target cells in the different test 
systems. In vivo , AV-1451 is cleared rapidly; however, the in vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. While the in vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clinically -relevant doses for human diagnostic studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer distributi
on was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  
There were three organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The organ that receive d the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall 
(0.0955 ± 0.0134 mSv/MBq), followed by the small intestine and the liver.  The Effective 
Dose was 0. 0235 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated Effective Dose of 
8.70 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
and florbetapir F 18 injection.  
18F-AV-1451 may be useful as a marker of tau pathology in patients with AD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders.  Several preliminary studies using 18F-AV-1451 have been 
completed (e.g., Chien et al., 2013). The purpose of the current study is to extend these 
findings by evaluating the usefulness of AV-1451 in FTD and in particular, whether the 
regional pattern of tau deposition typical of AD is present in FTD cases.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLA N 
5.1. Overall De sign and Plan  of Trial  
This is a phase I study that will evaluate imaging characteristics of 18F-AV-1451 in 
subjects with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD).   
Subjects followed in a referral center research cohort  for FTD w ill be contacted to 
participate and must provide informed consent before starting any 18F-AV-1451-A19 
study procedures. Diagnosis be will determined by companion study with d etailed 
characterization  provided by enrolling physician. Screening assessments may take place 
over several days and will include demographic information, a medical as sessment for 
eligibility,  ECG  a brief cognitive assessment (e.g. MMSE) , and florbetapir F 18 Positron 
Emission Tom ography (PET) imaging .  The screening florbetapir F 18 PET scan is to be 
performed to assess for evidence of amyloid pathology and should be interpreted by the 
local  reader prior to enrollment.  
Subjects who qualify for the study will come to the imaging center at a later date and will have a cathet
er(s) placed for IV administration of 18F-AV-1451. Vital signs will be taken 
in a supine position immediately prior to administration of 18F-AV-1451 (within 30 
minutes prior to injection) and at the completion of imaging prior to subject discharge. Subjects will receive up to a target dose of 370 mBq as a single IV bolus of 
18F-AV-1451.  
A 30 minute dynamic image starting approximately 75 minutes post injection will be 
obtained. 
Adverse events will be continuously monitored during the imaging sessions.  Subjects 
who experie
nce any adverse event will not be discharged until the event has resolved or 
stabilized.  
A follow-up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted between 2 or 
3 business days, but not less than 48 hours, after each imaging visit, to 
confirm subject well-being and to collect information about any new adverse events.   
5.2. Planned  Dosage and Duration of Treatment  
5.2.1.  Dosage and Administration  
 
18F-AV-1451:

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 16 of 39 
 All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration of approximately 370 MBq (10 
mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
 
Florbetapir F 18: 
Subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi)  
of Florbetapir F 18 Injection. 
 
5.2.2. Rationale f or Dosage  
 
18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a radioactive dose of 370 MBq with a maximum 
human dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by weight.   
  The Effective Dose of 8.70 mSv for
  a 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection is comparable to the 
effective dose of approved 18F-labeled compounds such as FDG and florbetapir F 18 
injection.  
 The proposed dose has been shown to have acceptable image quality in previous human studies. 
 
5.3. Selection  of Subjects  
Approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled.  
5.3.1. Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects diagnosed by a dementia specialist with symptomatic clinical syndromes 
with expec
ted Frontotemporal Dementia pathology will be enrolled.  Clinical 
syndromes associated with FTD pathology include: behavioral- variant FTD, FTD

primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome and 
corticobasal syndrome. S ymptomatic carriers of a known autosomal dominant 
gene mutation associated with FTD , including : MAPT, GRN, C9ORF72, 
TARDP, CMP2B, VCP, FUS  as well as non -gene carriers  are eligible for 
enrollment. 
Diagnosis will be determi ned by companion study with detailed characterization 
provided by enrolling physician.

 or study termination, appropriate steps will be take n to ensure the safety of study 
subjects.  
6. PRODUCT RISK ASSESSMENT  
 
The most up- to-date and complete information regarding the use of 18F-AV-1451 
Injection can be found in the investigator's brochure.  
  
In brief, 18F-AV-1451 Injection is an experimental imaging agent that will be used at 
relatively low (tracer) doses.  However, because 18F-AV-1451 Injection is in the early 
stages of clinical investigation, it is recommended that subjects receiving 18F-AV-
1451 Injection be followed closely by means of adverse event repo rting  and vital 
signs . 
 
There are no data on the effects of 18F-AV-1451 Injection  in human perinatal 
development.  . For this reason, females must avoid becoming pregnant. Females must use adequate contraceptive methods for 24 hours after administration of 
18F-
AV-1451 Injection. 18F-AV-1451 Injection must not be administered to females who 
are pregnant, or lactating. Males with female partners who are pregnant or of childbearing potential must agree to refrain from sexual activity for 24 hours following adm inistration of 
18F-AV-1451 Injection. Additionally, males must agree 
not to donate sperm for 24 hours following administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
7. PROCEDURES AND METHO DS 
 
7.1. Assessment  Periods (See Section 11.2,  Trial Flow Chart)  
        
The study will consist of the following sequence of activities:  
 
7.1.1. Screening V isit: Visit 1  
Screening may take place over several days. All screening assessments will 
preferably
 be performed within 60 days prior to the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging 
session .   
Screening assessments will include : 
• Inform
ed consent; 
• Demogra
phics (age, gender, education, race, ethnicity); 
• Medica
l history, concomitant medications;

 • Disease history (date/months since symptom onset, date/months since 
diagnosis, family history of relevant neurologic disease);  
• An ECG will be performed to assess the subject’s cardiac status. If an ECG was
 performed within the last 12 months and is available for 
review, the ECG does not need to be repeated;  
• Cognitive status interview, including MMSE; 
• MRI of t
he brain, only for those subjects who do not have a prior MRI 
(obtained w
ithin one year of enrollment) available for submission to 
Avid and are able to tolerate one;  
• Serum  pregnanc y test (women of childbearing potential);  
• A physician will see the pa tient during the screening visit. 
• Florbet
apir F 18 PET scan (see section 7.1.1.1 for details) 
7.1.1.1. Screening
 F lorbetapir F 18 PET scan  
The screening florbetapir F 18 PET scan is to be performed to assess for evidence 
of amyloid pa
thology and should be interpreted by the local reader prior to 
enrollment. Amyloid scans that have been obtained within 3 years of screening 
can be submitted for review by the local  reader for enrollment criteria. If deemed 
interpre table, the subject would not need to complete the sc reening florbetapir F 
18 PET scan.  
• For women of childbearing potential , a neg ative pregnancy test must be 
obtained within 24 hours prior to injection; If screening serum pregnancy 
test obtained within 24 hours prior to injection, the pregnancy test need 
not be repeated.  
• Height and body weight will be measured prior to injection.  
• A phy
sician or licens ed/credentialed medical professional (that is, a PET 
technologist, imaging center nurse, or a regional equivalent) designated by 
the site principal investigato r must see the subject prior to administration 
of Florbetapir F 18 Injection to determine if they are still suitable to 
undergo the scan; 
• Vital signs will be taken ( pulse rat e, respiratory rate, supine blood 
pressure) immediately prior to injection of florbetapir F 18;  
• Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection of approximately 370 MBq (10 mCi 
) +10% of florbetapir F 18 followed by a saline flu sh. A 20-
minute c ontinuous, dynamic  PET brain scan will begin approxim ately 50 
minutes following the dose administration ; 
• A physician or licensed/credentialed medical professional (that is, a PET 
technologi
st, imaging center nurse, or a regional equivalent) designated by

 the site principal investigator will see the subject  prior to discharge from 
the imaging center to evaluate the subject’s readiness for discharge; 
• A follow-up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will 
be conducted 
between 2 or 3 business days of the imaging day, but not 
before 48 hours post- injection, to confirm subject well-being and to collect 
information about any new adverse events.  If both of these days are not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the following business 
day. 
 
7.1.2.  
18F-AV-1451 PET  Imaging Visit : Visit 2  
 
The 18F-AV-1451 PET scan should be performed at least 16 hours apart from the 
Florbetapir F 18 PET scan due to the half-life of fluorine 18. The  following 
assessments will be performed for all subjects:

techn ologist, imaging center nurs e, or a regional equivalent) desi gnate d by 
the site principa l invest igator must see the subject prior to administration 
of 18F-AV-1451 to determine if they are still suitable to undergo the scan ; 
• Vital signs will be taken in a supine position immediately prior to 
administra
tion of 18F-AV-1451 (within 30 minutes prior to injection) and 
at the completion of imaging at discharge.  
• Body weight will be measured prior to injection. 
•  Subject
s will receive a single IV bolus injection of approximately 370 
MBq (10 mCi ) 18F-AV-1451 followed by a saline flu sh. A 30 minute

 business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the following business 
day.  
7.2. Observations and Measurements  
   
Informed Consent 
 
Potential subjects  will be allowed to read a written informed consent form.  The 
principal investigator, or designee , will explain all study procedures, risks, and 
alternative therapies to the subject.  The subject will have an opportunity to have 
all questions answered.  The appropriate parties will then sign  and date the 
informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study  (see 
Section 7.5). A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the subject.   All inform
ed consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the 
appropriate I nstitutional Review Board (IRB) prior to use. 
 
Medical History  
The investigator or designee will obtain an updated history at the screening visit.  
• Relevant demographic information  
• Review
 of body systems 
• Social 
history  
• Medica
l and surgical histo ry 
• Concurre
nt medications 
Whenever pos
sible, the medical history will be confirmed by medical records. 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, supine blood pressure) will be taken at the following time points: 
• Screening Florbetapir F 18 Ima ging  
o Immedia
tely prior to injection of florbetapir F 18  
 
• 18F-AV-1451 Imaging Visit 
o Prior to the administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection 
o After the completion of imaging, prior to discharge.   
 
Height and Weight 
At both imaging visits body weight will be measured, lightly clothed.  Height will 
only be measured as part of the 18F-AV-1451 imaging visit. 
Electrocardiogram  
A resting ECG will be recorded at screening if a previous ECG performed within 
the last 12 months is not available for review.

 Pregnancy Testing  
• Serum beta hCG, qualitative:  performed at screening for females of 
childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile.  A serum pregnancy test may 
also be obtained prior to injection at the imaging visit if required by the local site.  
• Urine beta hCG: performed at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging visit and 
florbetapir F 18 imaging visit (except as specified in section 7.1.1.1) prior to 
injection f
or females of childbearing potential (defined as pre-menopausal, less 
than 2 years post- menopausal or not surgically sterile).   
 
MRI  
Electronic copies of volumetric brain MRI scans obtained as part of the site’s 
companion protocol will be submitted to Avid, or designated imaging core lab. If 
one is not available for submission to Avid or designated imaging core lab, an 
MRI may be performed under this protocol if the subject is able to tolerate one. 
The MRI sequences and acquisition parameters will be described in a separate document. 
 
Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Folste in et al., 1975) is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive 
function in elderly patients.  The instrument is divided into 2 sections.  The first 
section measures orientation, memory, and attention.  The maximum score for the first section is 21.  The s econd section tests the ability of the patient to name 
objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures.  The maximum score for the second section is 9.  The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30.   
Physician Visit 
A physician must see the subject at screening to confirm that the subject is 
appropriate for participation in the trial. A physician or licensed/creden tialed 
medical professi onal (that is, a PET techn ologist, imaging center nurs e, or a 
regional equivalent) designated by the site principa l invest igator must see the 
subject at baseline, prior to drug administration and at study end, prior to discharge from  the imaging session s. At discharge, the physician or designee 
should review all safety data and briefly examine/query the subject regarding potential adverse events or other treatment issues.   
 
7.3. Protocol  for Image Collection  
 
The sponsor will prepare and distribute imaging manuals for 18F-AV-1451 and 
florbetapir F 18 image acquisition parameters and transmission procedures prior 
to site initiation.

 7.4. Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring  
All clinical studies performed under the direction of Avid/CRO will be conducted 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Avid/CRO Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).  
This includes: 
1. IRB approval:  An investigation will be initiated at a study site only after the 
IRB fo
r that study site has given their written approval of the protocol and 
informed consent;    
2. Informed Consent:  Study procedures will not be initiated until the informed consent for
m is signed ;   
3. Recording and monitoring of adverse events as outlined in Section 7.7.3 including 
the notification of study site clinical investigators, local IRBs and 
the FDA regarding serious adverse event; 
4. Avid RP’s obligation to monitor the participating center on a regular basis; and 
5. The te
rmination of a center or the trial if conditions apply, as outlined in 
Section
 5.6. 
 
7.5. Informed Consent and Subject Information  
 Potential subjects , or their le
 gally authorized representative (as appropriate) will 
be allowed to read a written informed consent form.  The principal investigator or designee will explain all study procedures, risks, and alternative therapies.  The 
subject and legally authorized representative will have an opportunity to have all 
questions answered by a physician.  The subject will then sign and date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study.    
 
Subjects with FT D are pote
 ntially a vulnerable population with compromised 
mental capacity.  Investigators should take extra care to evaluate a patient’s 
ability to give consent.  If the subject is cap able of giving informed consent then 
the subject should sign on the consent line of the informed consent form.  When 
applicable the legally authorized representative should sign as well, indicating 
that they have witnessed the subject’s consent, and furthe r agree to participate as 
an informant. 
If the subject is not capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a legally 
authorized r
epresentative , consistent with the requirements of the State where the 
subject resides and local IRB guidance.  Subjects with the capacity to understand 
that they are engaging in a research study should affirm that they do not object to participating by signing on the Subject Assent line of the consent form.  Subjects

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 25 of 39 
 lacking the capacity to assent and/or dissent will not be  precluded from 
participation, but would not be required to sign the consent form. 
 
All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the 
appropriate
 Institutional Review Board (IRB).  No study related procedures shall 
be performed prior to completion of the informed consent process, and signing of 
the consent form.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.  
7.6. Documentation  
 
18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 PET scans will be saved in an ap propriate 
electronic format as specified in the imaging manual s.  A copy of all scans, 
including the MRI scans will be saved at the site/imaging center and a copy of each will be forwarded to the sponsor or to the designated imaging core lab as described i n the i maging manual s.  All other data required by the protocol will be 
recorded in  the eCRFs .  All data in the eCRF s will be substantiated by “source 
documents,” which consist of the subject’s medical files, laboratory result sheets, ECG tracings, etc.  All source documentation must be available to Avid, and its designees.  Completed source documents and eCRFs may need to be made available and complete for an audit by the FDA , other international regulatory 
authorities , or Avid at any time.  eCRFs and all other records must be filed in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations ( see Section 10.6). 
 
7.7. Adverse Events (A E) 
 
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be 
followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less 
stringent.  All AEs must be fully recorded on the a dverse event e CRF s. 
Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid, or its designee , their assessment 
of the potential relatedness of each AE to study drug or protocol procedure via 
electronic data entry.  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly  report to Avid, or its designee, via electronic 
data entry the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the actual event term to Avid , or its designee (for example, the complete actual term would 
be “unexpected benefit - sleeping longer”). 
 Laboratory test abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant s
hould be reported on the adverse e vent eCRFs.  Signs and symptoms of 
each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, relationship to study drug , action taken, and outcome).

 Additionally, any clinically significant findings from laboratory evaluations, vital 
sign measurements, or other study procedures  including those that result in a 
diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid, or its designee .  
 
7.7.1. Adverse Event  Monitoring  
  
Each patie
nt must be carefully monitored for adverse events.  This includes 
clinical laboratory test variables.  An assessment must be made of the 
severity/intensity and relationship to the administration of the study drug. 
 
7.7.2.  Adverse E vent Definitions  
Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
 For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre-existing conditions, trial- emergen
t adverse events and treatment -emergent adverse events.   
 Pre-existing conditions (i.e., undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that 
begin prio
r to the Screening Visit) will be recorded on the medical history 
eCRF pages. During the study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and occurrence and nature of any AEs.  Signs and symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre- existing condition (s) (started prior to dose of 
study medication) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, unless there is an increasing in frequency and severity.  Additionally, signs or 
symptoms or changes in pre- existing conditions that occur outside the tria l 
defined adverse event reporting period (e.g., between each imaging visit will 
be recorded in medical history). 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related. For the purposes 
of this study, untoward medical occurrences will be considered associated 
with the use of 18F-AV-1451, and thus be reported as adverse events, if they 
occur within 48 hours after administration of 18F-AV-1451. Untoward medical 
occurrences will b e considered associated with the use of Florbetapir F 18 
injection, if they occur within 48 hours after Florbetapir F 18 injection 
administration.  Adverse events associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451 or 
Florbetapir F 18 injection will be recorded as treatment emergent relative to 
the respective drug.  Adverse experiences that occur after administration of 
either drug but outside the 48 hour reporting window will not be reported 
unless the investigator believes they are attributable to the drug.  
Trial -emergent adverse events are undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms 
that begi
n, or worsen in intensity or frequency, after the informed consent, and

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 27 of 39 
 prior to administration of study drug at the imaging visit.  In order to capture 
possible adverse effects of  trial participation, trial -emergent AEs will also be 
reported during the baseline imaging period but not during the 48 hour 
windows following the administration of 18F-AV-1451 or Florbetapir. These 
will be recorded on the adverse event pages.  
The end of study, for the purpose of adverse event reporting, is defined as 48 
hours aft
er the  last study drug administration.  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
A SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initia
l or prolonged inpatient hospitalization (other than that required by 
protocol; “
social hospitalization” or any hospitalization for non- medical 
reasons does not constitute a SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying ); 
• Pers
istent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenit
al anomaly/birth defect; 
• Consider
ed significant by the investigator for any other reason. 
                                          
Importa
nt medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatenin g, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
  
Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse event that occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the current IB. 
 
Relationship to Study Drug  
 Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedne
ss of each adverse event to protocol procedure or study drug.  The 
assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  
Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event 
 
LY3191748
Protocol 18F-AV-1451-A19: “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Subjects with 
Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 28 of 39 
 In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the study drug  
to adverse events, an assessment is required, in order to determine the 
intensity (severity) of the event.   The following classifications should be used:  Mild:   
A mild adver
se event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and 
generally not interfering with normal activities.  
 Moderate :   
A moder
ate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently 
discomforting to interfere with normal activities.  
 Severe:   
A severe ad
verse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and 
prevents normal activities.   Note tha t a severe event is not necessarily a 
serious event; nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
 
7.7.3. Adverse Ev ent Documentation  
 
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the adverse even t eCRFs .  
Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject file.  Laboratory 
tests, vital signs and ECG abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be 
clinically relevant should be reported on the adverse event eCRF s.  Signs and 
symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop da tes, 
severity/intensity, relationship to study drug , action taken, and outcome).  
 
Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of a 
serious adve
rse event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse 
Event Reporting Form.  
 
 
7.7.4. Reportin g of Serious Adverse Events  
 
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly , or its desi gnee, of any SAE within 24 
hours of their awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method.  Alerts 
issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on study- specific SAE forms.  
 Serious adverse events occurring after a subject receives a dose of study drug will be co
llected in the eCRF as Adverse Events until 48 hours after the  
dosing of the study drug, regardless of the investigator’s opinion of causation.   Thereaft 
er, SAEs are not required to be reported in the eCRF  as Adverse

 Events unless the investigator feels the events were related to either 
investigational product or drug delivery system, or a protocol procedure If the investigator does not feel the event was related to the investigational product or drug delivery system or protocol procedure, then the event should be recorded in the eCRF  as Medical History for the subject . Regardless of the 
investigator’s assessment of relatedness or timing, all SAEs that occur after the subject receives the investigational product should be submitted to Lilly GPS for processing to determine applicability of any expedited reporting requirements..   If a patient experiences a SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving s
tudy drug, the event will NOT be reported unless the investigator 
feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.  
8. STATIST ICAL ANALYSIS  
 
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. 
The study data collected under  companion proto col such as  but not limited to  
subjects’ demographic and baseline characteristics, history taking, neurological and 
behavioral evaluations, and MRI will be transferred to Avid for analysis purposes. 
Amyloid scans used for review of enrollment criteria will also be transferred to Avid 
if applicable.  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard devi
ation [SD], median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum) for continuous 
variables and using frequency count and percentage for discrete variables.  T he 
demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for all subjects in 
the safety population according to clinical group.  Safety data will be summarized for 
all patients.  
Subject listings of all data from the eCRFs as well as any derived variables will be 
presented. 
 
8.1.1. Sample S ize Estimation  
This study will enroll up to 25 subjects.  This sample size was chosen in order to 
allow for qua
litative and descriptive review of 18F-AV-1451 PET binding in subjects 
with clinically defined FTD.   Based on prior studies, 10- 15 cases are typically 
LY3191748

Frontotemporal Dementia”  
Versi on 05MAY 16 FIN A L Page 30 of 39 sufficient for preliminary exploratory analysis.    The s a mple size for this study is 
slightly larger to accommodate the heterogeneous pathology that underlies 
FTD.    Results of the exploratory analysis from this study will permit planning of 
subsequent, hypothesis-driven studies. 
8.1.2. Population s for Analysis 
The efficacy population will include all patients for whom image data are available.   All analy
ses involving tau imaging outcomes will be based on the efficacy 
population. Safety population will include all patients that received at least one dose 
of 18F-AV-1451 compound or Florbetapir F 18. Safety evaluation will be based on 
safety population.  
8.2. Analyses 
8.2.1. Efficacy Analyses 
18F-AV-1451 images will be evaluated  both by qualitative visual analysis and by 
regional SUVr.   Descriptive statistics will be applied to describe the distribution of tau deposition as measured by 
18F-AV-1451 across clinical diagnosis groups and by 
florbetapir PET quantitation. Mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum values will be provided for continuous variables and counts and 
percentages will be provided for categorical variables.  
Details of analyses will be provided in statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . 
8.2.2. Safety Analyses 
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of 
number and perc
entage of patients experiencing an AE. The AEs will be summarized 
by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. Adverse events will also be presented by 
severity, relationship to treatment, and seriousness. All patients who experience SAEs, or who discontinue due to AEs, will be summarized.  
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION
 Avid adheres to the Pharm aceutical R esearch and  Manufacturers of  America 
(PhRMA) Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical 
Trial Results.  A complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can 
also be found at the PhRMA w ebsite (http://www.phrma.org ).  Avid’s policy is 
briefly s ummarized be low: 
•We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled clinical
trials, regardless of outcome.
LY3191748

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 31 of 39 
 • As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or decline 
publication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient to 
allow meaningful interpretation.  Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss the 
study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion, and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensus regarding the potential merits of publication.  
• Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts before 
the
y are submitted for publication. Where differences of opinion or interpretation 
exist regarding data planned for publication, the parties (Avid and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific debate.  Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.  
• Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate 
recogni
tion as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.  
This is a multi- center s tudy . The primary analysis will include data from all 
centers.  A multicenter publication, reporting the primary analysis data set, with 
authorship from all contributing centers, should precede any other publications. 
10.    INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Practice 
regulations; this may include an inspection by Avid and/or Health Authority representatives (FDA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.  
10.1.  Institutional Review Board (IRB)   
 
The intent of the research program, the trial protocol, the patient 
informati
on/informed consent form and any advertising material used to recruit 
subjects must be submitted to the clinical investigator’s local IRB and its approval must be obtained prior to its use.  A copy of the approval must be forwarded to 
Avid.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Avid. 
 
10.2.  Informed  Consent  
 
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient.  A copy 
of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.  A copy of the local IRB’s approved version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid, or its designee, for review prior to being used to obtain patient 
consent.

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 32 of 39 
 10.3.  Protocol Adherence  
  
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed 
exactly.  Where a deviation occurs, it must be documented, the sponsor/monitor 
informed, and a course of action agreed upon.  
10.4.  Documents Necess ary for Initiation of the Trial  
Avid must be provided with the following documents prior to the enrollment of any subjects:  
• Original signed and dated Statement of Agreement page; • Copy of the IRB and radiation safety committee approval ( if applica
 ble); 
• Copy of the IRB stamped approved consent form; • Name and location of the laboratory utilized for laboratory assays, and 
other fa 
cilities conducting tests, including laboratory certification number 
and date of certification if available;  
• List of reference range laboratory values; and  
• Any a
dditional licenses required in order to order to use 18F-AV-1451 or 
Florbetapir F 18. 
 
10.5. Study Drug  Control  
The receipt of clinical supplies ( e.g. starting material for 18F-AV-1451) must be 
documented at the site .   
 All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times durin
g the trial.   18F-AV-1451 Injection s and Florbetapir F 18 Injection 
should be prepared by a qualified PET manufacturing site and administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s supervision.  An up- to-date drug 
inventory/dispensing record must be maintained and all drug supplies must be justified .  After completion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies mu st be 
returned to the sponsor, or their representative.   
 
10.6. Data Collection  
 
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs ) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient 
files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to patient’s medical records and laboratory test results.  The files should include information such as visit dates, records of medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate.  These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the eCRFs must be backed up by source data.  Original electronic v ersions of imaging 
studies are also considered source data and should be kept on file by the site/imaging center , and appropriate copies should be forwarded to Avid , or a 
designated Imaging  Core Lab , as specified in the Imaging Manual.

Frontotemporal Dementia”    
 
Versi on 05MAY 16 FINAL   Page 33 of 39 
  
Each patient’s so urce fil e should include an original signed informed consent 
form.  When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on 
file with other trial related records.  
 All original laboratory reports must be available for review in each patient’s file.  It is impor
tant that the original reports be available for review because of the 
possibility of inaccuracies or errors in transcribing data from original records to the eCRF.  
 
The eCRFs must be kept in order and up- to-date so 
 that they always re flect the 
latest observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The eCRFs must 
be completed for each patient enrolled in the trial and signed by the investigator.  This should be done as soon as possible after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor will verify the source data for all information 
on the eCRF. 
 
10.7. Adverse Events  
 All adverse events encountered during the clinical trial must be documented on the eCRF, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 Eli Lilly and Company mus
 t be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in 
all cases within 24 hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered serious. Eli Lilly and Com pany m ust be notified immediately 
of any findings with the use of the drug that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug.  The investigator will be requested to complete a separate report form in addition to the information on the eCRF.  See section 7.7.4 for reporting
 serious adverse events 
 If a SAE i
s determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by 
Avid), and study drug- related, Eli Lilly and Co. w ill notify the investigator in 
writing.  The investigator should forward this notification to the IRB within 24 hours of receipt. 
 
10.8. Records Retention  
 
All co rrespondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should 
be kept in appr
opriate file folders.  Records of subjects, source documents, and 
drug inventory sheets pertaining to the trial must be kept on file.  Records must be 
retained until the date a marketing ap plication (NDA) is approved for the drug for 
the indication for which it is being investigated, or until 2 years following the date 
of clinical trial termination or completion, whichever is later.   If no application is

 to be filed , or if the application is not approved for such indication, records should 
be kept until 2 years following the date of clinical trial termination or completion.  
 
If an investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibil
ity for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person 
who will accept the responsibility.  Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed 
upon by Avid.

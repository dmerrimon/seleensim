1.1. Primary Objective   
The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of ultrasound elastography in evaluation 
of thyroid nodules . Elastography is a non -invasive method in which stiffness or strain images 
of soft tissues are used to characterize a nodule or mass lesions. Tissue that is more stiff is 
thought to have a greater risk of malignancy.  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives   
 No secondary o bjective.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Study Disease  
Patients with thyroid nodules will be studied .  
 
2.2. Study Agent /Device /Imaging procedure  
 
Patients are not given a treatment or imaging agent. They are having a procedure - an 
Elastography  Ultrasound (experimental) as well as a standard of care ultrasound .  
 
 
2.3. Clinicaltrials.gov  
This investigation  does not require an Investigati onal New Drug application (IND) . 
 
2.4. Rationale  
 
Thyroid nodules are extremely common, affecting nearly half of the  adult population. 
Although extremely common, a minority, between 1.5  – 10% of thyroid nodules, are 
malignant. [1] Differentiation between  benign and malignant nodules however, based on 
phys ical examination  and ultrasound imaging is very difficult and generally is referred 
for invasive percutaneous biopsy or surgical excision for definitive  diagnosis.   
 
Because of the very common occurrence of thyroid nodules in the  general public, there is a  
great need for a noninvasive means of  stratifying those who are at greater risk of 
malignancy from those who  are more likely to harbor a benign nodule for which no treatment 
is necessary.   
 
Recent studies have examined elastography in thyroid nodules with  findings of high 
sensitivity and good specificity. [2] Other  investigators have looked at elastography in 
evaluation of other   [3] [4]  It is thought that lesions that are stiffer are more likely to  represent 
malignancy or other pathology than benign or no rmal tissue  which tend to be more softer.   
 
Elastography is a noninvasive ultrasound technology which can evaluate  the stiffness of a 
lesion compared to the background tissue. There are two major methods of measuring 
stiffness: strain imaging, and shear wave velocity measurement. In strain imaging, 
ultrasound maps the relative tissue deformity by extrinsic compression and provides a color 
map. Greater deformation with pr essure corresponds to more elastic tissue and less 
deformation corresponds to stiffer tissue. In the second method, shear waves are sent 
through a given volume of tissue and the speed of the shear wave propagation is measured. 
Since stiffer tissues have hi gher shear wave velocities, this can be correlated with tissue

Version # 1, Date  04/03/2017  Page 7 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  stiffness to provide a more quantative measurement. Velocities can then be used to 
calculate Young modulus in kPa. [5] 
 
Most shear wave elastography measurements  currently available  use a singl e point 
measurement; however, a new 2 -D shear wave elastography measurement technique will 
be used in our study to measure  stiffness of thyroid nodules. This will allow sampling of a 
larger area of a nodule instead of just one point, which may be more representative of the 
nodule’s overall stiffness.  
 
 
 
2.5. Preliminary results  
Preliminary results show that the stiffness or elast ography values of malignant nodules tend to be 
greater than benign thyroid nodules.  
 
2.6. Study Design  
• Single Group  
 
• There will be one intervention arm  
 
• The study will be open: no masking is used  
 
• The study is not randomized

4. IMAGING AGENT /DEVICE /PROCEDURE  INFORMATION  
 
4.1. Name of Study Agent /Device/Imaging Procedure  
 
No imaging agent will be used in this study.  
 
• The examination will consist of an ultrasound elastography assessment in which an 
ultrasound machine is used to evaluate elastography measurements of a thyroid 
nodule.  
• Each patient will undergo one ultrasound elastography assessment of the thyroid 
prior to either fine needle aspiration or surgical re section of the thyroid nodule 
(invasive procedure is not part of the study)  
• No radiation will be used for this examination. Ultrasound is an imaging modality that 
uses sound waves, not radiation in imaging.  
• Ultrasound machines are FDA approved.  
 
 
5. STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Criteria for Removal from Study  
After patient has ultrasound elastography of the thyroid nodule, they will have completed the

Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each 
Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed 
Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure s, and related to the investigation . 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution  and 30 days after the last 
dose of the study treatment.  
 
8. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1. Institutional Review of Protocol  
 
 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved 
by the Stanford IRB  and Scientific Review Committee (SRC) .  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB and SRC prior 
to implementation.  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment 
information to all participating investigators.  
 
8.2. Data Ma nagement Plan  
Data will be stored in Oncore and REDCap. Other data will be stored on a password 
protected and encrypted computer or on a HIPAA compliant server through Stanford, BOX.  
 
8.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
During the clinical investigation, the  Protocol Director will evaluate the progress of the trial, 
including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, 
accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study 
outcome.  
 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will audit 
study  related activities at least annually in accordance with the DSMC SOP to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard  
operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may 
include review of regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source 
documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events a nd protocol 
deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results 
of DSMC audit s will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities 
at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

9.1. Primary and Secondary Outcome measures  
Elastography shear wave velocity measurements of thyro id nodules will be compared to fine 
needle aspiration biopsy results or surgical pathologic specimens, if available .  
No secondary outcome measurements will be made.  
 
 
9.2. Measurement  methods      
Elastography shear wave velocity measurements of thyroid nodules (which are calculated 
by the ultrasound machine at the time of the elastography measurements) will be compared 
to fine needle aspiration biopsy results or surgical pathologic specimens, if applicable.  
 
9.3. Measurement Time Points  
Elastography shear wave velocity measurements of thyroid nodules will be compared to fine 
needle      aspiration biopsy results or surgical pathologic specimens, if applicable. No 
follow -up imaging or assessment will be required.  
 
9.4. Response Review  
No response review is planned.  
 
9.5. Secondary Outcome  
There is no secondary outcome.  
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  Statistical Design  
This is a prospective single arm blinded study in which patients who come for biopsy or 
surgical resection will be analyzed with elastography prior to biopsy or surgical resection. A 
sample size of 10 vs 43 provide 80% power for detecting a difference of 0.84 m/sec  at the 
significance level of 0.05 based on Wilcoxon rank sum test assuming that the sound velocity 
for benign (and malignant nodules) follows a Gaussian distribution ).  The standard deviation 
is 0.79  meters/second based on the observed standard deviation from our pilot data.  
 
We propose to use Wilcoxon rank sum test for its robustness in cases where the velocity does 
not follow the Gaussian distribution. Even if the Gaussian assumption is true, the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test is almost as powerful as the param etric t -test.  
 
Randomization  
Patients are not randomized in this study.  
 
10.2.  Interim analyses  
There will not be a statistical stopping rule. Every three months, the data collected will be 
analyzed and a record of the monitoring activities wil be maintained by  the study team.  
 
10.3.  Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis  
 The distribution of the elastography measurements will be summarized by mean and 
standard deviation. If the distribution is highly non -Gaussian, then median and other 
quantiles  will be provided as well.  The summaries will be provided by malignancy status.   
 
10.4.  Primary Analysis   
The primary analysis will be a comparison of tissue stiffness measured by the sound 
Protocol Document Template for Cancer Imaging Trials   Version 2  
 
Version # 1, Date  04/03/2017  Page 12 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  velocity between malignant and benign nodules.  To this end, the two -sided two sample 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used and the statistical significance level is 0.05.  
 
10.4.1.  Analysis Population  
                        Analysis population is 53 patients expected to consist of 10 cancer patients and 
43 non -cancer patients.  
 
 
10.4.2.  Analysis Plan  
Appropriate summary statistics will be provided for the sound velocity by the malignancy 
status.  two-sided two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare of tissue 
stiffness measured by the sound velocity between malignant and benign nodules

10.8.  Criteria for future studies  
 If current study yields promising results, a larger study may be performed with utilization of 
other types of ultrasound elastography measurements. Since elastography measurements may 
vary between ultrasound machines  as well as different elastography techn iques, it will be 
important to understand which technique yields the most reliable and consistent results.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  
 
You are invited to participate in a research study of ultrasound elastography  of thyroid 
nodules .  We hope to learn whether elastography is an effective technique for imaging 
nodules in the thyroid . You were selected as a possible participant in thi s study because 
you have a thyroid nodule that will be biopsied.    
 
This research study is looking for 50 patients with thyroid nodules being seen at 
Stanford University Hospital Department of Radiology for a thyroid biopsy. Stanford 
University expects to enroll 50 research study participants.

Your participati on in this study is entirely voluntary.  Your decision  not to participate will 
not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  If you wish to participate in 
this study, you must sign this form. You can decide to participate now, but withdraw 
your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical 
care to which you are entitled.  
 
If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify Dr. Aya 
Kamaya at xxx-xxx-xxxx. 
 
DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT  
 
Your participation in t his research study is expected to take approximately 1 5 minutes, 
with screening of each participant taking approximately 5 minutes, and elastography  
imaging taking less than 10 minutes. The duration of the entire study is expected to 
take approximately three years, including time for data analysis.  
 
PROCEDURES  
 
If you choose to participate, Dr. Kamaya or a designated representative  from her 
research s tudy staff will describe the procedure to you before perform ing an ultrasound 
elastography study o f your thyroid .  
 
Though ultrasound has been used routinely in hospitals for decades, we are studying 
the effectiveness of ultrasound elastography, which is a n experimental imaging study. 
The ultrasound elastography imaging study will take less than 10 minutes, and will 
involve using a special ultrasound machine with elastography capabilities.  Elastography 
measurements will be obtained, which measures the degr ee of compressibility of the 
thyroid nodule compared to background thyroid tissue.  There is no ionizing radiation 
involved with elastography and there is no known side effect of elastography imaging.

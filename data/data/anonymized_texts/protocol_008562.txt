Title of Study: A Phase 2, Randomized, Open Label, Multiple -Dose, Comparator, Parallel -
Group, Safety and Tolerance Study of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray (0.5 mg TID) versus 
Standard of Care Post -Operative Narcotic Therap y for the Treatment of Post -Operative Pain  
Study center(s):  2 
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: Q3 2017  
Estimated date last patient completed: Q4 2017  Phase of development:  
Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability based on the incidence of adverse experi ences of 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray  (0.5 mg three times daily  [TID]) compared with standard 
post-operative narcotic therapy in subjects with postoperative pain . Standard post -operative 
narcotic therapy is defined as Morphine Intravenous Injection  (IV) ( 4 mg TID ) followed by 
Oxycodone  Hydrochloride Tablet  (10 mg TID ). 
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 2, randomized (stratified according to surgery and postoperative nausea and 
vomiting risk factors), open label, multiple -dose, comparator controlled, parallel -group, study 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray (0.5 mg TID) 
versus standard  postoperative narcotic thera py in subjects with postoperative pain. Standard 
postoperative narcotic therapy is defined as Morphine IV (4 mg TID ) for 24 hours  followed 
by Oxycodone Hydrochloride Tablet  (10 mg TID ). 
The stu dy will comprise four periods:  Screening Period (Days -28 to -1), Surgical Period 
(Day 1), Treatment Period (Days 1  to 4 Inpatient / Days 4 to 7 Outpatient ), and Follow -up 
Period (Day 8 , +2 day window ). 
Subjects will be admitted to the study site on the morning of the scheduled surgery (Day 1), 
will remain at the study site until Postoperative Day 4 (a total of 3 nights at the study site)  
then be  evaluated t o participate in the outpatient  setting and meet  criteria in order to proceed 
to the outpatient treatment period  Days 4 to 7, and will return  to the clinic  for the Follow -up 
Visit on Day 8  (+2 day window) . 
Screening Period:  Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible 
for enrollment. After providing written Informed Consent, subjects will undergo study 
specific screening procedures, including a review of inclusion and exclusion, demographics, 
medi cal history, concomitant medication use, assessment of postoperative nausea and

    vomiting (PONV) risk factors, physical  and oral  cavity examination, baseline laboratory 
testing, alcohol breath test, urine drug screening, HIV and hepatitis screening, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and pregnancy testing. Eligible subjects will complete all 
screening procedures within 28 days before the surgery (Days -28 to -1). 
Surgical  Period:  On Day 1, anesthesia will be established using standardized techniques, as 
appropriate, for each surgical procedure. The surgical procedures will be bunionectomy, 
breast augmentation, and abdominoplasty. For nausea prophylaxis, all subjects will receive a 
uniform stan dard of care regimen which includes the following: 10 mg of dex amethasone at 
induction and 8 mg of ondansetron near the end of surgery.  Vitals, pulse oximetry , and  ECG 
measurements will be taken. Concomitant medications and Adverse Events  will be recorded.  
Post surg ury and prior to randomization, subjects may be treated with intravenous morphine 
and or fentanyl for post-surgical  analgesia (dose and frequency per the discretion of the 
investigator).  
Treatment Period :  Within 4 hours after surgery , subjects who meet the post-surgical 
eligibility requirements will be randomized to treatment  (see Post-surgical  Eligibility 
Requirements ). 
After meeting post-surgical  eligibility requirements and subsequently being randomized to 
treatment, subjects may receive their first dose of investigational drug any time between 0 -4 
hours after surgery. The first dose does not need to be immediately administered after 
meeting post -surgical eligibility requirements . 
During the Treatment Period, approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 
treatment groups: Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray 0.5 mg TID, or standard of care 
postoperative narcotic therapy. Randomization w ill be stratified according to surgical 
procedure and  baseline  PONV risk factors.  Vitals, pulse oximetry, and ECG measurements 
will be taken. Concomitant medications and Adverse Events  will be recorded.  
Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously after surgery as a safety measure. An 
electrocardiogram (ECG) will be conducted after surgery but before the first dose of the 
study drug and serve as a baseline for comparison to subsequent tracings. The time of 
administration of the first dose of study drug wi ll be defined as Time 0. During confinement, 
study drug will be administered by site staff to ensure appropriate dosing of study 
medication. Subjects should not have anything orally except room -temperature water within 
15 minutes of each dose. The inpatien t Treatment Period will continue through 72 hours after 
Time 0. Additional ECGs will be performed at 90 minutes, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48  hours and 
72 hours after Time 0.  
Rescue for inadequate analgesic response:   
During confinement to the study center durin g the first 72 hours (Days 1 -4), subjects 
requiring rescue medication for pain will be provided with acetaminophen 1000 mg every six 
hours and/or ketorolac 30 mg every six hours , as needed. On outpatient days 4 -7, ketorolac 
will not be available to study s ubjects (because it is intravenous).  Therefore, subjects will be

    provided with acetaminophen, and will be advised to take acetaminophen 1000 mg every six 
hours as needed for rescue analgesia.   
Rescue for postoperative nausea:  During confinement to the st udy center during the first 72 
hours (Day 1 -4), subjects requiring rescue medication for nausea will be provided with 
Zofran 4 mg IV per the discretion of the clinician. On outpatient days 4 -7 subjects will be 
provided  Zofran ODT (oral dissolvable tablet) to be taken as needed  for postoperative 
nausea .  
Subjects whose pain or nausea cannot be adequately managed (in the investigator’s opinion) 
by a combination of study drug and rescue medication or who develop unacceptab le side 
effects during the study will be discontinued from further study participation. Their pain or 
nausea will be managed according to usual standard of care at the investigator’s discretion.  
Site staff will train subjects on how to self -administer stud y drug. Investigators will 
determine if patients are able to proceed with the outpatient treatment period. Before 
discharge from the study site on Day 4, site personnel will dispense rescue medication and 
will train subjects on how to administer the study drug, educate patients on the signs and 
symptoms of Adverse Events , and observe subjects self -administer medication. After  
discharge, study drug will be administered by subjects  at home according to the directions 
provided by study staff . Study personnel will dispense outpatient diary , study drug, rescue 
pain and nausea medication . Subjects will also be instructed to return the outpatient diary to 
study personnel at the Follow up Visit 8 + 2 days after surgery.                  
Follow -up V isit on Day 8  (+2 day window) : Subjects will be instructed to return any 
unused outpatient study drug to  study personnel. Vitals, pulse oximetry, and ECG will be 
measured. Concomitant medications and Adverse Events  will be recorded.  
Subject outpatient diary will be collected and reviewed by study staff.  
Number of patients (planned):  Approximately 100 subjects (50 subjects assigned to 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray and 50 subjects assigned to standard post -operative pain 
management) will be enrolled.

    Criteria for safety evaluation : 
Primary Safety End point 
 Incidence of Treatment  Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)  
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints:   
 Proportion of subjects using rescue medication for nausea  
 Time to first use of rescue medication for nausea following each dose of the 
investigational product (IP)  
 Total use of rescue medication for nausea over 0 to 8 hours, 0 to 24 hours, over 0 to 
48 hours, over 0 -72 hours and 0 -7 days  
 Pulse oximetry recorded prior to study drug administration  
 ECGs at 90 minutes, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours  
 Oral Examinations  
 
Statistical methods:  
Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size estimate has been completed.  However, a sample size of 50 subjects 
per treatment group is considered  sufficient to demonstrate that the incidence of nausea and 
vomiting associated with buprenorphine is consistent with that of standard post -operative 
narcotic therapy.  
Analysis Populations  
Statistical analysis will be done on the safety population, which will include all subjects who 
are treated with the study drug. The safety population is the population for all safety 
assessments.  
Safety Analyses  
Data listings will be provided for protocol specified safety data. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Acti vities (MedDRA; Version 19.0 or higher) will be used to classify all AEs 
with respect to system organ class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include 
only TEAEs, which will be summarized for each treatment group.  
 
Statistical analyses will b e performed using  SAS® 
Clinical laboratory and v ital signs results and changes from baseline will be summarized at 
each time point.  
Incidence of abnormal ECG and PE findings will be summarized by treatment group.  Any 
clinically significant findings will b e recorded as AEs.

    1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
The majority of patients who undergo surgical procedures are likely to ex perience post-operative 
pa
in. Furthermore, 75% of those patients report the pain as moderate, severe or extreme ( 1). 
The
se patients require effective postoperative pain control in order to provide comfort, earlier 
mobilization, faster recovery, and decreased likelihood of post-operative complications. 
Traditionally, acute post-operative pain management has relied on opioid medications to target 
central mechanisms involved in the perception of pain. Opioids bind to receptors in the central 
nervous system and peripheral tissues and modulate the effect of the nociceptors. They can be 
administered via oral, transdermal, parenteral, neuraxial, and rectal routes. Morphine is the 
standa
rd choice for opiates and is widely used for acute post-operative pain. However, morphine 
ha
s significant amount of first-pass metabolism in the liver with only around 40 to 50% of the 
amount absorbed actually reaching the nervous system ( 2). Most of the morphine is processed in 
the kidne
ys and eliminated from the body in urine.  Oxycodone, another opioid agonist, is  being 
wide
ly used to alleviate moderate- to-severe pain but even then its bioavailability is 67–80% ( 3). 
I
t would be beneficial to manage patients’ post-operative pain effectively with opioids through a 
route
 that by-passes liver metabolism and is feasible in the ambulatory setting. An option would 
be the sublingual route which allows drug to diffuse to the blood through the tissues under the 
tongue and avoiding the first pass effect by the liver.  
B
uprenorphine is currently approved by the FDA to be administered as a transdermal patch or a 
buccal film to treat chronic pain. Buprenorphine binds to mu-receptors with high affinity but less 
int
rinsic activity compared to full opioid agonists. Because of its partial agonist features, the 
efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine are thought to plateau at higher doses. Past 
research suggests that buprenorphine may show a respiratory depression “ceiling effect” where 
analgesic efficacy continues to escalate at higher doses, but respiratory depression does not. 
Dahan et al. (4) found that when tested over a dose range, buprenorphine demonstrated a ceiling 
e
ffect for respiratory depression but not for analgesia. In a separate study, Dahan et al. (5) found 
that the ceiling effect shown for buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression was not 
demonstrated for the full μ-agonist opioid fentanyl.  In addition, buprenorphine dissociates from 
the mu-receptor very slowly, which likely accounts for its longer duration of action than 
morphine, and its low level of manifested physical dependence. Actions at kappa-receptors, 
where buprenorphine is an antagonist, are believed to produce alterations in the perception of 
pain and the emotional response to pain. 
It is postulated that using buprenorphine for acute pain relief through the sublingual spray route 
may have multiple benefits over full opioids such as less constipation, milder withdrawal and 
less abuse potential, better efficacy in older population, and treatment in a broad range of pain 
types. In addition, its use through sublingual is advantageous over oral administration such that 
the effect is more direct and faster ( 6). 
The
 proposed study will evaluate the safety with the administration of buprenorphine delivered 
as a sublingual spray for post-operative pain.

Version 1.0 02Aug2017                            CONFIDENTIAL                                                        17  
     
1.2. Clinical Experience 
The drug being investigated in this study is the sublingual preparation spray of buprenorphine. 
B
uprenorphine has been shown to be safe and effective in its currently marketed oral forms: 
tablet (Subutex®) and buccal film (Belbuca™) (www.accesseddata.fda.gov). Subutex® 
sublingual tablets have been studied in 1834 patients and Belbuca™ has been evaluated in three 
12-week double- blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in opioid- na ��� n d opioid-experienced 
patients with moderate- to-severe chronic low back pain. Two of the 3 studies showed efficacy in 
lower back pain. 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray has been studied in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, multiple-dose, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (Study INS005-15-062) to 
e
valuate the safety and efficacy of 3 dosing regimens (0.5 mg, 0.25 mg, or 0.125 mg 3 times 
da
ily [TID]) in subjects with moderate to severe pain after bunionectomy). In summary, the 
stud
y demonstrated that the Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray given TID at doses of 0.125 mg, 
0.25 mg, or 0.5 mg had significantly higher efficacy than a placebo spray over 48 hours after the 
start of dosing as measured using the primary endpoint of SPID-48 score in subjects with acute 
pain following bunionectomy surgery. Overall, all doses of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray 
evaluated in this study were safe and generally well tolerated. 
1.3. Dose Selection Rationale 
In study INS005-15-062, Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray 0.5 mg TID demonstrated the largest 
re
duction in pain as assessed by SPID-48 and was statistically significant to placebo (p<0.0001).  
The 0.25 mg tid and 0.125 mg tid doses also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 
SPID-48 (p = 0.0108 and p = 0.0120, respectively).  Because all treatments were generally well 
tol
erated, the 0.5 mg TID dose is being studied. 
1.4. Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
There are no anticipated benefits of participation. 
The potentials risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray and the risks of medical evaluation, including venipuncture. 
Adverse Events common with buprenorphine are constipation, dizziness, headache, nausea, 
sweating, and vomiting. Severe side effects that may occur with buprenorphine include rash, 
hives, itching, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or 
tongue, anxiety or nervousness, dark urine, fast or irregular heartbeat, mental or mood changes, 
pale stools, pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, slow or shallow breathing, unusual 
weakness, vision changes, yellowing of eyes or skin. Safety monitoring will occur during the in-
clinic period of the study. All subjects will be actively monitored with pulse-oximetry (SpO2) 
and ECG after surgery. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of Buprenorphine 
Sublingual Spray is provided in the current version of the investigator’s brochure. The

4. S ubjects must not have surgical complications that could compromise safety of the 
subject or confound the results of the study.   
3.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment 
Subjects are free to terminate their participation in the study at any time and for any reason. 
Likewise, a subject may be terminated from the study by the Investigator if the Investigator 
determines that it is not the subject’s best interest to continue participation. The Investigator has 
the r
ight to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for an effect that is intolerable or 
otherwise unacceptable to the subjects, for intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, 
nonc
ompliance with study procedures, administrative reasons, or in the investigator’s opinion to 
protect the patient’s best interest. Subjects may be considered terminated if they state an 
int
ention to terminate, or fail to comply or return for assessments/ visits, or become lost to follow 
up for any other reason.  If early termination occurs for any reason, the Investigator must 
determine the primary reason for a subject’s early termination from the study and this 
information must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. Subjects will be required to return on Day 7 
if e
arly termination occurs and they do not withdraw consent. 
Subjects whose pain or nausea cannot be adequately managed in the Investigator’s opinion by a 
combination of study drug and rescue medication will be discontinued from further study 
participation. Their pain or nausea will be managed according to usual standard of care at the 
I
nvestigator’s discretion. In addition, subjects who develop unacceptable side effects during the 
stud
y will be discontinued from further study participation. 
The Investigator must document early or other termination for randomization and drug 
reconciliation purposes. 
3.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
There will be no dose adjustments for IP and the reference drug s.

    4. TREATMENTS 
4.1. Treatments Administered 
Eligible subjects meeting all study entry criteria will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one 
of the following treatments: Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray (1 x 0.5 mg TID; total of 21 
doses); or reference drugs Morphine Intravenous Injection (1 x 4 mg TID for 24 hours; total of 3 
doses) followed by Oxycodone Hydrochloride Tablet (1 x 10 mg TID; total of 18 doses). 
4.2. Identity of Investigational Product  
The drug is formulated as a sublingual spray. The product is a clear solution filled into a glass 
vial, stoppe
red and assembled within a unit-dose sublingual spray pump. Priming is not required. 
Ea
ch spray pump delivers 0.5 mg of buprenorphine.  
4.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Up to 100 subjects will be dosed in this study. The sample size is not based on statistical 
considerations. The number of subjects planned for enrollment is considered sufficient to achieve 
the study objectives.  
Randomized treatment will be assigned utilizing a computer generated randomization scheme. 
P
atients will be randomly assigned to treatment administered in a 1:1 assignment ratio according 
to the randomization scheme.  All study doses administered will be according to IWRS to ensure 
that st
udy personnel will not be aware of the next subject’s treatment assignment until the 
decision to randomize that subject has been made. Randomization will be stratified by surgical 
procedure and baseline PONV risk factors. Patients with PONV risk factors of 0-2 will be 
stra
tified as low risk and 3-4 as high risk. 
4.4. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
The buprenorphine dose was chosen based on a Phase 3 trial which showed that Buprenorphine 
0.5 mg
 Sublingual Spray TID is effective in reducing moderate- to-severe pain after 
bunionec
tomy compared to placebo and is generally well tolerated.  The reference drugs 
morphine 4 mg TID for 24 hours followed by oxycodone 10 mg TID was chosen because the 
re
gimen is accepted as standard postoperative narcotic therapy.

.5. Blinding 
This is an open-label study without treatment blinding. 
4.6. Treatment Compliance 
All subjects will receive IP at the study site under the surveillance of appropriate study personnel 
during Inpatient Treatment Days 1 to 4.  Subjects will receive IP to take home on Outpatient 
Tr
eatment Days 4 to 7 and will be instructed how to correctly dose with IP at home. The IP lot 
number
(s) will be recorded in the subject’s chart/source documents. Exposure (total dose of 
stud
y drug) for the Inpatient, Outpatient and overall treatment periods will be recorded.

in t
he subject’s source.  
4.7. Permitted and Prohibited Therapies 
4.7.1. P ermitted Therapies 
Prescription medications that in the opinion of the investigator will not potentially interact with 
bupre
norphine, morphine, oxycodone, or interfere with its respiratory effects may be permitted 
during
 the course of the study. 
4.7.2. P rohibited Therapies 
The following therapies are prohibited: 
 Anticoa gulants (e.g., heparin or warfarin). Aspirin at a daily dose of ≤325 mg is allowed 
for cardiovascular prophylaxis if the subject has been on a stable dose regimen for ≥30 
days before Screening and has not experienced any relevant medical problem. 
 Dr ugs known to be a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 within 1 week before surgery. 
 S ystemic corticosteroids (either oral or parenteral) within 1 month before Screening 
(inhaled nasal steroids and topical corticosteroids are allowed). 
 Chronic use (defined as daily use for >2 weeks) of NSAIDs, opiates, or glucocorticoids 
(except inhaled nasal steroids and topical corticosteroids) within 1 months before study 
drug administration. 
 Age nts that could affect the analgesic response (such as central alpha agents [clonidine and 
tizanidine], neuroleptic agents, and other antipsychotic agents) within 2 weeks before 
Screening. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective noradrenergic reuptake 
inhibitors are allowed if the subject has been on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before 
Screening and does not anticipate a dose change during the course of the study. 
Subjects receiving excluded therapies will be ineligible for study enrollment or for continuation 
in the study. 
Subjects should not have anything orally except room-temperature water within 15 minutes of 
e
ach dose. 
4.8. Rescue Medication 
Rescue for inadequate analgesic response during confinement to the study center during the first 
72 hours for pain will be acetaminophen 1000 mg every six hours and/or ketorolac 30 mg every 
six
 hours, as needed. On outpatient days 4-7 subjects will be provided with acetaminophen, and 
will be advised to take acetaminophen 1000 mg every six hours as needed for rescue analgesia.   
Rescue for postoperative nausea during confinement to the study center during the first 72 hours 
will be Zofran 4 mg IV per the discretion of the clinician. On outpatient days 4-7, subjects will 
be
 administered Zofran ODT (oral dissolvable tablet) to be taken as needed.  
The rescue medication and specific reason for use will need to be captured in the subject 
outpatient diaries.

6.2.9. Adver se Events and Serious Adverse Events 
6.2.9.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product.  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for AEs. Monitoring for treatment-emergent 
AEs will begin as soon as the subject is dosed. All AEs must be followed until they are resolved 
or stabilized, or until all attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted. The 
investigator should use their discretion in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the 
progr
ess of such events. 
Adverse Events reported prior to dose administration will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. 
An AE may be: 
 A ne w illness, not documented in the subject’s medical history; 
 W orsening of a concomitant illness; 
 An e ffect of the study medication; it could be an abnormal laboratory value, as well 
as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the qualified 
investigator or medical qualified designate considers to be clinically important; 
 A combination of two or more of these factors. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study 
protocol and the conditions(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history. 
6.2.9.2. Classification of Adverse Events 
Adverse Events are to be recorded on the AE page of the subject’s case report form (CRF).  
Severity will be graded according to the following definitions: 
 Mild:  The subject experiences awareness of symptoms but these are easily tolerated 
or managed without specific treatment. 
Insys Development Company, Inc.                         Protocol Number INS005-17-111  
 
Version 1.0 02Aug2017                            CONFIDENTIAL                                                        30  
     Moderate:  The subject experiences discomfort enough to cause interference with 
usual activity, and/or the condition requires specific treatment. 
 Severe:  The subject is incapacitated with inability to work or do usual activity, 
and/or the event requires significant treatment measures. 
Action taken will be categorized as none, study drug discontinued, dose modified, required 
concomitant medication, required procedure, or other. 
Event outcome at resolution or time of last follow-up will recorded as event resolved, resolved 
with s
equelae, ongoing, or death. 
6.2.9.3. Causality/Drug Relationship Assessment 
The relationship of the event to the study drug should be determined by the investigator 
according to the following criteria:  
 Definitely related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration that cannot be explained, follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the study drug, that is confirmed by improvement on stopping and 
reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could not be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant drug.  
 Probably related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
 Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but 
could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical condition, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
 Unlikely related: The event follows little or no temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or other factors 
such as the subject’s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs is a 
more likely alternative. 
 Not related:  The event is most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to 
study drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely. 
6.2.9.4. Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per 21 CFR 312.32: 
 Results in death; 
 I s life-threatening; 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;

     R esults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
 I s medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. 
Ser
ious AEs will be captured from the time of consent through the end of the study. 
6.2.9.5. Actions Taken for Serious Adverse Events 
Ac
tions taken may consist of: 
 None: No action taken 
 Tr eatment: Standard of care measures instituted 
 Dr ug withdrawn: Study medication was permanently discontinued because of the AE 
 Unknow n: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused 
6.2.9.6. Outcome at the Time of Last Observation for Serious Adverse Events 
The
 outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 R ecovered/resolved 
 R ecovered/resolved with sequelae 
 Not r ecovered/not resolved 
 De ath 
 Unknown  
6.2.9.7. Adverse Event Recording and Reporting 
Adverse Events will be recorded throughout the study in the source documents and in the CRFs. 
The investigator will rate AEs for seriousness, intensity, causality, action taken, and outcome as 
described in the previous section. 
Ex
pedited reporting is required for serious unexpected adverse drug reactions. Fatal or 
life-threatening unexpected drug reactions must be reported by the Sponsor to regulatory 
agencies no more than 7 days after the Sponsor’s first knowledge of the reaction; followed by as 
complete a report as possible within 8 additional days.  Unexpected drug reactions must be 
reported no later than 15 days after the Sponsor’s first knowledge of the reaction. In order to 
comply with these requirements, the investigator or delegate must inform the Sponsor 
immediately upon occurrence of any SAE. The site will complete the SAE Report Form as 
thoroughly as possible and email/fax it to Insys Development Company within 24 hours of the 
investi
gators first knowledge of the event.

    6.2.9.9. Special Considerations 
Pregnancy 
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the 
need to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation. Women should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff 
immediately if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted before IP administration on every woman of childbearing 
potential. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the Screening Visit will be excluded from the 
study and considered to be a screening failure. 
If a subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must report the pregnancy within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. The investigator should contact the designated individual(s) who 
receive SAE notification and record information related to the pregnancy on the designated form. 
The investigator is responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. These 
findings must be reported on the designated form and forwarded to the designated individual(s). 
The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital 
anomaly. 
Subjects who become pregnant during the course of the study will be followed to collect data on 
lactating women and health of the child (for births) or until termination of the pregnancy. 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES

specifically including, but not limited to, those defined by GCP as essential until the following 
occur: 
 At lea st 2 years after the last marketing authorization for the Investigational Product 
has been approved or the sponsor has discontinued its research with the 
Investigational Product, or 
 At lea st 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the Investigational Product 
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s) or if needed by the sponsor. 
9.6.2. L aboratory Sample Retention 
Laboratory samples may be used for purposes related to this research. The samples will be stored 
until the sponsor has determined that specimens are no longer needed and the decision has been 
made that none of the samples needs to be reanalyzed. In addition, identifiable samples can be 
destroyed at any time at the request of the subject. 
10. QUALITY CONTROL A ND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The sponsor or its designee will implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance 
procedures with written standard operating procedures to ensure the study is conducted and data 
are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable 
regulatory requirements. This trial will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Declaration of Helsinki (October 1996) and all revisions thereof, and in accordance with the 
FDA CFR 312.50 and 312.56, and with the ICH guidelines on GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95). 
10.1. Changes To The Protocol 
Only Insys Development Company may modify the protocol. Amendments to the protocol will 
be made only after consultation and agreement between the sponsor and the investigator. The 
only exception is when the investigator assesses a subject’s safety will be compromised without 
immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IEC/IRB 
must be sought, and the investigator should inform the sponsor and the full IEC/IRB within 5 
working days after the emergency occurred. All amendments that have an impact on subject risk

    or the study objectives, or require revision of the informed consent form, must receive approval 
from the IEC/IRB prior to their implementation. 
10.2. Monitoring 
The sponsor or sponsor’s representative will conduct site visits to monitor the study and ensure 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. The assigned 
clinical research associate(s) (CRA[s]) will visit the investigator and study site at periodic 
intervals and maintain periodic communication. The investigator agrees to allow the CRA(s) and 
other authorized sponsor/contract research organization (CRO) personnel access. The CRA(s) 
will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
investigator and staff. 
10.3. Data Review Meeting 
The sponsor will review all data reported in CRFs of all subjects before database lock. The data 
re
view meeting determines whether or not all enrolled subjects can be included in the analysis 
population according to the specified definition of analysis populations and evaluates whether or 
not medical decisions of the Investigator were appropriate for important data affecting the safety 
and efficacy endpoint. 
10.4. Protocol Violations  
The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol approved by the IRB. 
Modifications to the protocol should not be performed without agreement of both the 
Investigator and the sponsor. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB approval prior to 
implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects. 
The Investigator or sub-investigator should document any deviation from the protocol and the 
reason. If the Investigator performs a deviation from the protocol or a change of the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects, the record should be immediately submitted to th e 
sponsor, the CRO, and the IRB by the Investigator and the IRB will provide expedited review 
and approval. After the Investigator has obtained approval of the IRB, the Investigator should

    11. REGULATORY A ND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1. Regulatory Authority Approval 
The investigator will ensure that the protocol and consent form are reviewed and approved by the 
appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) prior to the 
start of any study procedures. The IEC/IRB will be appropriately constituted and will perform its 
functions in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, and local 
requirements as applicable. 
In addition, the IRB will approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, subject recruitment 
procedures, written information to be provided to the subjects, available safety information, 
information about payment and compensation available to subjects, the investigator’s curriculum 
vitae and/or other evidence of qualifications, and any other documents requested by the IRB/IEC 
and regulatory authority, as applicable. 
11.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP according 
to ICH guidelines. Specifically, the study will be conducted under a protocol reviewed by an IRB 
or IEC; the study will be conducted by scientifically and medically qualified persons; the 
benefits of the study are in proportion to the risks; the rights and welfare of the subjects will be 
respected; the physicians conducting the study do not find the hazards to outweigh the potential 
benefits; and each subject will give his or her written, informed consent before any protocol-
driven tests or evaluations are performed. 
11.3. Statement of Investigator/Delegation of Authority 
As a condition for conducting the clinical investigation, the Principal Investigator will sign the 
FDA Form 1572, Statement of Investigator (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 312). 
The
 Principal Investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately qualified, 
informed about the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the study treatments, and their trial-related 
duties and functions. The qualified investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigator and other 
appropriately qualified persons to whom to delegate significant trial-related duties. Should the qualified 
investigator delegate the supervision of the investigational product administration to a designated person, 
this individual must have the appropriate medical qualifications to effectively conduct or supervise any 
potential resuscitation procedures. 
11.4. Subject Informed Consent 
The investigator or his/her designee will inform the subject of all aspects pertaining to their 
participation in the study. The process for obtaining subject informed consent will be in 
accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., CFR Part 50 and ICH E6 Section 
4.8). 
The investigator or his/her designee and the subject must both sign and date the informed 
consent document (ICD) before the subject can participate in the study. The subject will receive 
a copy of the signed and dated form, and the original will be retained in the site’s study records. 
The decision to participate in the study that is made by the subject is entirely voluntary. The 
Insys Development Company, Inc.                         Protocol Number INS005-17-111

    investigator or his/her designee must emphasize to the subject that consent for study participation 
may be withdrawn at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled. If the ICD is amended during the study the investigator must follow all 
applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to approval of the amended ICD by the IRB, and 
use of the amended form, including the necessity of re-consenting ongoing subjects. 
11.5. Investigator Reporting Requirements 
In accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements, the investigator may be obligated to 
provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at his/her site and notification of 
study closure to the IRB. Such periodic safety updates and notifications are the responsibility of 
the investigator and not of Insys Development Company or its delegate.

    17. APPENDICES 
17.1. Appendix 1: Surgical and Anesthesia Protocols 
Below are surgical and anesthetic protocols for the allowed surgical procedures in this protocol. 
The anesthetic regimens listed for each surgical model are a guide that should be followed to 
minimize interpatient variability to the greatest extent possible. However, it is understood that 
hemodynamic fluctuations and other intraoperative events may necessitate some deviation from 
this standard regimen and that is acceptable. 
Bunionectomy  
Subjects will undergo primary unilateral first metatarsal b unionectomy with no other collateral 
procedures. The use of midazolam, fentanyl, nitrous oxide and propofol are allowed with doses 
a
t discretion of anesthesia.  A small dose of lidocaine (up to 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without 
epinephrine) may be administered prior to medications to reduce peripheral vein irritation. A 
standa
rd Mayo block will be established using 2% lidocaine (plain), not to exceed 24 mL. For 
nausea prophylaxis, all subjects will receive a uniform standard of care regimen which includes 
the following: 10 mg of dexamethasone at induction and 8 mg of ondansetron near the end of 
surge
ry.  Airway management is at the discretion of anesthesia (typically LMA vs MAC). The 
bunionec
tomy procedure time should not exceed 90 minutes. No Popliteal nerve block should be 
used. Post surgically and prior to randomization, subjects may be treated with intravenous 
morphine 
and or fentanyl for post-surgical analgesia (dose and frequency per the discretion of 
the investigator). 
Breast Augmentation  
Subjects will undergo a bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty via an inframammary 
approach under general anesthesia utilizing saline implants not to exceed 500cc each. Ancillary 
proc
edures (liposuction, breast reduction, breast lift, abdominoplasty etc.) are prohibited. 
Midaz
olam, Fentanyl, Sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and propofol are allowed with doses at 
discretion of anesthesia. A small dose of lidocaine (up to 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without 
epinephrine) may be administered prior to medications to reduce peripheral vein irritation. For 
na
usea prophylaxis, all subjects will receive a uniform standard of care regimen which includes 
the following: 10 mg of dexamethasone at induction and 8 mg of ondansetron near the end of 
surgery.  LMA without muscle relaxation is preferred for all subjects however ET intubation 
ma
y be performed if deemed necessary. Post surgically and prior to randomization, subjects may 
be
 treated with intravenous morphine and or fentanyl for post-surgical analgesia (dose and 
fr
equency per the discretion of the investigator). 
Mini-Abdominoplasty 
Subjects will undergo a mini-abdominoplasty procedure (defined as a cosmetic surgery involving 
skin, muscle and adipose tissue, but no relocation of the umbilicus ). The approach should be 
a
nterior. Surgical drains should be placed per the discretion of the surgeon. The incision should 
in general be from one ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) to the other. It is understood that the 
exact incision length will vary depending on the subject’s anatomy and the desired cosmetic 
outcome. Ancillary procedures (liposuction, breast reduction etc.) are prohibited. Midazolam,

1. Admini ster at a dose of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg IV at every 2- to 3- minute’s intervals until 
de
sired response is achieved.  
2. Additi onal doses may be necessary and depends on the buprenorphine dose and the 
correct naloxone dose window 
3. B ecause respiratory depression from buprenorphine may last longer than the effects of 
naloxone boluses or short infusions, continued close supervision of the subject is until 
vital signs including respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels stabilize over an 
extended period of time 
4. Na loxone IV is the preferred route of administration (In the event of lost IV access, 
naloxone may be administered IM and SQ as an alternative)

dose will be administered every 8 hours (Treatment Days 1 – 7).  
xii Vital Signs :  Includes blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature, will be measured after the subject has been in a resting position for 5 minutes. Blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature will be measured at Screening , before surgery on Day 1, and at baseline before Time 0 (prior to first dose). Heart 
ra
te and respiratory rate will be measured at study drug administration/Time 0, 1 hour, and every 2 hours (±10 minutes) after first dose of study drug /Time 0 during the 
inpatient Treatment Period. Blood pressure will be measured every 4 hours after first dose of study drug /Time 0 during the inpatient Treatment Period. Vital signs will also 
be measured at Follow-up Visit/ET. 
xiii Pulse oximetry :  Will be measured continuously after surgery for safety; pulse oximetry will be recorded at screening and at selected times (±10 minutes), including 
baseline before Time 0 (prior to first dose) and at 90 minutes and 12, 24, 48, 72 hours after Time 0, and at Follow-up Visit/ET. 
xiv Oral Cavity Exam : Study staff will perform a sublingual assessment, noting the colour of mucosa and whether inflammation is present.  Check for mucositis and local 
irritation.  The oral cavity examination s should be conducted at screening, pre -surgery, before the first dose of study drug, and then at 90 minutes (±10 minutes), and at 12, 
24, 48 hours, 72 hours (±10 minutes) after Time 0.  An oral examination will also be collected at Follow -up Visit/ET . Asse ssments will be repeated based on the

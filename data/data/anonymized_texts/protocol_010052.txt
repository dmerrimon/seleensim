 1.0    Abstract    
    
Introduction    
    
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) therapy has been used for the control of 
postoperative pain with variable results.[1 -9]    TENS therapy is also considered an appropriate 
non-pharmacologic adjunct to patient care in the setting of symptomatic knee arthritis.[10 -28]   
Recently, orthopaedic surgeons have begun to utilize TENS therapy about the operative site in 
the early po st-operative period because of several proposed benefits including pain relief with 
decreased analgesic requirements, increased quadriceps strength with decreased postoperative 
muscle atrophy.  To our knowledge, the use of TENS as an adjunct to post -operat ive analgesia 
in the setting of outpatient knee arthroscopy has not been extensively studied.  We propose a pilot 
study to determine the effectiveness of TENS therapy in the early post -operative period following 
knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy, synovecto my, or chondroplasty.      
    
Methods    
    
Consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 
1) structured TENS therapy (n=10) or 2) sham TENS therapy (n=10).  Patients and the surgeon 
will be blinded to the TENS treatment group.  Patients will complete preoperative assessments of 
pain and function using standardized outcomes instruments, then complete daily pain 
assessments and reports of analgesic consumption in the early post -operative period (two weeks ).  
TENS will be discontinued at two weeks post -operatively.  The surgeon will complete the IKDC 
Surgical Document Form with information from the surgical procedure.  Patients will be followed 
for a total of six months post -operatively with clinical measur ements of quadriceps strength, knee 
range of motion, presence of effusion, and quadriceps circumfrence (measure of atrophy).  
Functional outcomes will be measured with KOOS, Marx, Lysholm, IKDC, and SF -12 for up to six 
 TENS in Arthroscopy        3    
PI:  Marberry, KM    
kmm 4 .2011     months post -operatively.  Statistical  analysis will be performed using computer software and 
significance defined as p<0.05.    
    
The results of the pilot study will be used to design a multi -center prospective randomized clinical 
trial.            
Conclusion    
    
TENS therapy in the earl y post -operative period following outpatient knee arthrscopy has not been 
extensively studied.  This pilot study will provide initial information for the effectiveness of this 
widely -used clinical device.    
    
    
 2.0    Specific Aims    
    
Transcutane ous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) therapy has been used for control of knee 
pain with good results.  Documented benefits of non -pharmacologic post -surgical pain control 
using TENS include decreased opioid analgesic usage, increased muscle strength, w ith a relative 
lack of side -effects.[1 -9]  Additionally, TENS therapy has been studied extensively for the 
nonoperative treatment of knee arthritic conditions with somewhat mixed results.        
    
Knee arthroscopy in the outpatient setting often requires  a patient’s pain to be well controlled in 
order to ensure day of surgery discharge.  In the early post -operative period, pain is primarily 
controlled with a combination of modalities including cryotherapy, narcotic and non -steroidal 
analgesia.  To our kno wledge, the use of TENS as an adjunct to post -operative analgesia in the 
setting of outpatient knee arthroscopy has not been studied extensively.  To this end, we propose 
the following hypothesis:     
    
Hypothesis:  Following standard of care procedures for arthroscopy knee surgery it is 
anticipated that Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) will provide improved 
pain relieve and improve functional outcomes.    
    
Specific Aim 1:  Determine patient’s perception of pain in the early post -operative period 
while utilizing structure TENS therapy.    
    
Specific Aim 2:  Determine the short -term (6 months) outcomes following knee arthroscopy 
while using TENS in the early post -operative period.    
    
Specific Aim 3:  Determine effect of early TENS use on quadriceps strength and tone in the 
early and intermediate post -operative periods.    
    
 3.0    Background and Significance    
    
Outpatient knee arthroscopy is considered a common procedure in the United States with more 
than 500,000 surger ies performed on an outpatient basis yearly.[29] Immediate post -operative 
pain has multiple etiologic factors including the type of surgery performed, operative time, and 
time from surgery among others.[30]   Unfortunately, these factors are non -modifiable .  Therefore, 
post-operative pain in the ambulatory setting is inevitable.[31 -33]  Limiting narcotic analgesic 
 TENS in Arthroscopy        4    
PI:  Marberry, KM    
kmm 4 .2011     usage has several advantages and thus strategies to accomplish this goal have been proposed 
for major orthopaedic surgery.[31]    
    
TENS has been offered as an adjunct to analgesic use in the early post -operative period in a 
variety of settings.  In a prospective, randomized study, Briet and Van der Wall compared narcotic 
analgesic usage following total knee arthroplasty with and witho ut the use of TENS therapy.  The 
authors were unable to demonstrate significant reductions in post -operative analgesic 
requirements with the use of TENS therapy following total knee arthroplasty.[1]  In a prospective 
randomized clinical trial following abd ominal surgery however, Cooperman and colleagues found 
that 77% of patients receiving TENS therapy in the immediate post -operative period reported good 
or excellent results, while 33% of patients reported good to excellent pain control without TENS.[9]      
    
For the non -operative treatment of knee osteoarthritis, TENS therapy has seen mixed results.  
When compared to intraarticular hyaluronic acid, TENS therapy has shown no statistically 
significant difference in pain and functional outcome at 6 months f ollowing treatment.[15]  Law et 
al. demonstrated significant improvements in self -reported pain and ROM in first two weeks 
following initiation of a TENS therapy program for patients with osteoarthritis.  They were unable 
to detect differences in patient -oriented outcomes.[18]  Cheing et al. found that four weeks of 
TENS therapy for knee osteoarthritis resulted in improved pain measures, but the treatment was 
not statistically different than placebo ore exercise alone.[24]  In a Cochrane Review of 6 trials,  
Osiri et al concluded that TENS is more effective than placebo for the treatment of knee 
osteoarthritis.[25]  In the setting of rheumatoid arthritis, Casamiro and colleagues in a Cochrane 
Review found that TENS was effective for pain control, but a formal  recommendation for its use 
was precluded by the poor design of the studies included.[17]    
    
    
    
 4.0    Preliminary Studies    
    
Preliminary data is pending.    
    
 5.0    Research Design and Methods    
    
    5.1    Rationale for use of hand -held dynamometer    
    
The reliability and validity of hand -held dynamometry has been extensively studied and adopted 
as a means of efficiently determining quadriceps strength in the outpatient setting.[34 -45]    
    
    5.2    Rationale for use of outcomes instruments    
    
Outcomes measures have been extensively used in orthopaedic research.[46]  The KOOS (Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score) evaluates five diminsions and is specific to kneerelated 
pathology: pain, s ymptoms, ADLs, sports and recreation function, and knee -related quality of life.  
The Marx Activity Level Scale consists of four questions and was designed to be a short, 
patientreported activity assessment that can be used in addition to knee rating scale s and general 
health outcomes measures.  The The Lysholm knee scale was developed for the followup 
evaluation of knee ligament surgery, with an emphasis on symptoms of instability.  It consists of 
eight items (limp, support, stair climbing, squatting, inst ability, locking and catching, pain, 
 TENS in Arthroscopy        5    
PI:  Marberry, KM    
kmm 4 .2011     swelling).  It is included for historical comparison and perspective.  The IKDC (International Knee 
Documentation Committee) scale is a subjective form consisting of 18 questions.  This form is 
considered to be specific  to the knee and widely used in outcomes research.  The SF -12 is a 
shortened version of the SF -36 and is a general health quality of life instrument.

Sealed envelopes will be used to conceal the random assignments of patients to one  of two 
treatment groups in the immediate post -operative period.    
    
 Group 1:  structured TENS therapy (n=10)    
 Group 2:  sham TENS therapy (n=10)    
    
 8.0    Patient Form (Week 1 and 2 post -operative)    
    
Patients will complete a pain and analgesic usage diary.  Additionally, patients will complete VAS 
pain questions daily and pre - and post -TENS treatment.  See Appendix D.  TENS treatment will 
be standardized and will consist of 20 minute sessions three tim es per day at the manufacturer’s 
recommended settings.    
    
 9.0    Proposed Timeline    
        
• Pre-study:   Patient questionnaire and database constructed.    
• 0-3 months:   Patient enrollment begins.

About this consent form
Please read this form carefully.  It tells you important information about a research study.  A 
member of our research team will also talk to you about taking part in this research study.  
People who agree to take part in research studies are called “subjects.”  This term will be used 
throughout this consent form.
Partners HealthCare System is made up of Partners hospitals, health care providers, and 
researchers.  In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the Partners system simply as 
“Partners.”
If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.  Taking part in 
this research study is up to you.  If you decide to take part in this research study, you must sign 
this form to show that you want to take part.  We will give you a signed copy of this form to 
keep.
Why is this research study being done?
This research study will compare the impact of dietary restriction pre-operatively compared to the 
standard nutrition that a patient typically eats before selected vascular surgery procedures major 
operation. We want to study how dietary restriction before surgery affects patient’s response to 
surgery and recovery studies suggest that short-term dietary restriction may be beneficial before 
surgery. This study is a randomized, controlled mechanistic study physician at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital (BWH). This research has no external funding and is supported by the Division 
of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at BWH.

This study plans to enroll 80 research participants treated at BWH.
You are being asked to take part in this study because your doctor has recommended one of the 
following procedures: 
Carotid artery endarterectomy
Aortic/iliac aneurysm repair (open, and endovascular if groin cut down planned) 
Open lower extremity arterial procedures (bypasses, aneurysm repair, arterial and 
bypass graft reconstructions) 
Major amputation of the lower extremity (below knee and above knee amputations)
Open hemodialysis access procedures 
Hydrogen sulfide has emerged as a critical gas signaling molecule in biological processes. Non-
human scientific research published by the BWH vascular surgery research laboratory and others 
has linked hydrogen sulfide production to short-term dietary restriction. Dietary restriction means 
limiting what you eat (in this case excess protein and some calories) temporarily. Pilot data suggest 
that adverse post-operative outcomes like strokes, heart attacks, and wound healing problems may 
be modified by brief protein-calorie restriction in humans as well. 
How long will I take part in this research study?
If you choose to take part, you will be actively enrolled in the study for anywhere from 35 to 60 
days. 
What will happen in this research study?
This is the visit/encounter schedule:
Visit 1:  Baseline assessments (up to 30 days before your procedure)
Visit 2:  Day of Surgery
Visit 3:  Post-operation day 1
Visit 4:  Post-operation day 30
If you choose to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign this consent form before 
conducting any study procedures. We will review your medical history fully to ensure you 
qualify to safely participate in this research study. If you don’t qualify, the study doctor will tell 
you why. After signing consent and you are determined to be eligible by a physician-
investigator, you will be offered a taste test of the ScandiShake. This is a commercially available 
nutritional supplement used by people who need to gain weight. In this study it is being used to

achieve the dietary restriction diet. You will be able to choose which flavor you want if you are 
randomized to the restricted diet.  
We will assign you by chance (like a coin toss) to the restricted diet group (called PCR), 
Group 1, or the control group, Group 2.  The control group will be eating what they would 
normally and not changing their diet. You and the study doctor cannot choose your study group.  
You will have a 3 in 5 chance of being assigned to the restricted diet group.  You will have a 2 in 
5 chance of being assigned to the control group.
Group 1: The restricted diet group will drink ScandiShake mixed with almond 
milk
Group 2: Eats a normal, routine diet. You are encouraged to not change the way 
you eat.
Water intake is not restricted for either group, and participants should drink water as they 
normally do, and according to the pre-operative instructions given. Both diets can be consumed 
throughout the day and night.
If you do quality for the study, you will be asked to return to the Clinical Trials Hub 
(CTH) at BWH between 30 and 5 days before surgery for baseline assessments detailed below. 
This visit may be in conjunction with your anesthesia pre-operative evaluation, but may require 
an additional trip to the hospital. You will be asked to recall your diet the day before your 
baseline appointment and to record your diet for the four days before surgery and two weeks 
following the procedure. We will provide you with a free smartphone application called 
MealLogger, where you can document your food intake using pictures and directly talk to our 
licensed dieticians. If you do not have access to a smartphone, we can also provide a color-coded 
food diary to hand record meals. 
The following are details related to each visit:
Visit 1: Baseline Assessments (Pre-operative Day 30-5)
Collect information about your medical history, current health, and medications you are 
taking. We will also look at your medical record to help collect this information. To make 
sure this study is safe for you, you should be completely truthful with the study staff 
about your medical history.
Physical exam, including height and weight.
Blood Draw. This will be used for standard lab tests and measure production of stress and 
inflammation markers. We will draw about 35mL of blood (about 2.5 tablespoons).
If you are female who is of children bearing potential, blood will be drawn and tested to 
ensure you are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, you cannot take part in this study.

Download and review the MealLogger phone application, where you will be able to 
document your diet with pictures that are automatically shared with our licensed dietician 
who can respond with clarifications about what you have eaten. You will be asked to 
record what your dietary intake four days before admission, and every day after surgery 
until post-operative day 14. 
If you cannot use the MealLogger app, we will give you a color-coded food diary to 
hand record meals. 
We will ask for a 24-hour food recall, to gather a baseline assessment of your typical diet.
Randomization to a diet group. If randomized to the dietary restriction group, we will 
supply you with the ScandiShakes at this visit to eat for the 4 days leading up to your 
surgery. We will allow you to sample the flavors, so you can choose your preference.
Visit2: Day of Surgery
The day of surgery will ask you to provide a repeat blood draw for research purposes, which will 
be done at the same time as blood draws needed for your care. During the surgery, a small tissue 
sample will be collected by your surgeon for analysis, about the size of an eraser head. From this 
point on, you may resume your usual diet according to standard post-operative care, regardless of 
what diet you were assigned to. We will still ask you to continue logging your diet using either 
MealLogger or paper record.  
At this visit, we will collect/perform:
Blood sample
Weight
Food diary (if applicable) 
Fat tissue samples will be taken and analyzed.  These samples will each be about the size 
of the eraser head of a pencil.
Discarded tissue that might be left over after your surgery will also be collected for 
analysis. 
Visit 3: Post-Operation Day 1 
Based on your recovery progress, your surgery team will determine when you will be discharged 
from the hospital. We will see you in the hospital on post-operation day 1 for the following 
procedures. Both groups (PCR diet and normal diet) will resume normal diet immediately after 
surgery according to recommendation by the clinical team. For subjects who do not need an 
overnight hospital stay, this visit will occur after surgery but before you are discharged.

At this visit, we will collect/perform:
Physical exam
Blood Sample
Collect the appropriate food diary entries if not using MealLogger app 
Visit 4: 1-Month Post-Operative Research Study Visit (Day 30 +/- 2 weeks)
You will return to the hospital for a standard post-operative evaluation with your vascular 
surgeon. At the end of this visit, your study participation will end.
At this visit, we will collect/perform:
Physical exam
Wound evaluation of the incision 
Information about any changes in your health, procedures since your surgery, or 
problems you have had 
Collect the appropriate food diary entries if not using MealLogger app (for two weeks 
post-op)

At the one-year mark after your surgery, we will review your medical record at to record any 
clinically important events.
Unscheduled Visits
If you have any side effects from your surgical care, your doctor may request that you come in 
for an unscheduled visit for further assessment of the side effect.    
Future Use of Stored Specimens
The small amount of blood at Visits 1-3 will be labeled with a code number (not your name) and 
temporarily stored and analyzed for chemical composition in a vascular research laboratory at 
BWH. Samples will also be stored and analyzed in The Mitchell Laboratory (Harvard School of 
Public Health) and by Dr. Karen Ho (Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine). Fat samples 
will be studied at BWH for chemical composition and microscopic examination. These will be 
analyzed at BWH for the effects of diet on lipid composition, and inflammatory markers 
predictive of the response to surgical stress. The key to the code connects your name to your 
samples and health information. The study doctor and coordinators will keep the key to the code 
in a password locked file on a Partners secured computer. 
Additionally, discarded tissue specimens will be examined microscopically at BWH. Enrolled 
patients and their clinical data will be entered into a study-specific database.

What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research 
study?
Your doctor will explain the risks of the medical procedure (carotid endarterectomy, aortic/iliac 
aneurysm repair, lower extremity arterial revascularization, major lower extremity amputation or 
open hemodialysis access procedures) you are having. Your doctor will ask you to sign a 
separate clinical consent form that explains the risks and benefits of the procedure. Allowing 
your leftover samples to be used for research will not change the risks of the medical procedure. 
At this time, there are no known medical risks associated to short-term PCR diets. We have 
successfully completed a pilot study here at BWH investigating and confirming the safety of the 
PCR diet before vascular surgery. 
However, as a result of taking part in this study, you are at risk for the following side effects. 
You should discuss these with the study doctor and your regular health care provider.
Risks of Blood Drawing
You may have a bruise (a black and blue mark) or pain where we take the blood samples.  There 
is also a small risk of infection, lightheadedness, and/or fainting. 
Risks of Pregnancy and Information about Birth Control
The effect of dietary restriction on an embryo or fetus (developing baby still in the womb), or on 
a breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be harmful. Because of these unknown risks, women 
cannot take part in this study if they are:
Pregnant
Trying to become pregnant
Breastfeeding
If you are a menopausal woman and have not had a period for the past 12 months or more, you 
will not need to have a pregnancy test. Also, if you have had any well-documented method of 
surgical sterilization, you will not need to have a pregnancy test. Methods of surgical sterilization

include having had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus with or without the ovaries), bilateral 
oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries), a tubal ligation (having your tubes tied), or 
transvaginal occlusion (plugging the opening of the tubes with a coil). All other female subjects 
must have a negative pregnancy test.
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant and you decide to take part in this study, you 
must have a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit (Visit 1), and you must agree to use 
birth control for at least 4 weeks after surgery. 
Acceptable birth control methods for use in this study are:
Hormonal methods, such as birth control pills, patches, injections, vaginal 
ring, or implants
Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a 
foam, cream, or gel that kills sperm)
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Abstinence (no sex)
Fat (Adipose) Biopsies
Adipose (fatty tissue) biopsies (sample of tissue taken from the body to examine it more closely) 
add about 30-60 seconds more to your surgery but hold no other known risks. 
Infection
Infection is a risk of any surgery, including the one you are having.
New Findings
Sometimes during the course of a research study, we get new information that affects the risks of 
taking part in the study. We will tell you about any new information that might change your 
decision to be part of this study or continue taking part. You may contact the study doctor or any 
member of the study team at any time after you complete taking part in the study to find out if 
any new information about this study has become available.
Inconveniences to You 
Taking part in a research study can be inconvenient.  Please think about the time commitments 
and responsibilities you will be agreeing to as a research subject. You must carefully follow any 
instructions given to you.
Additional visit to the hospital: We ask that you come to the hospital for one visit that may not be 
standard of care, Visit 1 (between 30-5 days before surgery). Any time spent in the hospital can be 
stressful.

Possible Hunger 
If you are assigned to the restricted diet you may experience hunger or discomfort. If you feel too 
hungry or uncomfortable you may choose to resume a normal diet while recording all intake and 
stay in the study. You may also withdraw at any time.
Possible Fatigue
You may also experience fatigue pre-operatively if randomized to the restricted diet. 
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?
You may or may not benefit medically from taking part in this study. We hope that if you receive 
the restricted diet you may have less chance of complications after your surgery, but this is 
unproven. We do not expect any benefit if you are randomized to the non-dietary restricted arm.
Choosing to take part in this research study may help others having surgery in the future. It is 
important to know that you may not receive any direct benefit from participating.  
What other treatments or procedures are available for my condition?
You do not have to take part in this study to be treated for your medical condition. You can have 
the procedure done without electing to be a part of this study. You should discuss these choices 
with your doctor.
Can I still get medical care within BWH if I don’t take part in this research 
study, or if I stop taking part?
Yes. Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within BWH now or in the future. 
There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to 
receive.
Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don’t take part in this 
research study, or if I stop taking part? 
Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Partners now or in the future.

this happens, we will tell you why.  We will also help arrange other care for you, if needed.
Will I be paid to take part in this research study?
Yes, you will be paid $50 for completing the baseline study visit, $50 for successfully recording 
your 4-day dietary intake before surgery, and $100 for successfully completing the end of study 
visit for a total of $200. We will also provide a parking voucher for the baseline visit. 
We will not pay you for missed or incomplete visits. We will pay you by check, so please allow 
time for processing. We will ask you to provide your social security number for reimbursement 
purposes. 
You will also receive a complimentary custom cooler bag.
What will I have to pay for if I take part in this research study?
The Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at Brigham and Women’s is providing the 
PCR diet and all research tests at no additional cost to you.
Although study funds will pay for certain study-related items and services, we will bill your 
health insurer for your surgery, anesthesia, and the routine items and services you would have 
received even if you did not take part in the research.  
Your surgery and the overnight post-operation stays are not part of this study.  The costs related 
to your surgery and for any routine care related to that surgery will be billed to you or your

You are invited to participate in a research study. This study, called TeleBATRAC, is investigating 
a home arm exercise program using the Internet. If you are eligible and wish to participate, please 
note that you are a volunteer and may ask questions at any time. The research will take place at 
the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS), conducted by VAMHCS researchers and staff 
at the Baltimore VA Annex located on 209 West Fayette Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, and at VA-
leased space at the University of Maryland Allied Health Building, 100 Penn Street, Baltimore, 
MD 21201.
PURPOSE OF STUDY:
Stroke rehabilitation studies investigating recovery of arm use with a specific portable repetitive 
exercise device called the Bilateral Arm Training with Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (BATRAC) 
have shown to benefit people several months after stroke. The purpose of this study is to 
determine if a home program using the BATRAC can be successfully combined with traditional 
exercise and the VA’s MyHealtheVet website for remote “telerehabilitation” of arm weakness 
after stroke. The MyHealtheVet website will allow for exercise video access and secure 
messaging to a therapist. We will compare this home-based telerehabilitation exercise program 
to the same exercise provided here at the VA and to a group that does not exercise for the first 6 
weeks of the study. The BATRAC is available in the marketplace as an FDA-approved exercise 
device called the “Tailwind.” It was developed and studied with patients with stroke at the 
University of Maryland and is NOT an investigational device.  
You may qualify for this study if you had a stroke at least 6 months ago and continue to have 
weakness in your arm. You also have an identified person (caregiver) that will assist with your 
exercise program, if needed. The VAMHCS will be the primary location for this study, and you 
will be one of 98 participants asked to take part.

VA Form 10-1086 Page 2 of 20 VAMHCS template v. 082815PROCEDURES:
This is a single blind randomized controlled trial. This means our study evaluator will not 
know, and will be “blinded,” to your exercise group assignment and cannot be told which 
treatment you are getting. However, you, the therapist, and the study doctor will know. Please 
be aware that this study requires a large amount of time and effort. If you agree to participate, 
you may be asked to make about 24 visits to the VA. This entire study will take about 5–7 
months. 
There are three exercise groups assigned at random. This means the group you get will be 
chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the study team will choose what 
treatment you get. There are three exercise groups you can be randomly assigned to: (1) a 
home-based telerehabilitation group, (2) a clinic-based rehabilitation group, or (3) a delayed-
entry group. The first two groups will start training immediately after the consent and baseline 
process. The delayed-entry group will wait 6 weeks before starting their randomly assigned 
exercise training. The figure below shows how the study will be conducted.
If you agree to participate in this study, you will receive baseline evaluations for the first month 
(4 weeks), followed by either 6 weeks of your randomized exercise or 6 weeks of weekly phone 
calls if you are initially assigned to the delay group. Home-based telerehabilitation and clinic-
based rehabilitation will include exercise sessions 3 times /week for a total of 18 training 
sessions. This training will be spread over a maximum of 9 weeks, to allow for missed visits due

VA Form 10-1086 Page 3 of 20 VAMHCS template v. 082815to transportation/weather or minor illness. You will be asked to return for a follow-up after 8 
weeks of no training. Please note that if you are initially randomized to the delayed entry group, 
you will have a slightly longer maximum study commitment: 4 weeks of baseline + 6 weeks of 
delay + max. 9 weeks of intervention + 8 weeks of retention = 27 weeks.
 The research related procedures performed include: 
General Medical Evaluation: A general neurological evaluation will be conducted at 
baseline by a neurologist to confirm clinical diagnosis of stroke and review medical 
records related to your stroke. A depression survey called the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale, and a cognitive screening called the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment will also be conducted at this time. The doctor will promptly notify you and 
refer you to a specialist if your depression or cognitive test indicate need for concern.  
This evaluation should take approximately 30–40 minutes. 
Robotic Evaluation of Arm Function: The KinArm robot is an arm robot specifically 
designed to test motor skill and coordination of both your arms at the same time. It will 
be used to evaluate your arm function.  This evaluation will occur once at the start of the 
study, and once at the end of the study by a trained study staff member. This VA-owned 
robot is located at VA-leased space at the University of Maryland Allied Health Building.  
Non-robotic Evaluations of Arm Function and Use: These will be performed at the VA 
by an evaluator that is not supposed to know your treatment assignment. Each 
evaluation visit will take approximately 90 minutes to complete. You will need to attend 
three baseline visits with him/her approximately one week apart in the first month. You 
will also need to be seen by this evaluator at a final evaluation visit (on Week 6–9), and 
after an 8-week time period of no training (at a visit called the retention evaluation visit). 
Questionnaires and surveys about your activity, arm use, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and 
learning.  
The specific non-robotic research evaluations are as follows:
Wolf Motor Function Test: This includes 15 timed arm/hand tasks and two strength 
activities designed to measure the capabilities of your stroke-affected arm. Time to 
administer this test is approximately 25 minutes.

VA Form 10-1086 Page 12 of 20 VAMHCS template v. 082815RISKS:
The Optional Focus Group Qualitative Study of Four Features of the MyHealtheVet 
Secure Messaging Pilot has a risk of frustration and/or irritation with completing a focus 
group, and you may only participate to the degree that you feel comfortable. There is also 
a risk of inconvenience and interruption to your schedule.
There is a minimal risk that a breach of confidentiality could occur. Loss of 
confidentiality will be minimized by storing data in a secure location, such as a locked 
office and locked cabinet, and electronic and voice-recorded data will be password-
protected and secured behind a firewall in a database within a VA server.
Anonymity cannot be assured if all MyHealtheVet triage team members elect to 
participate in a focus group. The members will be aware of the statements attributed to 
each other. Use of any statements made in the group will be deidentified if later used as 
part of a publication for research, and, if possible, will be used in such a way that 
comments represent a conclusion rather than direct attributions.

VA Form 10-1086 Page 13 of 20 VAMHCS template v. 082815WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?
If you take part in this research, you will be responsible to:
Keep study appointments and notify the study team if you need to reschedule. 
Discontinue any current arm exercise programs you are participating in to avoid any 
potential interference of your activities with the study results.
Notify us of any emergent medical problems that will affect continuing with the training 
or overall study. 
Notify us if you become pregnant over the course of the study. 
POTENTIAL RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:
There are no major risks or discomforts that you are likely to experience as a participant in this 
research. Additionally, pregnancy will not affect the ability to use the device, increase risk, or 
affect the scientific design. Below are some potential minor risks or discomforts that may occur: 
1. There is a small risk of muscle strain or pull in the assessment of strength and coordination.  
You will be instructed to perform within your level of comfort.
2. There is a risk of injury by the robot. The possible injuries from this malfunctioning robot 
include bumps, bruises, fingers jammed, pinching, or lacerations. The risk of injury is minimized 
by continuous oversight by a qualified staff member trained in the use of the robot during all 
evaluations. The robot design is specific to evaluations of neurologically impaired people and 
includes an emergency stop to immediately terminate all robot forces if there is any potential for 
injury.
3. There is a risk of frustration and/or irritation with completing the questionnaires. You will be 
informed that you can skip any question that is uncomfortable. 
4. Training involves repetitive arm motions which may cause muscle soreness, and joint 
irritation to your shoulder and elbow. This is a relatively rare occurrence, and is more likely in 
the early stages of training when you are unused to the exercise. The risk is reduced by providing 
regular opportunities to rest within the training protocol. You will be asked about joint and 
muscular pain after each session and told to rest the affected area and report back if pain persists. 
Therapy sessions will be suspended if pain worsens, and you will be asked to seek a medical 
evaluation before resuming research activities.

potential risk to your confidentiality related to the use of MyHealtheVet secure messaging. 
Secure messages are electronically stamped by the VA system and include your name, date of 
birth, and last four digits of your Social Security Number. These messages are stored securely in 
the VA system and may be reviewed by study staff. They may also be counted by the VA as part 
of VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) reports. The information retrieved for the VSSC reports 
will not include your identifiable information. Several procedures are in place to minimize this 
risk. All research activities will be conducted in a private setting. The PI and research team will 
keep identifiers linking names to research codes in a secure file locked in a cabinet in the locked 
research space or the PI’s office. Only the PI and research team will have access to this 
information on an as-needed basis. Only these research codes will be used for data collection and 
training records. Electronic data, including digital video and secure messages, will be password-
protected and kept within the VA firewall in approved computers and servers. There are no 
foreseeable psychological, social, or legal risks for this study. 
6.  There may be risks in this study which are not yet known.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS:
You may or may not benefit from taking part in this study.  There is no guarantee that 
you will receive direct benefit from your participation in this study. 
A potential benefit oy your participation is the development of a new home 
telerehabilitation program for survivors of stroke.  
There is a potential benefit in defining those who can successfully use this new 
telerehabilitation approach after stroke.  
ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION:
This is not a treatment study. Your alternative is to not take part. If you choose not to take part, 
your healthcare at the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) will not be affected.

PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS:
You will be reimbursed $10 for each study visit completed at the VA. In the event you do not 
complete the study, you will receive $10 per session attended to be paid on the last day of your 
participation. You will receive a voucher from the study team at the Baltimore VA Annex to be 
redeemed at the Baltimore VA Medical Center cashier’s office at 10 North Greene Street, 
Baltimore, MD 21201 as follows:
BASELINE: At the completion of the entire baseline testing phase, a voucher for your 
consent and baseline evaluation visits 1–4 and robot evaluation visit 5 will be distributed 
in the amount of $50. 
TRAINING: 
A) If you are randomized to the clinic-based rehabilitation group, you will receive 
additional vouchers for travel to/from the VA for intervention visits 1–18. This 
voucher will be issued at the final training evaluation visit in the amount of $180 if all 
appointments are kept. 
B) If you are randomized to the home-based telerehabilitation group, you will NOT 
NEED TO TRAVEL to the VA for your exercise visits, so you will NOT be 
reimbursed for sessions 1–18.
EVALUATION: At the retention visit, a voucher for the final arm and robot evaluation 
visits, and for the retention arm evaluation visits will be given in the amount of $30. 
In summary, if you are immediately enrolled in the clinic-based group and keep all your 
appointments, you will receive $260. If you are immediately enrolled in the home-based group 
and keep all your evaluation visits, you will receive $80. If you are in the delayed intervention 
group, you will receive payment for the intervention described above after the delay, and one 
additional evaluation reimbursement of $10 for your delayed retention evaluation.

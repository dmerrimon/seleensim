1.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
The purpose of this feasibility study is to obtain pilot data in preparation for an upcoming R01 submission (June 
2017). The goals of that submission will be to conduct a clinical trial of n -3 LCPUFAs for smoking cessation in 
pregnant women. For this VICTR  proposal, we will develop, test, and refine our recruitment strategy, and 
collect data demonstrating our ability to successfully recruit pregnant women who are actively smoking.  We 
will collect side effect, tolerability, and adherence data regarding our intervention.  Finally, we hope to gather 
preliminary effect size data to allow more formal estimate s of sample size. We hypothesize that pregnant 
smokers randomized to n -3 LCPUFA supplementation will have higher smoking cessation rates and less 
nicotine c ravings compared to women allocated to placebo . We intend to use this preliminary data to inform a 
future randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of n -3 LCPUFA supplementation for tobacco 
cessation.  
 
Our specific aims are:  
 
SA1: To successfully recruit and randomize 40 pregnant, current smokers into a clinical trial of n -3 LCPUFA 
supplementation.  
 
SA2: To assess the tolerability of 4 gm/day n -3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant, current smokers over a 
4-week period  
 
SA3: To determine the effect of 4 grams/day n -3 LCPUFA supplementation for 4 -weeks on smoking cessation 
rates, cigarettes smoked per day, and self -reported nicotine cravings in pregnant smokers  
 
2.0 Background  
 
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality and quitting s moking significantly reduces the 
risk of tobacco -related diseases (1).  Smoking is considered the most important modifiable risk factor for 
adverse pregnancy outcomes and is associated with preterm deliveries, growth restriction of infant s, pre-term 
related deaths, and sudden infant death syndrome (2-5). It is estimated that almost 11% of American women 
report smoking during pregnancy with higher rates in younger women with lower educational levels (6, 7) . 
Rates of quitting smoking during pregnancy have been  reported ranging from 35 -75% with risk factors for lack 
of quitting including lower educational status, smoking 10 or more cigarettes a day, multipar ity, and coexisting 
psychiatric problems (6-8).  For these particular high -risk individuals promoting smoking cessation can be 
challenging given concerns regarding both the safety and efficacy of currently FDA -approved pharmacologic 
treatment in pregnancy and breast feeding women.  As such, currently there are limited pharmacologic 
approaches for smoking cessation in this high risk group of pregnan t women.  The identification of safe and 
effective adjuvant therapies to promote smoking cessation in pregnant women would have a powerful clinical  
impact on maternal -fetal health outcomes.  
 
n-3 PUFAs have anti -inflammatory effects and are possibly cardio -protective (9).  We and others have found 
that red blood cell phospholipid (RBC) membrane concentrations of long -chain n -3 (LC) PUFAs (EPA and 
DHA) are significantly reduced in smokers compared to non -smokers (10-14).  The mechanisms behind this 
relative n -3 LCPUFA deficiency are not known , however , possible reasons include 1) dietary differences;  2) 
preferential lipid peroxidation of n -3 PUFA versus n -6 PUFAs; and 3) tobacco -related changes in endogenous 
n-3 LCPUFA metabolism.   
 
Emerging data is beginning to suggest that n -3 LC PUFA relative deficiencies could have a role in behavior.  In 
animal m odels, n -3 PUFA deficiencies result in structural changes in nervous tissue which impacts 
dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and correction of these deficiencies can reverse these changes (15-
18).  In particular, n -3 PUFA deficiency can result in hypofunctioning of the dopamine mesocorticolimbic 
pathways which are related to reward and dependence (19, 20) . Nicotine results in an elevation of dopamine in 
the nucleus accumbens which is associated with the pleasurable sensations related to nicotine use (21, 22) . 
As such, it has been hypothesized that correcting the hypofunctioning dopamine rgic system through n -3 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
LCPUFA supplementation might reduce the symptoms of withdrawal associated with smoking cessation and 
reduce nicotine cravings (23). 
 
Recently, two small scale, double -blind, randomized control trials have found that supplementation with n -3 
LCPUFA reduces signs of nicotine dependence (24, 25) . It is important to note that neither of these studies 
recruited subjects who wished to quit smoking and at no time during either study was smoking cessation 
encouraged.  Rabinovitz randomized 50 healthy smokers to either 4750 mg of EPA + DHA per day for 30 days 
or placebo (24).  The study re ported only 1 subject loss to follow -up and found a statistically significant 
reduction in self -reported tobacco craving and cigarettes per day in n -3 LCPUFA group compared to the 
placebo group.  Of interest, even 30 days after stopping the intervention, i ndividuals allocated to the n -3 
LCPUFA group reported lower levels of tobacco cravings compared to the placebo group. Zaparoli et al 
randomized 63 healthy -smokers to either 1023 mg/d EPA + DHA or placebo for 90 days (25).  Loss of follow -up 
was considerable in this study with only 62% of the participants completing the study (38% drop out).  The 
study was analyzed using an intention -to-treat design.  A statistically significant difference was seen in nicotine 
dependence between the n -3 PUFA  and placebo group with a 23% reduction in dependence score for smokers 
allocated to n -3 LCPUFA.  However, there was no difference between the groups in cigarettes per day.  
Reasons for the discrepancy between the two trials could be related to the dose of  n-3 PUFA chosen and the 
rate of subject drop -out. Taken together, these studies suggest that supplemental n -3 LCPUFA might be 
useful in promoting smoking cessation.  In addition, given that these trials were conducted in 
individuals who were not intereste d in quitting smoking, perhaps even greater effects might be seen in 
individuals who wish to stop smoking.   
 
Because the n -3 LCPUFA DHA has such an important role in fetal neural development there has been 
significant interest in the use of fish oil supple ments in pregnancy.  A meta -analysis of 11 randomized trials of 
fish oil supplementation versus no supplementation found no differences in cognitive, language or motor 
development between the intervention and control arms. Of note, only two of these studie s provided above 2 
grams per day of n -3 LCPUFA, possible under dosing the intervention (26). In general most interventional 
studies have included few smokers and smoking  status was only assessed at baseline (27). Thus it is unclear 
how adequately dos ed n-3 LCPUFAs might impact tobacco use in pregnant women who smoke. Nevertheless, 
even larger doses of fish oil supplementations are well tolerated, with the most common side effect reported 
being fishy “burps” with no differences in bleeding complication s, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or abdominal pain 
(28).  Although several expert panels recommend pregnant and lactating women to consume at least 200 to 
300 mg/day of DHA on average, no formal guidelines exist advocating the use of supplements (29, 30) .   
 
3.0 Summary of Study Plan  
 
Design  
Eligible patient s will be pregnant women who are currently smoking seen at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center.  The study is a single -site, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm trial design.  The 
two arms  included one treatment arm and one placebo arm.  Treatment will be 4.2 grams/day of EPA + DHA. 
Placebo will be 5 grams of olive oil in capsule form.  The intervention period will last 4 -weeks.  We will 
randomize 40 participants into the two treatment arms . As this is a feasibility study, we have not powered the 
study to account for drop -outs.  
 
Recruitment and Screening  
Participants will be identified  through searching Subject Locator, queries of the Research Derivative, direct 
referral from the Tobacco Treatment Service, or self -referral from clinic fliers . Study physicians will conduct a 
medical chart review and participants who are potentially eligible will be invited for Clinic Visit 1 (baseline).  
 
Clinic Visits  
Clinic Visit 1: After eligibility is co nfirmed, consent will be obtained. A brief medical history will be obtained. 
Participants will complete  four questionnaires.  Questionnaires will be administered by study staff or CRC 
nurses directly into REDCap study databases .  Blood , urine, and exhaled CO measurements will be collected.  
Participants will be dispensed a four-week supply of medication.  Participants will be given a pill diary.

4.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
The study will only recruit women which are justified scientifically. Members of all races and ethnic groups are 
eligible for the trial.  
 
4.4 Recruitment and Retention Plan  
Recruitment into the study will follow a six step process including: 1) identification of potential participants  
through electronic prescreening  to identify potentially eligible candidates by querying Subject Locator, 
Research Derivative, and StarPanel  OR direct referral from the TTS OR OB or self -referra l; 2) medical record 
review  for a preliminary check of eligibility criteria; 3) initial participant contact  first via an introductory letter and 
then via telephone contact to describe the study, determine interest, and arrange for a face -to-face visit; 4) 
contacting the CRC  to schedule the visit; and 5) mailing the introductory packet . 
 
4.4.1  Identification of potential participants  
 
4.4.1.1  Electronic prescreening  
 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center has invested heavily in infrastructure to recruit subjects for clinic al trials 
and we will utilize all of our potential resources. Potentially eligible participants will be identified through 
multiple sources.  
 
We will utilize SUBJECT LOCATOR  as a recruitment tool to identify potential research subjects based on data 
available in VU clinical systems (e.g. STAR Panel, WizOrder, Clinic Scheduling). The SUBJECT LOCATOR 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
program is part of a toolset available through VICTR that enables teams to specify inclusion/exclusion criteria 
for a specific study. The inclusion/exclusion cr iteria are codified for computable use and combined with data 
coming through VU Clinical Systems to proactively identify individuals who might qualify for a study. Once a 
'match' is made, research study personnel are alerted using confidential messaging or  a secure web portal.  
 
We will identify pregnant women by querying upcoming obstetrics visits occurring within the next 28 days as 
potential subjects. We will identify smokers by querying as free text searches for the terms “cigarettes”, 
“cigarettes/day”,  “pack/day”, “ppd” within the problem list and clinical notes. We will also search using ICD -10 
codes for tobacco use disorder s (listed below ).

Search algorithm for RESEARCH DERIVATIVE :  
 
The Research Derivative is a database of clinical and related data derived from the Medical Center’s clinical 
systems and restructured for research. Data is repurposed from VU’s enterprise data warehouse, which 
includes data from StarPanel, VPIMS, and ORMIS (O perating Room Management Information System), EPIC, 
Medipac, and HEO among others. The medical record number and other person identifiers are preserved 
within the database. Data types include reimbursement codes, clinical notes and documentation, nursing 
records, medication data, laboratory data, encounter and visit data, among others. Output may include 
structured data points, such as ICD 9 codes or encounter dates, semi -structured data such as laboratory tests 
and results, or unstructured data such as phy sician progress reports. The database is maintained by the Office 
of Research Informatics under the direction of Paul Harris, Ph.D.  
 
Searches of RD will include identifying individuals’ ages 18 to 45 years of age, with a B -HCG measured within 
the past 180 days AND with a value ≥ 1000. RD will be searched to identify individuals with upcoming clinic 
visits (any clinic).  Smoking status will be queried using the RAN/CIF forms.  Information that will be captured 
and transmitted to Dr. Murff via a secure file t ransfer will include: name, MRN, phone number.  
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
 
4.4.1.2  Direct referral from the TTS  
 
In addition, in conjunction with the ongoing inpatient Tobacco Treatment Service in VUH, Dr. Tindle and the 
TTS are partnering with Obstetrics providers, whose support we are enl isting to begin the process of smoking 
cessation treatment as early as possible in the pregnancy .  If the TTS identifies a  potentially eligible participant 
in performing their clinical duties they will contact the Dr. Murff by either pager/cell (615 835 -9617 pager/615 
969-0425 cell) or secure email (Harvey.j.murff@vanderbilt.edu).   
 
4.4.1.3  Participant self -referral or direct OB referral  
 
Fliers with study contact information will be placed in VUMC obstetric clinics.  Participants who contact study 
investigators indicating an interest in participating will be considered potential participants.  We will also meet 
with OB clinicians and clinical leaders to describe the protocol.  OB’s or midwifes may directly refer to Dr. Murff 
by either pager/cell (615 835 -9617 pag er/615 969 -0425 cell) or secure email (Harvey.j.murff@vanderbilt.edu).    
 
During the identification of potential participants , study personnel will initiate a subject as a potential participant 
adding identified individuals to an Excel  database.  The datab ase will be called the Master Eligible File . The 
choice of the Excel databases it to allow for the immediate destruction of the PHI on potential participants who 
were not eligible for the study. The form will be utilized to ensure records for potential sub jects are not 
reviewed twice or a potential subject who was not interested in participating is not contacted twice. The Excel 
database will document:  
 
1. Participant Name  
2. Medical Record Number  
3. Entry Date  
4. Medical Record Review Complete (Y/N)  
5. Eligible (Y/N)  
6. Telephone Number (Only recorded for potentially eligible individuals)  
7. Verbal Consent obtained (Y/N)  
 
4.4.2  Medical record review  
 
Study physicians will access the Master Eligible File  on a regular basis to identify potential participants for  
medical record review. We will conduct a preliminary medical record review to confirm inclusion and  exclusion 
criteria ( Appendix A: Eligibility Checklist ).  
 
4.4.3  Initial participant contact  
 
Once a potential participant has been identified an introductory letter will be mailed.  After 1 week after the 
letter is mailed s ubjects will be contacted prior to their visits to determine 1) current smoking status, 2) eligibility 
status, and 3) interest in participating ( Appendix E: Initial Contact Telephone Script ). Subjects who note that 
they are interested in participating will have their current address and contact information verified , will be asked 
to recommend several potential dates within the next 2 weeks for the first in person visit. They will be told that 
they will be mailed a st udy introductions packet (Appendix D: Study Introductory Packet) and will be called 
to confirm the appointment  (Appendix F: Appointment Confirmation Contact ). Subjects who give verbal 
consent will be instructed to stop any over -the-counter fish oil supplem entations. Subjects who are interested 
to participate will be entered into the  Tracker REDCap database.  Contact information will be verified and 
updated and the following information will be added:  
 
1. Telephone Interviewers Initials  
2. Telephone Contact Date

5.0 Agent Administration  
 
Intervention will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported AE’s and potential risks are described in 
Section 6.2.  
 
5.1 Dose Regimen and Dose Groups  
 
The whole intervention period lasts for 4 weeks (range: 3 weeks 5 days – 4 weeks and 2 days):  
 
Control Arm: Placebo Olive oil supplement capsules 5 grams/daily in five (5) daily capsules (n=20)  
 
Expe rimental Arm: Lovaza® 4.2 grams/daily in five (5) daily capsules  (n = 20)  
 
5.2 N-3 LCPUFA Administration  
 
Lovaza® is purchased from GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) and placebo is purchased from 
Swanson Health Products (Fargo, ND). The study PI wil l purchase placebo.  The Vanderbilt Investigational 
Drug Service (IDS) will purchase Lovaza®. The Vanderbilt IDS will be responsible for the storage (controlled 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
room temperature 59° F – 86 ° F and under low humidity and low light), preparation of all inves tigational 
agents, and maint enance of  accurate drug storage and dispensing logs.  
 
Participants allocated to fish oil supplementation will be instructed to take five Lovaza® capsules each 
containing 465 mg of EPA and 375 mg DHA daily; this will provide a t otal daily dose of 2325 mg EPA plus 
1875 mg DHA for a total daily dose of fish oil of 4.2 grams.   
 
Rationale for Dose  
As described above, two prior studies have been conducted in smokers to assess the effects of supplemental 
n-3 LCPUFAs on nicotine cravin gs (24, 25) . While both studies reported a statistically  significant  reduction in 
self-reported nicotine cravings in the intervention arms, a reduction in cigarettes smoked per day was only 
seen in the study of high -dose n -3 LCPUFA (> 4 grams/day) as opposed to low dose n -3 LCPUFA (1 
gram/day). These studies would suggest a dose effect and as such we are using a high -dose n -3 LCPUFA 
intervention for this pil ot study.  
 
Each participant will receive three bottles give n at a single dispensing time (Visit 1) : 
 Bottle 1 -3 labelled “Weeks 1 -4” (154 capsules).  
Bottle s 1-3 will be dispensed at Clinic Visit 1  (Baseline Visit). The prescription ( Appendix B: Visit Materials ) 
and the signed consent document (for Clinic Visit 1 only) will be faxed to the Vanderbilt IDS. The Vanderbilt 
IDS will transport the capsules to the CRC unit. Either the CRC nurse o r study staff will give the bottles to the 
participant.  Partici pants will be instructed to take the study medication with food to decrease the risk of GI 
upset and to store the medication in a refrigerator. Refrigeration of the product is to reduce the risk of 
eructation and “fishy” taste in the mouth.  The y will be i nstructed not to freeze the capsules.  To enhance 
tolerability subject will be given the following dose -escalation schedule.  
 
 Day 1: Take 2 capsules  
 Day 2: Take 3 capsules  
 Day 3: Take 4 capsules  
 Day 4: Take 5 capsule s 
Participants are allowed to take all 5  capsules at one time or in divided doses.  Participants will be advised to 
maintain the same dosing pattern over the course of the study to improve compliance.  Participants will be 
given a pill diary as a visual memory aide at Clinic Visits 1 ( Appendix B: Visit Materials ).  Between Clinic 
Visits 1 to 2 and 2 to 3, subjects will receive a single telephone reminder to encourage  medication compliance 
using a standardized telephone script ( Appendix C: Telephone/Email Reminder Scripts ).  This message 
can be left either on a voice mail or with a different household member if the participant allows. In addition, 
alternative message options (email communications) will be allowed for medication and visit reminders if the 
participant indica tes these as their preferred method of communication.  Standardized telephone  and email 
reminders are in Appendix C: Telephone/Email Reminder Scripts . 
 
If the participant is unable to stay at the clinic to receive the capsules  or run out of study medicatio n before the 
final visit can be scheduled , the pharmacist at the Vanderbilt IDS will mail the capsules via FedEx within one 
business day of the Clinic Visit. Research staff will follow -up with a phone call to the participant to ensure 
receipt of the study agent.  
 
5.3 Run-in Procedures  
 
Not applicable  
 
5.4 Contraindications  
 
Lovaza® is contraindicated in participants with a known hypersensitivity to Lovaza® or any of its components.  
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
 
5.5 Concomitant Medications  
 
There are no restricted concomitant medications.  
 
5.6 Dose Mod ification  
 
Individuals who report any GI symptoms ≥ grade 3, such as dyspepsia, heartburn, or diarrhea, will be 
instructed to discontinue the study medication immediately.  
 
Participants reporting minor GI symptoms (≤ grade 2) will be assessed to ensure they are taking the 
medication as suggested (with meals and refrigerated).  Those who wish to remain on trial will be instructed to 
reduce their study medication from 5 capsules daily to 4 capsules daily.  If symptoms persist or worsen over 
the next 3 days  they will be instructed to reduce their daily dose from 4 capsules per day to 3 capsules per day.  
If symptoms persist or worsen over the next 3 days they will be instructed to reduce their daily dose from 3 
capsules per day to 2 capsules per day.  If sym ptoms persist or worsen over the next 3 days they will be will be 
instructed to discontinue the study medication immediately  
 
5.7 Adherence/Compliance  
 
Unused medications will be collected at Clinic Visit s 2 and 3.  Participants will be considered evaluable if  they 
have taken 70% of the prescribed dose and/or have a 100% increase in RBC phospholipid membrane total n -3 
LCPUFA (EPA + DHA) concentration from baseline to 4 weeks.  
 
Participant compliance will be monitored in a variety of ways. Returned pills will be  counted , pill diaries 
collected,  and RBC phospholipid membrane n -3 LCPUFA content monitored  
 
6.0 Pharmaceutical Information  
 
6.1 Lovaza®  
 
Lovaza® is a combination of ethyl esters of omega3 fatty acids, principally EPA and DHA.  Lovaza® capsules 
are supplied as 1 -gram transparent soft -gelatin capsules filled with light -yellow oil. Each 1 -gram capsule of 
Lovaza® contains at least 900 mg of the ethyl esters of omega -3 fatty acids sourced from fish oils.  These are 
predominately a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (approximately 465 mg) and docosahexaenoic acid 
(approximately 375).  Lovaza® capsules also contain the following inactive ingredients: 4 mg α -tocopherol (in a 
carrier of soybean oil) and gelatin, glycerol, and purified water.  
 
6.2 Placebo  
 
Placebo will be Swa nson® Brand Essential Fatty Acids Olive Oil Supplement. Capsules are supplied as 1 -
gram transparent soft -gelatin capsules filled with light -yellow oil. Each 1 -gram capsule contained 1000 mg of 
extra -virgin olive oil. Other ingredients include gelatin, glyc erin, and purified water.  
We will use oleic acid as our placebo.  The reason for the use of oleic acid is several -fold.  First, oleic acid 
(olive oil) capsules have a similar texture, size, color, and consistency to fish oil capsules.  Oleic acid has been 
used as a placebo in several prior studies and is well tolerated. (31-33)   
 
 
6.3 Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks  
 
The most common adverse effects associated with Lovaza® include: eructation, dyspepsia, and taste 
perversion (incidence > 3% and greater than placebo). Other GI side effects reported include: diarrhea, 
nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, constipation, and vomiting.  Adverse events will be collected on 
the AE CFR ( Appendix G: Adverse Event  Form ).

Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
 
6.4 Packaging/Labeling and Storage  
 
The study agents w ill be packaged and labelled by the Vanderbilt IDS.  One bottle will be dispensed at Clinic 
Visit 1 and a second bottle at Clinic Visit 2.  Each bottle will contain  either 74 or 80  capsules.  The Vanderbilt 
IDS will be responsible for the storage (controll ed room temperature 59° F – 86 ° F and under low humidity and 
low light), preparation of all investigational agents, and to maintain accurate drug storage and dispensing logs.  
 
6.5 Randomization  
 
This study will recruit 40 participants who are currently pregnant and actively smoking. A 1:1 permuted block 
randomization design stratified based on current tobacco use (≤ 5 cigarettes per day or > 5 cigarettes per day) 
will be used to allocate the parti cipants to the intervention or placebo arm and will be created by the study 
statistician.  The randomization schema will be transmitted to the IDS. Both subjects and study staff will be 
blinded to the assignments.  
 
Procedures:  
1. Participants will review and sign an informed consent document  
2. The signed ICD and prescription for the study medication will be faxed to the IDS  
3. The IDS will randomize the participant based on the study statistician schema  
4. The IDS will transmit the study medication to study personnel in the CRC  
6.6 Blinding and Unblinding Methods  
 
The research pharmacist will manage the investigational agent.  The blind will be maintained through the effort 
of the research pharmacist and the pharmacy. Unblinding will only occur when it is deemed medically 
necessary, and will only take place after consultation will all study investigators. The date and the reason for 
breaking the blind must be recorded.  
 
6.7 Agent Destruction/Disposal  
 
After completion of investigation, all unused study agent will be returned to  the Vanderbilt IDS for 
destruction/disposal.

7.5 Post -Intervention Follow -up Period  
 
As part of this feasibility study there is no post-intervention follow -up planned  
 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
7.6 Methods for Clinical Procedures  
 
Blood Sample Collection Procedure  
Blood samples will be collected at all Clinic Visits. Blood will be dra wn into one EDTA tube (all 3 visits), one 
heparin tube for plasma  (visit 1 only),  and one red top tube for long term storage (visit 1 and visit 3 only).  
  
End-Exhaled CO Procedure  
Participants will be advised to hold their breath for 15 seconds before blowing in the device .  The results of the 
device will be recorded into the REDCap da tabase.  
 
Collection of Oral Flora  
Participants will be advised swish 1 -2 tablespoons of Scope (or generic equivalent) in their mouth for 5 
seconds and then spit into a specimen collection container. This sample will be transported to the Molecular 
Epidemiology Laboratory.  
 
 
8.0 Criteria for Evaluation and Endpoint Determination  
 
8.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary outcome will be reduction in total number of cigarettes per day from baseline to 4 -weeks.  
 
8.2 Secondary Endpoint  
 
The secondary outcome s will include: 1) reduction in the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire and 2) point 
prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks biochemically confirmed by end -expired carbon monoxide.  
 
Safety and tolerability outcomes will include: 1) reported AEs and 2) the rate of d iscontinuation of study 
medication due to side effects . 
 
8.3 Off-Agent Criteria  
 
Participants may stop taking the study agent for the following reasons:  
 
1) Individuals who reports minor GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, heartburn or diarrhea who do 
not wish to remain on trial  
2) Noncompliance with study agent  
3) Medical contraindication  
 
Participants who go off -agent will be withdrawn from the study  
 
8.4 Off-Study Criteria  
 
Accrual will be stopped if at any time toxicity among participants requires withdrawal of 25% of pa rticipants 
based on toxicity criteria outlined in Section 5.6.  
 
8.5 Study Termination  
 
The study PI(s) has the right to discontinue the study at any  time. 
 
9.0 Specimen Management  
 
9.1 Laboratories  
 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
RBC phospholipid membrane fatty acid analyses will be conducted by the Hormone Assay and Analytical 
Services Core Lab -Lipid Lab (Dr. Larry Swift, Director).  
 
Nicotine and tobacco metabolites will be determined using the VUMC Clinical Laboratories (ARUP).  
 
Blood specimens will be processed within the CRC and stored in the -80°C freezers in the Molecular 
Epidemiology Biospecimen Laboratory (Dr. Qiuyin Cai, Director).  
 
Oral microbiome specimens will be processed in the Molecular Epidemiology Biospecimen Laboratory (Dr. 
Qiuyin Cai, Director).  
 
 
9.2 Collection and Handling Procedur es 
 
End-Expired CO levels  
We will use the piCO Smokerlyzer (Bedfont Instruments) to assess end -expired carbon monoxide. Participants 
will be advised to hold their breath for 15 seconds before blowing in the device.  Output is in CO ppm  and hb% . 
Subjects self -reporting abstinence may have smoking status confirmed biochemically using end expired carbon 
monoxide.   Biochemically validated abstinence will be defined as end expired carbon monoxide less than 10 
ppm.  
 
Serum Cotinine and 3 -hydroxycotin ine  
Nicotine metabolites will be measured using an isotope dilution -high performance liquid chromatography/ 
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry using a commercially available testing 
center. The assay requires 1.5 ml of serum .  Serum cotinine has an advantage over end -expired CO as it 
reflects a greater period of abstinence detecting nicotine exposure for up to 14 days as opposed to 12 -24 
hours for expired CO . 
 
Urine  nicotine and metabolites testing   
Nicotine metabolites will be measured using a quantitative liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry 
using a commercially available testing center. The assay requires 4 ml of urine.   The assay measures 3 -
hydroxycotine, anabasine, cotinine, nicotine and nornicotine.  
 
Determination of RBC Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis  
Lipids will be extracted using the method of Folch -Lees (113).  Fatty acid methyl esters are identified by 
comparing the retention times to those of known standards.  Inclusion of the internal standard, dipentadecanoyl 
phosphatidylcholine (C15:0), permits quantitation of phospholipid amount in the sample.  
 
9.3 Specimen Storage  
 
  Protocol for blood sample collection  
We will collect a total of 24 ml non-fasting blood on each subject to be drawn into a serum, heparin, and EDTA.  
Blood samples will be collected at study baseline (wee k 0) (12 ml -three tubes), the study midpoint (week 2) 
(4ml-one tube)  and the end of the study (week 4) (8 ml -two tubes) .  Collected blood will be used for the 
following study related  measures:  
 
 Erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid content:   This will be a marker of medication compliance.   
o Tube type: EDTA lavender  top 
o Will collect on all three visits

Required Phlebotomy Materials:  
o Tourniquet  
o Non-latex disposable  gloves  
o Evacuated Tubes  
o 70% alcohol pads  
o 20 or 21 Gauge butterfly needle for the forearm or 25 Gauge needle for the wrist or hand  
o Red, Lavender and Green top collection tubes  
o Specimen Labels  
o Specimen Bags  
o 2 x 2 Gauze pads  
o Adhesive Tape or Bandages  
 
Procedure  
o Wash your hands thoroughly and don non -latex disposable gloves to prevent cross -
contamination.  
o Ask the patient to sit in a chair and support his arm securely on an armrest or tabletop.  
o Assess the patient’s veins to determine the best puncture sit e.  Observe the skin for the vein’s 
blue color, or palpate the vein for a firm rebound sensation.  
o Tie a tourniquet 2” proximal to the area chosen.  If the tourniquet fails to dilate the vein, have the 
patient open and close his fist repeatedly.  Then ask h im to close his fist as you insert the 
needle and to open it again when the needle is in place.  
o Clean the venipuncture site with an alcohol pad using friction for 30 seconds. Wipe in a circular 
motion, spiraling outward from the site. Allow to dry before p erforming venipuncture.  
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
o Immobilize the vein by pressing just below the venipuncture site with your thumb and drawing 
the skin taut.  
o Position the syringe with the needle bevel up and the shaft parallel to the path of the vein and at 
a 30-degree angle to the  arm.  Insert the needle into the vein.  Grasp the needle holder securely 
to stabilize the vein, and push down on the collection tube until the needle punctures the rubber 
stopper.  Blood will flow into the collection tube automatically.  
o Remove the tourniq uet as soon as the blood flows adequately to prevent stasis and hem 
concentration, which can impair test results.  If blood flow is sluggish, leave the tourniquet in 
place longer, but always remove it before withdrawing the needle.  
o Continue to fill the req uired tubes, removing one and inserting another.  Gently rotate each tube 
as you remove it to help mix the additive.  Order of fill is lavender/green/red  
o After you’ve drawn the sample, place a gauze pad over the puncture site, and slowly and gently 
remove t he needle from the vein.  When using an evacuated tube, remove it from the needle 
holder to release the vacuum before withdrawing the needle from the vein.  
o Apply gentle pressure to the puncture site for 2 to 3 minutes or until bleeding stops.  This 
prevent s extravasation into the surrounding tissue, which causes hematoma.  
o After the bleeding stops, apply an adhesive bandage.  
o Label the patient chart with appropriate blood tube labels and record the time of collection on 
sample collection form.  
o Place the tubes  into black wet ice bucket.  
o Finally, check the venipuncture site to make sure a hematoma has not developed.  If it has, then 
apply warm soaks.  
o Discard syringes, needles, and used gloves in the appropriate containers.  
 
Special Considerations  
o If the patient has large, distended, highly visible veins, perform venipuncture without a 
tourniquet to minimize the risk of hematoma  
o If the patient has a clotting disorder or is receiving anticoagulant therapy, maintain firm pressure 
on the venipuncture site for no less  than 5 minutes after withdrawing the needle to prevent 
formation of a hematoma.  
Blood processing  
o Blood specimens will be stored in CRC refrigerator.  
o All specimen’s will be labeled with date, participant ID #, study title , visit number,  and PI name  
o Green top tube will be given to the CRC nurse for specimen requisition and sending to TVC 
laboratories for send out  
o The other s pecimens will be storage on ice or at -4 °C until processed within 4 -6 hours after 
collection within the Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory  
o Serum  will be collected after coagulation.  
o Whole blood (EDTA tube) will be processed within 4 -6 hours and separated into plasma , buffy 
coats (white cells) .  
o EDTA tube processing  
- Spin at 1500g for 10 min at 4°C

10.0 Reporting Adverse Events  
 
The potential risk to the subjects related to the drawing of venous blood and the use of fish oil supplements.   
 
Sampling of venous blood  includes risk such as bruising, bleeding, and infection.  These complications are 
uncommon and phlebotomy is a routine part of general clinical care.  
 
Omega -3 fatty acids  have been part of the human diet for millennia and have uncommon and generally trivi al 
side effects.  In 1997 the Food and Drug Administration rules that an intake of up to 3 g/day of marine omega -3 
fatty acids are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) (135)   (http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA -
IMPACT/2002/February/Day -26/i4327.htm ). This ruling specifically considered the possible effects of fish oil on 
bleeding time, glycemic control, and LDL cholesterol.  Fish oil supplements have been used in several large 
randomized controlled studies of cardiac patients. (136)  In some trials doses as high as 12 g/d for durations of 
2 years have been well tolerated. (137)   In addition, fish oil supplements have been used in over X randomized 
controlled studies of pregnant wom en and are well tolerated. The most common side effect of fish oil is a fishy

Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
after-taste which is less of a problem with pharmaceutical grade supplements.  Minor gastrointestinal 
symptoms occur in 5 percent of patients. (135)  Fish oil has been approved by  the FDA for treatment of 
hypertriglyceridemia.  
 
10.1 Adverse Events  
 
Adverse event (AE) grading and attribution scale  
For the purposes of this study and adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, 
not necessarily having a causal r elationship with the study.  AE’s are graded as Mild , Moderate , Severe, Life -
threatening, and Death and are attribute d according to the relationship to the study drug and/or procedure as 
Not related, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite.   
 
All AEs that occur after the informed consent is signed must be recorded on the AE CRF ( Appendix G: 
Adverse Events ) whether or not related to study agent.  
 
Data elements to be collected for AE reporting include:  
1) Event description  
2) Event onset date and event end tim e 
3) Severity grade  
4) Attribution to study agent  
5) Whether or not the report was reported as a SAE

Adverse Event Attribution  Guidelines  
The possibility that the AE is related to the study agent will be classified as one of the following: not related, 
unlikely, possible, probable, definite.  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  
1) Results in death  
2) Is life-threatening  
3) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
4) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
Plan for unanticipated AE reporting  
SAEs and unanticipated AEs will be reported immediately by telephone to the Vanderbilt University IRB  
(Chasiety Turner HS#1) .  An Adverse Event Report form will be complete d and retu rned to the VU IRB within 2 
working days.  
 
Plan for annual reporting of AEs  
Annual reports are submitted to the VU IRBs and will contain a) the number of adverse events and an 
explanation of how each event was handled, b) the number of complaints and how e ach complaint was 
handled, c) the number of subject withdrawals and an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was 
withdrawn, and d) the number of protocol violations and how each was handled.  
 
11.0 Study Monitoring  
 
11.1 Data Management  and Security  
 
Confidentiality and ethical considerations will be addressed as follows.  All identifying documents, data and 
specimens collected as a result of this study will be retained by the investigator.  Access to this material will be 
available only to the researc h investigator and his staff.  Paper (hard) copies of study documents will be kept in 
a locked file cabinet.  Electronic copies of documents will be stored in a password protected database on a 
secured server.  If results of this study are to be published,  only code numbers will be used for identification.  
Participants will not be identified by name.  
 
11.2 Case Report Forms  
 
Participant data will be collected using protocol -specific case report forms (CRFs) in REDCap. All CRFs will be 
approved by the Vanderbilt  IRB prior to use. Study staff will enter data into the electronic research record either 
directly.  The primary source of data collection and storage will be REDCap.  REDCap offers a secure, 
password -protected web -based record..  
 
11.3 Source Documents  
 
All sou rce documents will be collected and stored in a locked file cabinet within the Division of General Internal 
Medicine and Public Health offices.  Only study personnel will have access to these files.  
 
11.4 Record Retention  
 
Hard copies of all records will be stored in locked filing cabinets located in locked office space. Electronic 
databases are located in restricted access folders within the Vanderbilt University Medical Center computer 
network. Access to the database is re stricted by password or permission -based access. All identifying 
information will be removed and/or deleted from the participant records at 2 years following the conclusion of 
the investigation. Biological samples are coded and retained in a locked locatio n with access limited to specific 
study personnel.  Source documents and data will be stored in a secure facility in compliance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the 
Vanderb ilt IRB regulations and guidelines.  
 
12.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
This study will provide feasibility data regarding the recruitment strategy, the acceptability of n -3 LCPUFAs 
supplementation in pregnant women, and preliminary data on effect size for power estimation.  Our study 
power is based on our primary outcome, reduction of cigarettes per day at 4 weeks .   
 
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
12.1 Study Design/Description  
 
The study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm trial design.  The two arms include 
one treatment arm and one placebo arm.  Treatment will be 4.2 grams/day of E PA + DHA. Placebo will be 5 
grams of olive oil in capsule form.  The intervention period will last 4 -weeks.  We will randomize 40 participants 
into the two treatment arms. As this is a feasibility study, we have not powered the study to account for drop -
outs 
 
12.2 Randomization  
 
The study includes two groups and randomization in permuted blocks.  Randomization will be stratified based 
on daily cigarette use (≤5 cigarettes per day/> 5 cigarettes per day).  
 
12.3 Accrual and Feasibility  
 
Approximately 400 women delivere d at VUMC last year who were active smokers.  With an average of 30 
pregnant smokers delivering at Vanderbilt per month we would estimate an accrual rate of 6 -8 subjects a 
month reaching our study estimate of 40 subjects in 6 months.  
 
12.4 Primary Objective, En dpoint, Analysis Plan  
 
Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviation, and ranges for continuous variables, as well as 
percent and frequencies for categorical variables, will be presented.  Standard graphing and screening 
techniques will be us ed to detect outliers and to ensure data accuracy.  For the primary analysis of post -
intervention cigarettes per day, we will perform a Wilcoxon (Mann Whitney) rank sum test evaluated at a 5% 
significance level.  This data analysis plan will be carried out  using statistical software SAS® (Cary, North 
Carolina) or statistical package R ( R Development Core Team, 2008 ).  
 
For our primary outcome we will compare the change in total number of cigarettes smoked per day from 
baseline to 4 -weeks.  We will compare the change outcome at 4 -weeks between arms using logistic regression 
using repeated measured ANOVA.  
 
For our primary outcome, if we assume a baseline number of cigarettes per day of 11 with a SD of 5 (34), we 
should be able to detect a reduction by 41% in cigarettes  per day in smokers allocated to the n -3 LCPUFA arm 
compared to placebo with 80% power.  
 
12.5 Secondary Objective, Endpoint(s), Analysis Plan  
 
Secondary outcomes include : change in the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire  and point prevalence 
abstinence at 4 week s biochemically confirmed by end -expired carbon monoxide.  We will compare the change 
outcome at 4 -weeks between arms using logistic regression using repeated measured ANOVA.  
 
The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire is on a 10 -point Likert scale. Estimating  a baseline score of 7.3 ± 
1.6(35) we have 80% power to detect a difference of 1 SD between the study arms.  
 
A goal of this pilot study  is to estimate potential effect sizes for a future R01 study.  We are underpowered to 
detect a main effect however the study will give us an effect size from which to power a larger study.  No prior 
studies exists which have used n -3 LCPUFA supplementatio n in pregnant women who are interested in 
quitting. We estimate a 50% abstinence rate in all comers. With 20 subjects per arm we would only have 24% 
power to identify a 50% increase in abstinence rates assuming a two -tailed type 1 error rate of 0.05.  
 
12.6 Evaluation of Toxicity  
 
All participants will be evaluated for toxicity from the time of their first dose of study agent  
FORTUNE Trial  
Protocol Version 2.4, April 26, 201 7 
 
 
12.7 Evaluation of Response  
All participants included in the study will be assessed for response to intervention, even if there are major 
protocol deviations.  
 
All of the participants who met the eligibility criteria and receive the study agent will be included in the intention -
to-treat analysis.  
 
13.0 Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
 
13.1 Institutional Review Board Approval  
 
Prior to initiating the study and receiving agent, the Investigators will have obtained written approval to conduct 
the study from the Vanderbilt IRB. Should changes to the study become necessary, protocol amendment will 
be submitted according to VUMC guidelines.  
 
13.2 Informed Consent  
 
All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved Informed Consent to review. The 
Investigator will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all questions regarding the study. If 
the participant decides to participate in the study, she will be asked to sign and date the Informed Consent 
document. The study agent will not be released to a participant who has not signed the Informed Consent 
document. Subjects who refuse to participate or who withdra w from the study will be treated withou t prejudice.  
 
13.3 Other  
 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and the applicable 
regulatory requirements  
 
13.4 Financing, Expenses, and/or Insurance  
 
Participants will be compensated $ 225 for participation (i.e. Clinic Visit 1 $ 75, Clinic Visit 2 $ 75, Clinic Visit 3 
$75) if all the procedures are completed. This is to compensate for any financial cost due to travel and the 
inconvenience of blood draws. The participant compe nsation plan will be pro -rated based on the number of 
study visits completed. Participants who complete the entire study will receive a total of $ 225. Participants will 
sign the Reimbursement Form ( Appendix B: Study Visit Forms ) which will be submitted to the Division of 
General Internal Medicine and Public Health for processing.  Subjects will be told to expect  at least 2 -4 weeks 
for payment.

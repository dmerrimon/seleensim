Trial site(s):Multi-centre trial
Clinical phase:II
Trial rationaleThis proof of concept (PoC) study will assess whether a drug aimed at 
improving cognition is better than placebo in patients with schizophrenia on a background of cognitive enrichment with adjunctive Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT).
Trial objective(s) The primary objective of this trial is to provide PoC data to assess the effect on cognition of oral once daily administration of BI 425809 given for 12 weeks in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic treatment and adjunctive Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT).
Other objectives of this trial are to explore endpoints to assess 
functioning and well-being of patients with schizophrenia, and to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of BI 425809.
Trial endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in neurocognitive function as measured by the neurocognitive composite score of the MCCB after 12 weeks of treatment.
The secondary endpoints of efficacy and safety are as follows:

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 20161. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is chronic and disabling. It has a lifetime 
prevalence of approximately 1%, with almost equal distribution worldwide and comparable incidence between men and women.
Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome and symptoms are clustered into positive, 
negative and cognitive impairments.
Cognitive impairments are a core feature of schizophrenia and have been shown to be a major 
determinant of poor functional outcome. While many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with some degree of cognitive dysfunction, the impairments seen in schizophrenia tend to be more severe and more independent of symptomatic state ( R10-5111 ). Meta-
analyses of schizophrenia studies with neurocognitive assessments reported an overall mean 
decrement of at least one standard deviation in cognitive performance compared to community controls (R15-3853 ; R15-3854 ) and is comparable or greater than the effect sizes 
reported for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury ( R15-3852 ).
Existing treatment options for schizophrenia (i.e. antipsychotics) are primarily efficacious in 
treating positive symptoms, however demonstrated only mild beneficial effects on cognition in schizophrenia ( R15-5596 ; R15-5580 ). Antipsychotics also adversely affect some aspects of 
cognitive function, such as processing speed ( R15-5595 ). So far, no drug has been approved 
for the treatment of Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia (CIAS).
Data from several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that ameliorating cognitive
deficits can benefit a range of functional measures, which may have significant economic impact ( R10-5108 ). The potential to increase functional recovery is therefore a major unmet 
medical need and drives developing novel treatments for CIAS.
It has been long hypothesized that deficits in glutamatergic signaling may underlie
schizophrenia, including negative and cognitive symptoms ( R13-4521 ). Various 
glutamatergic transmission-enhancing agents have been tested for the treatment of negative 
symptoms and/or cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Targets have included NMDA receptor co-factor glycine site, including agonists D-glycine, D-serine, and partial agonist D-cycloserine, as well as glycine transporter inhibitors, such as sarcosine and bitopertin, however previous studies have produced inconsistent results. Most of these studies were of a small sample size, making interpretation of data difficult ( R15-5877 ;R15-5838 ; 
R15-5584 ; R15-5615 ; R15-5578 ; R15-5639 ; R13-4524 ;R13-4448 ;R15-5616 ). Also, 
pharmaceutical industry-sponsored studies with bitopertin (a glycine reuptake inhibitor) 
failed to separate from placebo in the pivotal program to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia ( R14-4313 ;R15-1273 ) despite a positive signal in Phase II ( R15-1266 ).
BI 425809 works via the same mechanism as bitopertin, therefore hypotheses on bitopertin 
failures have been carefully evaluated in this project. Measures have been taken to address

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016the perceived failures including a different patient group and better control over the conduct of cognitive test batteries. One of the hypothesized reasons for bitopertin failurewas lack of environmental cognitive stimulation, which is beneficial to learning as brain plasticity is activity-dependent and responds to environmental demands. However, cognitive stimulation is often absent in the lives of patients with schizophrenia ( R18-1592 ).
The current trial will test this hypothesis by providing standardized background cognitive 
stimulation via adjunctive Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT).
Therapeutic approaches towards CIAS frequently include various forms of psychotherapy 
and, increasingly, some form of cognitive remediation or cognitive training for which many approaches exist, both computerized and non-computerized ( R16-2165 ; R16-2208 ). 
However, while some meta-analyses suggest that cognitive remediation may be able to 
improve cognitive abilities with a moderate but stable improvement compared to the control groups (average effect size 0.45), the studies included in this analyses are highly diverse and do not allow a clear conclusion as to what extent of treatment effect was achieved by which component of therapy ( R16-2166 ). This is particularly true for cognitive training delivered 
via a computer at home, without an intervention of a therapist. Nevertheless, it is 
hypothesized that cognitive training may lead to a stimulation of the brain, which could result in a change in neuroplasticity.
As stated previously, no pharmacological treatment of CIAS exists to date. There has been a 
long-standing debate as to whether a pharmacological treatment may exert its full efficacy only when given to a patient who has a low degree of stimulation while receiving pharmacological treatment. Cognitive training may provide such stimulation as summarized above. In order to reduce bias by cognitive training provided by individuals and to allow for a certain level of standardization in the study, computerized cognitive training will be used in this study. Provided as training in home settings will make it more easily disseminated to special populations that otherwise may have difficulty accessing traditional cognitive training programs ( R18-1594 ). At-home adjunctive CCT will be used in this study to provide 
background cognitive stimulation to patients treated with BI 425809.
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI 425809 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Glycine Transporter 1 (GLYT1) and, as 
such, increases the concentration of the NMDA receptor co-activator glycine in the
synaptic cleft. In vivo proof-of-mechanism (i.e. indirect target engagement in the brain) was
demonstrated by a dose-dependent increase of glycine in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), both in rats ( U13-2547 ) and humans ( c03724403-01 ).
Enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission is believed to improve brain plasticity (also 
referred to as neuroplasticity) which is essential for learning and memory. Indeed, pre-clinicalstudies with BI 425809 have demonstrated pro-cognitive
properties in relevant animal
models of learning and memory. It is therefore expected that treatment with BI 425809 has
the potential to improve CIAS.

Major human metabolites of BI 425809, M530 (BI 758790) and M232 (BI 761036), do not 
show relevant activity on GLYT1 and Glycine Transporter 2, nor against other off-targets tested. M530 and M232 have been evaluated in non-clinical studies with no evidence of pharmacological activity, genotoxicity, effects on embryo-foetal development, or adverse effects in repeat-dose toxicity.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Intact cognition is essential for everyday living. Cognitive impairment is a core feature of 
schizophrenia ( R14-3766 ). In fact, CIAS has been shown to be a major determinant of poor 
functional outcome ( R15-0570 , R15-0567 ). Thus treatment of CIAS is a high unmet medical 
need.
Neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain’s ability to acquire and store new information, is 
activity dependent and responds to environmental demands. Environmental cognitive stimulation conducive to learning is often absent in the lives of patients with schizophrenia(R18-1592 ). It was hypothesized that efficacy of compounds targeting cognition in patients 
with schizophrenia may be augmented by providing environmental cognitive stimulation
(P17-11122 ). Cognitive training employing exercises engaging specific cognitive domains is 
an optimal tool to provide environmental cognitive stimulation, with more standardized
delivery than various in-person psychosocial training. Moreover, cognitive training can be administered outside of the clinic/hospital in a computerized form known as CCT. This training can also be monitored remotely by clinicians to ensure adherence to the training.
As a strategy to enhance neuroplasticity and thereby optimize performance of compromised 
cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, this study will employ CCT as an enrichment strategy adjunctive to the 12-week treatment with BI 425809. The study is designed to show superiority of BI 425809 over placebo in patients on a background of CCT.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 20161.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
This is a Phase II Proof of Concept (PoC) study. In this study, efficacy and safety of the 
potential pro-cognitive medication BI 425809 on a background of cognitive stimulation will 
be tested in patients with CIAS. 
Background cognitive stimulation will be provided using CCT outside of the clinic/hospital. 
A meta-analysis showed that cognitive remediation therapy, including computerized interventions in combination with other treatment modalities, such as psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment, may have a positive impact on cognition in patients with schizophrenia ( R16-2166 ); however, the benefit of CCT alone without involvement of a 
psychotherapist is uncertain. The CCT program will encourage patients to regularly engage in 
exercises that will increase background cognitive stimulation. It is hypothesized that thebeneficial impact on cognition in patients on active treatment with BI 425809 will be further enhanced as a result of the increased cognitive activity achieved through CCT.
As in other clinical trials, participation in this study may be associated with potential risks 
derived from administration of an investigational drug and/or from trial-related procedures.
BI 425908 has been tested in 12 Phase I studies assessing safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and DDIs in healthy volunteers (male and female) and in two Phase II 
studies in patients. Study 1346-0009 tested 12-week treatment with BI 425809 in patients 
with schizophrenia and study 1346-0023 in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The potential 
risks and measures to minimize these risks that may potentially arise from administration of 
the study drug and/or from trial-related procedures (e.g. in-/exclusion criteria, restrictions, 
restricted medications, safety monitoring) are described below.
Drug-related risks and safety measures
The overall safety profile of BI 425809 is outlined in the current IB ( c02155957 ).
Based on non-clinical toxicology data, Phase I trials in healthy volunteers and Phase II 
studies in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease, BI 425809 is assessed to be generally safe and well-tolerated. The most common AEs reported more frequently for BI 425809 than placebo were were CNS-related (particularly headache, dizziness andsomnolence) or GI-related (particularly nausea and vomiting), and were typically mild to moderate and transient.
Visual disturbances such as flashes of light or blurred vision were reported as adverse events 
in Phase I healthy volunteers studies, but th ese events were reported infrequently 
(approximately 2% of study participants) in the Phase II study in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia ( c02155957 ).  These effects are understood to be mostly mild to moderate and 
transient. Please refer to Section 5.2.6.2 for further details on monitoring, reporting and 
follow-up of any unusual visual perception that patients may experience during this study.
In longer-term studies, BI 425809 was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in Hb: in 
the 12-week Phase II study in patients with schizophrenia administration of the 10 mg dose resulted in a decrease of 3.3 g/L (-2.3%) at last value on treatment, while administration of

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016the 25 mg dose resulted in a decrease of 4.5 g/L (-3.2%) ( c02155957 ).  No clear decrease in 
Hb was seen in BI 425809-treated subjects compared to placebo in Phase I trials of short 
treatment duration.  Decreased Hb is also considered to be a potential risk based on preclinical data and class effect, as GLYT1 is present on erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and on circulating reticulocytes and glycine is required for Hb synthesis.
Patients with Hb less than 120 g/L (12g/dL) in men or 115g/L (11.5g/dL) in women will be 
excluded from participation in this study.  Hb will also be monitored through safety 
laboratory tests and additional reflex testing will be done for patients with ≥20g/L (>2g/dL)
decrease in Hb since baseline as described in Table 5.2.3: 1 . Patients will be withdrawn from 
the study treatment if: Hb level is <100 g/L (10 g/dL) AND absolute drop of >20 g/L (2 
g/dL) compared to baseline (Visit 2); orif the subject develops anemia with symptoms of 
anemia such as dizziness, fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath, etc as determined by the 
investigator.
Results of DDI studies showed that co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 
increased the total exposure of BI 425809 significantly, while exposure of BI 425809 was decreased in presence of a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, concomitant use of strong and moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided.
Placebo risks and risks of stopping study drug
There is currently no approved medication indicated for treatment of cognitive impairment in 
schizophrenia. Therefore, a placebo control group is being used in this study design. It should be noted that all patients, including those randomized to the placebo group, remain on antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications throughout the study. Moreover, all patients will complete adjunctive CCT as described above.
According to the medication assignment planned in this trial, 50% of the patients will receive
BI 425809 and 50% of patients will be assigned to placebo. Inclusion criteria imply that patients enrolled in this clinical trial should be in stable clinical status and on stable doses of antipsychotic and concomitant psychotropic medications. Assignment to the placebo arm or stopping the study drug during the treatment period is not associated with a higher risk since patients remain on their stable treatment regimen with antipsychotics. Psychiatric events, positive and negative symptoms, and suicidality will be monitored throughout the study to ensure that worsening of pre-existing conditions or any newly occurring events are detected and any necessary actions taken according to stopping criteria.
Although this is an experimental drug at an early stage of clinical development and therefore 
an individual benefit cannot be guaranteed, potential efficacy has been demonstrated by pre-clinical behavioral cognition models. Given the acceptable safety profile in nonclinical and toxicology studies and the good tolerability in clinical studies performed until this date, and careful monitoring planned during the study visits, the sponsor feels the risks to the participating patients are minimized and balanced by a potential benefit due to the intensive medical care received. Additional justification is the possibility to further develop treatment options to improve cognition as a treatment for an unmet medical need.

The patients may feel discomfort during some of the study procedures, among other study 
procedure risks, such as blood draw. The potential risks of a blood draw include fainting and pain, bruising, swelling, or rarely infection where the needle is inserted. In rare cases a nerve may be damaged, inducing long-lasting abnormal sensations (paraesthesia), impaired sensation of touch and persistent pain.
We do not anticipate any risks associated with CCT. The weekly training duration is split up 
into short sessions (i.e. it is recommended that patients complete approximately 2.5 hours of CCT per week divided into 3-5 sessions of 30-50 minutes duration) to avoid strain caused by prolonged use of a personal computer (laptop/desktop) or tablet device.
In summary, results of this study will determine whether benefit of treatment with potential 
pharmacotherapies targeting modulation of neuroplasticity would increase with cognitive stimulation through adjunctive CCT in patients with schizophrenia. This is of utmost importance as cognitive stimulation is low or even absent in the lives of patients. It was indeed hypothesized as one of the reasons for past failures during development of new medications to treat CIAS. Since there is currently no approved pharmacotherapy to improve CIAS, finding an effective treatment represents a high unmet medical need. Considering the chronic and severe disease burden of CIAS, and moreover the potential additional favorable effect of adjunctive CCT on cognition in all study patients, the potential therapeutic benefits are assessed to outweigh the currently understood potential risks of the treatment and/or trial-related procedures.
Other risks
Regarding the potential risk while operating machinery, please refer to Section 4.2.2.2 .
Consistent with the FDA draft guidance entitled "Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Prospective
Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials", prospective assessment of suicidal ideation andbehavior is included in this study using the Columbia Suicidal Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). No signal was observed for suicidal ideation or behavior in patient studies of 12 weeks treatment duration.
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this trial requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety, see also Section 5.2.6 , adverse events of special interest (AESI).
Overall, the risk for patients with schizophrenia participating in BI 425809 CIAS clinical 
trials is considered increased in light of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to the need for the study participant to leave his/her home, higher prevalence of medical comorbiditiessuch as diabetes, COPD, and cardiovascular disease that may increase the risk of developing COVID-19 related complications and due to potential decrease in Hb after treatment with BI 425809.

In the event of restriction to visit the investigator site, certain procedures can be done remotely, and local labs can be used instead of central lab, as described in Section 10.5 . These changes are meant to keep the 
integrity of the trial and they will not affect the benefit-risk of BI 425809. Considering the 
risk, patients with known active SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 days prior to randomization will be excluded from participation in this study. Also, the study drug should be discontinued if the patient experiences severe or serious symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 (see Section 3.3.4.1 ).
The investigators will take the totality of information related to each single patient and the 
local COVID-19 situation into consideration when performing the individual benefit-risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon each patient’s (continued) participation in the trial. Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) as the sponsor, where required, will support the investigator in their decision making. It is acknowledged that the investigator may decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safety, wellbeing and/or is in the best interest of the patient.

2.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
The primary objective of this Phase II exploratory trial is to provide PoC data to assess the 
effect on cognition of oral once daily administration of BI 425809 given for 12 weeks in 
patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic treatment and adjunctive CCT.
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
Change from baseline in neurocognitive function as measured by the neurocognitive 
composite score of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) after 12 weeks of treatment is the primary efficacy endpoint.
MCCB neurocognitive composite score (including all MCCB domains except Social 
Cognition) was selected because it was found to have greater sensitivity to treatment effect in previous studies in the same population ( R18-1873 ).
2.1.3 Secondary endpoint(s)
The secondary endpoints of efficacy and safety are as follows:
∀Change from baseline in cognitive function as measured by the overall MCCB 
composite score (including social cognition) after 12 weeks of treatment
∀Change from baseline in the effect of cognitive deficit on day-to-day functioning as 
measured by SCoRS total score after 12 weeks of treatment
∀Change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score 
after 12 weeks of treatment
∀Percentage of patients with (S)AEs (including clinically relevant abnormalities of 
physical examination, vital signs, ECG test and laboratory tests)

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
A parallel group design was chosen for this trial to detect the effects of BI 425809 compared
to placebo on cognition in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic treatment and adjunctive CCT. The primary analysis of efficacy is planned after 12 weeks of treatment(refer to Section 5.7 for appropriateness of treatment duration). The 4 weeks (+7-day 
window) post-treatment Follow-up Visit is considered to be sufficient to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic effect of BI 425809 after discontinuation and allow for assessment ofreversibility of any unexpected side-effects. Details of the statistical approach and sample size justification are given in Section 7 .
There is currently no approved medication indicated for treatment of CIAS and therefore, a 
placebo control group is being used in this study design. However, all patients will complete adjunctive CCT which has emerged as a non-pharmacological approach to improve cognitive impairments in patients with mental illness. It should be noted that all patients, including those randomized to the placebo group, are permitted to remain on other antipsychotic and psychotropic medications, within the eligibility criteria. The risk to the control group is discussed in Section 1.4 .
This study includes CCT run-in for two weeks during the screening period.  The intention of 
this CCT run-in is to evaluate patient compliance with an at-home (i.e. completed by the 
patient independently, most likely at home, without clinician intervention) CCT program prior to randomization, in order to minimize the number of patients randomized at Visit 2 who will not be compliant with at-home CCT during the treatment period.  See further Section 4.3 and Section 6.2.1 .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is planned that around 58 trial centres in 6 countries will be participating in this trial and a 
sufficient number of patients will be screened for the trial to ensure that 200 patients are randomized to trial treatment.
It is expected that approximately 5 patients will be randomized at each trial center.  If 
enrolment is delayed, additional sites may be recruited. 
To avoid differential center influence on study results, permission to randomize more than 15
patients per site must be obtained from the Clinical Trial Leader (CTL). This will only be allowed after a careful review of the enrolment status and of the site.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all 
sites once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified

A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the sponsor should be contacted immediately.
It was decided that patients in this study should be maximum 50 years of age, as 
neuroplasticity (i.e. ability of the brain to change during life by acquiring, storing and re-using information) declines with age as well as with duration of the illness and treatment with antipsychotics. If BI 425809 is shown to be efficacious in this age group, it is planned to conduct additional studies to explore efficacy in patients over 50 years of age.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Only patients with established Schizophrenia (as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)) who are clinically stable will be screened for suitability for the study. Inclusion will be based upon a complete medical history, including physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.
Please refer to Section 8.3.1 for the documentation requirements pertaining to the in- and 
exclusion criteria.
3.3.2 Inclusion criteria
1. Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH Harmonized 
Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the trial.
2. Male or female patients who are 18-50 years (inclusive) of age at time of consent.3. Established schizophrenia (as per DSM-5) with the following clinical features:
∀Outpatient, with no hospitalization for worsening of schizophrenia within 3

BI 425809 tablets have been manufactured by BI Pharma GmbH & Co. KG.
Eligible patients are randomly assigned to one of the double-blind treatment regimens at a 
ratio of 1:1 as follows:
∀BI 425809 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks
∀Placebo once daily for 12 weeks
All patients will receive non-pharmacological adjunctive CCT (see further Section 4.2.1 ).

Method and route of administration:Oral
4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial and dose modifications
According to the result of previous trials, BI 425809 was well tolerated in healthy subjects in 
single doses of up to 150 mg and multiple doses of up to 75 mg bid (150 mg per day), please refer to Section 1.2 for more details.
Based on preclinical data in animal cognition tasks, BI 425809 shows efficacy at doses which 
correspond to ~50% glycine increase in CSF and CSF levels of the drug in the range of 1x GLYT1 IC
50(see chapter 5.1.1.2 of the IB c02155957 ).
In the Proof of Mechanism trial ( c03724403-01 ) demonstrating functional target engagement 
in healthy volunteers, the target mean increase of 50% in CSF glycine was observed after 
multiple dosing of 10 mg BI 425809 indicating that this dose level generates sufficient drug exposure and glycine increases in the brain that are expected to lead to improvement of the cognitive abilities in human.
Therefore, based on the preclinical data and data from the Proof of Mechanism Trial, 10 mg 
of BI 425809 was chosen as the dose level to be investigated in the present study.
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
During Visit 2, eligible patients will be randomized to receive BI 425809 10 mg q.d. or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomization plan. The study drug assignment will occur in a blinded fashion via IRT.  All patients will complete adjunctive CCT for the duration of the treatment period (see further Section 4.1.1 ).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Dispensing of kits for the double-blind treatment period will begin at Visit 2.  Trial 
medication kits will be provided at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5.  At each of these visits, medication assignment will be provided through IRT.  The assigned medication number(s) must be entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding medication kit(s) must be given to the patient.  The duration of treatment is 12 weeks.  At Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5, patients will receive one treatment kit containing supplies for a total of 28 days (21 treatment days plus 7 days reserve).
The first dose of study medication will be taken at the end of Visit 2 under supervision of the 
investigator or site staff. For patients that complete the treatment period, the last dose of 
study medication should be taken on the day before the EoT Visit. In case the EoT Visit is split into 2 sequential days (i.e. 2 consecutive calendar days), the last dose of study

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016Adjunctive Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT)
All patients in the study will complete adjunctive CCT for the duration of the 12-week 
treatment period (and additional CCT run-in during the screening period).
Total CCT will be approximately 30 hours spread over the 12-week treatment period. It is 
recommended that patients complete approximately 2.5 hours of CCT per week divided into 3-5 sessions of 30-50 minutes duration.  Patients can split assigned training sessions into shorter segments, instead of completing the session as one continuous workout, however patients should be instructed that the training done during a session or segment thereof should preferably be minimum 10 minutes duration. Sessions should not exceed 1 hour of continuous training to patient fatigue.
The same program will be used to deliver CCT during both the screening and treatment 
period.  The CCT exercises completed during the screening period (CCT run-in) will match the CCT exercises completed during the treatment period in order to most effectively serve the intention of the CCT run-in, which is to identify and exclude patients who will not be compliant with completing at-home CCT exercises.  It is recognized that patients may gain some benefit from completion of CCT during the run-in period. To minimize the effect of CCT during run-in, a large variety of exercises will be delivered so that patient will have limited exposure to any one particular exercise, and all exercises will start at the lowest level of difficulty. In addition, once eligibility based on CCT run-in is established, patients should be advised to not complete any further CCT until they are randomized to the treatment period.
Selection of CCT target duration
The CCT target duration of total approximately 30 hours divided into 3-5 sessions per week 
is based on a meta-analysis published in 2011 ( R16-2166 ) of cognitive remediation therapy 
for schizophrenia. This review examined 2,104 patients who participated in 40 different 
studies.  The average length of administration (CCT use) was 32.2 hours over an average of16.7 weeks. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in global cognition of moderate effect size (average 0.45).  The meta-analysis included studies that used both computerized and non-computerized methods, with no difference between the two approaches.
Our goal for the CCT component of this study is not to improve cognition but to provide a 
moderate level of background cognitive stimulation.  Based on the above-mentioned meta-analysis, it was determined that total approximately 30 hours of CCT over 12 weeks with a recommendation for 3-5 sessions per week should allow for the desired moderate level of background cognitive stimulation from the adjunctive CCT.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 20164.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
Study medication will be dispensed to the patient at the study site by responsible site
personnel. Details regarding dispensing of the study medication to each participating patient,including patient identification, the amount of study drug dispensed, the date the drug wasdispensed, and the numbers of tablets returned to the site will be recorded in the drugaccountability log. All dispensed study drug should be recorded in the drug accountability logof the ISF.
Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty package 
material with them when attending visits.
Based on tablet counts, treatment compliance will be calculated as shown in the formula 
below. Compliance will be verified by the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) authorised by the sponsor.
Treatment compliance (%) =Number of tablets actually taken #100
     Number of tablets which should have been taken
as directed by the investigator
If the number of doses taken is not between 80-120%, site staff will re-train the patient andexplain the importance of treatment compliance.  The site should also discuss with the patient if the number of doses taken is greater than 100%, to determine the reason.
Compliance with adjunctive CCT
Total CCT will be approximately 30 hours spread over the 12-week treatment period.
Optimally, patients should complete approximately 2.5 hours of CCT per week divided into 3-5 sessions of 30-50 minutes duration.  Patients can split the training sessions into shorter segments during the day and throughout the week, however the training done during a session or segment thereof should preferably be minimum 10 minutes duration.
CCT compliance will be monitored on an ongoing basis by site staff (CCT coach) that should 
follow up with patients to discuss compliance status and provide advice and motivation as necessary. See Section 6.2 for further description of the role and responsibilities of the CCT 
coach.
CCT compliance during run-in (screening period)
The CCT run-in will be completed by the patient during the screening period. Patients that 
comply with CCT run-in will be eligible for randomization. Preferably within 7 days after written informed consent signed (enrolment), the CCT run-in will begin. The baseline MCCBassessment at Visit 2 should be done within 7 days after patient completes the CCT run-inwhenever possible. This allows sufficient time for patients to complete the CCT run-in (two
weeks) and for sites to receive/review the compliance results prior to Visit 2.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016Target compliance for the CCT run-in is at least 2 hours per week for two weeks, totalling 4 hours, during the screening period. If target compliance is not met but the investigator believes the patient will be compliant during the treatment period, then the investigator should contact the CTM or CTL prior to randomization and a documented discussion should take place to determine whether the patient can be randomized. See further Section 6.2.1 .
During the screening period, once eligibility based on CCT run-in is established, the patient 
should not complete any further CCT until they are randomized to the treatment period.
CCT compliance during treatment period
CCT compliance during the treatment period should also be maintained at 2-3 hours (i.e. 
approximately 2.5 hours) per week across 3-5 sessions. Additionally, the CCT coach will discuss compliance during regular contact (at least weekly) with patients (see further description of CCT coach role and responsibilities in Section 6.2 ).
Minimum compliance expectation is at least 1 hour per week throughout the trial.  Any 
instance in which a patient completes less than 1 hour of CCT in any given week will be recorded as a protocol deviation (i.e. CCT low compliance).
Patients that do not complete any of the assigned CCT (i.e. zero sessions started) for 3 
consecutive weeks or more will be recorded as a protocol deviation (i.e. CCT non-compliance).

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
Change in cognitive function, everyday living skills, motivation and disease state will be 
measured by the batteries, scales and questionnaires listed below.
During the scheduled visits, the investigator or site staff will perform the evaluations by
asking subjects questions or help subjects to complete the evaluations which have to be done by themselves at sites.
In some cases the investigator or site staff will ask the study partner questions in order to 
complete evaluations. A study partner is defined as any person who has been capable of interacting with the patient over the past week. It is recommended that the study partnershould interact (in person or telephone) with the subject at least 2 times a week. If the study partner is not available for in person interview at the scheduled visit, telephone interview is acceptable. The study partner should preferably be the same person throughout the study. However, in the event that the identified study partner becomes unavailable or unwilling to provide input during the study, the patient should contact the investigator and identify a new study partner.
MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) will be used at screening (Visit 1), 
randomization (Visit 2/baseline), Visit 4 and (e)EoT Visit to evaluate the effects of BI 425809 on cognitive functions.
MCCB comprises 10 tests, which assess 7 cognitive domains, including speed of processing, 
attention vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition ( R13-2347 ;R13-2373 ).
The 10 tests of the MCCB with corresponding cognitive domains are listed in Table 5.1: 1

5.2.4 Electrocardiogram
The 12-lead ECGs will be performed as scheduled in the Flow Chart . Twelve-lead ECGs (I, 
II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 – V6) will be recorded using equipment provided by a central 
ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10-second duration after the subjects have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position and prior to lab sampling. Electrode placement will be performed according to the method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and wrists). At all time points indicated in the Flow Chart , single ECGs will be recorded. ECG 
recordings at planned time points may be repeated for quality reasons like alternating current 
artefacts, muscle movements and electrode dislocation. In this case the repeated ECG recordings will be used if quality was better.
The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically significant, if abnormal. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the patient’s medical file if there is no validated and certified e-medical record for ECG data.
Additional ECGs may be collected by the investigator for safety reasons. Clinically relevant 
findings noticed at baseline assessment (Visit 1) should be reported as baseline condition.

5.2.5 Other safety parameters
5.2.5.1 Assessment of disease state
PANSS will be used to evaluate the disease state. It contains seven positive symptom items, 
seven negative symptom items and 16 general psychopathology symptom items. Fourteen of the PANSS items require input from a study partner. A trained rater interviews the patient and the study partner, estimated to take 30-40 minutes for evaluating the subjects’ disease state.
5.2.5.2 Assessment of suicidality
Suicidal risk assessed by the eC-SSRS (electronic version):
The C-SSRS is a semi-structured, investigator-rated interview, developed by clinical experts
in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. It doesnot give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity informationspecifically for behavior and ideation.
The computer-automated eC-SSRS interview may be administered using a tablet device. 
Subjects who do not have suicidal behavior or ideation will answer a limited number of questions and will usually complete the assessment in about 3 minutes. Subjects with significant suicidal ideation or behavior may require up to 10 minutes to answer all relevant questions. This assessment should be conducted early in the visit. At the conclusion of each assessment, the site will have access to the eC-SSRS results via a web-based portal. The results include the findings for suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, suicidal behavior, and lethality / medical damage (for actual suicide attempts only).
The C-SSRS / eC-SSRS has been widely used in large multinational clinical trials. The eC-
SSRS will be administered first at screening (Visit 1) (using the ‘Baseline / Screening’version) with the aim to exclude subjects with active moderate or severe symptomatology within a specified time prior to screening. The life time history of suicidal ideation and 
behavior will also be recorded.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016After screening (Visit 1) the assessment ‘since last visit’ will be performed at each clinic visit(‘Since Last Visit version’). The investigator is to review/consider the eC-SSRS results for plausibility and clinical relevance. Doubtful results may be repeated or results may be validated by a consulting psychiatrist. If there is a confirmed positive report of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately interview the subject during the clinic visit (if the investigator did not administer the C-SSRS leading to the positive report), and/ or is to consult a psychiatrist if considered necessary. If the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the subject’s safety have to be initiated.
All C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 and all reports of suicidal behavior must 
be reported as separate SAEs by the investigator.
For ‘Self-injurious behaviour, no suicidal intent’ (Type 11) standard AE / SAE reporting 
rules are to be applied.
For each negative report (suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the
investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported accordingly.
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
Adverse event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the eCRF and BI SAE form (if 
applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator*
*Note: If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as 
baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
Regarding AEs in the context of suicidal risk assessment by C-SSRS, Section 5.2.5.2 should 
be adhered.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016Serious adverse event
A SAE is defined as any AE which fulfils at least one of the following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe.
- requires inpatient hospitalization or - requires prolongation of existing hospitalization,- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,
or
- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. 
Regarding SAEs in the context of suicidal risk assessment by C-SSRS, Section 5.2.5.2 should 
be adhered.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in Section 5.2.6.2 , sub-sections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. These events should 
always be reported as SAEs as described above.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see above.
The following are considered as AESIs:

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
∀an elevation of AST (aspartate transaminase) and/or ALT (alanine aminotransferase)
>3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in
the same blood draw sample, or
∀aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC system.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug
∀The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications)
∀The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished)

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned)
∀Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives); of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger
∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned)
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart including time
windows for rescheduling. Preferably the visits should be conducted in the morning.
If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date
schedule calculated from randomization (Visit 2). The trial medication kits contain sufficient medication to allow for these time windows.
The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out” (i.e. last visit completed by the last 
patient).
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an AE or an abnormal laboratory 
test result, the patient must be followed until they are resolved, or deemed reasonably followed up by the investigator on consultation with BI.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Patients do not have to come fasted for any trial visits.
The following guidance pertains to conduct of the neuropsychological assessments:
∀Each assessment of the rating scales (MCCB, SCoRS, PANSS, ) should 
preferentially be done by the same members of the site staff for a given patient 
throughout the study period
oNote: MCCB and SCoRS should not be administered to a patient by the same 
rater at the same visit to prevent bias on the SCoRS ratings
∀The MCCB assessments at Visit 4 and (e)EoT Visit must be started at the same 
time of the day as at Visit 2 (+/- 60 minutes) ; in case this cannot be done at a 
scheduled visit, then the visit should be rescheduled within the allowed visit window
∀The MCCB assessment should preferably be done in the morning
∀The screening MCCB assessment must be done before start of CCT run-in and at least 
12 days prior to the baseline MCCB assessment at Visit 2
∀Visit 2 should be done within 7 days after patient completes the CCT run-in whenever 
possible
oDuring the screening period, once eligibility based on CCT run-in is 
established, the patient should not complete any further CCT until they are randomized to the treatment period.
∀The neuropsychological assessments should be conducted in the following order:
oScreening (Visit 1) and Visit 4: The MCCB is done first before other neuropsychological assessments
oVisit 2 and (e)EoT Visit: The  MCCB is done 
before other neuropsychological assessments

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016∀Study procedures for Visit 2 and (e)EoT Visit can be split into 2 sequential days (i.e. 2 
consecutive calendar days), in which case: the , MCCB  
 should be performed on the first day (for Visit 2, this should
preferably be done within 7 days after patient completes the CCT run-in); the other neuropsychological assessments (i.e. PANSS, SCoRS, ) should be performed on the second day (for Visit 2, this would be day of first study drug 
intake).
∀During the neuropsychological testing, patients are allowed to take short breaks as 
needed, in the judgement of the rater/investigator
∀The site staff must be properly trained on all trial procedures and training 
documentation has to be filed in the ISF; the training standards and standards for the 
conduct of the assessments will be defined for each assessment individually and can be found in the ISF; it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator at the site to ensure proper training of all members of the site staff involved in the neuropsychological assessments
oIn addition, the site staff that will be administering the neuropsychological 
performance and clinical rating scales may require certification
The following information applies to the CCT and related activities:
∀The CCT exercises will come from the CR-Psychiatry program provided via the 
 
∀Patients will use a personal computer (laptop/desktop) or tablet device with web 
browser to access the CCT exercises through the internet; each patient will need to log 
into their own account within the  in order to access and complete their CCT exercises
∀All CCT training data is saved on a secure server by the CCT vendor; data can then be 
viewed by sponsor and site staff through a secure, password-protected and HIPAA-
compliant clinician server (CCT “portal”)
oNote: These data will only be used to ensure compliance with the use of CCT;
they will not be used to display or analyze medical information about a patient, they will not be used to support or provide recommendations about prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and they will not be used to enable review the basis for such recommendations with the intent of making treatment decisions
∀Each participating site will identify a CCT “coach” who will supervise use of the CCT 
program by study participants; the CCT coach performs various functions including:
oCreates patient accounts within the 
oManages allocation and return of CCT devices 
oProvides training/re-training as necessary on the proper use of the CCT 
program
oProactively contacts patients at least weekly during the treatment period (more 
frequent contacts may be warranted during the CCT run-in) to provide guidance and encouragement to complete assigned CCT exercises, and to ensure that the CCT program is problem-free
oMonitors CCT compliance remotely via CCT portal on an ongoing basis (at 
least weekly although more frequent checks are encouraged during the CCT

oIs available to remotely assist study patients in case of technical difficulties or 
questions regarding the CCT program
∀All sites will receive a CCT Manual (available in the ISF) containing further details 
regarding the CCT program and CCT coach role and responsibilities
∀Patients should try to avoid antihistaminic, benzodiazepine or other sedative 
medication within 8 hours before CCT training sessions, if possible
Study procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart . Additional details
regarding visit procedures are provided below.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be s ituations when patients already in the study 
might not be able to come to the site for the scheduled visit. This might be due to restrictions 
set by authorities or by the investigator site/institution, because the patient is quarantined, orbecause of any patient specific situation that the investigator judges as being not safe for thepatient to come to the site.
For details on potential modifications of the trial conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
please refer to Section 10.5 .
6.2.1 Screening and run-in period(s)
After patients have been informed about the trial, written informed consent in accordance 
with ICH-GCP and the local legislation must be obtained prior to any study related 
procedures taking place. Once consented, the patient is considered enrolled in the trial and starts the screening period. The patient is recorded on the enrolment log and registered in the IRT system as a screened patient.
All procedures for screening (Visit 1) as listed in the Flow Chart have to be performed within
28 days (or within 38 days if cannabis re-testing is performed) prior to Visit 2 (date of first 
drug administration) and can occur on more than one day. It is recommended that Visit 1 laboratory samples are collected as early as possible in the screening period.
Baseline conditions and medical history will be recorded, including but not limited to:
∀Demographics such as gender, age, ethnicity, smoking and alcohol history
∀All concomitant medications.
∀Psychiatric and relevant non-psychiatric history
oBaseline disease state will be assessed by PANSS
The following assessments will be completed to assess eligibility:
∀PANSS Positive scale item P1-P7 will be used for confirming eligibility at Visit 1 and 
Visit 2
∀The M.I.N.I. and the ‘Baseline / Screening’ version of the C-SSRS will be 
administered for eligibility confirmation

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016The SCoRS assessment will be done during screening (Visit 1).
BP should always be measured before any blood samples are taken. For details regarding the 
correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.3.2 .
A 12-lead ECG will be taken.
Any abnormal condition of clinical significance identified during physical examination, vital 
signs, 12 lead ECG and/or laboratory assessment should be recorded as a baseline condition.
All women of childbearing potential must perform urine (dipstick) pregnancy test at 
screening (Visit 1). The urine dipstick test will be completed locally on-site using kits provided by central lab. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central lab for confirmation.
During screening, the investigator should highlight to patients the importance of not taking 
drugs of abuse during the study, and that the urine drug screen will be repeated periodically throughout the trial. Patients should also be informed that they cannot participate in the trial if they have a positive urine drug screen (see further the relevant exclusion criterion in Section 
3.3.3 ).
The screening MCCB assessment must be done before start of CCT run-in and it is 
recommended that as many of the other screening procedures as possible also should be assessed prior to start of CCT run-in. The process for completion of CCT run-in includes the following:
∀Preferably within 7 days after written informed consent signed (enrolment), patients 
that still meet eligibility criteria (according to available information) will begin the 
CCT run-in; this will be considered day 1 of the CCT run-in
∀On day 1 of the CCT run-in, the following will be completed by the CCT coach:
oProvide initial training to patient on use of the CCT program; patients with 
little or no experience using a personal computer (laptop/desktop) or tablet device may require additional training from the CCT coach on how to properly use the CCT device
oSupervise the first CCT session at the clinic to ensure the patient is able to 
demonstrate proper use of the CCT device and program
oAllocate a CCT device to the patient, if needed (i.e. if patient does not have or 
is not willing to use their own device or does not have reliable internet access)
∀During the CCT run-in (2 weeks), the CCT coach will:
oProactively contact patient at least weekly (although more frequent contacts 
may be warranted) to provide guidance and coaching about their progress, and ensure that the CCT program is problem-free
oMonitor CCT compliance remotely via CCT portal on an ongoing basis (at 
least weekly although more frequent checks are recommended) and follow up with patients as necessary to discuss compliance status and encourage them to 
complete CCT exercises to target

7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
A specification of secondary endpoints is provided in Section 2.1.3 .
The analyses of efficacy-related secondary endpoints will be performed in FAS. The same 
model utilized for the primary endpoint will be fitted for change from baseline in the overall MCCB composite score. For change from baseline in PANSS total score after 12 weeks of treatment, an MMRM model that includes treatment, age and visit as factors, the corresponding baseline value as a covariate, as well as treatment-by-visit and baseline-by-visit interactions will be fitted. For change from baseline in SCoRS score after 12 weeks of treatment, an ANCOVA model that includes treatment and age as factors, and its corresponding score at baseline as a covariate will be fitted. The adjusted mean values as well as the treatment group contrasts at week 12 will be presented together with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). All p-values will be considered descriptive.
For the percentage of patients with (S)AEs (including clinically relevant abnormalities of 
physical examination, vital signs, ECG and laboratory tests), comparison will be made for (BI 424809 + CCT) group vs. (placebo + CCT) group on TS together with descriptive statistics.
For other secondary endpoints, only descriptive statistics and exploratory analyses will be 
provided.
Other analyses may be considered if deemed necessary and the details will be provided in the 
TSAP.
7.3.4 Safety analyses
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All AEs with an onset between start of treatment and the end of the REP, a period of 11 days after the last dose of trialmedication, will be assigned to the on Treatment Period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment-emergent adverse 
events, i.e. all AEs occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. AEs that start

Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by system organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the MedDRA at the database lock.
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety-relevant data observed at screening (Visit 
1), baseline (Visit 2), during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Every effort will be made to collect complete data at the pre-planned time points. Handling of 
missing data in MCCB tests will follow the MCCB Manual (available in the ISF). In general, for completely missing visit missing data will not be imputed and will be handled through the MMRM under the “missing at random” assumption. BI standards will be used for missing data in AE, safety lab, . The missing data handling rules will be further specified in details in the TSAP.

Eligible patients will be stratified by age (age  18-40 and age 41-50) and will be randomized 
with 1:1 ratio to the BI 425809 10 mg + CCT and placebo + CCT arms. The randomization will be implemented in blocks to achieve balanced allocation to each of the two treatment arms. The block size will be documented in the clinical trial report (CTR).  
The randomization will be conducted via an IRT. BI will arrange for the randomization and 
the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomization list will be generated by a validated system, which utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to make the resulting treatment sequence both reproducible and non-predictable. Access to the randomization codes will be controlled and documented.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
It is planned to randomize a total of 200 subjects in the trial, because this sample size is
considered sufficient to achieve the aims of this exploratory trial.
Based on this sample size, the probabilities for observing a mean difference < 0.3, 0.3 - 0.4, 
or > 0.4 between the treatment arm and the placebo arm on the change from baseline MCCBneurocognitive composite score after 12 weeks of treatment are displayed in Table 7.7: 1 . 
For these calculations, the following assumptions are made. A total of 200 patients are
randomized. Assuming a10% dropout rate this leads to a total of 180 evaluable subjects. 
Table 7.7: 1 Probabilities of observing a mean difference in the primary endpoint

This trial will be initiated only after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved by the respective IRB / IEC and Competent Authority (CA) according to national and international regulations. The same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by amendments.Prior to patient participation in the trial, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient (or the patient’s legally accepted representative) according to ICH-GCP and to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. Each signature must be personally dated by each signatory and the informed consent and any additional patient-information form retained by the investigator as pa rt of the trial records. A signed copy of the 
informed consent and any additional patient information must be given to each patient or the patient’s legally accepted representative.
Re-consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and 
should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions.
If study conduct may need to be adjusted during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Section 6.2
and Section 10.5 ), the patient must be made aware of any modifications and provide their 
agreement to the modifications prior to them being implemented.
The consent and re-consenting process should be properly documented in the source 
documentation.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by the sponsor. See Section 4.1.5.2 for rules 
about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability, refer to Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. If medical records cannot be obtained prior to randomization, a phone call with the treating physician(s) detailing eligibility information must be conducted and documented, and the documentation filed with the subject’s source records. If medical 
records cannot be obtained and a phone call with the treating physician(s) cannot be 
conducted, the CTM or CTL should be contacted for further discussion.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 201610.5 POTENTIAL MODIFICATION OF TRIAL CONDUCT IN CASE OF 
RESTRICTIONS DUE TO COVID-19
As mentioned in Section 6.2 , in case of any new restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic
and for patients already in the study, study c onduct may need to be adjusted based on the 
investigator’s discretion (and agreed with the sponsor). The following contingency measures 
have been introduced to ensure patient safety and appropriate trial continuation based on a thorough benefit-risk assessment of treatment continuation versus early discontinuation, to be judged by the investigator on an individual patient level whereby patient safety always needs to be at the centre of decision-making (see Section 1.4 ).
In exceptional cases, when it is impossible to conduct the visits at the trial site, visits may be 
performed at the patient’s home or remotely (via telephone and/or internet based means of communication). The visits may also be performed as a combination of home and remote visits. Based on a thorough benefit-risk assessment (see Section 1.4 ), the visit procedures 
may be adjusted for the purpose of particular visits, whereby critical safety measures will 
remain in place. All home/remote visits need to be discussed with and approved by the sponsor.
Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country need to be respected for 
all modifications. Patients need to be informed about the modifications and agree to them before implementation (see Section 8.2 ).
Under these circumstances, the below modifications can be considered. 
Remote visit
If a patient is not able to come to the site for an in-clinic trial visit, a remote visit (by phone) 
should be performed instead and all assessments that can be done by phone performed.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (14 0) / Saved on: 17 Oct 2016The following study data may be collected/reported during phone contacts: Adverse events, concomitant therapies, C-SSRS, birth control check (for women of childbearing potential), SCoRS and PANSS, , and study medication and CCT compliance checks. Patients can report and/or send photos of study medication kit used to their site staff, if needed and possible.
Additional guidance for assessing specific symptoms as part of adverse event check during 
phone contacts is available to investigators and should be followed.
MCCB cannot be done via phone, but in certain situations it may be possible to complete 
some MCCB sub-tests (enough to derive a composite score) via videoconference between the rater and the patient, if agreed with sponsor. If necessary during COVID-19 pandemic, based on the REP for BI 425809 (as defined in Section 1.2 ), Visit 6/(e)EoT Visit may be delayed up 
to 10 days following the last dose of trial medication, in case this helps to facilitate an in-
clinic trial visit with MCCB assessment.
Safety and other laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG
If blood sampling for central lab at the trial site is not possible, safety lab analyses can be 
performed at a local laboratory. The results of the lab tests must be transferred to the investigator who ensures medical review and proper documentation in the eCRF.Recommended minimum safety lab parameters are: Hematology, Urea (BUN), Creatinine, eGFR, liver enzymes, pregnancy test (for WOCBP).
If home visits are possible, some assessments can be done at the patient’s home (e.g. 
collection of blood and urine samples to be sent to the central lab, vital signs).
Direct-to-patient shipment of trial medication
If a patient is not able to come to Visit 3, Visit 4 or Visit 5 as planned but the investigator 
considers it favorable and safe for the patient to continue on trial medication, the trial medication can be shipped from site directly to the patient (if acceptable according to local laws and regulations). Such shipments require the use of a sponsor approved courier to the patient’s home. Investigators should conduct phone visits first to discuss adverse events, concomitant therapies, C-SSRS, birth control check, and assess study medication and CCT compliance. If possible and as per investigator’s clinical judgement, safety laboratory tests should be done at a local laboratory.

TITLE  Randomized, Double -blind, Parallel -group, Placebo -controlled, 
Dose -ranging Study of Piromelatine in Patients with Mild Dementia 
Due to Alzheimer’s Disease  
STUDY PHASE  2 
COUNTRIES  United States 
ESTIMATED NUMBER OF 
CENTERS  Approximately 75 sites 
STUDY RATIONALE  Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly population. People 
progressing to AD develop distressing changes in memory, thought, 
function , and behavior, which worsen over time. These changes 
increasingly impact the person's daily life and reduce their 
independence until ultimately these pati ents are entirely dependent 
on others (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010 ). Worldwide, it is estimated 
that about 36  million people have dementia. Alzheimer’s disease 
accounts for 50 % to 80% of these patients  (Duthey, 2013 ). At 
early -stage AD, the episodic memo ry is the most noticeable 
impairment (Gold and Budson, 2008 ). With the shift to wards an 
increasingly elderly population, it is predicted that the number of 
people affected by early -stage AD that will progress to dementia will 
almost double every 20 years, and by the year 2050, 115 million 
people will have the condition  (Duthey, 2013 ). Effective treatments 
for the devastating disease are urgently needed as the world’s 
population continues to age.  
The diagnosis of AD is generally based on consensus diagnostic 
criteria developed by the National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's 
Association (NIA -AA) (McKhann et al., 2011 ). These criteria are 
clinical in nature and require that patients must exhibit impairments 
in both cognitive  and functional domains. In the earliest clinical 
stages of AD, subtle cognitive deficits may be evident only through 
use of sensitive measures of neuropsychological performance. 
Thereafter, but before developing overt dementia, patients proceed 
through a clinical phase where cognition becomes increasingly 
affected and relatively mild but detectable impairments in some 
functional abilities emerge as well.  
The hallmark pathological feature of AD is the presence of brain 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 5/92 
 
 
 plaques, consisting primarily of β -amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates 
(Selkoe, 2002 ). Accordingly, the abnormal production and 
aggregation of Aβ, associated particularly with late -stage disease, 
has been the principal target of many drug development efforts. 
However, 3  trials of Aβ lowering agents involving patients with 
overt dementia failed to show improvements in cognition. A leading 
theory posits that the attempts at intervention may have been made 
too late in the progression of disease, at a stage when neuronal 
damage had become too widespread, and there fore more trials now 
focus on patients in whom overt dementia seems imminent. An ideal 
drug for such patients will improve neuropsychological performance 
and functional abilities, slow down Aβ buildup, and promote 
neuroprotection and neurogenesis.  
The investigational compound, N -(2-(5-methoxy -1H-indol -3-
yl)ethyl) -4-oxo-4H-pyran -2-carboxamide (piromelatine) is a novel 
melatonin MT1, 2, and 3 and serotonin 5 -HT-1A and -1D receptors 
agonist with a different proposed mechanism of action than currently 
avail able AD medications. Through this unique molecular mode of 
action, piromelatine demonstrated in preclinical studies in rodents 
neuroprotective (Buendia et al., 2014 , Tang et al., 2012 ), memory 
enhancing (He et al., 2013 , Tian et al., 2010 ), sleep promoting (Liu 
et al., 2014 ), and neurogeneration enhancing capabilities (Tian et al ., 
2015 unpublished) with relevance to AD risk factors, comorbidities , 
and symptoms. The 5HT -1a agonists have demon strated 
neuroprotective effects (Kline et al., 2004 ) by increasing both cell 
proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone 
of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (Banasr et al., 200 4, 
Islam et al., 2014 ) and increase slow wave sleep (SWS)  specifically 
by inhibition of hypothalamic orexin neurons and the dorsal raphe 
nuclei that act as wake promoting centers (Muraki et al., 2004 , 
Tabuchi et al., 2013 ). Simultaneous activation of melatonergic and 
5HT-1a receptors may synergistically promote neurogenesis (Fava et 
al., 2012 ). 
The sleep enhancing capacities of piromelatine may also be relevant 
to the therapeutic potential. Recent clinical and biochemical 
evidence has identified an interesting lin k between sleep, Aβ, 
cognitive dysfunction , and AD. In mice, Aβ clearance through the 
glymphatic system (the biomolecule clearance system operating the 
convective flow between the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and 
interstitial fluid to remove toxic metabolites ) is strongly stimulated 
by sleep (Mendelsohn and Larrick, 2013 , Xie et al., 2013 ). 
Bidirectional relationships between sleep and Aβ production have 
been demonstrated in mice overexpressing Aβ (Roh et al., 2012 ). In 
humans, normal soluble Aβ concentrations in the CSF fluctuate with 
the sleep -wake cycle with 6 hours delay (Huang et al., 2012 ). 
Disruption of non -rapid eye movement ( NREM) SWS resulted in 
impaired overnight consolidation of long -term memory in healthy 
older adults (Mander et al., 2015 ). Since Aβ production is highest at 
times of neural activity  such as during wakefulness and lowest at 
times of decreased neural activity such as during SWS, sleep 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 6/92 
 
 
 disturbances accompanied by loss of SWS may lead to an increase in 
production of soluble CSF Aβ, increased Aβ aggregation, and 
attenuation of the Aβ diur nal pattern characterizing AD (Lucey and 
Bateman, 2014 ). Bidirectional relations between Aβ pathology and 
NREM sleep physiology were observed also in patients with mild 
cognitive impairmen t (MCI) and AD. In MCI patients the reduction 
in SWS was associated with deficits in sleep dependent memory 
consolidation (Pace -Schott and Spencer, 201 5). Moreover, MCI 
patients had modified sleep structure characterized by shorter and 
disrupted SWS and lower ∆ and Θ power as compared to controls 
(Westerberg et al., 2012 ). In AD patients, higher SWS was positively 
associated with retrieval of recent autobiographical memories 
(Rauchs et al., 2013 ). 
Indeed, 63% of the patients with subtle cognitive deficits (also 
termed MCIs ) (McKinnon et al., 2014 ) and 44% of the patients 
diagnosed with AD (Vitiello and Borson, 2001 ) demonstrate sleep 
disturbances as determined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality  Index 
(PSQI). More recently , neuropathological analyses revealed a 
positive correlation between total sleep time, sleep quality, and s leep 
onset latency in demented and nondemented older adults with higher 
Aβ burden in specific brain areas that are linked to early AD (Spira 
et al., 2013 ). Accordingly, deterioration in cognition from healthy 
controls through MCI to AD patients was associated with parallel 
deterioration in sleep (Economou et al., 2013 ). The presence of 
insomnia may thus help identify patients with early signs of AD who 
are at a gre ater risk of deteriorating to dementia.  
The relation becomes evident as poor sleep is directly associated 
with cognitive decline in healthy (Miyata et al., 2013 ) cognitively 
impaired (McKinnon et al., 2014 ) and demented adult populations 
(Vitiello et al., 1990 ), including AD (Carpenter et al., 199 6, 
McCurry et al., 1999 ). Further exploration of interventions that 
promote NREM SWS and minimize the progression of 
neurodegeneration and the cognitive dysfunction associated with Aβ 
pathology is needed (Mander et al., 2015 ). 
Importantly, the mechanism of sleep induction appears to be of key 
importance for the sought cognitive effects. Long -term use of 
benzodiazepine is associate d with an increased risk of dementia 
(Billioti de Gage et al., 2012 ) and AD (Billioti de Gage et al., 2014 , 
Yaffe a nd Boustani, 2014 ), presumably because of the known 
suppression of NREM SWS by benzodiazepines and 
nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Arbon et al., 2015 ). Treatment of 
patients with AD suffering from sleep disturbances with traditional 
hypnotics is associated with increased risk for a wide range of 
injuries (Chung et al., 2013 , Diem et al., 2014 ) and may actually 
worsen their cognition and memory (Hall-Porter et al., 2014 ). In 
contrast, melatonin  receptor agonism , which maintains the NREM 
SWS (Arbon et al., 2015 ), appears beneficial for cognition and 
functioning in mild to moderate AD patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, piromelatine (2, 5, 20, 50, 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 7/92 
 
 
 and 200 mg) was found to be safe and well tolerated with no serious 
adverse events (SAE s) and showed a favorable, dose -proportional 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following oral intake. In addition, 
piromelatine intake was associated with increase in fatigue and total 
sleep time in the volunteers in a dose -dependent manner (Yalkinoglu 
et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in 
insomnia patients, piromelatine (2, 5, 20, and 50 mg) had a favorable  
PK profile without any sign of accumulation. This study also 
suggested dose -dependent beneficial effects of piromelatine on sleep 
continuity measures. Importantly, in this study piromelatine 
administered for 5 days to nondemented patients with insomnia ha d 
no detrimental nor beneficial effect on learning and memory as 
measured using the word -pair association  task (Laudon et al., 2012 ). 
In a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, sleep laboratory study 
in ins omnia patients (aged 18 -80), piromelatine (20 mg and 50 mg 
daily for 1 month) enhanced sleep maintenance (wake after sleep 
onset [WASO]) measured by polysomnography (PSG) significantly 
in comparison to placebo (Neurim press release, 2013). Piromelatine 
enhanced NREM ∆ power (NREM SWS) and decreased NREM β 
power, a fast electroencephalogram (EEG) activity that is considered 
to be related to the hyperarousal state experienced by insomniac 
patients (Merica et al., 1998 ). Both effects may be beneficial for 
early AD and AD patients to enhance Aβ clearance from the brain 
(Grandy, 2013 ). Overall, piromelatine was generally safe and well 
tolerated. There were no SAEs during the conduct of this study. 
Adverse event (AE) rates during double -blind treatment with study 
medication were low (6.7% in the piromelatine 20 mg group, 0% in 
the piro melatine 50  mg and placebo groups). Laboratory values were 
within normal ranges. No clinically meaningful changes in vital 
signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or physical examinations were 
observed. No suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation (Columbia 
Suicide  Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS]) was recorded at any time 
during the study.  
Altogether, through its action at melatonin  receptors, piromelatine 
may improve sleep, circadian rhythms control , and, subsequently , 
cognition in the patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). Throu gh the 
serotonergic mechanism , piromelatine may improve memory and 
mood (Rodríguez et al., 2012 ), enhance SWS, and reduce 
wakefulness (Bjorvatn and Ursin, 1998 , Monti and Monti, 2000 ). 
Through the combined activation of melatonergic and 5HT -1a 
receptors, piromelatine may act synergistically to in crease 
neurogenesis (Fava et al., 2012 ). 
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
dose-ranging study of piromelatine (5, 20, and 50 mg daily for 
6 months) versus placebo to determine an effective dose to take 
forward to Phase 3 studies based on efficacy (cognitive 
performance), safety , and tolerability in patients with mild dementia 
due to AD.

STUDY DESIGN  
 This is a Phase 2, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 
dose-ranging safety and efficacy study of piromelatine in patients 
with mild dementia due to AD.  
Patients with a documented history of mild dementia due to AD for at 
least 6 months , having an MMSE score of 20 to 27 (inclusive ) at 
Screening (a s core of 27 is allowed  only if accompanied by a score of 
≥ 12 in the ADAS -cog11 portion of the ADAS -cog14 at Screening ), 
and a Clinical Dementia Rating Global S core (CDR -GS) of 0.5 or  1 
will be recruited and further screened for eligibility . Caregiver 
commitment for the study is also necessary.  
At Screening (Visit 1), patients w ill undergo neuropsychiatric 
assessments, psychometric testing , and general medical assessments 
(including medical history, pre -existing conditions, physical 
examination, vital signs , and ECG). If patients have not had brain 
imaging  with findings consisten t with the diagnosis of dementia due 
to AD in the last 12 months , a computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained to rule out 
clinically significant comorbid pathologies.  
Eligible patients will start a 2 -week run -in period of placebo (single 
blind), followed by 26 weeks of double -blind treatment comprising 
administration of piromelatine or placebo, for a total treatment 
duration of 28 weeks. During the double -blind period, patients will be 
enrolled in a 1.2:1:1:1 rand omization ratio to the 4 trial arms (placebo 
[1.2], and the equal piromelatine treatment arms 5, 20, and 50  mg 
[1:1:1]).  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 10/92 
 
 
 Intermediate visits will be carried out at 4 weeks (Visit 3) and 
13 weeks (Visit 4) after randomization . A follow -up phone call to 
elicit any safety concerns will be completed 2 weeks after the last 
dose of study medication. Patients who discontinue prior to Visit  5 
(Week 26) will be brought back for a termination visit.  
Assuming an effect size between treatment dose and placebo of 0.35 
over 26 weeks, a significant level (α) of 0.05, and power of 88%, a 
sample size of 143 patients for the placebo arm and 119  patients for 
each of the 3 piromelatine arms is calculated. Assuming a 50% screen 
failure rate and allowing for 15% patient withdrawa l, 1150 patients 
should be screened in order to randomly assign 575 patients, of whom 
it is expected 500 will complete the study.  
Piromelatine (5, 20 , and 50 mg tablets) and placebo will be 
administered orally, once daily after a meal, before habitual bedtime , 
preferably between 2100h and 2300h. Patients will be required to 
spend at least 2 hours a day exposed to daylight.  
STUDY DURATION  The study consists of a  2-week run -in period of single -blind placebo 
and a 26 -week, randomized, double -blind treatme nt period comprising 
administration of piromelatine or placebo, for a total treatment 
duration of 28 weeks . 
A follow -up phone call to elicit any safety concerns will be completed 
2 weeks after the last dose of study medication.

Secondary  parameters  - CGIC  
- ADCS -MCI -ADL  
- ADAS -cog14  
- Global composite score of the cNTB  
- Episodic memory domain of the cNTB  
- Attention domain of the cNTB  
- Executive function domain  
Exploratory parameters  - MMSE  
- cNTB individual scores  
- NPI 
- PSQI  
- ADAS -cog13, ADAS -cog12, and ADAS -cog11  
SAFETY PARAMETERS  Vital signs measurements (heart rate and blood pressure), reported 
AEs or SAEs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead ECGs, 
Sheehan -STS 
PRIMARY EFFICACY 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 The cNTB global composite score (ISLT immediate and delayed 
recall, OCL, identification, detection, and OBK) will be summarized 
at baseline and after 4, 13, and 26 weeks of double -blind treatment 
(actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using 
descriptive statistics (n,  mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum). The primary efficacy analysis will be carried out using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and study 
site as the main effects and baseline cNTB global z -score as the 
covar iate. To evaluate the effect of missing cNTB items, multiple 
imputations will be used for the calculation of cNTB composite scores 
in the case of 1 or 2 missing cNTB items.  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be carried out using a mixed -effects 
maximum likel ihood repeated measures (MMRM) model utilizing all 
baseline and postbaseline data  to assess any differences in treatment 
effects over time . The model shall include fixed effects of treatment, 
study site, visit, and treatment by visit interaction, with base line score 
as a covariate, and a baseline by visit interaction.  The global treatment 
effect estimates will be reported, with 95% confidence intervals and 
P values. 
SECONDARY EFFICACY 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze 
all secondary efficacy endpoints: CGIC, ADCS -MCI -ADL, 
ADAS -cog14, cNTB global composite score, cNTB episodic memory 
domain composite score (ISLT and OCL), cNTB attention domain 
composite score (identification and detection), and executive functi on 
composite score (COWAT and CFT). The MMRM model also will be 
used for the analysis of ADCS -MCI -ADL, cNTB various domains 
composite score (identification and detection) and executive function

 composite score.  
EXPLORATORY 
EFFICACY STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS   The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze 
the exploratory efficacy endpoints: MMSE, individual cNTB scores, 
NPI, PSQI (global score and individual components), and 
ADAS -cog13, ADAS -cog12, and ADAS -cog11 scores.  
Additionally, the MMRM mode l will be used for the analysis of 
individual cNTB scores and the PSQI global and individual 
component scores.  
SAFETY ANALYSIS  Descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, change in physical 
examination parameters, and vital signs. The number of patients 
taking concomitant medications during the 28 -week treatment period 
(2-week single -blind placebo run -in period followed by 26 -week 
double -blind treatment period) will be summarized by WHO drug 
classification code for each treatment group. The numbe r of patients 
withdrawing during the treatment periods will be summarized by 
primary  reason for withdrawal for each treatment group.  
The number of patients reporting AEs will be summarized during the 
28-week treatment period by body system and preferred te rm for each 
treatment group.  
The change in laboratory parameters from baseline (end of the first 
week) to the end of the 28 -week treatment period will be summarized 
using shift tables showing the number of patients having values 
below, within , and above th e normal range at each assessment for 
each treatment group separately. Data will not be carried forward for 
patients withdrawing due to treatment failure.  
The change in physical examination parameters from baseline to the 
end of the 28 -week treatment perio d will be summarized as the 
number of patients who have a normal or abnormal examination at 
each assessment for each treatment group separately. Data will not be 
carried forward for patients withdrawing due to treatment failure.  
Vital signs will be summari zed at baseline and at the end of the 
28-week treatment period (actual and change from baseline) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum).  
The number of patients withdrawing during the 28 -week treatment 
period will be summar ized by primary  reason for withdrawal for each 
treatment group.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed on the safety data . 
These safety parameters will be assessed using the safety analysis set.

 8. INTRODUCTION  
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder , is the leading cause of 
dementia in the elderly population. People progressing to A D develop distressing changes in 
memory, thought, function , and behavior, which worsen over time. These changes increasingly 
impact t he person's daily life and reduce their independence until ultimately these patients are 
entirely dependent on others (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010 ). Worldwide, it is estimated that 
about 36  million people have dementia. A lzheimer’s disease  accounts for 50 % to 80% of these 
patients  (Duthey, 2013 ). At early-stage AD , the episodic memory is the most noticeable 
impairment (Gold and Budson, 2008 ). With the shift towards an increasingly elderly population, 
it is predicted that the number of people affected by early-stage AD that will progress to 
dementia will almost double every 20 years, and by the year 2050, 115 million people will have 
the condition  (Duthey, 2013 ). Effective treatments for the devastating disease are urgently 
needed as the world’s population continues to age.  
The diagnosis of AD is generally bas ed on consensus diagnostic criteria developed by the 
National Institute on Aging -Alzheimer's Association (NIA -AA) (McKhann et al., 2011 ). These 
criteria are clinical in n ature and require that patients must exhibit impairments in both cognitive 
and functional domains. In the earliest clinical stages of AD, subtle cognitive deficits may be 
evident only through use of sensitive measures of neuropsychological performance. The reafter, 
but before developing overt dementia, patients proceed through a clinical phase where cognition 
becomes increasingly affected and relatively mild but detectable impairments in some functional 
abilities emerge as well.  
The hallmark pathological fea ture of AD is the presence of brain plaques, consisting primarily of 
β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates (Selkoe, 2002 ). Accordingly, the abnormal production and 
aggregation of Aβ, associated particularly with late -stage disease, has been the principal target of 
many dr ug development efforts. However, 3 trials of Aβ lowering agents involving patients with 
overt dementia failed to show improvements in cognition. A leading theory posits that the 
attempts at intervention may have been made too late in the progression of dis ease, at a stage 
when neuronal damage had become too widespread , and therefore more trials now focus on 
patients in whom overt dementia seems imminent. An ideal drug for such patients will improve 
neuropsychological performance and functional abilities, sl ow down Aβ buildup, and promote 
neuroprotection and neurogenesis.  
The investigational compound, N -(2-(5-methoxy -1H-indol -3-yl)ethyl) -4-oxo-4H-pyran -2-
carboxamide ( piromelatine) is a novel melatonin MT1, 2 , and 3 and serotonin 5 -HT-1A and -1D 
receptors agonist with a different proposed mechanism of action than currently available AD 
medications. Through this unique molecular mode of action , piromelatine demonstrated in 
preclinical studies in rodents neuroprotective (Buendia et al., 2014 , Tang et al., 2012 ), memory 
enhancing (He et al., 2013 , Tian et al., 2010 ), sleep promoting (Liu et al., 2014 ), and 
neurogeneration enhancing capabilities (Tian et al ., 2015 unpublished) with relevance to AD risk 
factors, comorbidities , and symptoms. The 5HT-1a agonists ha ve demonstrated neuroprotective 
effects (Kline et al., 2004 ) by increasing both cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the 
hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (Banasr et al., 
2004, Islam et al., 2014 ) and increase slow wave sleep ( SWS ) specifically by inhibition of 
hypothalamic orexin neurons and the dorsal raphe nuclei that act as wake promoting centers

 (Muraki et al., 2004 , Tabuchi et al., 2013 ). Simultaneous activation of melatonergic and 5HT -1a 
receptors may synergistically promote neurogenesis (Fava et al., 2012 ). 
The sleep enhancing capacities of piromelatine may also be relevant to the therapeutic potential. 
Recent clinical and biochemical evidence has identified an interesting link between sleep, Aβ, 
cognitive dysfunction , and A D. In mice, Aβ clearance through the glymphatic system (the 
biomolecule clearance system operating the convective flow between the cerebrospinal fluid 
[CSF] and interstitial fluid to remove toxic metabolites) is strongly stimulated by sleep 
(Mendelsohn and Larrick, 2013 , Xie et al., 2013 ). Bidirectional relationships between sleep and 
Aβ production have been demonstrated in mice overexpressing Aβ (Roh et al., 2012 ). In humans, 
normal soluble Aβ concentrations  in the CSF fluctuate with the sleep -wake cycle with 6 hours 
delay (Huang et al., 2012 ). Disruption of non-rapid eye movement (N REM ) SWS resulted in 
impaired overnight consolida tion of long -term memory in healthy older adults (Mander et al., 
2015 ). Since Aβ production is highest at times of neural activity such as during wakefulness and 
lowest at times of decreased neural activity such as during SWS, sleep disturbances accompanied 
by loss of SWS may lead to an increase in production of soluble CSF Aβ, increased Aβ 
aggregation , and attenuation of the Aβ diurnal pattern characterizing AD (Lucey and Bateman, 
2014 ). Bidirection al relations between Aβ pathology and NREM sleep physiology were observed 
also in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In MCI patients the reduction in 
SWS was associated with deficits in sleep dependent memory consolidation (Pace -Schott and 
Spencer, 201 5). Moreover, MCI patients had modified sleep structure characterized by shorter 
and disrupted SWS and lower ∆ and Θ power as compared to controls (Westerberg et al., 2012 ). 
In AD patients, higher SWS was positively associated with retrieval of recent autobiographical 
memories (Rauchs et al., 2013 ). 
Indeed, 63% of the patients with subtle cognitive deficits (also termed MCIs ) (McKinnon et al., 
2014 ) and 44% of the patients diagnosed with AD (Vitiello and Borson, 2001 ) demonstrate sleep 
disturbances as determined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Qu ality Index (PSQI). More recently , 
neuropathological analyses revealed a po sitive correlation between total sleep time, sleep quality , 
and sleep onset latency in demented and nondemented older adults with higher Aβ burden in 
specific brain areas that are linked to early AD (Spira et al., 2013 ). Accordingly, deterioration in 
cognition from healthy controls through MCI to AD patients was associated with parallel 
deterioration in sleep (Economou et al., 2013 ). The presence of insomnia may thus help identify 
patients with early signs  of AD who are at a greater risk of deteriorating to dementia.  
The relation becomes evident as poor sleep is directly associated with cognitive decline in 
healthy (Miyata et al., 2013 ) cognitively impaired (McKinnon et al., 2014 ), and demented adult 
populations (Vitiello et al., 1990 ), including AD (Carpenter et al., 199 6, McCurry et al., 1999 ). 
Further exploration of interventions that promote NREM SWS  and minimize the progression of 
neurodegeneration and the cognitive dy sfunction associated with Aβ pathology is  needed  
(Mander et al., 2015 ). 
Importantly, the mechanism of sleep induction appears to be of key importance for the sought 
cognitive effec ts. Long -term use of benzodiazepine  is associated with an increased risk of 
dementia (Billioti de Gage et al., 2012 ) and AD (Billioti de Gage et al., 2014 , Yaffe and 
Boustani, 2014 ), presumably because of the known suppression of NREM  SWS by 
benzodiazepines and non benzodiazepine hypnotics (Arbon et al., 2015 ). Treatment of patients 
with AD suffering from sleep disturbances with traditional hypnotics is associated with increased 
risk for a wide range of injuries (Chung et al., 2013 , Diem et al., 2014 ) and may actually worsen 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 27/92 
 
 
 their cognition and memory (Hall-Porter et al., 2014 ). In contrast, melatonin receptor agonism , 
which maintains the NREM SWS (Arbon et al., 2015 ), appears beneficial for cognition and 
functioning in mild to moderate AD patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, piromelatine (2, 5, 20, 50, and 200 mg) was found to be 
safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events  (SAEs)  and showed a favorable, 
dose-proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following oral intake. In addition, piromelatine 
intake was associated with increase in fatigue and total sleep time in the volunteers in a 
dose-dependent manner (Yalkinoglu et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in 
insomnia patients , piromelatine (2,  5, 20, and 50 mg) had a favorable PK profile without any sign 
of accumulation. This study also suggested dose -dependent beneficial effects of piromelatine on 
sleep continuity measures. Importantly, in this study piromelatine administered for 5 days to 
nondemented patients with insomnia had no detrimental nor beneficial effect on learning and 
memory as measured using the word -pair association task (Laudon et al., 2012 ). In a Phase 2, 
randomized , placebo -controlled , sleep laboratory study in insom nia patients (age d 18-80), 
piromelatine (20 mg and 50 mg daily  for 1 month) enhanced sleep maintenance ( wake after sleep 
onset [ WASO ]) measured by polysomnography ( PSG) significantly in comparison to placebo 
(Neurim press release , 2013). Piromelatine enhanced NREM ∆ power ( NREM SWS) and 
decreased NREM β power, a fast electroencephalogram ( EEG ) activity that is considered to be 
related to the hyperarousal state experienced by insomniac patients (Merica et al., 1998 ). Both 
effects may be beneficial for early AD and AD patients to enhance Aβ clearance from the brain 
(Grandy, 2013 ). Overall, piromelatine was generally safe and well tolerated. There were no 
SAEs during the conduct of this study. A dverse event  rates during double -blind treatment with 
study medication were low (6.7% in the piromelatine 20 mg gr oup, 0% in the piromelatine 50 
mg and placebo groups). Laboratory values were within normal ranges. No clinically meaningful 
changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), or physical examinations were observed. No 
suicidal behavior or suicidal ideatio n (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS ]) was 
recorded at any time during the study.  
Altogether, through its action at melatonin receptors, piromelatine may improve sleep, circadian 
rhythms control , and, subsequently , cognition in the patients (Wade et a l., 2014 ). Through the 
serotonergic mechanism , piromelatine may improve memory and mood (Rodríguez et al., 2012 ), 
enhance SWS , and reduce wakefulness (Bjorvatn and Ursin, 1998 , Monti and Monti, 2000 ). 
Through the combined activation of melatonergic and 5HT -1a receptors , piromelatine may act 
synergistically to increase neurogenesis (Fava et al., 2012 ). 
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlle d, dose-ranging study of piromelatine (5, 
20, and 50 mg daily for 6 months) versus  placebo to determine an effective dose to take forward 
to Phase 3 studies based on efficacy (cognitive performance) , safety , and tolerability in patients 
with mild dementia due to AD.

 10. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
10.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  AND PLAN  
This is a Phase 2, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, dose ranging safety and 
efficacy study of piromelatine in patients with mild dementia due to  AD. 
Following informed consent, p atients with a documented history of mild dementia due to AD for 
at least 6 months , having an MMSE score of 20 to 27 (inclusive ) at Screening  (a score of 27 is 
allowed only if accompanied  by a score of ≥  12 in the ADAS -cog11 portion of the ADAS -cog14 
at Screening ) and a Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR -GS) of 0.5 or 1 will be 
recruited and further screened for eligibility.  Caregiver commitment fo r the study is also 
necessary ( defined as someone  who is not expected to change during the course of the study , and 
is responsible for the overall care of the patient at home ). 
At Screening  (Visit 1) , patients will undergo neuropsychiatric assessments, psychometric testing 
and general medical assessment s (including medical history, pre -existing conditions, physical 
examination , vital signs , and ECG ). A computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging ( MRI ) scan will be obtained  to rule out clinically significant comorbid pathologies  for 
patients who did not have this scan in the last 12 months before Screening . Patients who had a 
past (more than 12 months or less than 12 months before) CT or MRI scan indicating 
incompatibility w ith a diagnosis of probable AD  should not be screened.  The medical monitor 
should be contacted when there are questions about eligibility. Rescreening will be allowed on 
specific cases following a decision by the medical monitor .  
Potentially eligible patients will be given a bottle of run -in placebo (single blind) with 
instructions not to begin taking the doses until they receive a phone call from the site staff. Site 
staff will send  MMSE, Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ), ADAS -cog, and documented histor y of 
cognitive deterioration of these potential eligible patients to  be centrally reviewed. After 
confirmation of eligibility from the central reviewer, eligible patients will start a 2 -week run -in 
period of placebo  (single blind) , followed by 26 weeks of double -blind treatment comprising 
administration of piromelatine or placebo, for a total treatment duration of 28 weeks. During the 
double -blind period, patients will be enrolled in a 1.2:1:1:1  randomization ratio to the 4 trial 
arms ( placebo  [1.2] , and the equal piromelatine treatment arms 5, 20 , and 50  mg [1:1:1] ).  
Intermediate visits will be carried out at 4 weeks ( Visit 3) and 13  weeks ( Visit 4) after 
randomization. A follow -up phone call to elicit any safety concerns will be completed 2 weeks 
after the last dose of study medication. Patients who discontinue prior to Visit  5 (Week 26) will 
be brought back for a termination visit.  
Piromelatine will  be administered orally, once daily, after a meal, before habitual bedtime, 
preferably between 2100h and 2 300h. Patients will be required to spend at least 2 hours a day 
exposed to daylight .

 10.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
Piromelatine proposed mode of action and previous studies suggest that this molecule may 
improve cognitive performance  via its effects on sleep and neuroprotective pathways . Sleep 
effects were demonstrated after 4 weeks of treatment  in a Phase 2 sleep labo ratory study . 
Cognition effect s are expected to be seen after 26 weeks of treatment as has been shown 
previously with melatonin administered to a similar population of patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
The cognitive outcome measure mostly used in AD clinical trial s, the ADAS -cog, is a scale 
based on a series of items that assess different aspects of cognitive function known to be relevant 
to the cognitive dysfunction that characterizes AD (Greenberg e t al., 2013 ). However , over the 
past 10 years the ADAS -cog has been shown to have poor sensitivity in discerning cognitive 
change in patients with MCI and early AD (Gold, 2007 ; Greenberg et al., 2013 ; Grundman et al., 
2004 ; Sevigny et al., 2010 ). Given the importance of formal neuropsychological approaches to 
the diagnosis and management of AD in patie nts with mild and moderate AD, several 
neuropsychological tests h ave been combined to construct a Neuropsychological Test Battery 
(NTB) (Harrison et al., 2007 ). In accord with the approaches to constructing the NTB for clinical 
trials in AD, the tests to be used in the NTB for this study have been selected on the basis of  the 
following:  
a) demonstrated validity for the target cognitive domain  
b) demonstrated acceptability in patients with some diminished intellectual function due to 
AD 
c) acceptable estimates of test -retest reliability in patients with AD  
d) demonstrated sensitivity to cog nitive change in AD (eg, related to drug effects or disease 
progression)  
Dosage specification was made on the basis of previous studies and the relative affinity to the 
melatonin and serotonin receptors.  
The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to  make direct comparison between the active 
treatment groups and placebo.  
The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased, study. The placebo group is a 
comparator group for efficacy and safety assessment.  
Within -subject variation in psychome tric test scores is common in AD patients. This could be the 
result of measurement error or reflection of the fluctuation in the patient’s condition. Both cases 
may influence the final score. The first problem of rater errors will be addressed  by employing  
strict rater training and by vigorous real -time monitoring of rater performances. In addition, in 
order to avoid habituation problem s, all patients will receive a practice assessment prior to their 
baseline  measurements  (NTB and ADAS -cog14). 
10.3.  SAFETY MONITORING AND  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BO ARD  
Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the sponsor  (Neurim Pharmaceuticals 
[1991] Ltd)  and the medical monitor. Safety data will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
an independent  Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ). The DSMB will be assembled to 
review safety  and tolerability data collected during the study . Based on its ongoing assessment of 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 35/92 
 
 
 the safety and tolerability of piromelatine , the DSMB will provide recommendations to the 
sponsor for modifying, stopping , or continuing the study as planned. Details on the safety

present a serious risk of suicide.  
11.1.4  Patient Eligibility Review  
One of the keys to study  success is validation of appropriate patient selection. Clinical  review for 
patient  eligibility and appropriate symptom severity level confirmation can enhance the subject 
selection process and optimize clinical trial outcomes. The mere presence of surveillance 
improves the integrity of subject selection given that sites are aware that a  site-independent body 
is monitoring subject eligibility data.  
For patients found eligible by the sites , records of the MMSE, CDR , and documentation of 
cognitive decline complaint over at least 6 months by patient  will be reviewed. The results of the 
ADAS -cog14 administered as a practice session during Screening will be reviewed as well. The 
ADAS -cog11 portion of the ADAS -cog14  will be part of the eligibility approval  only in cases 
where the MMSE score is 27 . MMSE, CDR , and ADAS review will also include audio captur e 
and review of the interviews.  
These records will be reviewed by a team of independent certified clinicians who will approve 
eligibility. In cases where issues are identified , the investigator will be contacted to discuss 
patient eligibility on a peer -to-peer basis. The discussion will include the relevant data, the 
possible exclusionary finding , and any new data the investigator may have gathered. A decision 
to enroll a patient will be made by the investigator after consultation with the revi ewing 
clinician. All communication regarding subject eligibility will be documented and filed.  
11.1. 5 Removal of Patient s from Therapy or Assessments  
Patient s who fail to fulfill the enrol lment criteria at the Visit 1 screening evaluation will be 
withdrawn  from the study prior to receipt of any study medication.  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 41/92 
 
 
 Patients withdrawn from the study prior to randomization would be considered as “screen 
failure .” 
Patients withdrawn from the study after randomization would be considered as “drop -out.” 
Patient s may withdraw their consent at any time during the study or may be withdrawn by the 
investigator at any time. Neurim Pharmaceuticals (1991) Ltd reserves the right to withdraw 
patient s from the study on the grounds that a serious protocol violation has occ urred. In case of 
dispute, the principal investigator’s opinion will prevail.  
The date and reason for withdrawal as well as the data collected up to that time should be 
recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
Patient s who withdraw from the stud y after receiving any study medication will be required to 
return to  the study site for a Premature Discontinuation Visit for safety assessments to be 
performed. Once a patient  has been withdrawn , he/she may not re -enter the study, and the 
medication that was designated for this patient  cannot be given to any other patient . 
11.2 TIMINGS THROUGHOUT T HE STUDY  
11.2.1  Overall Study Schedule  
It is intended to have an 18-month recruitment period. Each patient  will undergo a 2-week , 
single -blind , run-in period  and a 26-week , randomized , double -blind treatment period , for a t otal 
of 28  weeks. Two weeks after last dosing of study medication , the caregiver will receive a 
follo w-up phone  call. The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 40 months  from 
first patient  screened to final patient  comple ting the randomized treatment.  
An integrated clinical study report in the format of the International Conference on 
Harmonisation Tripart ite Guideline E3: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
(ICH E3) will be written within 3 months of the last patient  completing the study .

 12. TREATMENTS  
12.1 TREATMENTS ADMINISTE RED  
Throughout the study, all study medication is to be administered orally, 1 tablet daily, taken 
before going to bed , preferably between  2100h and 2300h , and after food consumption.  
Upon completion of the 2 -week, single -blind run-in period,  patient s will be random ly assigned  in 
a 1.2 :1:1:1 ratio to placebo (1.2) or to 1 of 3 active treatment arms  (1:1:1)  as follows:  
Active Medication  
Piromelatine 5, 20, or 50 mg tablet s 
Placebo Medication  
Matched placebo tablets, with identical features to the piromelatine tablets, will be used as 
control treatment  
At the end of the study, each investigator will forward all unused medication packs together with 
any study medicati on that has not been allocated to  the clinical supply vendor for destruction . 
Piromelatine  tablets  are pink and oval shape d. Tablets will be packaged in polyethylene 
terephthalate bottles  containing 35 tablets. Patient s will receive sufficient medication at the 
randomization  visit (Visit 2) to provide enough  tablets for the period  of treatment between visits 
to allow for loss of tablets and for arrival at the  scheduled visit up to 3 days after the scheduled 
date. For the period between Visit 2 (randomization) and Visit 3 ( Week 4) , each patient will 
receive 1 bottle with 35  tablets. For the period between Visit 3 (Week 4) and Visit 4 (Week 13), 
each patient will receive 2 bottle s containing  35 tablets each ( total of 70 tablets). For the period 
between Visit 4 (Week 13) and Visit 5 (Week 26), each patient will receive 3 bottle s contain ing 
35 tablets  each (total of 105 tablets).

investigator's office, separate from other drugs. It should not be exposed to sources of heat and is 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 43/92 
 
 
 to be kept at ro om temperature (15°C-25°C, or 59 °F-77°F ). The study medication may not be 
used for any purpose other than the present study ; the insurance coverage shall otherwise become 
null and void.  
12.2.2  Placebo  
The placebo is of identical appearance and formulation to the active piromelatine  tablet but 
contains no active piromelatine . 
12.2.3  Labelling Information  
The study medication bottles  will be labeled according to US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) requirements. The labeling on all bottles of study medication will include  the following : 
name of sponsor , pharmaceutical dosage form , route of administration , quantity of dosage units , 
batch numbers , bottle number, study number , patient  ID number , directions for use , “for clinical 
trial use only” , investi gator name , storage method , the statement “keep out of reach of children ,” 
and “Caution: New Drug – Limited by Federal Law (US) to investigational use .” 
12.3 SELECTION OF DOSE  IN THE STUDY  
The choice of doses (5 , 20, and 50 mg) to be orally administered in AD patients is defined 
according to the following clinical data . 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, piromelatine (2, 5, 20, 50, and 200 mg) was found to be 
safe and well tolerated with no SAE s and showed a favorable,  dose-proportional PK profile 
following oral intake. In addition, piromelatine intake was associated with increase in total sleep 
time in the volunteers in a dose -dependent manner  (Yalkinoglu et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b 
multiple ascending dose study in insomnia patients , piromelatine (2,  5, 20, and 50 mg) had a 
favorable PK profile without any sign of accumulation. This stud y also showed that piromelatine 
had some beneficial effects on sleep continuity measures and did not have an adverse effect on 
memory (Laudon et al., 2012 ). In a Phase 2, randomized , placebo -controlled , sleep laboratory 
study in insomnia patients (age d 18-80 years ), piromelatine (20 and 50 mg daily  for 1 month) 
enhanced sleep maintenance (WASO) measured by PSG significantly in comparison to placebo 
(Neurim press release , 2013 ). Piromelatine enhanced N REM ∆ power (deep sleep) and decreased 
NREM β power, a fast EEG activity that is considered to be related to the hyperarousal state 
experienced by insomniac patients (Merica et al., 1998 ). Both effects may be beneficial for AD 
patients to enhance Aβ clearance from the brain.  
12.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENT S TO TREATMENT GROUP S 
Commencing at Visit 1, all patients will be assigned an identification number. This identification 
number and the pa tient’s 3 initials must appear on all patient -related documents submitted to 
Neurim  Pharmaceuticals . When qualified for enrollment at Visit 2 , the patient will be random ly 
assigned  to 1 of 4 trial arms . 
12.5 SELECTION AND TIMING  OF DOSE FOR EACH PATIENT  
Upon completion of eligibility review, the caregiver will be instructed via telephone call to begin 
administration of study medication. The patient  will take the first dose of placebo that evening. 
After 2 weeks of single -blind placebo run -in, the patient  will be random ly assigned  to receive 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 44/92 
 
 
 either piromelatine (5 , 20, or 50 mg)  or placebo. The patient  will take the first dose of 
piromelatine /placebo in the evening of Visit 2. The dose of medication will be 1 tablet daily  in 
the evening after meals, before going to bed, preferably between  2100h and 2300h . 
12.6 DOSE ADJUSTMENT CRIT ERIA  
The dose will not change throughout the 26-week randomized double -blind treatment period.  
12.7 BLINDING  
The initial 2-week run -in period of this study is designed as single blind, with the patient  blinded 
to the medication he/she is  receiving. All patient s will receive placebo during the run -in period . 
The run -in will be followed by 26 weeks of double -blind treatment, where the investigator s, 
staff, and patient s will be unaware of the alloc ated treatment.  
The blinding will not be broken (unless in an emergency) until all completed eCRFs have been 
received by data management and the database is locked.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator m ay access patient treatment assignment through the 
interactive web response system ( IWRS ). This will be done only when the investigator decides 
that knowledge  of the treatment arm  is required. Except in emergency cases, treatment 
assignment should not be a ccessed  without discussion with the sponsor's safety officer. The date 
and reasons for  accessing treatment  assignment must be fully documented , and a  statement that 
the correct procedure was followed should be documented in the trial master file . 
12.8 GENETIC TESTING FOR APOE 4 STATUS  
Genetic testing for apolipoprotein E (APOE4) status is voluntary. Retrospective genetic 
information could be used. Patients requiring a blood test for APOE 4 status must  sign a separate 
ICF. The test should be performed during  the patient’s  last visit . 
12.9 PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
Patients receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment o f AD must have been taking 
the medication for at least 6 months before Baseline (Visit 2), t he daily dose must have re mained 
unchanged for 4 months prior to Baseline , and the dose must not be expected to change during 
study participation.  
Patients who stopped receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors before enrollment must be stable 
off acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  for 6 months before B aseline and must be agreeable to not 
restarting throughout the study.  
Patients not receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors must be agreeable to not starting it 
throughout the study.  
Patients taking memantine (with or without acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) must be on a stable 
dose for at least 3 months before Baseline  and plan to continue throughout the study.  
Patients taking antidepressants should be on a stable  dose for at least 3 months before the  
Screening visit  (Visit 1)  and throughout the study . 
The following medications are not allowed during the study or during the 5 weeks before the 
Screening visit (Visit 1) : 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 45/92 
 
 
  Fluvoxamine  
 Mirtazapine 
 Trazodone  
 Insulin  
A full list of prohibited medication is listed in Section 24 , APPENDIX  2 “PROHIBITED 
AND RESTRICTED MEDICATIONS .” 
Patients taking alternative pharmacotherapy for dementia (eg, Souvenaid, DHA 
[docosahexaenoic acid], phosphatidylserine, omega -3 fatty acids , ginkgo biloba, ginseng, 
Huperzia serrata, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, or any other supplement to improve cognitive 
function) should be on a stable dose f or at least 3 months before the Screening visit (Visit 1).  
Other n ecessary and permitted concomitant treatment should not be altered if it has been 
established and equilibrated for at least 4 weeks  prior to study enrol lment , unless the 
investigator(s) consider(s) that a change is necessary. This should first be discussed with the 
sponsor's safety officer who will assess whether the patient  is to be withdrawn.  
Continuous use of sedative -hypnotics or treatments used as a hypno tic (eg , all benzodiazepine s, 
zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon, barbiturates, buspirone and hydroxyzine , melato nin or 
melatonin agonists [ ramelteon ]) is not allowed during the study or during the 2 weeks before the 
Screening visit (Visit 1) . 
12.9.1 Rescue Medication  
Intermittent  use of short to medium -acting benzodiazepines , melatonin (up to 3 mg), ramelteon 
(up to 8 mg), eszopiclone (up to 2 mg), zaleplon (up to 5 mg) or zolpidem tartrate (≤  6.25 mg 
controlled release and ≤  10 mg tablet) is allowed when ab solutely necessary for intermittent 
sleep disturbances . Intermittent  use is defined as no more than 2 times a week. However , these 
medications cannot be used within 3  days of any study visit.  
12.10 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Treatment compliance will be calculated at each study visit by the investigator counting returned 
tablets and using the formula:  
Compliance (%) =  number of tablets actually taken   100  number of days since last visit  
Compliance between Visit 1 and Visit 2 should be calculated using number  of days since start of 
run-in. 
Any divergence from the accepted level of compliance (70% -130% of expected consumption) is 
to be investigated by the investigator and should lead to withdrawal of the patient  from the study.  
Treatment compliance will be recorded in the eCRF by the investigator.

13.1 CLINICAL  EFFICACY PARAMETERS  
13.1.1  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy parameter is the c NTB ( global  composite of 5 test scores ): 
1. Visual recognition learning task ( OCL ): The OCL task is a continuous visual recognition 
learning  task that assesses visual learning within a pattern separation model. Theoretical 
models of the pattern separation model specify that information is organized in 
orthogonal and distinct nonoverlapping representations so that new memories can be 
stored rap idly without interference. The OCL has been shown to be a valid test of 
learning and memory in MCI and AD. In this task , the patient must attend to the card in 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 52/92 
 
 
 the center of the screen and respond to the question , “Have you seen this card before in 
this ta sk?” If the answer is yes, patients are instructed to press the “YES” button, and the 
“NO” button if the answer is no. Normal playing cards are displayed (without joker 
cards). In this task, 4 cards are drawn at random from the deck and are repeated 
throughout the task. These 4 cards are interspersed with distractors (nonrepeating cards). 
The task ends after 80 trials, without rescheduling for postanticipatory correct trials. The 
primary perform ance measure for this task is the proportion of correct answers 
(accuracy), which is normalized using an arcsine square root transformation.  
2. Verbal Learning Task ( ISLT  – immediate and delayed ): The ISLT  is a 
computer -controlled verbal learning test. In this test , patients are read a list of 12 words. 
Each word is a concrete noun and describes an item of food that is found commonly in 
the culture/society in which testing is occurring. The examiner asks the patient “I am 
going to read to you a list of item s I want you to get from the 
supermarket/store/market/shop etc .” After the 12 words have been read, the patient  is 
asked to recall as many of the words as he/she can. If he/she  can recall no more words , 
the same list is read a second time with the words in  the same order after the same 
instruction. The process of reading the list and waiting for responses occurs 3 times. At 
the completion of the computerized battery , the patient  is asked to recall as many of the 
items as he/she can from the shopping list. T his provides a measure of delayed recall. 
The primary performance measure for this task is the total number of correct words 
recalled . 
3. Detection task : The Cogstate Detection task is a measure of simple reaction time and has 
been shown to provide a valid assessment of psychomotor function in healthy adults and 
in adults with MCI and AD. For this test, the patient  must press a “YES” response key as 
soon as he/she  detect s an event (ie , a card turning face up presented in the cent er of the 
computer screen). The software measures the response time to detect each event.  
4. Identification task : The Cogstate Identification task is a measure of choice reaction time  
and has been shown to provide a valid assessment of visual attention in MCI and AD. In 
this task an event (a card turning face up) occurs in the cent er of the computer screen and 
the patient  must decide “YES” or “NO” as to whether this event meets a prede fined and 
unchanging criterion ( eg, is the color of the card red?). The software measures the speed 
and accuracy of each response.  
5. Computerized One Back Working Memory task  (OBK) : The Cogstate One B ack 
memory task is a valid measure of working memory in MC I and AD. On this task the 
patient is shown a single stimulus in the cent er of the computer screen (a card turns face 
up). The  patient  must decide “YES” or “NO” as to whether the current card matches the 
card that had been seen on the immediately previous trial. The software measures the 
speed and accuracy of each response . 
13.1.2  Secondary Efficacy P arameters  
CGIC  
The ADCS -CGIC is a systematic method for assessing clinically significant change in a clinical 
trial as viewed by an independent skilled and experienced clinician. The ADCS -CGIC focuses on 
clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 53/92 
 
 
 performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and 
interview of infor mants. Unlike a targeted symptom scale, it takes into account a patient's overall 
function in the cognitive, behavioral,  and functional activity domains. Scoring is based on an 
interview with the caregiver and examination of the patient by an independent e valuator, without 
consulting other information such as cognitive test results. The ADCS -CGIC requires the 
assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an 
overall "global" assessment of clinical change (Schneider et al., 1997 ; Schneider et al., 2006 ). 
The ADCS -CGIC assessor must be blinded to all other data for the p atient after Visit 2.  
Daily living activity (ADCS -MCI -ADL)  
The ADCS -MCI -ADL is one out of several available measurements of the Activities of Daily 
Living ( ADL ) in the targeted study population (Gold, 2012 ), and it  is based on the work of the 
ADCS operating  in the US (Galasko et al., 2006 ). The ADCS -MCI -ADL is an 18 -item 
interview –based assessment  (question s 19-24 are not to be completed) , and its ratings will be 
based on an interview of the patient’s best (closest) informant by a rater from the clinic. Scale 
administration duration will be about 15 -30 minutes.  
ADAS -cog14 
The ADAS was designed to measure the severit y of the most important symptoms of  AD. Its 
subscale , ADAS -cog, is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials. It 
consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention , and other 
cognitive abiliti es that are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The test comprises 
11 items summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe 
impairment. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline. The addition of delayed 
recall, number cancelation , and maze tasks – and thus turning ADAS -cog into a 12 -, 13-, and 
14-item scale respectively  – has increased the ability to detect changes in patients in the early 
stages of the disease (Sano et al., 2011 ). 
Global Composite Score of the cNTB (composite of 5 test scores)  
The global composite score  of the cNTB is a composite score of the ISLT (immediate and 
delayed recall), OCL, Identification, Detection, and OBK tests. For more details on the 
individual tests, please refer to Section  13.1.1 . 
Episodic Memo ry Domain of the cNTB (composite of 2 test scores)  
The episodic memory domain of the cNTB is a composite score of the ISLT (immediate and 
delayed recall) and OCL tests.  
Attention Domain of the cNTB (composite of 2 test scores)  
The attention domain of the cNTB is a composite score of the Identification and Detection tests.  
Executive F unction  Domain  (composite of 3 test scores)  
1. Computerized One Back Working Memory task (OBK)  
2. Category Fluency Test (CFT) : In this task , the patient is given a category and is 
instructed to provide as many items as he/she can that belong to this category in 
60 seconds. The score on this test is the total number of correct words provided for each 
category.  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 54/92 
 
 
 3. Controlled Oral Words Association Test (COWAT) : The COWAT is a cognitive test of 
verbal processing ability used to assess brain impairment. Verbal processing ability and 
verbal fluency are considered executive functions. The emphasis on these tests focuses 
on the degree of discrepancy (as opposed to consistency) between current functioning 
and an estimated pre -impairment functioning. The COWAT assesses the patient’s ability 
to spontaneously produce words that begin with specific letters within a certain time 
limit. In particular, the tes t uses the letters F, A, and S.  
13.1.3  Exploratory Efficacy P arameters  
MMSE  
The MMSE is a brief assessment instrument used to assess cognitive function in elderly patients. 
The MMSE can be used to screen for cognitive impairment and as a measurement of cognit ion 
over time and with pharmacologic treatment. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first 
section measures orientation, memory, and attention: the maximum score is 21. The second 
section tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow v erbal and written commands, write 
a sentence, and copy figures: the maximum score is 9. The scoring range for the MMSE is 0 -30. 
The MMSE was shown to be both reliable and valid in a group of elderly subjects , including 
those with dementia, depression with cognitive impairment, depression , and “normal” elderly 
patients. The MMSE has been shown to possess sensitivity and specificity in various 
populations. Although the MMSE alone is unable to provide diagnostic information, the data on 
its sensitivity and specificity in cognitively impaired patients demonstrates its utility as a 
screening instrument.  
cNTB – Individual Scores  
The individual scores of the cNTB include ISLT (immediate and delayed recall), OCL, 
Ident ification, Detection, and OBK.  
NPI 
The scale consists of 1 2 domains that are rated for both frequency (range 1 -4) and severity 
(range  1-3). A composite score for each domain is calculated (frequency × severity) , which 
ranges from 1 to 12. There is a leadin g question for each item. If the symptom is not present then 
the frequency, severity , and distress scores are not completed. In this case , the score is 0 for the 
item. The sum of the composite scores yields the NPI -12 total score (range 0 -144). A negative 
change in score indicates an improvement from b aseline (symptom reduction) (Cummings et al., 
1994 ). 
PSQI  
The PSQI is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older 
adult. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep by measuring 7 areas: subjective sleep qual ity, 
sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping 
medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The  investigator with the patien t and 
caregiver  rate each of these 7 areas of sleep.  In cases of discrepancies , the caregiver answers 
prevail . Scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby  a score of 3 reflects the negative 
extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper (Buysse et 
al., 1989 ). 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 55/92 
 
 
 ADAS -cog13, ADAS -cog12, and ADAS -cog1 1 
The ADAS was designed to measure the severity of the most important symptoms of AD. Its 
subscale, ADAS -cog, is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials. It 
consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention, and other 
cognitive abilities that are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The test comprises 
11 items summed to a total score ranging from 0  to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe 
impairment. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline. The addition of delayed 
recall, number cancelation, and maze tasks – and thus turning ADAS -cog into a 12 -, 13-, and 
14-item scale respect ively – has increased the ability to detect changes in patients in the early 
stages of the disease (Sano et al., 2011 ). 
Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale  
The Sheehan -STS is a prospective rating scale that tracks both treatment -emergent suicidal 
ideation and behaviors. The Sheehan -STS is a 22-item scale that can be administered by either a 
clinician or patient through self -report.  
13.2 APPROPRIATENESS AND CONSISTENCY OF MEASU REMENTS  
These efficacy measurements have been used in other studies in elderly patients  and AD patients.  
13.3 CLINICAL SAFETY PARA METERS  
The safety parameters assessed at each visit will include spontaneously reported AEs  or SAEs, 
vital signs  measurements  (heart rate  and blood pressure), physical examination,  body weight , and 
clinical laboratory tests ( hematology, biochemistry , and urinalysis) . A 12-lead ECG  will be 
performed at Visit 1  (Screening) , Visit 4 ( Week 13), and Visit 5 ( Week 26; end-of-study visit ). 
The Sheehan -STS will also be rated at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 4 (Week 13), and Visit 5 (Week 
26; end -of-study visit).  
13.3.1 Routine Laboratory Procedures  
All blood and urine samples will be analyzed using a central laboratory. An operating manual 
specifying all the steps for the urine and blood sampling will be given to the person in charge of 
the sampling.  
The sampling will be performed at the s ite at Visits 1  (Screening) , 4, and 5 and  as soon as 
possible following the Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).  
The following parameters will be measured  for hematology : hemoglobin , hematocrit , red blood 
cells, mean corpuscular hemoglobin , mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration , white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils , 
and platelets.  
The following parameters will be measured  for biochemistry : creati nine, uric acid, urea, AST,  
ALT, albumin, GGT, total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, 
alkaline phosphatase , and total bilirubin.  
Prolactin  and testosterone levels will be measured from blood sampl es collected at Visits 1 and 
5. 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 56/92 
 
 
 13.3.2 Adverse Event s 
The recording of AEs is an important aspect of study documentation. Detailed guidelines are set 
out below.  
Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. An AE 
includes any noxious, pathological , or unintended change in anatomical, physiological , or 
metabolic functions as indicated by physical signs, symptoms , and/or laboratory changes , 
whether associated with the study medication  and whether or not considered d rug related. This 
includes an exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction , or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded 
elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy  assessments. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations 
of pre -existing conditions, including the disease under study, which do not represent a clinically 
significant exacerbation or worsening, need not be considered AEs. 
Patient  entry into the study is defined as the time at which informed consent is obtained (this 
must be before any protocol -specific diagnostic procedures or interventions  are performed ). All 
AEs subsequent to Visit 1 must be reported regardless of whether or not they are considered drug 
related . 
Adverse events will be elicited by asking the patient  a nonleading question, for example “Have 
you experienced or are you experiencing any new or changed symptoms since we last 
asked/since your last visit? .” Adverse events should be reported on the appro priate page of the 
eCRF.  
Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assigned a category as follows:  
Mild:   The AE was not sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the drug. 
Symptomatic treatment may have been given.  
Moderate:   The AE was sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the drug. 
Symptomatic treatment may have been given.  
Severe:   Severe is more intense than moderate; moreover the AE interferes significantly 
with ability to do work or usual activity.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of Frequency  
Frequency should be assessed using the following categories:  
 unique  
 intermittent  
 continued  
Assessment of Outcome  
Outcome should be assessed using th e following categories:  
 recovered  
 recovered with sequelae  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 57/92 
 
 
  not recovered  
 unknown  
Assessment of Causality  
Every effort should be made by the investigator to explain each AE and assess its relationship, if 
any, to study medication  treatment. Causality should be assessed using the following categories:  
 not related  
 unlikely to be related  
 possibly related  
 probably related  
 definitely related  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All investigators should follow -up with patient s on AEs until the event is resolved or until, in  the 
opinion of the investigator, the event is stabili zed or determined to be chronic. Details of AE 
resolution must be documented in the eCRF.  
13.3.3  Suicidal Ideation  
Suicidal ideation will be rated at Visit 1 (S creening ), at Visit 4 (W eek 13 ), and at Visit  5 
(Week  26; end-of-study visit) using the Sheehan -STS. At Screening, patients with evidence of 
serious risk of suicide based on the Sheehan -STS with a score of 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 and a 
score of 2 or higher on questions 1a, 3 through 12, and 1 4 should be excluded from the study. 
During the study (at Visit 4), patients should be discontinued from the study if they score 3 or 4 
on any one question 2 through 8 or 13, or score 2 or higher on any one question 1a, 9 through 12, 
or 20 , or if, in the o pinion of the investigator, the patient present a serious risk of suicide.

 14. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
14.1 DEFINITION OF A SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT  
An SAE  is any event that is: 
1. Fatal 
2. Life threatening  
An AE is life threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred ; ie, it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had 
occurred in a more serious form.  
3. Disabling or incapacitating  
An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a su bstantial and/or permanent 
disruption of the patient ’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
4. Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay  
Complications occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs  if they cause 
prolongation of the current hospitalization. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a 
pre-existing , nonworsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of 
such hospitalizations must be recorded on the medical history/phy sical examination 
page of the eCRF.  
5. In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification 
is required in other situations ; ie, any event which the investigator regards as serious that 
did not strictly meet the criteria a bove but may have jeopardized the patient  or required 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or which would suggest any 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be associated 
with the use of the drug.  
14.2 DEFINITION OF AN UNE XPECTED ADVERSE EVEN T 
An unexpected AE is defined as a ny AE that is not expected, ie , one that has not been reported as 
expected in this protocol or in the investigator’s brochure, either from previous clinical or 
preclinical studies.  
14.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS  
Any SAE  must be reported by the investigator if it occurs during the clinical study or within 
30 days of receiving the study medication, whether or not the SAE is related to the study 
medication . An SAE  report consists of the SAE  form, the AE form , and the concomitant 
medication form. A copy of these forms must be faxed within 24  hours  following knowledge of 
the event by the investigator for the attention of the medical monitor  at:

 14.5 REGULATORY RESPONSIB ILITY  
INC Research , on behalf of Neurim Pharmaceutical s, has a responsibility to notify the regulatory 
authorities about the safety of a new d rug and will also inform all participating investigators of 
serious and/or unexpected drug -related events associated with the use of this drug . Therefore, 
prompt notification of SAEs is required by the investigator so that reporting timelines can be 
met, and also to ensure ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other patient s are met. The 
investigators must adhere to local requirements of the IRBs and i ndependent ethics committees 
with regard to reporting these events locally.  
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 61/92 
 
 
 15. STUDY TERMINAT ION CRITERIA  
Neurim Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. The reasons will 
be discussed with the investigator s. A study site may also be discontinued by Neurim 
Pharmaceuticals for significant deviations from the protocol or due to insurmountable difficulties 
experienced in running the study at that center . 
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 62/92 
 
 
 16. DATA COLLECTION AND ENTRY  
The study will be monitored at regular intervals during the enrol lment and follow -up period. 
There will be a monitoring visit or telephone call approximately every 8 weeks. The frequency of 
monitoring visits will be determined by the rate of patient  recruitment.  
The following will be reviewed at these visits:  
 Compliance with the protocol  
 Consent procedure  
 Source document verifica tion (see below)  
 AE procedures  
 Storage and accountability of materials  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to maintain adequate and accurate eCRFs , which have 
been designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. All 
eCRFs should be completed in their entirety.  
The purpose of source document verification is to verify, so far as is possible, that the 
informa tion in the eCRF reflects the data recorded in the patient ’s medical notes (see Section 
21.2 for details). S ource document verification  will be performed with due regard for patient  
confidentiality  and will be undertaken on an ongoing basis as part of the monitoring visits. Direct 
access to the source documents will be required. The monitor will make a direct comparison with 
data entered in the eCRFs.  
The investigator must permit the monitor, the sponsor ’s internal auditors , and representatives 
from the regulatory authorities , IRB,  and ethics committee s to inspect all study -related 
documents and pertinent medical records for confirmation of data contained within the eCRFs.  
INC Research  will be responsible  for activities associated with the  Statistical Analysis Plan  and 
for data management of this study. This will include producing a n eCRF  and setting up a 
relevant database and data transfer mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and 
producti on of queries.  
Automated checks will be made against the data to ensure completeness and consistency. The 
database and check programs will be validated prior to implementation. Missing or inconsistent 
data will be queried in writing to the investigator for  clarification. Subsequent modifications in 
the database will be documented.  
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 63/92 
 
 
 17. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Further details of the planned statistical analysis will be provided in the  Statistical Analysis Plan . 
17.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
Eligible patients will be enrolled equally in a 1.2: 1:1:1  randomization ratio  to the 4  trial arms 
(placebo [1.2] and the equal p iromelatine treatment arms  5 mg, 20 mg , and 50 mg  [1:1:1] ). 
Assuming an effect size between treatment dose and placebo of 0. 35 over 26 weeks, a significant 
level  (α) of 0.05 , and power of 88%, a sample size of 143 patients for the placebo arm and 119 
for each  of the 3  piromelatine arms  is calculated. Assuming a 50% screen failure  rate and 
allowing for 15% patient withdrawal , 1150  patients should be screened in order to random ly 
assign  575 patients , of whom  it is expected 500 will complet e the study . 
17.2 POPULATIONS FOR ANAL YSIS  
All patient s randomized to treatment who have taken at least 1 dose of study medication will be 
included in the safety analysis set for the evaluation of safety.  
The evaluation of efficacy will be based on 2 analysis sets, the full analysis set and the 
per-protocol set. The full analysis set is the primary population  and will include all  patient s in the 
safety analysis set  who satisfy all entry criteria and who have efficacy data for the primary 
parameter recorded for baseline and at least 1 postbaseline period assessment. The per -protocol 
set will include all  patient s in the full analysis set who have no major protocol violations.  
17.3 ANALYTICAL MEASURES  
Statistical testing will be one-tailed at the 5% level of significance.  The justification for this 
follows. When conducting placebo -controlled trials, it is imperati ve that the study medication  be 
demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to placebo, since equivalent or worse efficacy than 
placebo will preclude approvability. Consequently, a one -sided test for efficacy is required. The 
null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that 
the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only when it is concluded that a 
study medication  is effective when in fact it is not. This can occur in only one tail of the 
distribution of the treatment difference.  
17.3.1  Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data (age , gender , BMI ), education (years), duration of AD , severity of disease as 
expressed by  MMSE score , and ApoE 4 genotyping will be summarized by treatment group for 
the full analysis set  using descriptive statistics.  
Prior medication, compliance , and medical and surgical history will be summarized by treatment 
group for the full analysis se t using descriptive statistics.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed on these data.  
17.3.2  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The cNTB global  composite  score  (ISLT immediate  and delayed  recall , OCL , identification, 
detection, and OBK ) will be summarized at baseline and after 4, 13 , and 26  weeks of 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 64/92 
 
 
 double -blind treatment (actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using 
descriptive statistics (n,  mean, SD, median, minimum , and maximum). The primary efficacy 
analysis will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
and study site as the main effects and baseline cNTB global  z-score as the covariate . To evaluate 
the effect of missing cNTB items, multiple imputations  will be used for the calculation of cNTB 
composite scores in the case of 1 or 2  missing cNTB items.  
Secondary efficacy analys es will be carried out using a mixed -effects maximum likelihood 
repeated measures (MMRM) model utilizing all baseline a nd postbaseline data  to assess any 
differences in treatment effects over time . The model shall include fixed effects of treatment, 
study site, visit , and treatment by visit interaction, with baseline score as a covariate, and a 
baseline by visit interactio n. The global treatment effect estimates will be reported, with 95% 
confidence intervals and P values. 
17.3.3  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze all secondary efficacy 
endpoints : CGIC, ADCS -MCI -ADL,  ADAS -cog14, cNTB global composite score, cNTB 
episodic memory domain  composite score  (ISLT and OCL), cNTB attention domain composite 
score ( identification and detection), and executive function composite score ( OBK, COWAT and 
CFT).  The MMRM m odel also will be used for the  analysis of ADCS -MCI -ADL, cNTB various  
domain s composite score  (identification and detection) and  executive function composite score.  
17.3.4  Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Parameters  
The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the exploratory efficacy 
endpoints: MMSE, individual cNTB scores, NPI, PSQI  (global score and individual 
components) , and ADAS -cog13, ADAS -cog12, and ADAS -cog11 score s. 
Additionally, t he MMRM mod el will be used for the analysis of individual c NTB score s and the 
PSQI global and individual component scores . 
17.3.5  General Considerations  
For all ANCOVA and MMRM models, data collected from investigators who enrolled fewer 
than 3 patients in any 1 treatment group will be combined prior to analysis. If this combination 
still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3  patients in any 1 treatment group, then this 
group of patients will be combined with the next fewest -enrolling investigator. In the event that 
there is a tie for fewest -enrolling investigator, one of these will be chosen at random by a 
random -number generator.  
The inherent assumption of normally distributed data will be evaluated by generating output for 
the residuals from the full  ANCOVA and MMRM models, which include the interaction term, 
and by testing for normality using the Shapiro -Wilk test. In the event that the data are 
predominantly non -normally distributed, analyses will also be conducted on the ranked data. 
This rank tran sformation will be applied by ranking all the data for a particular variable, across 
all investigators and treatments, from lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 
1; mean ranks will be assigned when ties occur.  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 65/92 
 
 
 17.3. 6 Analysis of Saf ety 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, change in physical examination parameters , and 
vital signs. The number of patients taking concomitant medications during the 28-week treatment 
period (2-week single -blind , placebo run -in period followed by 26 -week double -blind , treatment 
period) will be summari zed by WHO drug classification code for each treatment group. The 
number of patients withdrawing during the treatment periods will be summari zed by primary  
reason for withdr awal for each treatment g roup.  
The number of patients reporting AEs will be summarized during the 28 -week treatment period 
by body system and preferred term for each treatment group.  
The change in laboratory parameters from baseline (end of the first week) to the end of the 
28-week treatment period will be summarized using shift tables showing the number of patients 
having values below, within , and above the normal range at each assessment for each treatment 
group separately. Data will not be carried forward for patients withdrawin g due to treatment 
failure.  
The change in physical examination parameters from baseline to the end of the 28 -week 
treatment period will be summarized as the number of patients who have a normal or abnormal 
examination at each assessment for each treatment group separately. Data will not be carried 
forward for patients withdrawing due to treatment failure.  
Vital signs will be summarized at baseline and at the end of the 28 -week treatment period (actual 
and change from baseline) using descriptive statistics ( n, mean, SD, median, minimum , and 
maximum).  
The number of patients withdrawing during the 28 -week treatment period will be summarized by 
primary reason for withdrawal for each treatment group.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed on the safety d ata. These safety parameters will be 
assessed using the safety analysis set.  
17.3. 7 Subgroup Analysis  
The effect of age, gender, origin, baseline disease severity as measured by MMSE,  ApoE 4, 
baseline insomnia severity, and patient education level upon efficacy will be evaluated if sample 
sizes are sufficient to warrant such analyses. For example, if all patients are Caucasian, then 
there is no need to evaluate the co -factor origin. The ANCOVA and MMRM models described 
above will be supplemented with ter ms for the main effect and interaction with treatment. Each 
co-factor will be analyzed in separate models. The test for treatment -by-subgroup interaction will 
address whether the response to piromelatine, compared with placebo, is different or consistent 
between levels of the co -factor.  
18. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD APPROV AL

 21. RECORDS AND SUPPLIES  
21.1 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
Upon receipt  of study medication, the investigator ( or investigator ’s designee ) will conduct an 
inventory of the supplies and complete a supplies receipt. The investigator will retain a copy of 
this receipt at the site and return the original receipt to the study moni tor. 
It is the responsibility of the study monitor to ensure that the investigator ( or investigator ’s 
designee ) has correctly documented the dispensing and return of study medication on the 
dispensing log , which will be provided. The study monitor will arr ange regular collection of 
unused study medication returned by the patient . The study monitor will also perform an 
inventory of study medication at the close -out visit to the site. All discrepancies must be 
accounted for and documented.  
21.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
In accordance with GCP and ICH Guidelines, the study monitor will carry out source document 
verification to ensure that the data collected in the eCRF are accurate and reliable. Source 
document verification involves cross -referencing data  in the eCRF with those recorded in any 
source document ( eg, patient s’ medical notes, nurses ’ notes, appointment diaries, laboratory 
reports).  
All key trial information must be recorded in the patient ’s medical notes. This includes: 
confirmation of diagnosis , date of informed consent given and of study entry , visit dates , start 
and stop dates of study medication , changes to concomitant medication , and AEs . Study 
procedures will be fully documented in the eCRFs and signed by the investigator. For data  
required to be transcribed into the eCRF, a check on accuracy will be performed by the 
investigator. The investigator will check relevant laboratory reports for accuracy, will annotate 
the laboratory report for values of clinical significance and out of r ange values , and  then will 
sign and date such reports.  
21.3 CRITICAL DOCUMENTS  
The investigator must permit the monitor, the sponsor’s internal auditors, IRB, independent 
ethics committees , and representatives from the regulatory authorities to have direct  access to all 
study -related documents and pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data

Background:
•Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the leading cause of non-relapse morbidity and 
mortality in persons after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants. 
•About 50% of persons with cGvHD have disease refractory to systemic corticosteroids and 
there is no standard second-line therapy.     
•Thalidomide, a drug with immune-modulating effects, was active in advanced cGvHD but was 
difficult to use at appropriate doses.  
•Pomalidomide is related to thalidomide but with higher potency and more favorable toxicity 
profile. It is active in multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative neoplasm–associated 
myelofibrosis. Preliminary data in humans with cGvHD are encouraging but data are limited. 
Objective:
•Primary: Determine whether pomalidomide is effective in persons with moderate or severe 
cGvHD not controlled by corticosteroids.
Eligibility:
•Inclusion Criteria
oModerate or severe cGvHD per NIH criteria
oAge 18 to 75 years old
oKarnofsky performance score >60%
oHas cGvHD that did not respond to high-dose corticosteroids (average 0.5 mg/kg/d 
prednisone for >8 weeks) or second-line therapy
oReceiving stable or tapering doses of systemic therapy in the preceding 4 weeks
oAgree to adhere to methods of contraception and other fertility control measures as 
prescribed by the protocol
•Exclusion Criteria
oAcute GvHD (classic and late per NIH criteria) 
oAbsolute neutrophils <1.0x109/L, platelets <75x109/L, estimated creatinine clearance <50 
mL/min/1.73m2
oNIH lung score 3
oPregnant or lactating 
oUncontrolled infection
Design: 
Randomized phase 2 trial with the single stage selection design. Patients will receive either a 
constant low dose of pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) for six months or a strategy of increasing dose 
of pomalidomide from 0.5 mg/d up through each individual patients’ maximum tolerated dose, 
with escalations by 0.5 mg/d every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2.0 mg/d. As an early stopping rule 
for futility, if after 7 patients have enrolled on either arm, 0 have responded, then no further 
patients will be accrued to that arm as soon as this can be determined. To protect patient safety, 
an early stopping rule will be implemented. With two arms, each of which has a maximal accrual 
of 16 patients, up to 32 evaluable patients will be randomized. Response assessments will occur

3every 3 months with primary efficacy endpoint evaluated at 6 months. Patients with responding 
disease will continue therapy for another 6 months.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary Objective: 
1.1.2 Determine whether pomalidomide is effective in persons with moderate or severe chronic 
graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) not controlled by corticosteroids.
1.1.3 Secondary Objectives:
1.1.3.1 Determine whether pomalidomide is safe in persons with moderate or severe cGvHD not 
controlled by corticosteroids.
1.1.3.2 Determine the immune-modulatory effects of pomalidomide in persons with moderate or 
severe cGvHD.
1.1.3.3 Determine limited pharmacokinetics after oral administration of pomalidomide. 
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.2.1 Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
cGvHD is an important late complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. It is a 
leading cause of mortality in persons more than 2 years post transplant.1,2 Symptoms of cGvHD 
usually appear within 2 years post transplant. Incidences range from 6%-80% depending on 
recipient age, donor type (related or unrelated, HLA matched or mismatched), graft type (blood, 
bone marrow or umbilical cord), graft manipulation or donor lymphocyte infusions.3 Chronic 
GvHD is strongly associated with prior acute GvHD (aGvHD).4,5 Traditionally the cutoff point 
between aGvHD and cGvHD was day 100 post transplant. In 2005 an NIH consensus project 
proposed two main GVHD categories, each with two subcategories: (1) “classic” aGvHD 
occurring within 100 days post transplant and (2) “persistent, recurrent or late” aGvHD. The broad 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
8category of cGvHD includes: (1) “classic” cGvHD (without features or characteristics of aGvHD) 
and (2) an “overlap syndrome” with concordant features of cGvHD and aGvHD.3 cGvHD is a 
multi-organ alloimmune and autoimmune disorder characterized by immune dysregulation, 
immunodeficiency, impaired organ function and decreased survival.  It requires prolonged ongoing 
immunosuppression and inter-disciplinary management. 
1.2.1.1 Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of cGvHD is poorly understood. T- (both Th1 and Th2) and B-cells play a 
role in the pathogenesis of cGvHD, suggesting a general loss of tolerance, including abnormalities 
in the function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Natural Tregs (CD4+,CD25+,FoxP3+) maintain self-
tolerance.6 Studies in mice indicate Tregs can suppress GvHD and that a deficiency of Tregs 
worsens GHD.7 There are conflicting data in humans concerning role of Tregs in the development 
of cGvHD.8 A recent study suggested in vivo administration of low-dose IL-2 as a potential Treg-
mediated therapeutic approach for severe cGvHD.9 
Several studies suggested that aGvHD is associated with predominant Th1-type immune response 
and cGvHD with Th2-type immune response. Th1 cells produce interferon- γ (IFN-γ) that mediates 
cell immunity, and Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which mediate humoral 
immunity. Following T-cell dysregulation, there is consequently cytokine dysregulation. In 
persons with cGvHD, higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL- 6, transforming growth factor-
β, IL-1β  and lower levels of INF-γ and IL-10 are reported.1,10-13 
Autoimmunity and autoreactive T-cells have an important role in cGvHD. Some studies have 
shown that host thymus is not required for induction of cGvHD and that quiescent autoreactive T- 
and B-cells in transplants from non-autoimmune donors may be activated and expanded to cause 
cGvHD.14 In contrast, involvement of thymus-dependent pathways in cGvHD development begins 
with injury to the thymus from a chemotherapy-conditioning regimen or aGvHD, leading to loss 
of B-cells with their ability to produce antibodies and to present antigen, which may enhance 
development of cGvHD. Autoantibodies like anti-nuclear, anti-mitochondrial, anti-parietal, anti–
smooth muscle and anti–parotid are present in persons with cGvHD.15,16 Also, persons with 
autoantibodies had more cGvHD-associated symptoms than persons without autoantibodies.15 
Autoantibodies against platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) may play a role in 
cGvHD.17 These PDGFR-α autoantibodies stimulate thyrosine phosphorylation in a cascade of 
events contributing inflammation and fibrosis. 
The studies report elevated levels of BAFF (B-cell activating factor of the TNF family), which is 
produced by T-cells and granulocytes. BAFF supports differentiation and survival of normal B-
cells in persons with cGvHD and autoimmune diseases.7,18 Fuji et al. showed that in early-onset 
cGvHD, there are elevated sBAFF, sIL-2Rα, sCD13, and anti-dsDNA levels. In late-onset cGvHD, 
sBAFF, anti-dsDNA and ANA are higher, suggesting that the B-cell activation is predominant.19 
These observations create rationale for treatments with anti-CD20 antibodies in cGvHD.20All of 
these pathways are potential targets for cGvHD therapy. However, to date no laboratory parameter 
is considered a reliable biomarker for the diagnosis, measurement of severity, prognosis or 
therapeutic effect in cGvHD.  
1.2.1.2 Clinical Manifestations
The usually affected organs in cGvHD are the skin, eyes, mouth, gut, liver, lungs, joints and 
genitourinary tract. Examples of diagnostic skin manifestations are sclerotic features and 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
9poikiloderma, lichen-type and hyperkeratotic plaques in the mouth or bronchiolitis obliterans in 
lung biopsy.3 The clinical manifestations of the disease are reminiscent of the autoimmune diseases 
such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren syndrome.3 According to the 
NIH consensus global scoring system, cGvHD is categorized as mild, moderate or severe. 
Systemic immune-suppressive therapy is usually indicated in persons with cGvHD involving 3 or 
more organs or with a severity score of 2 or higher in any organ. Systemic therapy is also to be 
considered  in persons with thrombocytopenia (platelets <100x109/L) or progressive onset during 
prednisone treatment.4 cGvHD eventually leads to impaired functional performance, deteriorating 
quality of life, increased risk of infections and death.21-25 
1.2.1.3 Treatment
Initial therapy for cGvHD is well established consisting of prednisone with or without a calcineurin 
inhibitor. However, only about 50% of persons have a durable response.6 There are no standard 
recommendations for second-line treatment of cGvHD and there is no FDA approved agent. 
Recommendations for therapy are based on a long list of poorly standardized phase 2 trials or 
retrospective case analyses.26  Diverse drugs (about 40 are described) are used, including sirolimus, 
tacrolimus, mycophenolate, methotrexate, extracorporeal photopheresis, monoclonal antibodies, 
pentostatin, imatinib and others. Choice between drugs is based on logistics, cost, failed prior 
treatments, toxicity profile and subject or clinician preferences.
For many years cGvHD has been difficult to address because of the lack of standardized criteria 
for diagnosis, staging and response to therapy. Recently, as an effort of the NIH-sponsored 
Consensus Development Project, a new series of guidelines have been published addressing 
diagnosis and staging, histopathology, biomarkers, assessment of response to therapy, ancillary 
therapy, supportive care and the design of clinical trials.22,27-31 Typically, cGvHD usually lasts 2 
to 5 years, and approximately 85% of survivors are able to discontinue systemic immune 
suppression. Five-year survival rates for persons who develop cGvHD range from 30% to 40% for 
high-risk persons and persons with cGvHD resistant to steroid therapy to 70% for standard-risk 
cGvHD persons. Treatment goals in management of cGvHD include both alleviation of symptoms 
and the control and reversion of the destructive immunological process. Therapy for cGvHD is 
largely unsatisfactory and persons should be treated on investigational clinical protocols whenever 
possible.23
1.2.2 Thalidomide in cGvHD
Thalidomide is effective in modulating cGvHD in rodents and has been tried for the prophylaxis 
and treatment of cGvHD in humans.32 Thalidomide was found to have immune modulating effects 
from reduced production of TNF-α, costimulation of T-cells to produce IL-2 and IFNγ, inhibition 
of other cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 and down-regulation of cell surface adhesion 
molecules involved in leukocyte migration.26,33 It also has anti-angiogenic properties.34 Since the 
report by Vogelsang et al. in 1992 presenting thalidomide as a safe and effective treatment for 
severe cGvHD, several other phase 2 studies in children and adults reproduced these findings in 
salvage treatment of cGvHD. Historically, thalidomide is the third most commonly tested drug in 
trials of cGvHD second-line therapy.35 Vogelsang et al. treated 44 persons with cGvHD who were 
high risk at diagnosis (21) or refractory (23) to conventional treatment with thalidomide for 3 
months after a complete response (CR) and for 6 months after a partial response (PR). High-risk 
cGvHD was defined as having 2 out of following 3 characteristics: evolving from aGvHD, 
lichenoid skin or mucous-membrane changes and hepatic dysfunction. Absolute survival was 64%, 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
1078% among persons receiving salvage therapy and 48% among those with high-risk cGvHD. 
Complete CR was achieved in 14 persons (7 high risk, 7 salvage), PR in 12 (1 high risk, 11 salvage) 
and no response in 18 (13 high risk, 5 salvage). The main side effects were sedation, neuropathy 
and constipation.36 In the United States, thalidomide is FDA approved for erythema nodosum 
leprosum and in combination with dexamethasone for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.37  
Six other phase 2 studies have suggested efficacy of thalidomide in high-risk or refractory cGvHD 
(Table 1). Most trials were small but 3 had more than 30 subjects. Complete and partial remissions 
(variously defined) were reported with overall response rates of 20% to 86%. Heney et al.38 
reported responses in 5 of 6 persons, best in cutaneous involvement; 2 persons developed 
peripheral neuropathy. In a study in children by Rovelli et al., 10 subjects responded (6 CR, 4 
PR).39 Forsyth reported a thalidomide-responsive case of pulmonary cGvHD (brochiolitis 
obliterans).40 Staumont-Salle reported a response in lichenoid vulvar lesions.41 In study by Browne 
et al.,42 38% of subjects with cGvHD responded (46% children, 25% adults). In a 1995 study by 
Parker et al., 20% of subjects had sustained responses, and 36% discontinued because of side 
effects, including sedation, constipation, neuritis, neutropenia and rash. In a phase 2 study by Cole 
et al., 5 children received doses 100 to 800 mg—1 CR and 4 PRs were reported. Side effects were 
minimal, and there was no neuropathy.43 Kulkarni et al. reported 13 CRs and 8 PRs in 59 subjects 
with cGvHD at thalidomide doses of 600 to 1200 mg/d. Two subjects had polyneuropathy, 2 had 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 1 had thrombocytopenia. Mehta treated 6 children with cGvHD.44 
One child had a CR and one a PR. One child had a rash, eosinophilia and pancreatitis shortly after 
starting thalidomide, which resolved only after discontinuing thalidomide. 
Two randomized trials (with approximately 50 subjects each) using thalidomide as part of the 
front-line therapy in cGvHD are reported.45,46 In one open-label, add-on to steroids and 
cyclosporine study, comparable response rates were seen in the thalidomide and control cohorts.45 
The second study was a placebo-controlled trial using initial doses of 200 to 800 mg/d. 
Thalidomide had to be discontinued in 92% of persons in contrast to 65% in the placebo group due 
to intolerance, mostly neutropenia, sedation and neuropathy.46 A third randomized trial of 
thalidomide in cGvHD was performed by Chao et al. for cGvHD prevention.47 This study showed 
increased incidence of cGvHD and inferior survival in the thalidomide arm with such strategy.47 
Collectively, these data suggest efficacy of thalidomide as salvage therapy for cGvHD but not for 
prevention or as front-line therapy.26  
In summary, several phase 2 trials report response rates of 20% to 83% with thalidomide doses of 
100 to 1600mg/d.26,34 Thalidomide doses higher than 200 mg/d are poorly tolerated. Phase 3 trials 
show, however, no benefit of thalidomide for front-line therapy and detrimental effect in cGvHD 
prevention. These data suggest that although thalidomide may be active at high doses in rodents, 
these doses cannot be reliably and safely achieved in humans. Developing pomalidomide, which 
has similar immune-modulating effects as thalidomide but less toxicity, is of considerable interest 
in cGvHD.

1.3 POMALIDOMIDE
Pomalidomide is a novel immune-modulatory drug, a thalidomide analogue with 4,000-fold 
greater inhibition of TNF-α production relative to thalidomide (Celgene Corp data on file50). The 
pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of pomalidomide are of potential therapeutic benefit in the 
treatment of various hematologic malignancies (such as multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative 
neoplasm [MPN]–associated myelofibrosis and other hematologic disorders (like β-thalassemia  
and sickle cell disease) as well as solid cancers (prostate, thyroid and lung cancer). In addition, 
several features of pomalidomide suggest it may be useful in treating cGvHD, including: (1) in 
vitro suppression of TNF-α (human monocytes);51 (2) increasing Th1 (mouse cancer vaccine, 
human CD4+ T-cells in vitro);52,53 (3) suppression of Th2 (mouse cancer vaccine);52 and (4) 
stimulation of IL-12 and sIL-2Rα (humans).54 However, other effects of  pomalidomide may have 
potential adverse effects in cGvHD, including: (1) increased CD45RO+ (memory) CD4 and CD8 
T-cells (humans);54 (2) decreased Tregs;55 (3) increased Th2 (polarized human CD4+ T-cells in 
vitro);53 and (4) increased B-cells (in vitro human CD19+ cells).56 Because the precise 
pathogenesis of cGvHD is unknown (and may be different in different persons), it is impossible to 
predict the effect of therapy with pomalidomide outside of the context of a clinical trial.
1.3.1 Preclinical Studies
In a series of in vitro studies, pomalidomide exhibited several immune-modulating properties such 
as potent inhibition of TNF-α activity, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, monocyte chemoattractant protein 
(MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein, and production and inhibition of cellular 
cyclooxygenase-2, as well as modulation of angiogenesis. Pomalidomide also augmented the 
activity of natural killer (NK) cells and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
of targeted tumor cells in combination with therapeutic antibodies to tumor-specific surface 
antigens. Pomalidomide enhances T-cell stimulation by augmenting T-cell proliferation, 
increasing production of IL-2, IFN-γ and RANTES, and decreasing IL-10 production. 
Furthermore, pomalidomide is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of multiple myeloma cell lines 
in vitro and has been shown to be active in subjects with relapsed or refractory myeloma.54,57 Based 
on its numerous mechanisms of carcinoma growth inhibition, pomalidomide is being tested as part 
of induction chemotherapy regimens and as post-induction maintenance therapy for solid cancers.
More information emerged recently about the specific mode of pomalidomide action as cereblon 
(CRBN), the primary target for thalidomide teratogenicity58, is now identified also as an essential

13target for pomalidomide anti-myeloma activity.59 The immediate result of this binding is interferon 
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) down-regulation, which is also essential for Th-17 cell development.60,61  
1.3.2 Animal Models
Oral pomalidomide is rapidly absorbed in rats and monkeys and the bioavailability is dose 
dependent, at high doses 100mg/kg, the bioavailability was low (15%) however at 2mg/kg the 
bioavailability was 100%. Following intravenous (IV) administration to rats and monkeys, 
pomalidomide exhibited low clearance (240 to 286 mL/h/kg), a moderate volume of distribution 
(2.2 to 2.5 L/kg), and a moderately long terminal half-life (approximately 6 hours). Renal excretion 
of metabolites was the predominant route of clearance in animal models. The toxicity of 
pomalidomide after oral and IV dosing was studied in rats and mice. There were no deaths and no 
significant clinical observations in rodents given a single dose of pomalidomide at 2000 mg/kg 
orally or up to 50 mg/kg IV. No treatment-related macroscopic changes were observed. In rats 
administered a single dose of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg pomalidomide by IV injection, the high dose 
produced piloerection, hunching, and tachypnea. Palpebral closure was observed at doses of 25 
and 50 mg/kg, and hyperpnea at 50 mg/kg. The severity and persistence of clinical observations 
increased with increased dose. Pomalidomide at oral doses of 100, 500 or 1500 mg/kg was well 
tolerated when given once daily to male and female rats for 90 consecutive days. Therefore, the 
no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) under the conditions of this study was 1500 mg/kg.
A 13-week study evaluated the toxicity and toxicokinetics of pomalidomide in male and female 
cynomolgus monkeys after oral doses of 0.05, 0.2, 2 or 10 mg/kg. Lesions in the bone marrow, 
spleen, and thymus were observed in animals dosed at 2 and 10 mg/kg. Based on the results from 
this study, the NOAEL was 0.2 mg/kg/day; the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values at this dosage were 
approximately150 ng/mL and 600 ngh/mL, respectively. Since the monkey was identified as the 
most sensitive species in the toxicology program, the NOAEL of 0.2 mg/kg/day was used to 
calculate the human equivalent dose of 0.06 mg/kg or 3.8 mg for a 60 kg person. External and 
cardiac malformations were observed in fetuses of pregnant rabbits that were administered 
pomalidomide orally at 10, 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. A relationship was noted between increasing 
pomalidomide dose and the number of fetuses affected, as well as the frequency of occurrence of 
each type of malformation. Based on these data, it was concluded that pomalidomide causes fetal 
malformations in rabbits. A nonclinical safety PD study demonstrated no major safety concerns 
with cardiac and respiratory functions in dogs, rats or monkeys. In rats and monkeys pomalidomide 
administrated orally was absorbed fairly rapidly (T max of 2 to 4 hours) and had low oral 
bioavailability (13%-15%). Renal excretion was the predominant route of clearance in animal 
models. 
In the mouse model of bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis, pomalidomide exerted potent anti-fibrotic 
effects and not only prevented progression of experimental fibrosis, but also induced regression of 
established fibrosis.  In this model, pomalidomide reduced dermal thickening and reduced the 
numbers of myofibroblasts in the skin, whether it was administered prophylactically or 
therapeutically. These results show that pomalidomide exerts potent anti-fibrotic effects and not 
only prevents the progression, but also induces a regression of established fibrosis in a nonclinical 
model of skin fibrosis (Celgene, unpublished). 
In multiple myeloma, pomalidomide induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis of multiple myeloma 
cells (via caspase-8 death receptor pathway), and it also reduces stromal cell expression of vascular

14endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which decreases 
angiogenesis. 62 One characteristic of immune-modulatory drugs is their potency to act as a co-
stimulus of T-cell receptor ligation, leading to increased production of IL-2 and INF-γ, indicative 
of a Th1 phenotype.63 Pomalidomide promotes T-cell differentiation via the augmentation of T-
bet, which leads to upregulation of INF-γ.63 It also increases antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity.  
1.3.3 Experience in Humans
Pomalidomide is active in multiple myeloma and MPN-associated myelofibrosis. It has been also 
used to treat cGvHD. Given at doses up to 3 mg/day is usually well tolerated and main toxicities 
are neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, there have been no drug-related deaths in clinical trials 
with pomalidomide (summarized in Table 2). 
1.3.3.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans
A phase-1, single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single oral dose study (CC-
4047 1398/132) was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of pomalidomide in 30 healthy male subjects, aged 19 to 55 years.  
Pomalidomide was administered orally in capsule form at 5 dose levels comprised of 1, 5, 10, 25, 
and 50 mg, and corresponding to 0.01, 0.07, 0.13, 0.30, and 0.59 mg/kg, respectively, when 
adjusted for group mean body weight.  At each dose level, 4 subjects received pomalidomide and 
2 subjects received placebo in a fasted state.  A total of 20 subjects each received a single oral 
dose of pomalidomide in doses ranging from 1 mg to 50 mg, and 10 received placebo. Following 
each dose level of pomalidomide, the absorption of pomalidomide was moderately rapid.  The 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) occurred at a median t max of 2.5 to 6 hours postdose.  The 
systemic exposure of pomalidomide as determined from the area under the plasma concentration-
time curve [AUC (0-tz) and AUC (0-∞)] increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, 
whereas C max increased in a subproportional manner.  After reaching C max, plasma concentrations 
of pomalidomide declined in an apparent biphasic manner.  The geometric mean terminal 
elimination half-life (t 1/2) ranged from 8.2 to 10.8 hours, with no apparent dose-related trend.  
Less than 3% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged pomalidomide across 
all dose levels.
A phase-1b, single-center, ascending dose, open-label study (CDC-407-00-001) was conducted 
to identify the MTD and evaluate the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide in male and female 
subjects with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM). Pomalidomide was administered 
orally in capsule form at doses of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg in either once daily dosing (Cohort 1) or 
alternate day dosing (Cohort 2) for 4 weeks.  The study design did not allow for a precise 
calculation of subject numbers, as the number of subjects per dose group was dependent on the 
frequency of DLT.  Subjects were enrolled in groups of 3 per dose group beginning with the 1-
mg dose group.  If no DLT were experienced (in one dose group) at a given dose level, the 
subsequent group of 3 subjects were to receive the next highest dose.  If 1 of the 3 subjects in a 
dose group experienced a DLT, that cohort would then be expanded to 6 subjects.  If 2 or more 
subjects in a cohort of up to 6 subjects experienced a DLT, no additional escalation of dose 
would occur.  Escalations would occur until an MTD was established or the maximum dose of 
10 mg/day was reached.  A DLT was defined as a Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity or 
a Grade 4 or higher hematologic toxicity using the NCI CTC.  A total of 45 subjects were 
enrolled in the study; 24 subjects in Cohort 1 and 21 subjects in Cohort 2.  Blood samples for the 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD

15analysis of pomalidomide were collected from 28 subjects and included in the pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  Dose levels of pomalidomide evaluated in the pharmacokinetic assessment were 1, 2, 
5, and 10 mg once daily and 5 mg on alternate days.  Blood and urine samples for analysis of 
plasma and urinary pomalidomide concentrations were collected for up to 24 hours after dosing 
on Day 1 and Week 4 (Day 29).  Plasma concentrations (Geometric means and coefficient of 
variation percent [CV%]) of pomalidomide in subjects with MM on Day 1 and Week 4 are 
summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

OD = once daily; QOD = every other day.
Following administration of pomalidomide at dose levels of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg once daily and 5 
mg every other day to subjects with MM, absorption of pomalidomide was steady with median 
tmax ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 hours postdose on Day 1 and Week 4.  The mean t 1/2 of 
pomalidomide was similar across dose levels and dosing days being approximately 7 to 8 hours.
At the 1 and 2 mg daily dose levels, there was slightly greater accumulation of pomalidomide in 
plasma upon multiple dosing than predicted.  However, at the 5 mg daily and 5 mg alternate day 
dose levels, there was little or no accumulation of pomalidomide upon multiple dosing.
There was a less than dose proportional increase in AUC (0-) and C max for pomalidomide  over 
the 1 to 10 mg dose range on Day 1, with a more pronounced sub-proportional increase in both 
parameters on Week 4 over the 1 to 5 mg dose range. 
The fraction of the dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug was low for all dosing 
regimens, with a maximum of 4.5% being eliminated up to 24 hours after dosing on Day 1 and 
Week 4 for individual subjects.
1.3.3.2 Clinical studies with Pomalidomide
In a phase 1 single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose study, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), PD and safety of pomalidomide were studied in 30 healthy male subjects. 
The results demonstrated that pomalidomide administered at a dose of 1 to 50 mg has an acceptable 
safety profile. Adverse events (AEs) reported in the study were mild or moderate in nature and no 
clinically significant changes in any laboratory or other parameters, except a dose-related decrease 
in the CD4+ cell count, were observed. 
A phase 1b study was conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate 
safety and efficacy of pomalidomide in persons with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. A

17total of 24 persons were treated with the dose-escalating regimen (1, 2, 5 and 10 mg). The MTD 
was 2 mg. Pomalidomide was well tolerated with no serious nonhematological AEs and excellent 
disease responses. Fifty-eight percent of persons developed grade 3/4 neutropenia and 16% of 
persons developed DVT. 64 In this study, the cytokines were measured and it was noticed that the 
serum IL-12 and sIL-2 levels increased during the first 4 weeks of treatment. IL-12 is derived from 
monocytes and macrophages and has a key role in amplifying a Th1-type response.65 No 
significant changes and no correlation was found between IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, VEGF and bFGF 
levels and paraprotein response.  
A standard dose escalation phase 1 study was conducted to determine the MTD of pomalidomide 
at 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg on alternate days in persons with relapsed myeloma. Patients were 
evaluated prior to study enrolment and weekly for the first month and monthly thereafter. The 
overall response rate (>50% reduction in paraprotein) to pomalidomide monotherapy was 50%. 
Hematological monitoring over 4 weeks showed significant decline in hemoglobin, white blood 
cells, and neutrophils. Platelets decreased but without statistical significance. Significant decrease 
was noticed in the B-cell percentage (P=0.002) and absolute B-cell number. The CD3+ percentage 
and CD8+ percentage increased (P=0.003, P=0.007). The CD4+ percentage and absolute as well 
as NK cell percentage were increased but without statistical significance. There was a significant 
negative association between B-cell percentage or absolute B-cell count at 4 weeks and maximal 
percentage change in paraprotein (P=0.05, P=0.03). 
Tefferi et al. published a phase 2 randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of pomalidomide in 
MPN-associated myelofibrosis. Four arms were studied pomalidomide (2 mg) plus placebo, 
pomalidomide (2 mg) plus prednisone, pomalidomide (0.5 mg) plus placebo and pomalidomide 
(0.5 mg) plus prednisone. Pomalidomide was well tolerated. Anemia response rate was up to 40%. 
There was relatively low incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. How 
pomalidomide works in MPN-associated myelofibrosis is unclear, but it is known that TNF-α 
directly inhibits erythropoiesis in vitro.66 In this study it was also described that overall bone 
marrow cellularity, degree of fibrosis, or cytogenetic findings did not change (bone marrow 
examination was done in 4 responders who completed 1 year treatment with pomalidomide with 
or without prednisone. 
A multicenter, randomized, phase 2 study of pomalidomide in combination with low-dose 
dexamethasone was conducted in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma who received prior 
therapy (lenalidomide or bortezomib). Pomalidomide 2 mg po daily was given on days 1 through 
28 of a 28-day cycle. Dexamethasone 40 mg daily was given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. 
Thirty-eight patients achieved objective response (63%), including CR in 5%, very good PR in 
28% and PR in 30%. Responses were seen in 40% of lenalidomide-refractory persons, 37% 
thalidomide-refractory and 60% of bortezomib-refractory persons. Toxicity was primary 
myelosuppression. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity consisted of anemia (5%), thrombocytopenia 
(3%) and neutropenia (32%). Among those that developed grade 3/4 neutropenia, all first 
experienced the neutropenia in cycle 1-3; no new patients experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia in 
cycle 4 or later. One patient experienced thromboembolic event. The most common non-
hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities consisted of fatigue (17%) and pneumonia (8%); less than 5% 
of patients experienced neuropathy, diarrhea, constipation or hyperglycemia. One patient (1.6%) 
had a thromboembolic event of DVT.
In a phase 1/2 study in MPN-associated myelofibrosis with 19 patients, 3 mg was determined to 
be the MTD, but no efficacy was observed at that dose. Two of three patients in the 3.5 mg cohort 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD

18had dose-limiting myelosuppression. Overall, 7 subjects had an anemia response and 2 a spleen 
response.
In another trial of pomalidomide in MPN-associated myelofibrosis, low-dose pomalidomide (0.5 
mg/day) was given to 58 persons. Anemia response was documented only in persons with 
JAK2V617F (24 vs 0%; P=0.03). Nine of the 10 anemia responders became red blood cell–
transfusion independent. Fourteen of 24 persons with platelets ≤100x10e9 /L had a greater than 
50% increase in platelets. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia/neutropenia occurred rarely. This study 
established low-dose pomalidomide as effective and safe in MPN-associated myelofibrosis with 
anemia. 
1.3.3.1 Pomalidomide in cGvHD
Pusic et al. reported results of a phase 2 study of pomalidomide in patients with cGvHD not 
controlled by corticosteroids.67 Eight subjects received 3 mg/day with dose reductions to 2 mg, 1 
mg and 0.5 mg. Seven subjects required dose reduction because of muscle cramps, tremor and 
fatigue. Five subjects discontinued therapy for worsening of cGvHD of the skin and mouth (N=1), 
pain (N=1) and no response (N=3). No bone marrow suppression, somnolence, constipation or 
DVT were observed. Three persons reached the primary evaluation endpoint at 6 months at the 2 
mg dose (N=2) or 1 mg dose (N=1). The 3 patients had global PRs per NIH criteria (skin erythema, 
GI) and <PR ongoing improvements in the skin, mouth and eyes. This study established feasibility 
of giving pomalidomide to humans with cGvHD and the absence of serious side effects at doses 
less than 2 mg/day.

Better therapies for cGvHD are needed. In about 50% of persons with cGvHD, the disease does 
not respond to corticosteroids, and there is no standard second-line therapy or FDA-approved drug 
for cGvHD. Thalidomide is an immune-modulating drug effective in a rodent model of cGvHD 
and in humans for salvage therapy after failure of steroids, but at doses expected to be effective it 
is associated with troublesome side effects including somnolence, neuropathy and constipation, 
which precluded wider use in this population. Pomalidomide is a new immune-modulating drug 
that is more potent than thalidomide and has been shown in early trials in cancer and cGvHD to 
be without the toxicities that limited the use of thalidomide. Several biological features of 
pomalidomide suggest that this drug may be useful in treating cGvHD. Since the precise 
pathogenesis of cGvHD is unknown, the most compelling evidence for testing pomalidomide in a 
clinical trial is the encouraging efficacy data with thalidomide. Preliminary studies of 
pomalidomide in persons with cGvHD suggest absence of typical thalidomide-related side effects 
or significant myelosuppression and a preliminary suggestion of efficacy if doses of less than 3 
mg/day could be given for at least 6 months (the typical primary response evaluation time point in 
cGvHD trials). 
The use of the NIH Consensus Diagnosis, Staging Criteria now provides an updated, standardized 
assessment of persons with cGvHD for inclusion in clinical trials.71,72 Although NIH Consensus 
Response Criteria are not yet validated in large clinical trials there are preliminary data on validity 
and reproducibility that provide guidance for further use and testing.73
At the intramural NCI there is a well-established clinical research infrastructure, the “NIH Chronic 
GVHD Study Group,” that is uniquely qualified to conduct drug development studies and cGvHD 
assessments in a multi-disciplinary specialty setting. This environment is also uniquely conducive 
for further studies of cGvHD biology and in vivo pomalidomide effects by using the ETIB 
immunology pre-clinical core and the established cGvHD murine models expertise. The proposed 
study is not only expected to address a specific clinical therapeutic question related to 
pomalidomide in cGvHD but also allows establishment of experience with this important group of 
agents in general in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.      
The proposed study is a randomized phase 2 trial with the single stage selection design Patients 
will receive either a constant low dose of pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) for six months or a 
strategy of increasing dose of pomalidomide from 0.5 mg/d up through each individual patients’ 
maximum tolerated dose, with escalations by 0.5 mg/d every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2.0 mg/d. 
To protect patient safety, an early stopping rule will be implemented as outlined in section 8. 
With two arms, each of which has a maximal accrual of 16 patients, up to 32 evaluable patients 
will be randomized. Response assessments will occur every 3 months with primary efficacy 
endpoint evaluated at 6 months. Patients with responding disease will continue therapy for 
another 6 months.

242.1.3 Recruitment
Subjects will be recruited from NIH Clinical Center hematopoietic stem cell transplant clinics but 
could be referred from the outside institutions. Study participants will be primarily recruited from 
the 04-C-0281 cGvHD natural history study protocol, which currently has more than 260 persons 
registered and enrolls approximately 3 persons per month, most of them with moderate or severe 
cGvHD. Referrals will be also accepted from the other NIH protocols or from the extramural 
community. Every effort will be made to screen potential candidates through the existing 04-C-
0281 natural history protocol, which is a non-therapeutic study as part of pre-enrollment 
evaluations. The patient population enrolled on this study is expected to be representative of the 
population of persons receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the NIH and 
nationwide. 
2.2 REQUIRED TESTING AND C OUNSELING FOR FCBP AND PARTNERS OF FCBP
2.2.1 During study participation and for 28 days following discontinuation of study drug:
•Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. A female of childbearing 
potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy 
or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 
consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive 
months).
•Pregnancy tests must occur 10 – 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to initiation 
of pomalidomide. FCBP with regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test 
weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks 
in therapy); at discontinuation of pomalidomide and at Day 28 post the last dose of 
pomalidomide. Females with irregular menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly 
for the first 4 weeks and then every 14 days while on therapy (including breaks in 
therapy), at discontinuation of pomalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 post the last 
dose of pomalidomide (see Appendix M: Pomalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, 
Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods).   
•All patients must be counseled about pregnancy precautions, risks of fetal exposure and 
other risks. The counseling must be done every 28 days and at drug discontinuation 
through the POMALYST REMS™ program. See Appendix M: Pomalidomide Risks 
of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control 
Methods.
2.3 SCREENING EVALUATION
Screening procedures may be performed on a CCR screening protocol, most commonly on 04-C-
0281 “Natural History of Chronic GVHD.” All studies must be completed within 8 weeks prior to 
enrollment:

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
The study is a randomized phase 2 trial with the single stage selection design. It is known from 
prior trials that the maximum tolerated dose of pomalidomide is about 3 mg/d in persons with bone 
marrow disorders receiving prior therapies for cancer, in cGvHD doses <3mg/d have been well 
tolerated. This study will explore clinical toxicity of gradual escalation of pomalidomide doses <3 
mg/d in subjects with cGvHD. Patients will receive either a constant low dose of pomalidomide 
(0.5 mg/day) for six months or a strategy of increasing dose of pomalidomide from 0.5 mg/d up 
through each individual patients’ maximum tolerated dose, with escalations by 0.5 mg/d every 2 
weeks to a maximum of 2.0 mg/d. In each of the two arms, the trial will use a single stage design. 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
27As an early stopping rule for futility as outlined in section 8, if after 7 patients have enrolled on 
either arm, 0 have responded, then no further patients will be accrued to that arm as soon as this 
can be determined. To protect patient safety, an early stopping rule will be implemented. With two 
arms, each of which has a maximal accrual of 16 patients, up to 32 evaluable patients will be 
randomized. Safety assessments and pregnancy testing for FCBP will be performed at scheduled 
intervals as described in the Study Calendar. 
Response will be assessed every 3 months while taking pomalidomide following the criteria in 
Section 6.2. The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated at 6 months. Efficacy outcome is 
defined as clinical response (CR or PR) in subjects who enter the study with stable cGvHD or 
stable disease for ≥3 mo for subjects with progressive cGvHD at study-entry. (Stability will be 
assessed by the clinician and by the clinical exam at the screening evaluation based on the clinician 
estimate of the disease trajectory during the 3 months pre-randomization). Subjects who meet the 
response criteria at 6 months will continue therapy for another 6 months. If in the subject’s best 
interest, efforts will be made to provide access to study drug on compassionate basis beyond the 
12-month study endpoint. 
Patients who discontinue therapy for any reason will be followed for up to 24 months after starting 
pomalidomide as described in Section 6.1.3. 
Concurrent topical and ancillary treatments for cGvHD are allowed per standards of care and will 
be recorded (see Section 4).27 Other systemic immune suppression must stay stable or be tapered 
(systemic immunosuppression taper should be attempted no earlier than after 4-6 weeks on study), 
throughout the treatment with pomalidomide (with up to 2 steroid pulses allowed for disease 
stabilization per Section 4.1).

3.1.1 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
DLT will be defined as any grade ≥3 adverse event which is thought to be probably or 
definitively related to the investigational drug administration (notable exceptions where grades 2 
or lower can be considered as DLTs are indicated in Table 4 below in Section 3.3). In addition, 
any persons who are unable to tolerate the dose to which they are assigned will be counted as a 
DLT at the maximum dose explored for that patient. The time frame for evaluation in which 
toxicity will count towards a DLT will be up to 28 days after therapy received at a given dose 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
28level. In addition, a grade ≥ 3 AE will not be considered as DLT if the adverse event is attributed 
to a GVHD flare and responds to steroid pulse therapy as outlined in section 4.1. Whether treated 
on either arm, if there are 2 patients in the first 6 who experience a DLT from a given dose level, 
then no further patients will be treated at that dose level on the trial, regardless of arm. 
Furthermore, when more than 6 patients have received a given dose level, if at any time 33% or 
more patients experience a DLT when treated at that dose level, then no further patients will be 
treated at that dose level. Data from all subjects who receive >1 dose of pomalidomide will be 
include in the safety analysis.
3.1.2 Dose Escalation
All subjects, independently of the randomization arm, will start pomalidomide at 0.5 mg/d.  Those 
randomized to the high-dose arm will escalate to the target dose level by increasing the 
pomalidomide dose in 0.5 mg increments (Table 3) every 2 weeks to the next level. If the 
escalation is not tolerated, the patient will be treated on the next lower dose level. MTD designation 
will be given to the highest dose in which no more than 1 DLT occurred per cohort.

Starting Dose (level 1) 0.5 mg daily on Days 1-14
Dose Level 2 1.0 mg daily on Days 15-28
Dose Level 3 1.5 mg daily on Days 29-42
Dose Level 4 2.0 mg daily on Days 43-56
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
Pomalidomide will be given as 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2.0 mg capsules to be taken orally once a day 
on days 1–28 of a 28-day cycle. Each daily dose of pomalidomide should be taken at approximately 
the same time of day. Patients will be asked to complete a medication diary (Appendix P).
Pomalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or opened.   
If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. If it 
is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.  
Patients are instructed to fast (water or clear fluids only) for at least 2 hours prior to taking a dose 
to at least 1 hour post dosing.  Pomalidomide should not be swallowed concurrently with other 
allowed medications while on-study.
3.2.1 Drug Dispensing
Pomalidomide (POMALYST®) will be provided to research subjects for the duration of their 
participation in this trial at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Pomalidomide will be 
provided in accordance with the Celgene Corporation’s POMALYST REMS™ program.  Per the 
standard   POMALYST REMS™ program requirements, all physicians who prescribe 
pomalidomide for research subjects enrolled into this trial, and all research subjects enrolled into 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
29this trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the POMALYST 
REMS™ program.  
Drug will be shipped on a per patient basis by the contract pharmacy to the NIH pharmacy for 
IND studies.  Only enough pomalidomide for one cycle of therapy will be supplied to the patient 
each cycle.  This is in accordance with the POMALYST REMS™ program.
Only enough pomalidomide capsules for 1 cycle of therapy may be provided to the patient 
each cycle. 
Patients will be asked to maintain a dairy and bring to the next appointment all remaining capsules. 
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Patients requiring dose reduction will be reassigned to one of the lower dose cohorts being 
evaluated: 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg. Patients may be dose reduced to the lowest possible dose, i.e. 0.5 
mg. For any dose reductions or if study drug needs to be held greater than 35 days, the Principal 
Investigator (PI) or Lead Associate Investigator (LAI) must be contacted. Once a dose has been 
reduced, it cannot be re-escalated. At the discretion of the PI, the use of granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be permitted to manage neutropenic fever or a Grade 4 
neutropenia. Given the potentially long treatments delays, patients must have received 75% of 
the doses prescribed to be considered evaluable for the primary study endpoint.

3.4 QUESTIONNAIRES
Patient self-report questionnaires administered in this study are part of the standard NIH chronic 
consensus recommended criteria for the evaluation of cGvHD in clinical trials.29 These 
standardized assessments are designed to evaluate patient quality of life (SF-36, FACT-BMT), 
functional performance (HAP) and symptoms (Lee symptom scale, symptom intensity scale). The 
purpose of these evaluations is to assess the potential benefit of the administered therapy as 
compared to the baseline. These forms have been extensively used, published and validated. These 
forms are also standard part of many NCI CCR cGvHD protocols (Appendix G ). In a recent study 
median time for persons to complete these forms was 15 minutes (range 8-22 minutes).73

352Pomalidomide at assigned doses for 6 months; another 6-month course of treatment will be allowed for patients with response 
(see Section 3.1.1). Only patients who continue therapy beyond 6 months will be required to have clinical monitoring tests 
during cycles 7 through 12.
3Use NIH diagnostic criteria for cGvHD  (Appendix C). In addition, use Appendix D for clinical differentiation of acute versus 
cGvHD.
4MRI if indicated and chest CT at baseline and if indicated, at response assessments.
5Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential must follow pregnancy testing requirements as outlined in the POMALYST 
REMS™ program. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has 
had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
Pregnancy tests must occur 10–14 days and again within 24 hours prior to initiation of pomalidomide.  FCBP with regular or no 
menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks 
in therapy); at discontinuation of pomalidomide and at Day 28 post the last dose of pomalidomide.  Females with irregular 
menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 14 days while on therapy (including breaks 
in therapy), at discontinuation of pomalidomide and at Day 14 and Day 28 post the last dose of pomalidomide (see Appendix 
M).   
6All patients must be counseled about pregnancy precautions, risks of fetal exposure and other risks through the POMALYST 
REMS™ program.  The counseling must be done on at a minimum of every 28 days and at drug discontinuation. See Appendix 
M.
7ECG at indicated intervals baseline, at C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C7D1 and as clinically indicated. Prolongation of QTc > 0.5 s or 
QTc interval increases from baseline > 0.06 s is considered as a safety concern.
8CBC with differential and platelets, serum chemistries (including sodium, potassium, chloride, CO 2, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, AST 
[SGOT], ALT [SGPT], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and uric acid) at least every other week the first 3 months, then monthly 
until 9 months,then on day 28 of cycle 12. Platelets should be repeated when clinically indicated (e.g., suspected 
thromboembolic events).
9Includes primary and secondary measurement of response, performance scale, global rating, and Lee Symptom Scale (Appendix 
G through Appendix K).
10Skin and oral biopsies and saliva collection will be performed before treatment and after 6 months of pomalidomide, with intent 
to sample as close to the same area as possible (Section 5.1.1)
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
3611Blood for Immunologic studies will be collected (Section 5.1.2). A larger 100ml blood (12 R&G CPT) plus a 3ml theophylline 
citrate blood (for TGFb) will be collected only at baseline, at 3 months (beginning of cycle 4) and the 6 months evaluation (at the 
end of cycle 6)
12For determining serum pomalidomide levels, a 3-mL blood sample will be collected 2 hours (± 15 minutes) after initial oral 
administration and repeated every 2 weeks (20-24 hours after the last oral dose and 2 hours after the dose) until the 3-month 
evaluation, point then monthly until the 6-month evaluation (Section 5.1.3). Pre- dosing PK can be done 18-30 hours post last 
dose of pomalidomide.
13Patients who discontinue study drug for any reason will be followed for survival and cGvHD course and therapy for up to 2 
years from the start of study drug (see Section 6.1.3).
14Can be done up to two weeks after starting study drug
15As indicated in section 10.3, all subjects will be offered the opportunity to complete an NIH advanced directives form.  This 
should be done preferably at baseline but can be done at any time during the study as long as the capacity to do so is retained.  
The completion of the form is strongly recommended, but is not required.
Patients may undergo additional subspecialty evaluations by Gynecology, Dermatology, Opthalmology, Dentistry, Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation and Occupational Medicine at any additional time points as indicated clinically or during the off study visit per 
investigator discretion.

373.6 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY C RITERIA
Prior to removal from study, effort must be made to have all subjects complete a safety visit 
approximately 30 days following the last dose of study therapy.
3.6.1 Criteria for removal from protocol therapy
•Completion of 6- or 12-month course of protocol therapy (depending on the level of 
response)
•Progressive cGvHD or malignancy requiring new line of systemic therapy
•Participant requests to be withdrawn from active therapy
•Unacceptable toxicity as defined in Section 3.3
•Dose interruption longer than 35 days
•Positive pregnancy test
•Investigator discretion
The PI is to be notified of all discontinuations from study drug. The reason for dose 
modification/discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the patient’s medical records.
3.6.2 Off-Study Criteria
•Completed 2-year follow-up period
•Subject withdrawal from follow-up period
•Patient lost for follow-up
•Death
•PI decision to end this study 
3.6.3 Off Protocol Therapy and OffStudy Procedure
Authorized staff must notify Central Registration Office (CRO) when a subject is taken off- 
protocol therapy and when a subject is taken off study. A Participant Status Update Form from 
the web site (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/intra/eligibility/welcome.htm) main page must be 
completed and sent via encrypted email to:  NCI Central Registration Office (HOIS) 
ncicentralregistration-l@mail.nih.gov .
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
All medications (prescription and non-prescription), treatments and therapies taken throughout the 
study must be recorded on the appropriate page of the CRF. Patients will be advised to contact the 
study team before starting any new medications.
4.1 CONCOMITANT CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY AND TAPERING GUIDELINE
During the study, persons may remain on corticosteroids with intent to taper it. A steroid taper 
will be allowed to begin earliest at 4-6 weeks after starting on protocol, with a 10% (of starting 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
38dose) decrease per week. The study allows maximum two total pulses of steroids with 
subsequent rapid taper, one at the beginning of pomalidomide therapy in case of GvHD flares 
associated with the study drug initiation and/or another one later for any flares or worsening of 
cGvHD symptoms during steroid or other immunosuppression taper. Typical corticosteroid pulse 
is defined as up to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent tapered to the pre-pulse baseline within 
3 weeks. Steroid pulses require the PI’s approval. If the patient has a GVHD flare and no other 
reasons to hold the drug for an AE the patient would continue pomalidomide administration 
concomitantly with steroid pulse. Administration steroid pulses will be carefully recorded in the 
protocol case report forms. 
4.2 OTHER TREATMENTS FOR CGVHD
Patients who are taking concomitant systemic agents for control of cGvHD, such as calcineurin 
inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus or cyclosporine) or other immunosuppressants (e.g., mycophenolate 
or sirolimus) must be on a stable dose in the preceding 4 weeks with an intent to stop if possible 
after corticosteroids are at stable or supplementation doses (maximum 7.5 mg prednisone/day) or 
discontinued. Patient should not receive any investigational drugs or initiate any systemic 
therapy for cGvHD once started on pomalidomide. Patient should not be undergoing 
extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) concomitantly with study drug, and if they had ECP in the 
past, a minimum of 4 weeks should have passed since its discontinuation.
4.3 VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM PROPHYLAXIS
Pomalidomide may increase the risk of thrombotic events in persons who are at high risk or with 
a history of thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause thrombosis. 
When pomalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids (e.g., dexamethasone, 
prednisone), anthracyclines (doxorubicin) and erythropoietin, the risk of thrombosis may be 
increased. All persons if receiving study treatment in addition to any of these other agents must 
also agree to take venous thromboembolism (e.g., at minimum aspirin 325 mg/day) or some other 
form of prophylaxis as deemed appropriate by the PI, such as low molecular weight or 
unfractionated heparin.74 Patients should continue to receive anti-thrombotic therapy for the 
duration of pomalidomide therapy and 5 days after pomalidomide is discontinued.
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients taking pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is currently 
using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to another one of the effective 
methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced 
during co-treatment with dexamethasone.
4.4 OTHER ALLOWED CONCOMITANT THERAPY
Ancillary therapy and supportive care considered necessary for the patient’s wellbeing may be 
administered at the discretion of the PI and will follow the NIH Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Consortium guidelines for supportive care: 
http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/bmt/clinicalcare/guidelines.shtml . Any ancillary or supportive care 
which may have some effect on efficacy analysis will be carefully recorded in the CRF. Patients 
are allowed to take topical steroids at a maximum of 1% hydrocortisone concentration potency 
equivalence.
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
394.5 PROHIBITED CONCOMITANT THERAPY
Radiation therapy, cancer chemotherapy, biologic or immunotherapy is prohibited during 
participation in this study. Concomitant use of other investigational agents is not permitted while 
persons are receiving study drug. 
5 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION
5.1 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH
Note:  All samples will be sent for storage until analysis as detailed in Section 5.2 under 
appropriate storage conditions. 
5.1.1 Skin Biopsy and Oral Biopsy 
Skin and oral research biopsies will be performed before treatment and after 6 months of 
pomalidomide treatment (with intent to sample as close to the same area as possible) for 
assessment of sclerotic or lichen-planus like disease by H&E and pathologist evaluation. 
Immunohistochemistry methods will be applied to look for myofibroblast markers and pSMAD in 
the sclerotic skin, for T-cell infiltrates, and IFN-induced factors in the oral mucosa and 
erythematous skin. The advantage of histology is the greater amount of information on cell 
populations and functional changes in situ of the disease. These biopsies will be obtained by one 
of the study investigators and processed, stored and analyzed. A biopsy sample will be also sent 
to the NCI pathology laboratory. Patients will have an option to decline such research biopsy and 
this will not be considered as protocol deviation. Biopsy samples collected on the 04-C-0281 
cGvHD natural history study can be also used for these studies if obtained in the timeframe as part 
of the screening evaluations for this study.        
5.1.2 Immunologic Analyses Using Plasma and PBMCs
1. Blood: Blood will be collected, and PBMC and plasma will be cryopreserved for later batch 
analyses of markers relevant to cGvHD activity. Plasma will be collected with 
theophylline-citrate anticoagulant (to prevent platelet breakdown) for assessment of TGFb 
and PDGF, which may be relevant to fibrosis.  Heparinized plasma will be assayed for 
markers of cGvHD activity (including but not limited to BAFF, and IFN-induced 
chemokines). PBMC will be cryopreserved for subsequent flow cytometry of cell 
populations and sorting of monocytes for transcriptional analysis of genes upregulated in 
active cGvHD. The primary collection of blood for these analyses of pomalidomide effect 
on cGvHD will be at baseline and at 3 and 6 month evaluation time point. At these three 
timepoints one theophylline citrate plasma tube (for TGFb) and 12 red and green topped 
heparin CPT tubes (total of 100 cc) will be collected; a final collection will be done on 
patients continuing treatment until 12 months.
2.Plasma will be assayed for BAFF, IFN-induced chemokines and MCP-1. Separate 
collection of theophylline-citrate blood (different anticoagulant to prevent platelet 
breakdown) will be performed for assessment of TGFb and PDGF. 
3.Monocyte transcriptome: Monocytes will be sorted from PBMC for Nanostring evaluation 
of the monocyte transcriptome. This would be done on cryopreserved cells at the end of 
the study. Monocytes circulate throughout the body, are responsive to a variety of cytokines 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
40in tissues affected by cGvHD and maybe therefore serve as a reporter for changes in 
cGvHD-affected tissues.
4.Lymphocyte populations. Changes in circulating populations of lymphocytes will be 
assessed by flow cytometry on whole blood to determine changes in CD3, CD4, CD8, B 
and NK populations. At baseline, at the start of each cycle up to the 3 month time point 
and at 6 and 12 months, one 3ml lavender (EDTA) tube will be drawn and 
lymphophenotyping will be performed using Clinical center’s CLIA certified 
Immunophenotyping panel and reported in the CRIS. Further research assessments of the 
percentages of regulatory T cells, of naïve, memory and effector T cells and of B cell 
transitional, naïve and memory populations will be done in the ETIB Preclinical Core (Fran 
Hakim) on the baseline and at 3 month evaluation time points until 12 months post 
enrollment. Active cGvHD has been associated with decreases in Treg populations, 
reduced thymopoiesis (fewer naïve T cells) and increases in CD21- transitional B cell 
populations. Urine will be collected at 3 month intervals for assessment of biomarkers in 
urine as compared with blood.
The assays indicated are designed to assess the alterations in skin, oral mucosa and in circulating 
lymphocytes and plasma that may result from pomalidomide. If there is a decline in TGFb 
production or response, then this may be evident in TGFb levels in the plasma and in degree of 
fibrosis (by pathologist evaluation) and extent of pSMAD2/3 in sclerotic skin. If there is an 
increase in Th1 cells or a shift in Treg populations, this may be reflected in circulating T cell 
populations, plasma cytokines and tissue infiltrates. 
5.1.3 Measurement of Pomalidomide Serum Levels  
The objective of measuring pomalidomide serum levels is for the documentation of systemic 
absorption. A 6-mL blood sample will be collected 2 hours (+/- 20 minutes, exact time elapsed 
post-dosing will be recorded on PK sheets) after initial oral administration and repeated peak and 
trough every 2 weeks (20-28 hours after the last oral dose and 2 hours post-dose) until the 3-month 
evaluation, then monthly until the 6-month evaluation. Pre- dosing PK can be done 18-30 hours 
post last dose of pomalidomide. Actual dosing dates and times will be recorded. Detailed 
instruction for sample collection, processing, storage, and handling can be found in Appendix B. 
These sample collections will occur at the protocol scheduled evaluation visits at the NIH Clinical 
Center. 
The determination of pomalidomide concentrations in plasma samples, as well as the 
pharmacokinetic data analysis, will be performed by the Clinical Pharmacology Program. Samples 
will be analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system. 
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed. 
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required.

415.2.1 Sample Procedures
Blood and tissue samples, collected for the purpose of research under IRB-approved protocols of 
the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB)/Immune Deficiency Cellular 
Therapy Program (IDCTP) will be stored and may be archived by the Biospecimen Processing 
Core (BPC), with the exception of blood samples for pomalidomide analysis, which will be 
stored separately by the Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) until analysis. These will be 
barcoded, with data entered and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by the BPC. This is a secure 
program, with access to Labmatrix limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued 
individual user accounts. Installation of Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. 
These computers all have a password restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center 
patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).
Barcoded samples are stored in locked freezers at -20 or -80°C (sera and plasma) or under liquid 
nitrogen (cells), or as otherwise applicable according to stability requirements. These freezers are 
located onsite in the BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, 
MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by laboratory staff at all times. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator to 
ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.
5.2.1.1 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction 
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting 
the rights to use the material. 
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed or returned to the participant, if so requested. The PI will record any 
loss or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation. Reporting will be per the 
requirements of section 7.2 7.2.
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION 
6.1 DATA COLLECTION
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant data 
capture system provided by the NCI CCR and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
42data manager will assist with the data management efforts. Primary and final analyzed data will 
have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.
All adverse events, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event. Patients 
will be followed for adverse events for a minimum of 30 days after the last administration of 
investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of at least possibly related to the 
agent/intervention should be recorded and reported as per sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 or until 
removal from study treatment, whichever comes first.
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:
•Results in discontinuation from the study
•Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
•Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention
•Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization. 
•Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact
•If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations, and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable. 
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
6.1.1 Eligibility Checklist
The eligibility checklist is to be completed at study entry and forwarded to protocol research nurse 
who will forward the checklist to the Central Registration Office. 
6.1.2 Protocol Deviations and Non-Compliance
Any protocol non-compliance or deviations should be directly reported to the PI and to the NIH 
IRB per Section 7.2.  
6.1.3 Follow-up
All persons will be followed for SAEs for 30 days after last dose of pomalidomide. Patients who 
discontinue therapy for any reason will be invited for a follow up visit at 3 months after last dose, 
then followed up by a phone call to the patient and/or the primary physician’s office at 12 and 24 
months after starting the first dose of pomalidomide. The phone call will focus on a) survival status 
and cause of death if pertinent, b) ongoing systemic treatment for cGvHD and date of 
discontinuation, c) primary malignancy progression, d) any second primary malignancy, e) return 
to work part-time or full-time. Primary and contributing causes of death are to be recorded in the 
CRF and the patient’s medical record.

Version Date: 4/29/2025
436.2 RESPONSE C RITERIA
6.2.1 Definitions
Evaluable for efficacy: Patients who complete 6 months of therapy will be evaluable for the 
secondary endpoint of efficacy assessment. Patients who progress earlier will be also included in 
the analysis of efficacy.   
6.2.2 Efficacy Analysis
The primary evaluation point is overall response at 6 months using the NIH cGvHD response 
criteria measures.29 The overall response score will be assessed as CR, PR, SD or PD as per NIH 
guidelines. The organ-specific and other subcomponents of the overall response score will be 
analyzed individually and absolute values recorded.
Up to 2 corticosteroid pulses will be allowed, one for initial flares and one for late flares as 
described in Section 4.1.  
Response will be assessed every 3 months from the start of pomalidomide. To ensure 
comparability, baseline and on-study methods for response assessment will be performed using 
identical grading, scale or techniques. The Chronic GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form will be 
completed at each 3-month evaluation visit [Appendix G ]. Included in that form are both organ-
specific primary measurements and clinician-assessed secondary measurements. The response of 
each affected organ will be evaluated and an overall response (CR, PR, stable disease) will be 
determined. 
6.2.2.1 Response Criteria
Efficacy will be assessed using NIH consensus criteria measuring for therapeutic response in 
clinical trials for cGvHD29:
•CR is defined as complete resolution in all of signs and symptoms at all affected organs 
or tissues. 
•PR is defined as improvement in  1 organ or tissue with no progression in any other 
affected organ or tissue. The calculations for PR and progressive disease (PD) are 
provided in Appendix H and Appendix I. 
•Response < PR is defined as change towards improvement from the pre-treatment 
baseline but not meeting the criteria for CR or PR. 
•Stable Disease is defined as no change in cGvHD, SD will be considered as response 
in patients with documented cGvHD progression over preceding 3 months. 
•Flare  is defined as exacerbation of cGvHD manifestations during withdrawal of 
immunosuppressive therapy which do not exceed those at the beginning of the trial and 
improves after reinstatement of previous treatment.
•Progressive disease  is defined as failure of therapy to control cGvHD. The calculations 
for progressive disease (PD) are provided in Appendix I. Assessment by Organ-
Specific Criteria. Patients who progress prior to 6 months evaluation will be also 
evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
•Mixed response (improvement in some organs but worsening in others) will be 
categorized as progressive disease. 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
44As outlined in Section 3.5, type of involved organ, location and its measurements will be 
recorded at scheduled evaluations and reported on the appropriate CRF, equal to “Chronic 
GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form,” (Appendix G). All other measurements not being 
included in primary assessment but clinically related to cGvHD (e.g., change of pigmentation) 
will be reported in the source documents. 
Skin and skin appendages:  Skin assessments include 4 anatomic level of skin involvement: 
(1) erythematous rash (epidermal), 
(2) movable sclerosis (dermal), 
(3) non-moveable sclerosis, hidebound skin, or involvement of subcutaneous tissue and 
fascia (subcutaneous) and 
(4) ulceration (full thickness loss of epidermal tissue). 
The first 3 measurements should be taken separately and recorded in metric notation using a body 
surface area (BSA). A cutaneous assessment worksheet for recording the BSA is provided 
(Appendix J). The size of ulcer should be measured the longest diameter (LD) of the largest ulcer. 
Eyes:  The primary measurement of lacrimal gland function in cGvHD is using the Schirmer’s 
test. The test should be performed without anesthesia for both eyes (OU) unless physically 
inapplicable. The measurement of each eye and the average of measurements will be recorded in 
the CRF.
Mouth:  Mouth assessments include: 
(1) mucosal erythema by 0-3 grading based on the color intensity, (2) lichen-type 
hyperkeratosis by 0-3 grading based on the percentage of oral surface area,(3 ulceration by 
0-6 based on percentage of oral surface area, and (4) mucoceles by 0-3 grading based on 
its total number of presence. 
Hematopoietic:  The measurements of hematopoietic response include:
(1) platelet count, 
(2) eosinophil count and percentage. 
White blood cell (WBC) count will be recorded on the Assessment Form but will not be 
used for response assessment. 
Gastrointestinal tract:  Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are graded through interview by the 
investigator according to 0-3 severity scales. 
Liver: Involvement of liver is graded according to the levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes (AST 
and ALT). 
Lung:  The forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and single breath diffusion lung 
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is included as components for the lung function score 
(LFS). LFS is computed by the extent of FEV1 and DLCO compromise (>80% = 1, 70 – 79% = 
2, 60 – 69% = 3, 50 – 59% = 4, 40 – 49% = 5, <40% = 6). Scores for FEV1 and DLCO are added 
and the sum reduced to an overall category according to following table (Table 5). Absolute values 
of both FEV1 and DLCO should be recorded in the CRF.

Global chronic GVHD Rating:  The overall clinical impression of patient’s cGvHD will be 
recorded on a 4-point (0-3) scale on the Chronic GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form.  
Chronic GVHD Improvement Scale:  The overall changes of patient’s cGvHD symptoms during 
previous 3 months will be recorded on a 7-point (-3 to +3) scale on the Chronic GVHD Assessment 
(Clinician) Form.
Chronic GVHD Symptom Severity Scale:  The overall severity of patient’s cGvHD symptoms 
will be recorded on an 11-point (0-10) numeric scale on the Chronic GVHD Assessment 
(Clinician) Form.
Karnofsky Performance Scale:  The Karnofsky Performance Scale will be only recorded on the 
Chronic GVHD Assessment (Clinician) Form but not used as a measure of response. 
Lee symptom scale was developed as a 30-item symptom scale with 7 subscales to capture the 
cGvHD-specific symptom burden (Appendix K ). This symptom scale showed to correlate with 
persons’ self-assessed mild, moderate, and severe cGvHD manifestations in cross-sectional 
validation analysis. “Lee total score” will be calculated per Lee et al.75 Longitudinal assessments 
showed that changes in overall health status correlated best with changes in quality of life as 
measured by the SF-36 and FACT-BMT. We will not use “Lee symptom scale” as a measure of 
pomalidomide efficacy but as supplemental information on the quality of life. 
NIH organ 0-3 scoring (Appendix E) will be also collected at the evaluation endpoints.22 
Although not initially developed for response assessments, the evidence is emerging in some 
domains (skin, eyes) about potential use of this scale as a simple and valid assessment of cGvHD 
change over time.

488 SPONSOR PROTOCOL/SAFETY REPORTING
8.1 DEFINITIONS
8.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2))
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death,
•A life-threatening adverse event (see section 8.1.3)
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
oA hospitalization/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospitalization for pre-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
oA hospitalization/admission that is solely driven by non-medical reasons (e.g., 
hospitalization for patient or subject convenience) is not considered a serious adverse 
event. 
oEmergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to 
the hospital would not be considered a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking 
medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.
•Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32)
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
498.1.4 Severity
The severity of each Adverse Event will be assessed utilizing the CTCAE version 4.0.
8.1.5 Relationship to Study Product
All AEs will have their relationship to study product assessed using the terms:  related or not 
related.  
•Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study product and the adverse event.
•Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event.
8.2 ASSESSMENT OF S AFETY EVENTS
AE information collected will include event description, date of onset, assessment of severity 
and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product), date of 
resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome. The assessment of severity and relationship to 
the study product will be done only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis 
and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.  AEs 
occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution.
SAEs will be:
•Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not 
related to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as 
the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.
•Recorded on the appropriate SAE report form, the medical record and captured in the 
clinical database.
•Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 
as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.
For timeframe of recording adverse events, please refer to section Error! Reference source not 
found. . All serious adverse events recorded from the time of first investigational product 
administration must be reported to the sponsor. 
8.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS
Any AE that meets protocol-defined serious criteria or meets the definition of Adverse Event of 
Special Interest that require expedited reporting must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours 
of awareness) to OSRO Safety using the CCR SAE report form.  
All SAE reporting must include the elements described in section 8.2.
SAE reports will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  CCR SAE report form

Following the assessment of the SAE by OSRO, other supporting documentation of the event 
may be requested by the OSRO Safety and should be provided as soon as possible.
8.4 SAFETY R EPORTING CRITERIA TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATORS
Reporting will be per the collaborative agreement. 
8.5 REPORTING PREGNANCY 
All required pregnancy reports/follow-up to OSRO will be submitted to: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  Forms and instructions 
can be found here: https://nih.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/NCI-CCR-OCD-
Communications/SitePages/Forms-and-Instructions.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=uWBXtI
8.5.1 Maternal  exposure
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy becomes known.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2) should be reported as 
SAEs. 
The outcome of all pregnancies  occurring from the first dose of study therapy until 28 days after 
the last dose of study therapy should be followed up and documented.
8.5.2 Paternal exposure
Male participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and 
for 28 days after the last dose of Pomalidomide.
Pregnancy of the participant’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies occurring from the date of the first dose until 28 days after the last dose should, if 
possible, be followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the opportunity to 
participate in an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP pregnancy registry 
study) to provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety reporting purposes.
8.6 REGULATORY R EPORTING FOR STUDIES C ONDUCTED UNDER CCR-S PONSORED IND
Following notification from the investigator, CCR, the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  CCR will report an AE as a suspected 
adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
product and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to 21 CFR Part 312.32. 
All serious events will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.

Version Date: 4/29/2025
518.7 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by the 
Staff or the site Monitor in the CCR Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through 
independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:
•Informed consent process
•Eligibility confirmation
•Drug administration and accountability
•Adverse events monitoring
•Response assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by personnel employed by a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by training and experience to monitor the progress of clinical trials. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
It is known from prior trials that the pomalidomide MTD is about 3 mg/d in persons with bone 
marrow disorders receiving therapies for cancer. Due to high frequency of pomalidomide dose 
de-escalation observed in preliminary cGvHD experiences when given at 3 mg/d, this study will 
explore clinical toxicity of gradual escalation doses below 3.0 mg.
The primary objective of this study is to determine if patients with cGVHD will experience an 
acceptable level of clinical response when treated with either a constant low dose of 
pomalidomide (0.5 mg/day) for six months or a strategy of increasing dose of pomalidomide 
from 0.5 mg/d up through each individual patients’ maximum tolerated dose, with escalations by 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
520.5 mg/d every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2.0 mg/d. The study will thus randomize patients 
between fixed low dose and escalating dose to tolerance, and will be considered a randomized 
phase II trial with a selection design component.
In each of the two arms, the trial will be conducted using a single stage design. With 16 patients 
on each arm, an exact binomial test would have 90% power to detect a difference between a 5% 
response rate and a 30% response rate using a 0.10 one-sided significance level and an exact 
binomial test. In addition, after the trial has ended, the 80% and 95% confidence limits will be 
determined for each arm about the observed response proportion in order to aid in interpretation 
of the results. If there are 3 or more responses in 16 patients, this would be sufficient to rule out a 
5% response rate and demonstrate consistency with 30% or better response rates.
At the conclusion of the study, if both arms are able to accrue to the full 16 patients, the arm with 
the greater number of responses will be selected for further investigation subsequently. That is, if 
the fixed, low-dose arm, or the increasing dose level arm, has the greater number of responses, 
then that arm would be studied further. In the event of a tie, the lower dose arm would likely be 
preferred. As an example, if the true probabilities of response on the two arms were 0.10 and 
0.30, then the probability of correctly selecting the superior arm would be 93%, and if the true 
probabilities on the two arms were 0.15 and 0.30, the probability of correct selection would be 
84%.
As an early stopping rule for futility, if after 7 patients have enrolled on either arm, 0 have 
responded, then no further patients will be accrued to that arm as soon as this can be determined. 
In practice, this means that patients may continue to be accrued beyond 7 in an arm, but no more 
patients would be registered and treated on that arm once the first 7 were evaluated and no PRs 
or CRs were identified in those first 7.
To protect patient safety, an early stopping rule will be implemented as follows. For patients 
treated on either arm, if 2 patients in the first 6, or 33% of the patients at any time experience a 
DLT at a given dose level, no further patients will be treated at that given level on the trial. 
Furthermore, when more than 6 patients have received a given dose level, if at any time 33% or 
more patients experience a DLT when treated at that dose level, then no further patients will be 
treated at that dose level.  Thus, as an example, should there be 2 patients with a DLT in the first 
6 who are able to receive 2.0 mg/day on the dose escalating arm, then subsequent patients treated 
on that arm will not be escalated beyond 1.5 mg/day.
With two arms, each of which has a maximal accrual of 16 patients, up to 32 evaluable patients 
will be randomized. In order to allow for a very small number of patients who are not able to be 
evaluated at all for response, the accrual ceiling will be set at 35.

Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
5312 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS 
12.1 RATIONALE F OR S UBJECT SELECTION
No subjects will be excluded from participation based on sex, race or ethnicity. The study will be 
open to all subjects who satisfy the inclusion criteria and provide an informed consent to the 
protocol. 
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
As there is no experience with pomalidomide in children, this study will be limited to subjects age 
18 years or older.
12.3 PARTICIPATION OF NIH  SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE C ONSENT
Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However re-consent 
may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become 
decisionally impaired. For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from 
research participation (section 10.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI or AI will contact the NIH 
Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) for evaluation as needed for the following: an 
independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance 
in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the 
capacity to appoint a surrogate. For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have 
pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in MEC Policy 87-4 and 
NIH HRPP 403 for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) 
decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, 
will be followed.
12.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
12.4.1 Related to Pomalidomide
Potential risks of pomalidomide include the range of toxicities described in Section 11.1.9 and the 
consent form. There may also be unexpected side effects. All subjects will be carefully monitored 
for side effects. 
12.4.2 Related to Blood Collection
Minor complications including bleeding, pain, and hematoma formation at the site of blood draws, 
or infections may rarely occur.
12.4.3 Related to Tissue Biopsy
Skin and oral punch biopsy is a minor surgical procedure that may be associated with temporary 
bleeding, hematoma at the site, local infection and postoperative discomfort. These risks are small 
(generally <5%) and transient.
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
5412.4.4 Related to Pregnancy
Pomalidomide is in a class of agents that is known to be teratogenic. Women of child-bearing 
potential and men must agree to adhere to methods of contraception and other fertility control 
measures as prescribed by the protocol. This will include counseling about pregnancy precautions 
and the potential risks of fetal exposure conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. Women of 
child-bearing potential must also undergo regular pregnancy testing. 
12.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Risks of participating in this trial include side effects from pomalidomide and risks of medical 
procedures (blood draws, oral and skin biopsy). Patients may receive benefit from the clinical 
monitoring or potentially experience improvement in cGvHD symptoms or quality of life. 
Therefore, this research represents more than minimal risk to subjects with prospect of direct 
benefit to individual subjects. 
12.6 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedure and its attendant risks 
and discomforts will be carefully explained to the subject. The potential subject will be educated 
regarding the nature of the condition, proposed intervention, and outcome measures. Study 
subjects will be informed that participation is entirely voluntary and that withdrawal from the study 
can be made at any time without penalty of benefits to which they may be entitled. Informed 
consent will be obtained by Dr. Steven Pavletic or his designee. At any time during participation 
in the protocol if new information becomes available relating to risks, adverse events, or toxicities, 
this information will be provided orally or in writing to all enrolled or prospective participants. 
Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the informed consent amended to 
reflect relevant information.
12.6.1 Telephone re-consent procedure
Reconsent on this study may be obtained via telephone according to the following procedure: the 
informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date the informed consent. A witness to the subject’s signature will 
sign and date the consent.  The original informed consent document will be sent back to the 
consenting investigator who will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was 
obtained via telephone.  A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by the consenting 
investigator.
12.6.2 Short form consent process for non-English speaking patients
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for whom there is no translated extant 
IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator and/or those authorized to obtain 
informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS Policy M77-
2, OSHRP SOP 12, and 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2).  The summary that will be used is the English 
version of the extant IRB approved consent document.  Signed copies of both the English version 
of the consent and the translated short form will be given to the subject or their legally authorized 
representative and the signed original will be filed in the medical record.
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
55Unless the PI is fluent in the prospective subject’s language, an interpreter will be present to 
facilitate the conversation. Preferably someone who is independent of the subject (i.e., not a family 
member) will assist in presenting information and obtaining consent. Whenever possible, 
interpreters will be provided copies of the relevant consent documents well before the consent 
conversation with the subject (24 to 48 hours if possible). 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form process and will notify the IRB 
at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the use of the Short Form.
13 REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, 
investigators, funding agency, the Investigational New Drug (IND) and regulatory authorities. If 
the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly 
inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide 
the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contacted, as 
applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:
•Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
•Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping   
•Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
•Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
•Determination that the primary endpoint has been met
•Determination of futility
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and as applicable, Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
13.2 QUALITY A SSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological 
specimen collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management 
plan will be developed to describe a site’s quality management.
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the 
clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)). 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
56The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local 
and regulatory authorities.
13.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST P OLICY
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the 
pharmaceutical industry, is critical.  Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who 
have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be 
disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be 
required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the 
design and conduct of this trial.  The study leadership in conjunction with the National Cancer 
Institute has established policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all 
conflicts of interest and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities 
of interest.
13.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND P RIVACY
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and/or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical 
records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at the/each clinical site for 
internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a 
secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional policies, or 
sponsor requirements.
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be  stored at the NCI CCR. This will not include the participant’s contact or 
identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified 
by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems 
used by the clinical site(s) and by NCI CCR research staff will be secured and password 
protected. At the end of the study, all study databases will be archived at the NCI CCR.
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been 
issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects identifiable research

14 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
14.1 POMALIDOMIDE
14.1.1 Description
Pomalidomide, 4-amino-2-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidyl)isoindoline-1’-one)-1,3-dione, is a novel 
immunomodulatory drug. The Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number for 
pomalidomide is 19171-19-8. Pomalidomide is also known as CC-4047. The chemical structure 
of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is as follows: 
Pomalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms 
S (-) and R (+). Pomalidomide is being developed as a racemate. 
Pomalidomide shares a number of the beneficial pharmacologic properties of thalidomide and 
lenalidomide, but it is a more potent anti-proliferative immunomodulating agent than either drug. 
14.1.2 Source
Celgene Corporation will supply pomalidomide 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 2.0 mg capsules. 
Pomalidomide will be packaged in bottles containing capsules for 28 days of every 28-day cycle. 
Only a 28-day supply of pomalidomide may be provided to the patient for each 28-day cycle. Site 
will utilize commercial supply of anti-thrombotic agents for prophylactic purposes.
Celgene will supply drug free of charge. The initial drug shipment will be sent to NIH pharmacy.  
NIH pharmacy will order all subsequent drug orders.
14.1.3 Formulation and Preparation
Pomalidomide will be administered as 2.0 mg, 1.0 mg and/or 0.5 mg capsules to be taken orally. 
Each daily dose of pomalidomide should be taken at approximately the same time of day. No 
modification of capsules is necessary.   
14.1.4 Study Drug Packaging and Labeling
Pomalidomide investigational supplies are dispensed to the persons in individual bottles of 
capsules. Each bottle will identify the contents as study medication. The label for study drug 
supplied by Celgene will bear the Celgene Corporation name and address, the protocol number, 

Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
58the quantity of study drug contained, and the standard caution statement, as follows: “Caution:  
New Drug - Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use.”
Pomalidomide should not be handled by FCBP unless wearing gloves.  All bottles will contain the 
following warning label: “WARNING: POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN BIRTH DEFECTS.”
14.1.5 Study Drug Receipt and Storage
The PI is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of study drug received, and 
comparing it with the accompanying study drug accountability form.  The PI or their designee will 
verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, 
and return a copy to Celgene.
At the study site, all investigational study drugs will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.
The study drug should be stored at room temperature away from direct sunlight and protected from 
excessive heat and cold.
14.1.6 Administration Procedures
Females of childbearing potential should not handle or administer pomalidomide unless they are 
wearing gloves. Pomalidomide capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, 
chewed or opened. Pomalidomide should be taken without food, at least 2 hours before or 2 hours 
after a meal.
If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If it 
is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up, rather it should be taken at the next scheduled 
time point. 
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.  
Accurate recording of all study drug administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be made 
in the source documents.
14.1.7 Study Drug Accountability
The PI or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all study drug that is issued to and returned 
by the patient during the course of the study.
14.1.8 Study Drug Handling and Disposal
Celgene will instruct the Investigator(s) on the return or destruction of unused study drug.  If any 
study drug is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented in the patient’s CRF and 
source documents. Study drug supplies will be retained at the clinical site pending instructions for 
disposition by Celgene.  Patients will be instructed to return empty bottles or unused capsules.
14.1.9 Expected Toxicities
Likely (more than 20%): Constipation, fatigue, myalgia, and rash.
Less Likely (less than 20%):  Anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, productive cough, dyspnea 
(with or without exertion), lung pain, nose bleeds, sore throat, discolored sputum, bloody sputum, 
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
59irritation of the upper respiratory tract, other  respiratory infections, fever, headache, bacterial or 
viral infections, bone pain, muscle cramps, joint swelling, parasthesias, nausea, diarrhea, bloating, 
dry mouth and irritation of the mouth, dry skin, redness of the skin, and itching, unusual weakness 
or dizziness, hypotension, flushing, and chest pain.
Rare (Less than 3%): pneumonia, vomiting, blood clots in persons receiving combination therapy 
with other cancer drug, erythropoeitin, and/or steroids.
Experience with pomalidomide in humans and animals is detailed in the background section. 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported grade 3/4 AE in subjects with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma. The majority of these occurred without associated infection and was the dose-
limiting toxicity observed during the dose finding portion of the study. Neutropenia was also the 
most frequently reported AE and SAE in subjects with multiple myeloma followed by 
thrombocytopenia and anemia. Subjects receiving pomalidomide have developed venous 
thromboembolic events (DVTs and pulmonary emboli) reported as SAEs. Anticoagulant 
prophylaxis is recommended as a precaution per protocol.
Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in a developmental study in rabbits. Precautions against 
fetal exposure are detailed throughout the protocol.
14.1.10Incompatibilities
Based on in vitro metabolism data, pomalidomide is not likely to precipitate drug-drug interactions 
especially due to inhibition or induction when co-administered with cytochrome P-450, substrates.
A food effect study with pomalidomide has not been conducted.

Blood and Plasma Sample Labeling
Labels must contain the following information:
•Protocol No.: 
•Subject ID number: 
•Nominal Time Point: 
All blood and plasma collection tubes and storage vials should be labeled and chilled on wet ice 
prior to sample collection and processing.  
Blood Sample Collection
•Research nurses will give the Figg lab 24 hours advance notice on PK blood draws. 
•Fill an ice bucket with a sufficient amount of ice to pre-chill all collection tubes before 
blood draw.
•Collect approximately 6 mL of whole blood into a pre-chilled 6-mL K 3EDTA tube to 
which 1% hydrochloric acid has been added (supplied by Figg Laboratory).  Blood can 
be collected via direct vein puncture or indwelling catheter.
•Accurately record the time of blood collection.
•Gently invert the tube 3-5 times and immerse it into ice immediately to prevent possible 
compound degradation at room temperature.  
•The date, cycle day, and exact time of each blood draw should be recorded on the 
sample tube and the PK sheet containing the study number and unique patient identifier.
•Please page 102-11964 (Gareth Peters or alternate tech) for immediate pick-up. 
(Contact the Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) processing group in 10/5A09 at 
301-594-6131 or 301-402-3622 with any questions). 
Blood Sample Processing to Obtain Plasma
•Within 30 minutes of collection, the blood sample must be centrifuged at 1,500 g (about 
3,000 rpm dependent upon the type of centrifuge) for 10 min at 4°C to obtain plasma.  
•Using Eppendorf pipettes (or equivalent) to transfer approximately 0.7 mL of plasma 
into each of the two pre-labeled, pre-chilled, citric acid-containing polypropylene 
storage vials (one primary and one back-up, provide by Celgene).  Keep storage vials 
on ice before they are ready to be transferred into a freezer.
•Within 60 minutes of blood collection, transfer plasma samples in storage vials into a 
–80oC freezer, where they will remain stored until analysis.
•Immediately record the time of sample entry into the freezer.
•Patient data will be entered into a secure and encrypted LabSamples database 
maintained by the Clinical Pharmacology Program, Office of the Clinical Director

When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT scores the higher value should be used for final scoring. Scoring 
using the Lung Function Score (LFS) is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, grading using FEV1 should be used. The percent predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: >80% = 1; 70-79% = 2; 60-69% = 3; 50-59% = 4; 40-49% = 5; <40% = 6. The LFS = FEV1 score + DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12.

8816.13 APPENDIX M:  POMALIDOMIDE RISKS OF F ETAL EXPOSURE, PREGNANCY TESTING 
GUIDELINES AND A CCEPTABLE BIRTH CONTROL METHODS 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy
Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in a developmental study in rabbits.  Pomalidomide is 
an analogue of thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life-
threatening human birth defects.  If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth 
defects or death to an unborn baby.
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who is 
menstruating, amenorrheic from previous medical treatments, under 50 years of age and/or 
perimenopausal and do not qualify for the females not of reproductive potential category.
Criteria for females not of reproductive potential: 
Defined as females who have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive months, or 
who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.
Counselling
For a female of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following 
are met (ie, all females of childbearing potential must be counselled concerning the following risks 
and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide study therapy): 
•She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child
•She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 28 days 
before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, dose 
interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment
•She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures
•She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need 
to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy
•She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is 
dispensed following a negative pregnancy test
•She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol (Section 2.2)
•She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of pomalidomide
The investigator must ensure that females of childbearing potential:
•Comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including confirmation 
that she has an adequate level of understanding
•Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
89For a female NOT of childbearing potential, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counselled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide study therapy): 
•She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of pomalidomide
The effect of pomalidomide on spermatogenesis is not known and has not been studied. Therefore, 
male patients taking pomalidomide must meet the following conditions (ie, all males must be 
counselled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of pomalidomide 
study therapy):
•Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
female or a female of childbearing potential
•Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged 
in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential.  
Contraception
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting 
study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 
days after study treatment discontinuation. 
The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:  
•Highly effective methods:
oIntrauterine device (IUD)
oHormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)
oTubal ligation
oPartner’s vasectomy
•Additional effective methods:
oMale condom
oDiaphragm
oCervical Cap
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients taking pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is currently 
using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to another one of the effective 
methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced 
during co-treatment with dexamethasone.
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
90Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be 
considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Pregnancy testing
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.
Before starting study drug
Female Patients:
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to starting 
study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days prior to the start of 
study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of 
study drug.  The patient may not receive study drug until the study doctor has verified that the 
results of these pregnancy tests are negative.
Male Patients:
Must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant 
female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose 
interruptions and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, even if he has 
undergone a successful vasectomy.  
During study participation and for 28 days following study drug discontinuation 
Female Patients:
•FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly 
for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at 
study discontinuation, and at day 28 following study drug discontinuation. If menstrual 
cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and 
then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 
following study drug discontinuation.  
•At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use 
two reliable methods of birth control.  
•Counselling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must 
be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. 
•If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, study drug must 
be immediately discontinued.
•Pregnancy testing and counselling must be performed if a patient misses her period or 
if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study drug treatment must 
be discontinued during this evaluation.
•Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at 
least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

Version Date: 4/29/2025
91Male Patients:
•Counselling about the requirement for complete abstinence or condom use during 
sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential and the 
potential risks of fetal exposure to pomalidomide must be conducted at a minimum of 
every 28 days.  
•If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.
Additional precautions
•Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and 
to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the end of treatment.
•Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following 
discontinuation of study drug.
•Male patients should not donate semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of study drug.
•Only enough study drug for one cycle of therapy may be dispensed with each cycle of 
therapy.

Instructions:  
Gingival Index
Upon palpation of the gingiva and running a blunt instrument (periodontal probe) along the 
soft tissue wall of the entrance of the gingival crevice the gingiva is examined and categorized 
the following way:
GI=0:  is the score given to the gingiva the color of which is pale pink to pink.  The surface 
after drying is matt.  The degree of stippling may vary.  The gingival margin may be located 
on the enamel or at various levels apical to the cemento-enamel junction.  Although the margin 
should be thin, the buccal and lingual gingiva may present a rounded termination against the 
tooth, thereby forming the entrance or orifice of the gingival crevice.  The form of the 
interdental gingiva depends on the space and size of the interdental areas.  The tip of the papilla 
should be the most incisally or occlusally located part of the gingiva.  On palpation, the gingival 
should be firm.
GI=1:  is the score given when the gingiva is subject to mild inflammation.  The gingival 
margin is slightly more reddish or bluish-reddish than normal and there is slight edema of the 
margin.  A colorless gingival exudate may be observed or collected at the entrance of the 
crevice.  Bleeding is not provoked.
GI=2:  This is the score for a moderately inflamed gingiva.  The gingiva is red or reddish-blue 
and glazy.  There is enlargement of the margin due to edema.  Bleeding is provoked.
GI=3:  is the score for severe inflammation.  The gingiva is markedly red or reddish-blue and 
enlarged.  There is a tendency to spontaneous bleeding. Ulceration may be seen.
Plaque Index
    PI=0:  This score is given when the gingival area of the tooth surface is literally free of 
plaque.  The surface is tested by running a pointed probe across the tooth surface at the entrance 
of the gingival crevice after the tooth has been properly dried, and if no soft matter adheres to 
the point of the probe, the area is considered clean.

Version Date: 4/29/2025
105PI=1:  This score is given when no plaque can be observed in situ by the unarmed eye, but 
when the plaque is made visible on the point of the probe after this has been moved across the 
tooth surface at the entrance of the gingival crevice. 
PI=2:  This score is given when the gingival area is covered with a thin to moderately thick 
layer of plaque.  The deposit is visible to the naked eye.
PI=3:  Heavy accumulation of soft matter, the thickness of which fills out the niche produced 
by the gingival margin and the tooth surface.  The interdental area is stuffed with soft debris.
Scoring For both indices, scores are given for distal, buccal, mesial and lingual surfaces.  The scores are 
added together and divided by the number of surfaces scored (4), and then divided by the number of teeth 
scored (6).  This is your Gingival Index or Plaque Index score.

11716.17.4 Component 3: Function  
Description
There are standard ranges for all tests. Every joint has an established range of motion (ROM). 
For example, the normal ROM for shoulder flexion is 180 degrees, each quartile is 45 degrees. If 
the shoulder can be put through 125 degrees it is 75% of normal. Similar is for grip strength (in 
Kg or pounds of pressure) and for walk time. The velocity is established based on norms for age 
and sex. For example if 18 feet/second, if divided by 4 and gets quartiles.

136Revised guidelines for using the Frenchay Activities Index
The aim is to record activities which require some initiative from the patient. It is important to 
concentrate upon the patient’s actual frequency of activity over the recent past, not distant past 
performance nor potential performance. One activity can only score on one item.
Specific item information:
1. Needs to play a substantial part in the organization, preparation and cooking of main 
meal. Not just making snacks or reheating prepared food.
2. Must do all or share equally, e.g. washing or wiping and putting away. Not just rinsing an 
occasional item.
3. Organization of washing and drying clothes, whether in washing machine, or by hand or 
at laundromat. Sharing task equally, e.g. loading, unloading, hanging, folding.
4. Dusting, polishing, ironing, tidying small objects or bedclothes. Anything heavier is 
included in item 5.
5. All heavier housework including changing beds, cleaning floors, fires and windows, 
vacuuming, moving chairs, etc. 
6. Playing a substantial role in organizing and buying groceries, whether small or large 
amounts. Must go to the shop and not just push a cart. Can include collection of pension 
or going to the Post Office. 
7. Going out to clubs, church activities, cinema, theatre, drinking, to dinner with friends, 
etc. May be transported there, provided patient takes an active part once arrived. Includes 
social activities at home, initiated by the patient, e.g. visits from family or friends not 
where main purpose is to provide care.
8. Sustained walking for at least 15 minutes (allowed short stops for breath). About one 
mile. Can include walking to do shopping, provided walks far enough.
9. Must require some ‘active’ participation and thought, e.g. propagating or caring for 
houseplants, knitting, painting, games, sports (not just watching sport on television). Can 
be mental activities, e.g. reading specialist magazines, doing the stocks and shares or 
window shopping for pleasure. 
10. Must drive a car (not just be a passenger), or get to a bus/coach and travel on it 
independently.
11. Coach or rail trips or car rides to some place for pleasure. Not for a routine ‘social outing’ 
(i.e. shopping, going to local friends). Must involve some organization and decision-
making by the patient. Excludes trips organized passively by institutions unless patient 
exercises choice on whether to go. The common factor is travel for pleasure. Holidays 
within the six months are divided into days per month e.g. a 7-day holiday equals 1 or 2 
days per month.
12. Gardening outside:
a. Light = occasional weeding or sweeping paths
b. Moderate = regular weeding, raking, pruning, etc.
c. Heavy = all necessary work including heavy digging.
13. Household maintenance:
a. Light = repairing small items, replacing lamp lightbulb or plug
b. Moderate = spring cleaning, hanging a picture, routine car maintenance
c. Heavy = painting/decorating, most necessary household/car maintenance.
Abbreviated Title: Pomalidomide for cGvHD
Version Date: 4/29/2025
13714. Must be full-length books, not periodicals, magazines or newspapers. Can be talking books.
15. Work for which the patient is paid, not voluntary work. The time worked should be averaged 
out over six months. For example, one month working for 18 hours/week over the six-month 
period would be scored as ‘up to 10 hours/week’.

Objectives  The objectives of the study are to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of several dose  levels of COVID -HIGIV in healthy adults.  
Primary Objectives:  
• To evaluate safety of three dose levels of COVID -HIGIV 
administered IV as a single dose to healthy adults.  
• To evaluate PK of three dose levels of COVID -HIGIV 
administered IV as a single dose to healthy adults.  
Endpoints  Primary Endpoints  
The following primary safety endpoints  will b e evaluated:  
• Adverse events ( AEs) within 72 hours post -dosing.  
• AEs leading to discontinuation or temporary suspension of infusion . 
• AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) in healthy adults up to 84 days 
post-administration of a single dose.  
The following pr imary COVID -HIGIV PK endpoints (based on PK sample 
test results by a n immuno binding IgG assay and a pseudovirus 
neutralization assay) will be evaluated in healthy adults : 
• AUC 0-last: area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to the 
last quantifiable concentration  after dosing . 
• AUC 0-inf: AUC 0-last plus the additional area extrapolated to infinity after 
dosing  
• AUC 0-14d after dosing . 
• AUC 0-28d after dosing . 
• Cmax: maximum observed concentration  after dosing .   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 Dosage  Three  dose levels of COVID -HIGIV are planned for the study:  
• Dosage 1: 100 mg/kg ( ≈1 mL/kg), with a maximum of 100 mL for 
≥100 kg body weight   
• Dosage 2:  200 mg/kg  (≈2 mL/kg), with a maximum of 200 mL for 
≥100 kg body weight   
• Dosage 3: 400 mg/kg ( ≈4 mL/kg), with a maximum of 400 mL for 
≥100 kg body weight   
Protocol Design  This study will be a Phase 1, single -center, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled design to evaluate three dose levels of COVID -HIGIV 
for safety  and PK in healthy adults. Healthy adult subjects will be enrolled 
into the study  to receive a  single do se.

*** 400 mg/ kg (≈4 mL/kg), with a maximum of 400 mL COVID -HIGIV for ≥100 kg body weight.  
 
Twenty -eight subjects will be enrolled and randomized 2:2:2:1 into four 
study arms to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of one of three 
COVID -HIGIV dose levels (1 -3) or saline placebo (4), respectively  (see 
the table above ). 
The enrollment/dosing of the first seven  subjects (randomized 2:2:2:1) in 
the study ) will be staggered wherein n o more than t hree subjects will be 
dosed on the same day ( to be dosed at least one hour apart). Principal 
Investigator  (PI) and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  (MM)  will review 
blinded data (up to 24 hours after end of IV infusion) before proceeding 
with dos ing subsequent set of remaining subject s for the stagger . Available 
safety (blinded) data will be reviewed by Study Monitoring Committee  
(SMC)  (consisting of at least three  independent external mem bers) after 
seven subjects  have completed at least 72 hours of safety follow -up. If 
unblinding of the safety data is required, closed session by the SMC will 
be held. An overall decision by the SMC will be made whether or not to 
proceed with full randomization  (2:2:2:1)  and dosing of the remaining 
study subje cts (n=21) . 
Following dosing, each subject will stay overnight in the inpatient unit for 
close observation ; each dosed subject will be discharged from the inpatient   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 unit once all assessments at 24 hours post -dosing timepoint (i.e., Day 2) 
are completed .  
The SMC will perform overall ongoing review of safety data during the 
study . Study enrollment and administration of study treatments  may be 
temporarily paused by the SMC  for safety review if any of the following 
occur after study  product administration  and during the study’s follow -up 
period : 
• One or more serious adverse event(s) [SAE(s)].  
• Three  or more of the same adverse events ( AEs) classified  as 
grade 3  severity . 
• Five or more of the same AEs classified as grade 2  severity . 
Note: refer to Section 8.2 for AE severity grading . 
Placebo recipients may be unblinded  upon request  after all subjects have 
completed Day 29 to allow them to follow current  COVID -19 vaccin ation 
guidelines.   
Subjects will be followed up for safety and PK up to 84 days post -
administration of a single dose .  
If any s ubjects become positive for SARS -CoV -2 during the study follow -
up period , they will be assessed using modified WHO ordinal score  (see 
Appendix I  – Modified WHO Ordinal Scale ) until they compete their last 
follow -up visit  (via telemedicine ).

 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.1 Background Information  
1.1.1 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) and 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) 
The COVID -19 pandemic  cause d by SARS -CoV -2 has resulted in significant worldwide 
increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan failure ( 1). In December 2019, a  
cluster of  patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China was reported and by 
January 2020 the causative agent of the illness was identified; initially termed novel coronavirus 
2019 (2019 -nCoV) and later renamed to SARS -CoV -2 (2). Due to t he spread of SARS -CoV -2 
resulting in sudden increase in COVID -19 cases throughout the world , a pandemic  was declared 
by World Health Organization (WHO)  in March 2020 . By early Septem ber 2020, > 26 million 
COVID -19 cases and > 864,000 COVID -19 attributed deaths have been reported  to the WHO . 
SARS -CoV -2 transmission typically occurs via respiratory droplets from close face-to-face 
contact (within six feet/two meters) and, to a lesser degr ee, via contaminated surfaces  (3). 
Aerosol spread (airborne transmission) may occur  (4), but the role of airborne transmission  in 
humans remains unclear ( 5). It is estimated that u p to 62% of SARS -CoV -2 transmission may 
occur via pre -symptomatic carriers ( 3).  
SARS -CoV -2 utilizes its envelope homotrimeric Spike (S) glycoprotein to interact with a cellular 
receptor on human cells termed  angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Binding with ACE2 
triggers a cell membrane fusion cascade leading to viral cellular e ntry (6), (7). Cell types within 
tissues of nasopharynx, lung, heart, esoph agus, kidney, bladder and ileum (i.e., type II alveolar 
cells, myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, 
and bladder urothelial cells) express ACE2, which suggests tissue targets for SARS -CoV -2 
infection  (8), (9).  
SARS -CoV -2 viremia starts in the upper respiratory tract, and typically peaks around time of 
symptom onset  (4-5 days post -infection) ; however, viral shedding starts 2 -3 days prior to 
symptom onset ( 10). Pharyngeal viral shedding is high within the first week post-infection at a 
time when  symptoms are typically  mild ( 11). Although SARS -CoV -2 RNA can be detected in 
throat swabs for up to six weeks after the onset of symptom s, viral cultures are generally SARS -
CoV -2 negative 8 days after symptom onset  (10), (11), (12).  
Humoral immune response is induced during SARS -CoV -2 infection ; IgM and IgA antibodies 
are typically detectable  5 days (range: 3 -6 days) post symptom onset  (PSO) , while IgG 
antibodies are  detectable 14 days (range: 5-18 days) PSO (13), (14). The IgM response start s to 
decline  25-30 days PSO, while IgA and IgG responses remain stable 40 days ( 15) and 3 months 
PSO ( 16), respectively. Neutralizing SARS -CoV -2 antibod ies are detectable 10 -15 days pos t 
symptom onset  (13) and can persist up to 3 months ( 16). T-cell responses a gainst SARS -CoV -2 
Spike protein have been characterised and correlate d well with IgG and IgA antibody titres in 
COVID -19 patients  (17).   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 As previously mentioned, t he incubation period for SARS -CoV -2 is approximately  4-5 days 
(range: 2 -7 days ) (18), (19), and most individuals who develop symptoms (~98%) will do so 
within 11.5 days post-infection ( 18). COVID -19 has various clinical manifestations , includ ing 
the most commonly reported symptoms of fever, dry cough and dyspnea ( shortness of breath ); 
other reported symptoms include fatigue, myalgia, nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, headache, 
weakness, rhinorrhea, anosmia, ageusia , hypoxia, pneumonia  (20), (21), (22). However, current 
clinical experience with COVID -19 patients indicates  hematologic, cardiovascu lar, renal, 
gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, endocrinologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and dermatologic  
symptoms , which may reflect extrapulmonary dissemination and replication of SARS -CoV -2 
(23). 
Most COVID -19 patients present with mild disease ( 81%); however, 14% of patients develop 
severe COVID -19 [characterized by hospitalization  (median time from symptom onset to 
hospitalization is 7 days ; range: 3 -9 days ), (24), worsening of dyspnea and hypoxia, severe 
pneumonia with >50% lung involvement on imaging ], while 5% of patients progress to critical 
COVID -19 [manifested as respiratory failure /acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) , septic 
shock and/or multiorgan system dysfunction, which can result in death ] (19), (22), (25), (26).  
Mild COVID -19 resolves 5 –7 days (and up to 14 days) after symptom onset without requirement 
for special medical interventions. Some infected individuals are asymptomatic after SARS -CoV -
2 infection but are capable of transmitting the virus (27), (28). Approximately 25% of infected 
patients have underlying health co nditions ; however, 60-90% of  hospitalized COVID -19 patien ts 
have significant comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy and chronic liver disease ( 24), 
(29), (30). Abnormal laboratory values observed in hospitalized patients include lymphopenia 
(83%), elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., C -reactive protein, ferritin, tumor necrosis factor -α 
(TNF -α), interleukins (IL -1, IL -6)] indicative of cyt okine storm , and abnormal coagulation 
parameters (e.g., prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, elevated D -dimer (46% of 
patients), low fibrinogen) ( 31), (32), (33). Complications due to COVID -19 other than 
lung/pulmonary abnormal ities include impaired function of the heart, brain, liver, kidney and 
coagulation system ( 23).  
Mortality in hospitalized COVID -19 patients ranges from 15% to 20%; however, up to 40% 
mortality has been observed among patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission ( 29). 
In addition, hospital mortality ranges from <5% amon g patients <40 years to 35% for patients 
aged 70 -79 years and >60% for patients aged 80 -89 years  (24). 
Supportive care, including supplemental oxygen  and mechanical ventilation , is the main 
treatment for severe/critical COVID -19 patients. However, r ecent clinical studies  indicate that 
dexamethasone decreases mortality (subgroup analysis suggests benefit is limited to patients who 
require supplemental o xygen and who have symptoms for >7 days) and remdesivir improves 
time to recovery (subgroup analysis suggests benefit is limited to patients not receiving 
mechanical ventilation) ; both are currently recommended for treatment of COVID -19 patients 
(34), (35). Other classes of drugs are being assessed in clinical studies  for treatmen t of COVID -
19 (to either resolve ongoing viremia and/or to manage various COVID -19 manifestations),  
including antivirals (e.g., umifenovir ), antibody -based therapies (e.g., COVID -19 convalescent   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 plasma), anti -inflammatory agents (e.g., statins), immunomodu latory therapies (e.g., tocilizumab, 
sarilumab, anakinra, ruxolitinib), anticoagulants [e.g., heparin ; albeit, thromboprophylaxis with 
heparin is currently  recommended for hospitalized COVID -19 patients  (35)] and anti -fibrotics 
(e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) . Despite the enormous current efforts into clinical investigations 
of either repurposed  drug therapies or development of new products, there are no approved 
therapeutic interventions to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection or to treat COVID -19. Therefore, 
there still exists an unmet medical need for interventions that would resolve SARS -CoV -2 
infection and improve clinical outcomes in COVID -19 patients . 
1.2 Study Drug  
1.2.1 Anti -SARS -CoV -2 Immunoglobulin Intravenous (Human) – COVID -HIGIV  
COVID -HIGIV is a hyperimmune product that consists of purified immunoglobulin (IgG) 
fraction of human plasma containing antibodies  (including neutralizing antibodies)  to SARS -
CoV -2. COVID -HIGIV is prepared from pooled plasma collected at US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) -licensed and/or registered plasma and/or blood collection centers from 
healthy, adult donors who have elevated levels of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies .  
The final product is a li quid that contains 85 –115 mg/mL protein (target 100 mg/mL) of which at 
least 90% is purified human IgG, stabilized with 250 mM proline and 0.03% polysorbate 80 
(PS80 ), at target pH 5.8. During the viral inactivation step of the manufacturing process, t ri-n-
butyl phosphate  (TnBP) and Triton -X-100 (TX -100) are used and may be presented in trace 
amounts in the final product [ ≤1 parts per million ( ppm) for TnBP and ≤ 5 ppm  for TX -100].  
The potency of the final product is determined by a validated immunoassay tha t measures 
concentration of binding SARS -CoV -2 antibodies (  
) in relation to a standard; the final drug product is also characterized by a wild -type 
SARS -CoV -2 neutralization assay  (refer to the most current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure) . 
COVID -HIGIV is provided as a sterile liquid for IV administration  only. The product is a clear 
to slightly opalescent and colorless or pale -yellow liquid essentially free of foreign particles . 
The active ingredient of COVID -HIGIV is human immunoglobulin (IgG), which is a normal 
constituent of the human body and therefore it is not expected to be toxic to humans. At the 
proposed  COVID -HIGIV doses (≤100-400 mg/ kg) for this study , exposure  levels of excipients  
(proline, PS80) and residuals (TnBP, TX -100) are well below maximum tolerated  doses  in 
animals ; hence, these substances are not expected to pose any clinically significant health risks to 
study subjects  (refer to the most current version of the Investigat or’s Brochure f or more details ).  
Emergent BioSolutions is developing COVID -HIGIV for post -exposure prophylaxis following 
SARS -CoV -2 exposure and for treatment of COVID -19.   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 1.2.2 COVID -HIGIV as a Therapeutic Intervention for SARS -CoV -2/COVID -19 
COVID -HIGIV (code  name: NP -028) is intended as a passive immunization therapy (i.e., 
passive transfer of antibodies) that would  provide suitable levels of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies for 
binding and neutralization of  SARS -CoV -2 preventing  viral cellular entry  and potentially 
augmenting the immune response .  
Although no animal studies have been done to date with COVID -HIGIV, passive transfer of anti -
SARS -CoV -2 antibodies with neutralizing activity [e.g., monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated 
from recovered COVID -19 patients] has b een shown to be effective at modulating SARS -CoV -2 
infection and reducing viral load (including in the lung  tissue ) and disease burden in animals 
after exposure to SARS -CoV -2 (36), (37), (38). In addition, clinical data on passive transfer of 
SARS -CoV -2 antibodies via transfusion of  convalescent plasma collected from individuals who 
recovered from COVID -19 (i.e., CCP; which contains binding and neutralizing IgA, IgM and 
IgG antibodies against SARS -CoV -2) to COVID -19 patients  suggest that there are no elevated 
safety risks due to CCP transfusion and that there may be a potential clinical benefit in patients 
with severe COVID -19 (39), (40), (41), (42), (43). 
The overall safety profile of COVID -HIGIV is anticipated to be comparable to other 
commercially available human hyperimmune IGIV products, including those hyperimmune IGIV  
products manufactu red by Emergent  (VARIZIG®, HepaGam B®, ANTHRASIL®, WinRho® 
SDF, CNJ -016® -VIGIV)  (44), (45), (46), (47), (48). The most common types of adverse 
reactions to hyperimmune IGIV products are non -anaphylactic infusion reactions, such as back 
or abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting within the first 30 minutes of infusion. Us ually there is 
no dyspnea or other clinically significant changes in vital signs. Fever, headache, chills, rash, 
fatigue may begin at the end of the IV infusion and continue for several hours. More severe 
reactions of this type may require treatment with c orticosteroids or acetaminophen and persist for 
several hours after the infusion. These may be treated symptomatically. The incidence of adverse 
reactions associated with IV administration of immunoglobulin products is reported by the 
manufacturers to be t ypically in the range of 1 to 15% ( 44), (45), (46), (47), (48), (49), (50), (51), 
(52). Infrequent events associated w ith IV immunoglobulin treatment have also been reported 
(mostly in individuals with risk factors for developing these events), such as hypersensitivity 
reactions, renal failure, aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), hemolysis, transfusion -related acute 
lung i njury (TRALI) and thrombotic events ( 53). Potential risk of antibody -dependent 
enhancement (ADE) in COVID -19 patients following treatment with antibody -based therapies 
has not been clinically observed (e.g., in COVID -19 patients after transfusion of convalescent 
COVID -19 plasma); however, COVID -HIGIV recipients will be closely monitored for disease 
worsening  throughout the study period.  
Overall, there is currently proof -of-concept efficacy animal data with SARS -CoV -2 passive 
antibody transfer (with SARS -CoV -2 mAbs isolated from recovered COVID -19 patients) and 
some clinical experience with CCP in COVID -19 patients to suggest that a n antibody  therapeutic 
such as COVID -HIGIV would  elevate SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody levels sufficiently to 
impact SARS -CoV -2 viral load and to potentially improve cl inical outcomes.     Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 1.3 Clinical Study  Rationale  
This study is designed to evaluate safety and PK of three COVID -HIGIV dose levels 
administered IV as a single dose to healthy adults . 
Like other human IGIV products , the hyperimmune products manufactured by Emerge nt (see 
Section 1.2.2 ) have been studied in several healthy adult volunteer s and clinical studies  with 
patients ; the safety profile of these hyperimmune products is consistent with other commercial 
IGIV/hyperimmune  products and the PK profile is typically similar to PK of  licensed 
IGIV/hyperimmune  products , with a half -life of approximately 24 to 30 days after IV 
administration. The proposed dose s for this  clinical study  (≤100-400 mg/kg ) are within the dose 
levels tested in clinical studies  of other licensed IGIV/hyperimmune  products and are expected to 
display similar safety and PK profile to those products.   
Results from this clinical study  will provide s afety information on the intravenously administered 
COVID -HIGIV , as well as PK parameters such as peak COVID -HIGIV  plasma levels , trough 
titers of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies and COV ID-HIGIV half -life in healthy adults ; the safety data 
and PK parameters from thi s study (along with data available from other ongoing or planned 
clinical studies with COVID -HIGIV ) will be used for dose optimization/dose selection for the 
proposed  COVID -HIGIV  indications (treatment of COVID -19; post -exposure prophylaxis of 
COVID -19).    Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study  Design  
This study will be a Phase 1, single -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled design 
to assess safety and PK of COVID -HIGIV in healthy adults.  
Healthy adult subjects are planned to  be enrolled and randomized to receive a single dose ; see 
Table 2 below .  
Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:2:2:1 to four study treatment arms to receive a single IV 
infusion of one of three COVID -HIGIV dose levels (1 -3) or sal ine placebo (4), respectively.  
Table 2 Overview of Study Design  
Study Arm  No. of Subjects  Dosing Schedule  – Day 1 Visit  
1 8 COVID -HIGIV dosage 1*  
2 8 COVID -HIGIV dosage 2**  
3 8 COVID -HIGIV dosage 3***  
4 4 Placebo (saline)  
* 100 mg/kg (≈1 mL/kg), with a maximum of 100 mL COVID -HIGIV for ≥100 kg body weight.  
** 200 mg/ kg (≈2 mL/kg),  with a maximum of 200 mL COVID -HIGIV for ≥100 kg body weight.  
*** 400 mg/ kg (≈4 mL/kg), with a maximum of 400 mL COVID -HIGIV for ≥100 kg body weight.  
 
Following randomization and dosing on Day 1, subjects will be kept in the inpatient unit and will 
be discharged the following day (Day 2 visit). Subjects will be followed for safety and PK up to 
84 days (up to Day 85 visit)  post-dosing . 
Overall study dur ation for subjects will be  up to  91 days ( seven days of screening period and 84 
days of follow -up post -randomization).  
The enrollment/dosing of the first seven  subjects  (2:2:2:1 randomization) in the study will be 
staggered, wherein no more than three subjects will be dosed on the same day (dosing at least 1 
hour apart). Principal Investigator (PI) and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (MM) will review 
blinded data (up to 24 hours after end of IV in fusion) before proceeding with dosing subsequent 
set of staggered subject s. Available safety (blinded) data will be reviewed by Study Monitoring 
Committee (SMC) (consisting of at least three  independent external medical monitors) after 
seven subjects have completed at least 72 hours of safety follow -up. If unblinding of the safety 
data is required, closed session by the SMC will be held. An overall decision by the SMC will be 
made to proceed with full randomization (2:2:2:1) and dosing of the remaining stud y subjects  
(n=21) . The SMC will perform overall ongoing review of safety data during the study . Study 
enrollment and administration of study treatments may be temporarily paused by the SMC for 
safety review , if required (see Section 8.11 for study  safety -pausing rules ).  
Subjects who become positive for SARS -CoV -2 at any time post -dosing follow -up period will be 
withdrawn from the study (no further specimen collections ), but will be followed up for safety 
only via telemedicine  until their originally scheduled last follow -up visit . Subjects who report   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 32 of 76 
   
 clinical signs/symptoms of COVID -19 during telephone contact follow -ups will be classified in 
severity by site staff as g rade 1 -4 (see Appendix II  – Grading  of COVID -19 Symptoms ), while 
overall clinical status of the subjects with COVID -19 will be assessed by the site staff using 
modified WHO ordinal scale as outlined  (see Appendix I  – Modified WHO Ordinal Scale ).  
3.2 Study  Center (s) 
This study will be conducted at a single  center in the US.  
3.3 Sample Size   
There was no formal sample size calculation for this Phase 1 study. However, based on previous 
experience with hyperimmune globulin products  manufactured by Emergent  (see Section 1.2.2 ) 
in Phase 1 clinical studies with healthy adults, Emergent deems that the number of subjects 
planned to receive COVID -HIGIV is sufficient to descriptively assess safety and PK of three 
COVID -HIGIV dose levels administered by IV to healthy adults . 
In total, 28 subjects are planned for the study (8 subjects/dose level , and  4 placebo subjects) . 
3.4 Randomization  
Randomization/d osing of the first seven subjects in the study will be staggered; seven subjects 
will be randomized 2:2:2:1 (two subjects at COVID -HIGIV dosage level 1, two subjects at 
COVID -HIGIV dosage level 2 , two subjects at COVID -HIGIV dosage 3  and one placebo 
subject) . After the SMC review of the safety data from the first seven subjects, and if the 
enrollment is recommended to proceed, the remaining subjects (n=21) will be randomized 
2:2:2:1.  
Randomization list will be generated by a Randomization and Trial Supply Mana gement  
(RTSM ) system  vendor . The designated individual at the site receiving the randomization codes 
will be unblinded (pharmacist). Details on the randomization procedures will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual . 
3.5 Blinding  
The pharmacy staff assigned to this Phase 1 clinical study will be unblinded to access the 
randomization assignment and prepare the study treatment s. All doses of study treatments will be 
prepared in the same total volume in the IV infusion bags ; in addition, bag covers will be used to 
mask the bags t o maintain the blind.  
There will be designated (subcontracted) unblinded clinical study monitors and an independent 
unblinded Quality Assurance (QA) representative  (if needed) . In addition, designated personnel 
at the bioanalytical laboratory who will be assigned to perform PK sample testing may indirectly 
become unblinded due to nature of test results ; however , measures will be implemented not to 
disseminate bioanalytical laboratory results  until required . Other personnel involved in the 
conduct of the clinical study  will remain blinded until database lock  and final unblinding .   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 33 of 76 
   
 Access to information in electronic data capture (EDC) system will be blinded using role -based 
permis sions. Randomization group and study treatment dispensing data will be provided to 
Emergent  after database lock and unblinding . Dosing data will be reconciled with the 
randomized treatment group for each subject by the unblinded monitor, and any deviations  will 
be reported in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Upon request , subjects  who received placebo will be informed of their treatment assignment after 
all subjects have completed the  Day 29 to follow current COVID -19 vaccine recommendations. 
Placebo recip ients will be kept in the study for safety follow -up, but no PK samples will be 
drawn.   
While this is a double -blind study , an unscheduled un blind ing may occur  at any point after the 
infusion . Details on the  reasons for unblinding and  the associated unbli nding procedure s will be 
described in the Pharmacy Manual . In an event  of unblinding , Emergent  must be notified.

 5.1.4 Storage Conditions  
Once at the site, COVID -HIGIV  vials must be stored  at 2-8C (35 -46F) in a secured area until 
used for dose preparation by the assigned pharmacy staff . The temperature in the storage area 
should be monitored with properly calibrated instruments and recorded on a temperature log.  
Temperature excursions must be re ported to Emergent or designate as per instructions provided 
in the Pharmacy Manual . 
For further information, refer to the  COVID -HIGIV  Investigator’s Brochure and the Pharmacy 
Manual . 
5.1.5 Preparation  
The site must maintain documentation of a clear written formalized procedure for study  drug 
preparation activities (including any sample labels and documentation to be completed), and 
documented training and delegation of the activity to appropriate study  staff.  
Subject  identifier (subject ID number) must be recorded on the labels of the vial(s) used to 
prepare the dose . The unblinded pharmacy staff assigned to this study will prepare COVID -
HIGIV as follows:  
Visually inspect the vials to ensure the product is free from particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to dose preparation and administration. The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent 
and colorless or pale yellow.  Do not use solutions that ar e cloudy or have particulates.  DO 
NOT SHAKE VIALS; AVOID FOAMING.  
Prepare COVID -HIGIV at the required dosage into an IV infusion bag  (note: all doses are to be 
prepared  to maximum volume of 400 mL ; refer to Pharmacy Manual for details around dose 
preparat ion). In general, perform the following:  
• Remove the protective caps from the product vials.  
• Wipe the exposed central portion of the rubber stopper with an isopropyl alcohol swab.  
• Withdraw the vial content (note: extractable volume is up to 25.0 mL per via l) into a 
sterile syringe (that can accommodate up to 25.0 mL) using standard aseptic techniques 
and transfer the content into an appropriately sized and labeled IV infusion bag.  
• If multiple transfers of content from COVID -HIGIV vials are needed to prepar e the total 
dose in the IV infusion bag, use aseptic techniques to prevent contamination.  
Once punctured, use the vial contents to prepare the infusion bag promptly. COVID -HIGIV 
contains no preservative. Vials are for single use only. Do not reuse or save  vial(s) for future 
use.  
Retain used and empty vials for drug accountability as per instructions in the Pharmacy Manual . 
The IV infusion bag for COVID -HIGIV (and placebo ) requires that the dispensing label is 
affixed to the bag. The label on the IV infusi on bag will capture at a minimum: subject ID, 
expiry date of the prepared dose  (i.e., <24 hours after dose preparation ), the investigator ’s name, 
protocol code ( EBS-CVH -003) and caution statement “For investigational use only”. The IV   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 infusion bag will require a cover to maintain the blind . Protective coverings for the IV infusion 
bags will be provided by Emergent as part of the study material s.   
Record date of the infusion , start /stop times  and the total volume infused . For further details, 
refer to the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.1.6 Administration  
Ensure the recipient is adequately hydrated prior to initiation of IV infusion.  
Administer COVID -HIGIV by IV infusion through a dedicated IV line using a constant infusion 
pump (e.g., IVAC® pump or equivalent).  
Administer CO VID-HIGIV within 24 hours of preparation into an IV infusion bag.  
Set the starting infusion rate at 1.0 mL/min  for the first 30 minutes. If the infusion is well 
tolerated, double the infusion rate to 2.0 mL/min for the next 30  minutes, and if tolerated, d ouble 
the rate to 4.0 m L/min  (maximum rate)  which should be used for the remainder of the infusion.  
For example, a t the recommended infusion rates above (with no interruptions or reduction in the 
infusion rates), dose volume of 400 mL should be infused wi thin 2.5 hours.  
Monitor subjects closely during infusion and within 24 hours after completion of COVID -HIGIV 
infusion.  
If AEs occur during the IV infusion, such as grade 1 ( mild) event s of flushing, headache, chills,  
fatigue,  nausea, slight changes in puls e rate or blood pressure, slow the rate of infusion or 
temporarily stop the infusion until symptoms subside (at discretion of the investigator). Once the 
AEs resolve, resume the infusion at a rate that is comfortable to the subject (e.g., start the 
infusio n at half of the last tolerated infusion rate and increase gradually).  If the recipient 
experiences grade 2 ( moderate ) or higher  AEs such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, vomiting, 
arthralgia, or severe headache, unresponsive to slowing the infusion rate or stopping of the 
infusion, do not resume the infusion .  
Stop the infusion if serious AEs develop (e.g., anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reactions) 
and administer appropriate medical management.  Do no t restart the infusion.  
5.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate inventory records of COVID -HIGIV .  
The pharmacist  or pharmacy staff designate will inventory all COVID -HIGIV  shipments upon 
receipt, acknowledge possession by signing all required documentation , and r eturn ing these to 
the sponsor.  The investigator must ensure that all drug supplies are kept in a secure location in 
the site pharmacy in accordance with recommended storage conditions . A site  pharmacist 
(unblinded) or a designated individual (unblinded) not involved in study treatment  
administration /study assessments  will maintain a current inventory and ongoing record of test 
material supplies using the Drug Accountability Form provided by the sponsor.   This inventory 
record for the COVID -HIGIV  will include:

 7 ASSESSMENT OF PK  
7.1 PK Parameters  
PK parameters of three dose levels of COVID -HIGIV administered IV as a single dose will be 
determined in healthy adults (see Section 9.3.1 ). The assessments described below will be used 
to derive serum concentrations of SARS -CoV -2 antibodies (by testing PK samples with  validated 
immunobinding IgG and pseudovirus neutralization assays) to calculate the PK parameters.   
7.1.1 Assessment of PK Parameters  
For s ubjects that receive a single IV infusion of one of three COVID -HIGIV dose levels, a nalysis 
of PK will include PK sample test results (from samples collected by assigned site staff) from 
pre-dose on Day 1 and post -dose timepoints at Day 1, including 1 hour (±15 mins), 2 hours (±15 
mins), 4 hours (±30 mins), 8 hours (±1 hour) and 12 hours (± 1 hour) after end of IV infusion . In 
addition, the following post -dose timepoints will be included  (brackets indicate time after end of 
IV infusion ): Day 2 (24 ±2 hours), Day 4 ( 3±0.5 days ), Day 8 ( 7±1 days), Day 15  (14±2 days),

 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The safety of COVID -HIGIV will be assessed by collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory 
test results (blood chemistry and hematology, urinalysis), concomitant medications, medical 
history updates, vital signs and physical exam results.  
The occurrence of AE s will be monitored throughout all phases of the study  and will cover all 
participating subjects. Any medical history changes that occur after baseline  (Day 1)  but before 
dosing will be updated as medical history.  Capture of AEs starts during IV infus ion of study 
treatment and until the end of study period (up to Day 85 visit). Unanticipated problems related 
to study procedure may be collected following enrollment.  
Adverse events are to be elicited by the investigator (or designate) by asking the subje ct non -
leading questions. The association of the AE to COVID -HIGIV is to be judged by the 
investigator as related or unrelated  (see Section 8.3 below) . 
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavo urable and uni ntended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
NOTE: A diagnosis should be prefere ntially captured as an adverse event term and signs and 
symptoms should be captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis. In the event that there 
are multiple diagnoses, then all diagnoses should be captured. The worsening of an existing 
sign, sympt om or disease is also considered to be an AE. An abnormal laboratory finding 
deemed by the Principal Investigator as not clinically significant will not be captured as an AE, 
but an abnormal laboratory finding that worsens after dosing with the study drug,  from not 
clinically significant to clinically significant, is considered an AE. Surgical procedures are not 
AE’s. They are the action taken to treat a medical condition. Interventions that were planned 
prior to study entry for medical conditions that star ted prior to study entry but did not worsen 
during the clinical study  are not reported as AEs.  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation  of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events which may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.    Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 of 76 
   
 NOTE: Death is an outcome and not an event. The conditi on leading to death is the event. Death 
will be considered an event only when no other information regarding the cause of death is 
available.  
Hospitalization that is planned before inclusion into the study  or outpatient treatment without 
overnight hospital ization is not considered a SAE. Hospitalization that occurs during a study  for 
social reasons (e.g., transportation difficulties, respite care) is not considered to be SAE.  
8.1.3 Adverse Drug Reaction  
Any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal  (investig ational)  product related to any 
dose.  
8.1.3.1  Expected Adverse Drug Reaction/Event  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. , Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package 
insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  
8.1.3.2  Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction/Events  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent  with the applicable product 
information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package 
insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).   
8.2 Assessment of Severity  
All AEs (clinical and laboratory  abnorma lities ) irrespective of relationship to study treatment , 
including those that are not of a serious nature and those that are expected, will be documented 
by the investigators (or designate) in the source documents and appropriately recorded on AE 
eCRF . All AEs will be examined by  the investigator  or sub -investigator (s) for assessment of AE 
severity using the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events  
(see Appendix II I – Grading of Adverse Events ). For AEs that are not included in the DAIDS AE 
Grading Table,  use the following generic scale is : 
Table 3 Generic AE Grading Scale  
Grade 1   
(mild)  Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social & functional activities 
with intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  
(moderate)  Moderate symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social & functional 
activities with intervention indicated  
Grade 3  
(severe)  Severe symptoms causing inability to perform usual social & functional activities with 
intervention or hospitalization indicated  
Grade 4  
(potentially life -
threatening)  Potentially life -threatening symptoms causing inability to perform basic sel f-care functions 
with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability  
Grade 5  (death)  Death    Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

8.3 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator is responsible for the assessment of the causality of an AE. Emergent’s Medical 
Monitor w ill also assess SAE causality, independent of the Investigator . 
The following guidelines are provided for assessment of causality:  
• Unrelated:  No relationship between the investigational product and the reported event.  
• Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
administration of investigational product and/or follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product but could also have been produced by other factors.  
• Probably related: A reasonable temporal seque nce of the event with administration of IP 
exists and, based on the known response to the investigational product, known or 
previously reported adverse reactions to the investigational product or similar products, 
or in the Investigator's (or designee) cli nical judgment the association of the event with 
the investigational product seems likely.  
• Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to investigational product administration, an d which cannot be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals (e.g., injection site pain, 
anaphylaxis, TRALI). The response to withdrawal of the investigational product 
(DECHALLENGE) should be clinically plausible. The event must be definit ive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory RECHALLENGE 
procedure if necessary.  
If the relationship between the AE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“definitely”, “possibl y” or “probabl y,” the event will be consider ed to be “related” to the 
investigational product . 
8.4 Description of Known Adverse Event Profile for COVID -HIGIV  
For general description of safety profile for COVID -HIGIV, see Section 1.2.2 . For more detail s, 
refer to the most current version of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
8.5 Eliciting Adverse Event s 
AEs reported spontaneously by the subject and/or in response to an open question f rom the 
Investigator (or designee) or revealed by observation (e.g., during physical exam or from a 
clinical laboratory test result) will be recorded by the Investigator (or designee) on the AE eCRF 
if they occurred during the study period, regardless of c ausal association with the investigational 
product.  
All AEs reported from the signing of the ICF until immediately before dosing  of investigational 
product on Day 1, will be recorded as signs and symptoms on the Medical History eCRF.   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 of 76 
   
 Reporting of AEs is re quired for any new observation presenting during and after investigational 
product dosing or for a deterioration of baseline condition (e.g., increased severity/frequency).  
Occurrence of AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will cover all partici pating 
subjects. Study subjects will be provided with a 24 -hour telephone number to contact study 
personnel in case of an untoward reaction.  
8.6 Requirements for Immediately Reportable Events  
8.6.1 Principal Investigator's Reporting Requirements  
The investigator wi ll report all SAEs  and confirmed pregnancies to Emergent within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of occurrence. The PV SAE and  pregnancy forms are available  
within the EDC system .  Pharmacovigilance  is notified of SAEs and pregnancies through a 
‘trigger’ email which is delivered to  
However, safety info rmation may also be provided directly from the site via email to 
  
The details of the SAE report should be completed within three days of the investigator’s 
knowledge of occurrence of the  SAE.  
For SAEs, the Serious Adverse Event Report Form will be completed (abbreviated hereafter 
SAE Report Form). The SAE Report Form is NOT the same as the AE eCRF. Subject identifiers 
(e.g., name, address, telephone number, social security number, medical  record number, or 
hospital/laboratory number) must be redacted from the source documentation  attached to the 
SAE Report Form .  
All SAEs that are unexpected must be reported to the IRB/IEC/REB by the Investigator (or 
designee) as required by ICH GCP E6.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE, pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous 
miscarriage, congenital anomaly, or birth defect are considered to be SAEs and must be reported. 
Elective abortions without complications will not be handled as AEs.  
If a subj ect becomes pregnant during a study, Emergent will be notified. All pregnancies where 
conception occurred after first exposure to the investigational product through the End of Study 
visit are to be followed to outcome (e.g., delivery, spontaneous/elective /therapeutic abortion), 
including after the study is completed and even if the subject is withdrawn from the study. If a 
pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome that the reporting health care professional considers 
might be due to the investigational prod uct, then the guidelines for expedited reporting of 
serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions should be followed.  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical study  
pregnancy forms (“Pregnancy Notification Form” a nd “Pregnancy Follow -up Form”). To ensure 
subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to Emergent within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature 
termination) and status of moth er and child. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 of 76 
   
 for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported 
as an SAE.  
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attentio n 
during or after the subject has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as possibly 
related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to Emergent.  
The Investigator is responsible to notify their IRB/IEC/REB according to their polic y for SAE or 
pregnancy reporting . 
8.6.2 Emergent’s Reporting Requirements  
Emergent will report suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions ( SUSARs ) to the FDA  
and to the principal investigator  in an individual case safety report as soon as possible, no later 
than 15 calendar days after Emergent becomes aware of the SUSAR . 
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction s will be reported to the FDA as 
soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after Emergent’s initial r eceipt of 
the information.  
8.7 Reporting of Other Information - Unanticipated Problems  
For investigational sites in the United States, as outlined by the Office for Human Research 
Protection (OHRP), unanticipated problems must be reported to the IRB/IEC/REB ac cording to 
the requirements of 45 CFR Part 46. Unanticipated problems are considered to include any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL  the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:  
o Procedures that are described in the study -related documents, such as the 
IRB/IEC/REB approved research protocol and informed consent document.  
o The characteristics of the subject population being entered into the study.  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the stud y which means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the sample 
collection.  
• Suggests that the study places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economi c, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
An incidence, experience, or outcome that meets the three criteria above generally will warrant 
consideration of substantive changes in the study or informed consent process/document or other 
corrective actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or others. Only a 
small subset of AEs occurring in human subjects participating in a clinical study will meet these 
three criteria for an unanticipated problem. There are other t ypes of incidents, experiences, and 
outcomes that occur during the conduct of clinical study that represent unanticipated problems 
but are not considered AEs. For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or 
economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with AEs. In other   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 54 of 76 
   
 cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm 
occurs.  
The Investigator should promptly notify the IRB when an unanticipated problem involving risks 
to subje cts or others is identified. Also, the Investigator should notify the Emergent of 
unanticipated problem(s) , as well as to the US Army Medical Research and Development 
Command (USAMRDC) Office of Research Protections (ORP) – Human Research Protection 
Office  (HRPO) . 
8.8 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or up to 30 days after the last study 
visit.  
8.8.1 Follow -up of Non serious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs that are identified on the last scheduled visit must be r ecorded on the AE eCRF 
with the current status noted. All nonserious AEs that are ongoing at this time will be recorded as 
“Not Recovered/Not Resolved” on the AE eCRF. The status of ongoing, previously reported 
AEs will be subject to active follow -up. Subj ects will be interviewed at the study visits to 
determine if any previously on -going AEs are resolved . 
8.8.2 Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
Confirmed SAEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
The Investigator will provide or arrange appropriate care for subjec ts for whom SAEs are 
experienced.  
All SAEs will be followed by the Investigator until at least one of the following conditions is 
met:  
• The SAE is resolved or stable if expected to remain chronic.  
• The subject is referred to a specialist or other physician  for treatment and follow -up. The 
Principal Investigator (or designee) will follow the subject’s condition even if the subject 
is seen by another physician, to obtain information about the diagnosis and outcome and 
any treatments and medications administer ed for the event.  
The following will be considered acceptable reasons for discontinuation of follow -up of ongoing 
SAEs:  
• Subje ct withdraws consent .  
• Subject is referred to appropriate long -term medical care . 
• Subject is considered lost to follow -up. 
It is ex pected that the investigational site will obtain supporting medical records from 
appropriate physicians and record this information on the SAE Report Form and AE eCRF. The 
site must repo rt SAE to Emergent (study MM and Global PV Department) within 24 hours  of   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 55 of 76 
   
 knowledge of the SAE  and the SAE Report Form must be completed and provided to Emergent’s 
study MM and to Global PV Department within 72 hours   
. Additional information received related to any SAE must be 
forwarded within 24 hours of awareness to the Emergent Global PV Department  
  
8.9 Study Monitoring Committee  
An independent Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will provide on -going review of safety 
data during the study . The SMC  (consisting of at least three independent external members ) will 
be responsible for assessing safety and monitoring overall conduct and integrity of the study. In 
fulfilling these responsibilities, the SMC may make recommendations concerning continuation 
and/or pausing/ stopping of the stu dy (see Section 8.11) as it relates to safety and risk to the study 
subject population as outlined in the SMC Charter . 
8.10 Breaking the Blind for Individual Subjects  
While this is a double -blind study, the blind may be broken if a subject’s health or safety is at 
risk and knowledge of the study arm may be beneficial to the medical management of the 
subject. In an event of unblinding, Emergent must be notified.  
If the I nvestigator determines that knowledge of a subject’s treatment assignment is urgently 
needed in order to guide treatment or ensure the subject’s safety, the Investigator may perform 
emergency unblinding via RTSM  system . The Investigator may not delegate this responsibility. 
The Investigator must attempt to notify Emergent’s Medical Monitor prior to unblinding and 
must notify Emergent’s study MM  within 24 hours after unblinding at the latest.  
If a subject’s study treatme nt assignment is unblinded for safety reasons, or if a subject becomes 
accidentally unblinded for any reason, the subject will be requested to remain in the study for 
safety follow -up. Documentation of breaking the blind must be entered in the study subjec ts’ 
source documents with the following information recorded: (1) date and time the blind was 
broken; (2) the rationale behind the unblinding decision/occurrence; (3) the names of the 
personnel involved; and (4) date of contact with Emergent’s  study MM . 
8.11 Study Safety -Pause Rule  
Study enrollment and administration of study treatments may be temporarily paused by the SMC 
for safety review, if any of the following occur after study treatment administration  and during 
the study’s follow -up period : 
• One or more SA E(s).  
• Three or more of the same AEs classified as grade 3  severity . 
• Five or more of the same AEs classified as grade 2  severity . 
These events will be reviewed by the SMC  and a recommendation will be made. The procedures 
will be outlined in the SMC Charter .   : 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses. The details are described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Subject disposition will be provided for all who sign and date the ICF.  
9.1 Sample Size  Calculation  
There was no formal sample size calculation for this Phase 1 study. However, based on previous 
experience with hyperimmune globulin products manufactured by Emergent (see Section 1.2.2 ) 
in Phase 1 clinical studies with healthy adults, Emergent deems the number of subjects planned 
to receive study treatments (one of three dose levels of COVID -HIGIV or saline placebo)  in the 
study [N=28; n=8 COVID -HIGIV dosage 1; n= 8 COVID -HIGIV dosage 2; n=8 COVID -HIGIV 
dosage 3, n=4 placebo ] is sufficient to descriptively assess COVID -HIGIV safety and PK of a 
single dos e in healthy adults . 
9.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets will be evaluated in the study:  
• Safety Set (SS) : all randomized subjects who receive  any amount of COVID -HIGIV or 
placebo, analyzed according to the actual study treatment  arm. 
• PK Set (PKS) : all subjects who are randomized and receive d COVID -HIGIV  according 
to the protocol and with evaluable PK data (i.e., no major protocol deviations affecting 
PK sampling and results , adequate number of PK sample test results ).  
9.3 Study Endpoints  
9.3.1 Primary Safety Endpoints  
The following primary safety endpoints  will be evaluated :  
• Frequency and severity of AEs within 72 hours post-dosing.  
• AEs leading to discontinuation or temporary suspension of infusion . 
•  AEs and SAEs in healthy adults up to 84 days post -administration of a single dose . 
The primary safety endpoints will be evaluated using the following safety assessments  over the 
84-day follow -up period after administration of a single COVID -HIGIV dose : 
• Adverse events . 
• Physical exam s (complete and/or targeted physical exams) . 
• Safety laboratory tests ( chem 7 panel, total and direct bilirubin, ALT, AST, LDH, CBC 
with differential , urinalysis ). 
• Vital signs  (oral temperature, seated blood pressure, resting heart rate, pulse oximetry and 
respiratory rate ).   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 57 of 76 
   
 • Concomitant medications.  
9.3.2 Primary PK Endpoints  
The following primary PK endpoints  will be evaluated in healthy adults:  
• Primary PK Endpoints ( at each of the three COVID -HIGIV dose levels):  
o AUC 0-last: area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration  after dosing . 
o AUC 0-inf: AUC 0-last plus the additional area extrapolated to infinity after dosing .  
o AUC 0-14d after dosing . 
o AUC 0-28d after dosing . 
o Cmax: maximum observed concentration  after dosing . 
o Tmax: time at which C max occurs  after dosing . 
o Cmin28d: observed or estimated  concentration at 28 days after dosing . 
o λz: terminal elimination rate constant  after dosing . 
o T1/2: apparent terminal elimination half -life after dosing . 
o CL: systemic  clearance  after dosing . 
o VZ: volume of distribution  after dosing . 
Secondary  PK Endpoints : following b ody weight normalized PK parameters will be estimated  
as PK parameter  divided by subject body weight (kg) at baseline.  
o CmaxBWN: Body weight normalized Cmax  
o Cmin28dBWN: Body weight normalized Cmin28d  
o AUC 0-14dBWN:  Body weight normalized AUC 0-14d 
o AUC 0-28dBWN:  Body weight normalized AUC 0-28d 
o AUC 0-lastBWN:  Body weight normalize d AUC 0-last 
o AUC 0-infBWN:  Body weight normalized AUC 0-inf 
 
The PK endpoints will be based on  serum concentrations of SARS -CoV -2 binding  and 
neutralizing  antibodies after IV administration of a single COVID -HIGIV dose (up to 84 days 
post-dosing) . Serum concentrations of SARS -CoV -2 binding and neutralizing antibodies will be  
measured by validated immunobinding (IgG) and pseudovirus neutralization PK assay s and the 
results will be used to calculate the primary PK endpoints.    Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 of 76 
   
 9.4 Handling of Missing Data  
When calculating summary statistics, including geometric mean  and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs)  and PK (SARS -CoV-2 binding and/or neutralizing antibody) concentrations below the 
assay’s limit of quantitation (LOQ) and/or detection (LOD) will be imputed as  half of LOQ/LOD 
values . If the lower bounds of the CIs are below lower LOQ  (LLOQ) , it will be replaced by 
“<LLOQ” in the output.  Unless otherwise specified, no imputation will be made for missing data 
and complete data analysis will be used.  Missing data due to the COVID -19 pandemic will be 
indicated.  
9.5 Interim Analyses  
The SMC will perform blinded review of the safety days after the first seven subjects have 
completed at least 72 hours of safety follow -up.  
9.6 Planned Method of Analyses  
In general, continuous endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics including number 
of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Logarithm ic 
transformation will be used when appropriate, coefficient of variation (CV),  geometric mean, 
and geometric CV will also be summarized. Categorical endpoints will be summarized by the 
total number of subjects, frequencies and percentages.  Unless otherwise specified, CIs are two -
sided with 95% confidence.  Non-compartment method will  be used for estimating PK 
parameters . 
9.6.1 Subject Disposition, Demographics, Medical History and Study Treatment 
Exposure  
Subject disposition, including early termination reasons, will be summarized by study treatment 
for all subjects. Major protocol deviatio ns will be presented for the safety population. Subject 
demographics, medical history, and study treatment dosing data will be tabulated for the ITT 
population and the safety population . Study disruption due to the COVID -19 pandemic will be 
indicated  in the listing of subject disposition . 
9.6.2 Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population  by treatment group. . 
Adverse Events (AE)/Serious Adverse Events (SAE):  
AE will be coded to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), using the most current version at the time of coding. AEs 
will be defined as events beginning after study treatment administrat ion that were not present 
prior to study treatment administration or those that were present prior to study treatment 
administration and subsequently worsened in severity.  
• AE within 72 hours post -dosing will be summarized by SOC  and preferred term .   Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

Clinical Study Protocol EBS -CVH -003 
Version 4.0, 21 Apr 2021  
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 59 of 76 
   
 • AEs and SAE s within 84 days post-dosing will be summarized in the same manner  as 
described above in the first bullet . 
• Discontinuation or temporary suspension of infusion will be summarized by treatment 
group.  
Clinical Laboratory Test Results:  
Laboratory test res ults and change from baseline will be summarized by time point and study 
treatment.  The clinical significance of abnormality will be assessed by the Investigator. 
Abnormal laboratory results will be graded with severity  grade 1 to 4 ( grade 1=mild , through  
grade 4=potentially life -threatening) according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events  (see Appendix II I). For severity  not s pecifically listed in the 
severity  grading criteria, the PI or designee will use the grading criteria for “illness or clinical 
AE” to assign the AE severity  grading.  
Values not meeting criteria for severity of at least grade 1 will be considered as grade 0. 
Shift table of abnormality (Low, Normal, High) will be provided for selective laboratory 
parameters by treatment groups and timepoints.  
Shift table of severity grade (0, 1 -2, ≥3) will be provided for selective laboratory parameters by 
treatment groups a nd timepoints.  
Vital Signs:  
Vital signs include the following parameters: oral temperature, seated blood pressure, resting 
heart rate, pulse oximetry and respiratory rate. Vital sign results and change from baseline will 
be summarized by time point and stu dy treatment.  
Abnormal vital sign results will be assessed and assigned a severity grade 1 to 4 ( see Appendix 
IV – Grading of Vital Signs ). Grade 0 includes all values not meeting criteria for severity of at 
least Grade 1.  
Normality/Abnormality shift from baseline, and severity grade shift from baseline will be 
summarized by treatment group and timepoints in the same manner as for laboratory data.  
Concomitant Medication s:  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary and displayed by 
treatment group for the safety population.  Concomitant medications for COVID -19 treatment 
will be s ummari zed separately , if applicable . 
Clinical Status based on Modified WHO Ordinal Scale:  
For subjects that become SARS -CoV -2 positive during the study period ( at any time post-dosing 
on Day 1 and up to last follow -up visit/contact) and report COVID -19 symptoms, maximum

 COVID -19 Symptoms : 
For su bjects that become SARS -CoV -2 positive during the study period ( at any time post-dosing 
on Day 1  and up to last visit/contact ) and report COVID -19 symptoms, t he frequencies and 
percentages of subjects reporting COVID -19 symptoms will be presented by treatm ent arm.  A 
summary of COVID -19 symptoms by maximum severity  (see Appendix II  – Grading  of COVID -
19 Symptoms ) will be performed , for each symptom and for any symptoms.  
9.6.3 PK Analyses  
PK analysis will be conducted using the results of binding IgG and pseudovirus neutralization  
antibody assay s (primary PK analysis) for each dose level of COVID -HIGIV . Binding IgG and 
neutralizing SARS -CoV -2 antibody serum concentrations versus time will be plotted and 
summarized by treatment groups. PK parameters will be estimated using standard non -
compartmental method  (i.e., trapezoidal method). Actual times and not nominal times will be 
used in the analysis, and concentrations below the assay’s limit of quantitation (LOQ) and/or 
detection (LOD) will be imputed as half of LOQ/LOD values. Calculated PK parameters will 
include those listed in Section 9.3.1 . Subjects with elevated baseline levels of SARS -CoV -2 
antibodies or subjects with inadequate number of PK time -points (e.g., no pre -dose sample, or no 
measurable post -dose samples) may be excluded from the PK  analysis. Baseline correction may 
be implemented, if necessary.

 10.6 Protocol Deviations  
The Principal Investigator agrees to conduct the clinical study in compliance with the protocol 
agreed to by Emergent and ap proved by the investigational site’s IRB/IEC/REB.  
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
defined in the protocol.  
The Investigator or investigational site staff may not deviate from the protocol, ex cept, in rare 
circumstances, as necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to study subjects. In such event, both 
Emergent and IRB/IEC/REB will be immediately notified.  
The occurrence of protocol deviations will be routinely monitored for evaluation of Inve stigator 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and regulatory requirements. Emergent will review all 
protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will be responsible for determining if the deviation 
should be categorized as an Important Protocol Deviation (IPD ). IPDs may require additional 
documentation as requested by Emergent.  
Continued protocol deviations despite re -education of investigational site personnel, or persistent 
protocol deviations that are reportable to regulatory agencies may result in disconti nued 
shipment of investigational product and termination of further enrollment at the investigational 
site, or termination of the investigational site from the study.   
Protocol deviations due to the COVID -19 pandemic will be recorded, assessed,  and indicat ed.    Version: 4.0                    Effective Date: 21 Apr 2021

This study must be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with the protocol, current ICH GCP Guidelines, 
and appl icable local and federal regulations, and all other applicable local laws. Each 
investigational site will seek approval by an IRB/IEC/REB according to regional requirements. 
The IRB/IEC/REB will evaluate the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study. 
Further, in collecting and handling subject data and completing eCRFs, the Investigator and 
investigational site staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting subject privacy. 
To this end, a subject identification number will  be used to identify each subject.  
11.2 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the subject’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout their study participation.  
Emergent or designee will generate and prov ide a master ICF template to each investigational 
site for development of a site -specific ICF.  
All site -specific ICF must be in compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines, local regulatory 
requirements, and legal requirements and must be approved by Emergent or d esignee and the 
IRB/IEC/REB. Emergent or designee will advise the investigational site of required changes to 
the master ICF template during the course of the study.  
The subject will be asked to read and review the document. The Investigator will explain t he 
research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation 
will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, 
and potential risks of the study and of their rights as rese arch participants. Participants will have 
the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. 
The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or think about 
it prior to agreei ng to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent/assent document 
prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Participants must be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice. A copy of the informed consent/assent document will be given to the participants for 
their records. The informed consent/assent process will be conducted and documented in the 
source document (including the date), and the form sign ed, before the participant undergoes any 
study -specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by 
emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they 
decline to participate in this study.

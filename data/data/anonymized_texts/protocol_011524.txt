Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 2   1.0 OBJECTIVES  
1.1 To assess the outcome including disease -free survival, overall survival, and treatment -
related mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation 
1.2 To evaluate engraftment and the rate of hematopoietic recovery  
1.3 Evaluate donor -recipient chimerisms  
1.4 To determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft -versus -host disease 
(GVHD)  
  
2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo - HCT) is a curative therapy for the treatment of 
hematological and non- hematological malignancies and certain non -malignant conditions. Bone marrow 
or peripheral blood from an HLA matched sibling donor is the most commonly used source of allogeneic stem cells. However, HLA matched siblings are a vailable for less than one third of the patients who 
require allo - SCT. In the absence of an HLA matched sibling, volunteer unrelated donors or partially 
mismatched related donors (PMRD), stored cord blood may be used as a source of allogeneic stem cells. Stored cord blood has been used as a source of allogeneic stem cells in infants and children, but had early skepticism in adults because of concerns about the engraftment potential of the relatively limited number of stem cells. The number of stem cells in  a unit of cord blood is generally one log less than the number of 
stem cells on an average collection of bone marrow from an adult for transplantation.  
2.1  Advantages and disadvantages of using cord blood as a source of stem cells. 
 There are many potential  advantages of using cord blood as a source of allogeneic stem cells. It is a 
readily available source and umbilical cord units can be harvested at no risk to the mother or child since it is post -delivery.  Collection of marrow from unrelated donors is com monly a lengthy process.  Cord 
blood is available on demand and avoids delays in treatment for patients with unstable disease.  Cord blood is less likely to be exposed to infectious agents, especially viruses such as CMV that result in an inferior outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The risk of severe acute graft versus host 
disease (GVHD) may be less after cord blood transplantation in comparison to volunteer unrelated donor transplantation. Up to a two antigen mismatch may be tolerated wit hout a significant effect on the overall 
transplant outcome, expanding the patient population who may undergo allogeneic transplant.  For patients who lack an HLA matched bone marrow donor, cord blood from an unrelated donor is an alternative source of hem opoietic progenitor cells. 
 The major disadvantage of cord blood transplantation is the slow rate of hematopoietic recovery and relatively higher incidence of failure to engraft. This delay of recovery may result in a higher incidence of infectious complic ations in the early post transplant period. Lack of donor lymphocytes for future use is 
another major disadvantage with cord blood transplantation.

2.2   Results of cord blood transplantation in children and adults  
 
In a retrospective analysis from the Eurocord and International Bone Marrow Transplantation Registry, 
the long- term survival after transplantation from cord blood was similar or superior to survival after 
transplantation of marrow when the donor is a sibling.3 Also, Eurocord analysis reveale d that children 
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 3 with acute leukemia who received bone marrow, marrow depleted of T cells, or HLA mismatched cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors had similar survival.
4 The cause of death was different in 
different groups. There were early deaths from delayed engraftment in the groups that received cord 
blood, more relapses in the group that received T cell depleted bone marrow, and more cases of GVHD in 
the group that received unmanipulated marrow. In a matched pair analysis from the University of Minnesota, the survival after transplantation of unrelated donor cord blood was found to be comparable to 
HLA matched unrelated donor marrow transplantation in children. Despite increased HLA disparity in the 
cord blood group, GVHD was similar in both groups. Donor derived engraftment of 88% at day 45 was 
not statistically significant in difference compared to engraftment rate in the marrow group (96%).
5 
 
Rocha et al.6 compared cord blood versus bone marrow transplant for patients with acute leukemia.  T here 
were 98 patients who received cord blood and 584 patients who received bone marrow.  Cord blood recipients were younger, weighed less, and had more advanced disease at the time of transplant.  Bone marrow recipients were all 6/6 HLA matches, whereas 9 4% of cord blood recipients had an HLA -
incompatible graft [5/6 (51%), 4/6 (39%), and 3/6 (4%)].  Cord blood recipients were shown to have lower risks of grade II, III, or IV acute GVHD (relative risk, 0.57; P=0.01), but delayed neutrophil recovery (relativ e risk, 0.49; P<0.001).  There was no significant difference in chronic GVHD, transplant -
related mortality, relapse rate, and disease- free survival. 
 Laughlin et al.
7 also compared cord blood versus bone marrow transplant in patients with leukemia.  The 
cord bloods were mismatched at one HLA antigen (34pts) or two HLA antigens (116pts).  The bone 
marrow patients were HLA matched (367pts) or had one HLA mismatch (83pts).  The cord blood recipients were younger and had more advanced disease.  As expected, cor d blood recipients had a slower 
hematopoietic recovery.  Acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving bone marrow and chronic GVHD was higher in patients receiving cord blood.  Mismatched bone marrow transplant and mismatched cord blood showed similar rates  of treatment -related mortality, treatment failure, relapse rate, and overall 
mortality.  
 Reduced -intensity BMT has become more appealing as an attempt to minimize the toxicity and mortality 
of the preparative regimen while maintaining the anti- leukemic activity of the transplanted immune 
system.  This approach may also offer some benefit in cord blood transplant, considering a major barrier is the delay in neutrophil recovery.  Using a lower intensity regimen should allow some recipient neutrophils to pers ist during the engraftment phase.  One example of this approach was published by 
Barker et al
8 who utilized two regimens: fludarabine, busulfan, total body irradiation (Flu/Bu/TBI) and 
fludarabine, cytoxan, and total body irradiation (Flu/Cy/TBI).  Sustained donor engraftment was 76% with Flu/Bu/TBI and 94% with Flu/Cy/TBI.  The median day of neutrophil recovery was 26 and 9.5 days, respectively between the two regimens.  Incidence of grades III -IV GVHD was 9% and 1 year survival 
was 39%.  Numerous other ce nters have successfully utilized a reduced intensity approach in cord blood 
transplantation.
9-14  Despite the possible advantages of reduced -intensity conditioning, a recent 
publication by the Minnesota group has shown higher relapse risk in the patients t reated with a reduced -
intensity regimen as compared to a more standard myeloablative regimen.17  We have amended our 
protocol to allow an ablative preparative regimen for patients who can tolerate them, due to this data.  2.3   Cord blood banking  
After the su ccess of the first allogeneic umbilical cord blood transplantation in 1988, programs for 
banking screened unrelated donor CBSC have been initiated both in the United States and Europe.  Dr 
Pablo Rubenstein started the first such bank at the New York Blood Center (NYBC) in 1993. Since its 
inception, the NYBC has provided unrelated donor cord blood stem cells for over 1000 transplants. Analysis of outcomes for the initial 562 transplant recipients from the NYBC revealed a cumulative rate 
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 4 of engraftment of 81%  by day 42 for PMNs. and 85% by day 180 for platelets.15 Currently approximately 
more than 100,000 cord blood units are available in cord blood banks worldwide and more than 2000 patients have received cord blood transplants from these banks. Netcord, an i nternational cooperative 
group of cord blood banks, has developed a detailed set of standards for cord blood banking to facilitate international exchanges and to guarantee the quality of these products. 
 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
Cord Blood Unit Selection  
UCB uni ts will be required to be a 4/6 to a 6/ 6 HLA  A, B , DRB1 antigen match  with the patient as 
allowed per NMDP guidlines .  A minimum total nucleated cell (TNC) dose of >2.0 x 10
7/kg at the time of 
freezing will be utilized when possible.  When using double units, each unit should contain a minimum 
pre-cryopreserved TNC dose of 1.5 x 107/kg. 
 
UCB Transplant Procedure 
There will be a myeloablative and reduced -intensity preparative regimen that can be given prior to 
infusion of cord product.  The myeloablative approach will be selected in younger patients ( <50yo) with a 
HCT -CI score <3.   The reduced -intensity regimen will be selected for all older patients  (>50) or younger 
patients with a HCT -CI score > 3.  The reduced -intensity regimen will also be chosen for any patients 
being transplanted for indolent/follicular lymphomas , CLL, myeloma, or Hodgkin lymphoma; irrelevant 
of age or HCT -CI score.  On a case by case basis, patients may  receive a preparative regimen outside of 
their designated category as noted above  with the approval of the PI, if deemed in the patient’s best 
interest.   Example:   A p atient that is 55yo with high -risk AML and a HCT -CI score 1, may be approved 
for the myeloablative preparative regimen. . 
 
Myeloablative Preparative Regimen:  
• Fludarabine 4 0 mg/m2 IV on Days - 6, -5, -4, and -3 
• Busulfan 130mg/m2 IV on Days - 6, -5, -4, and -3 
• TBI 200cGy on Day -1 
• Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) 1.5mg/kg IV Days -4, -3, -2 (may be given at the discretion of

  The preparative regimen will be follow ed by infusion of one or two UCB unit(s).  UCB unit(s) will be 
thawed according to methods of Rubinstein et al.
16  If two products are used, they will be administered 
sequentially on the same day 1- 6 hours apart.  Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  will be 
used for GVHD prophylaxis.  On day  +30, +60, +100, +180, and +365 the chimeric status  of patients will 
be interpreted by VNTR analysis.  Immune reconstitution (Digeorge Panel) will also be checked at these 
time points.

8.0  HAZARDS AND DISCOMFORTS  
  Allogenei c HSCT is a complex procedure associated with a significant bone marrow failure, 
morbidity, and mortality. Patients eligible for this protocol will all have a life threatening hematologic malignancy for which allogeneic HSCT has shown to be the only treatm ent with 
curative potential. The exact incidence of hazards and discomforts is highly variable, and depends on factors like age, disease status, degree of HLA matching, CMV serostatus, etc. The following is 
an incomplete list of hazards and discomforts:  
Occurring uniformly in all patients:  
1. Alopecia (reversible)  
2. Nausea and vomiting, ranging in severity from grade 1 to grade 4  
3. Grade 4 anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia  
4. Mucositis, ranging in severity from grade 1 to grade 4 
5. Ovarian/testicu lar ablation resulting in long -term (irreversible) sterility  
 
Occurring in > 25% of all patients:  
1. Acute GVHD ranging in severity from grade I to grade IV  
2. Infection, ranging in severity from grade 1 to grade 4 
3. CMV reactivation  
4. Chronic GVHD, ranging in severity from limited to extensive  
5. Cataract formation  
 
Rare (<10%), but potentially lethal complications:  
1. Veno Occlusive Disease of the liver  
2. Cardiac arrhythmias and congestive heart failure  
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 9 3. Pulmonary hemorrhage  
4. TTP/HUS  
   9.0  WITH DRAWAL FROM THE PROTOCOL

rearrangement by RT -PCR is absent.  
 
2. AML  
 
a. Complete response: Resolution of abnormal blood and bone marrow morphology with less than 
5% blasts and resolution of disease -specific chromosome abnorma lity (if present) by standard 
cytogenetic analysis.  
 
b. Partial response: Decrease in bone marrow and peripheral blood blast count by > 50%.  
 
c. Molecular complete remission: In addition to criteria above for a complete response, disease -
specific rearran gement is absent by PCR analysis.  
 
3. MDS  
  
a. Complete response: Resolution of abnormal blood and bone marrow morphology with less than 
5% blasts and resolution of disease -specific chromosome abnormality (if present) by standard 
cytogenetic analysis.  
 
b. Partial response: Decrease in bone marrow and peripheral blood blast count by > 50%.  
c. Molecular complete remission: In addition to criteria above for a complete response, disease -
specific rearrangement is absent by PCR analysis.  
 
 
4. Multiple myeloma   
 
a. Complete response: Bone marrow less than 5% plasma cells, polytypic by 
immunohistology, and absence of M -protein on electrophoresis and 
immunoelectrophoresis.  
 
b. Partial response: Reduction in M -protein by > 50%.  
 5. NHL, HD, CLL  
 
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 13 a. Complete res ponse: Resolution of disease by physical findings and normalization of all 
previously abnormal clinical tests such as bone marrow examination and computed tomographic 
scans (CT). In addition, resolution of disease -specific chromosome abnormality (if present) by 
standard cytogenetics.  
 
 
b. Partial response: Reduction in disease volume in all measurable sites by > 50% , using product 
of diameters.  
 
c. Molecular complete remission: response above in addition rearrangement by PCR analysis.  
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 14 APPENDIX II:  GVHD  Grading Scale  
 
1.  Acute GVHD  
  
a. If patient develops acute GVHD at any time after BMT, acute GVHD is graded as outlined below.  
b. If patient dies before day 30 and has not developed acute GVHD, then the patient is considered not evaluable for GVHD.  
 
Clinical Stage of Acute GVHD according to Organ System  
Stage  Skin Liver  Intestine  
+ Maculopapular rash < 25% of 
body surface  Bilirubin 2 -3 mg/dl  >500 -1000 ml diarrhea /day or 
nausea, anorexia or vomiting 
with biopsy (EGD) confirmation 
of upper GI GVHD  
++ Maculopa pular rash  25 -50% if 
body surface  Bilirubin 3 -6 mg/dl  >1000 -1500 ml diarrhea/day  
+++ Maculopapular rash . 50% of 
body surface area or generalized 
erythroderma  Bilirubin 6 -15 mg/dl  >1500 ml diarrhea/day  
++++  Generalized erythroderma with 
bullous formatio n and 
desquamation  Bilirubin > 15mg/dl  >1500 ml diarrhea/day plus 
severe abdominal pain with or 
without ileus

2. Chronic Graft -vs.-Host Disease  
a. If patient develops chronic GVHD at anytime after BMT, chronic GVHD is graded as outlined below.  
b. If the patient dies before day 100 and has not developed chronic GVHD, then the patient is considered 
not evaluable for chronic GVHD.  
• Limited chronic GVHD  
Either or both  
- Localized skin involvement  
 
Version Date 09/17/2018    Amendment 7 15 - Hepatic dysfunction due to chronic GVHD  
•   Extensive chronic GVHD  
Either  
- Generalized skin involveme nt, or  
- Localized skin involvement and/or hepatic dysfunction 
 Plus  
-  Liver histology showing chronic aggressive hepatitis, or  
-  Involvement of eye (Schirmers test with less than 5mm wetting), or

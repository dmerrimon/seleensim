1 1.RCT Details
This section provides a high -level overview  of an RCT that the described real -world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely
as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title
The Preǀention of Chronic ObstrƵctiǀe PƵlmonarǇ Disease Eǆacerbations bǇ SalmeterolͬFlƵticasone Propionate or 
TiotropiƵm Bromide  ;INSPIRE  trialͿ 
1.2 Intended aim(s)  
The objective of the study is to compare the effect of the anti -inflammatory/bronchodilator combination of 
salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (SFC) with the bronchodilator tiotropium brom ide on the rate of moderate and/or severe 
exacerbations during a 2 -year treatment period, and secondarily on outcomes that might relate to exacerbations.  
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication and RCT finding  
Health care utilization exacerbation rate.  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable)  
With a sample size of ϲ3ϱ patients per treatment group , the trial will have ϵ0й power to detect a t least a 1ϱй (equal to 
1.ϰϰϱ exacerbations per subject per year) reduction in exacerbation s in the SFC group at a two -sided significance level of
alpha с 0.0ϱ
1.5 Trial estimate  
Rate ratio  с 0.ϵϲϳ (ϵϱй CI 0 .ϴ3ϲ–1.11ϵ ) comparing SFC to tiotropium bromide  (Wedzicha  et al., 200ϴ, Am J Respir Crit Care 
Med ). HR of 0.ϴϱ was used for power assessment based on RCT statistical analysis.

3 5.Cohort Identification
5.1 Cohort Summary  
This study will involve a new user , parallel group , propensity score matched  retrospective cohort study design comparing 
tiotropium to salmeterol . The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during baseline period of 1ϴ0 days before 
initiation of SFC or tiotropium  inhalers  (cohort entry  date ).  
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
New users (defined as no use in 1ϴ0 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified.  
ϱ.2.1   Eligible cohort entry date  
SFC inhaler was first approved by FDA for market availability on August 2ϰ, 2000, and t iotropium  on January 30, 200ϰ  
Optum: January 30, 200ϰ – March 31, 2020 ( end of data availability is September 30, 2020 but excluded data 
generated during COVID -1ϵ pandemic ) 
Marketscan : January 30, 200ϰ – December 31, 201 ϴ (end of data availability)  
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/e xclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are

6 Variables  
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
Study drug:   
The study exposure of interest is initiation of SFC (LABA/ICS combination ). Initiation will be defined by no use of inhaled 
SFC during the prior 1ϴ0 days before treatment initiation (washout period).   
 
Comparator agents:  
Initiators of tiotropium  inhaler  defined as no use of inhaled tiotropium during the 1ϴ0 days prior to index date  
 
Patients are required to be incident users with respect to both exposure gr oups.  
 
 
 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
ϱ 6.2 Preliminary Covariates:  
Age 
Sex 
Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period of 1ϴ0 days 
prior to and including the index prescription date  
Covariates listed above are a small subset of covariate s that will ultimately be controlled in the design and analysis phase 
of the study. They are included in the preliminary assessment to determine the presence of adequate overlap between 
the two population of patients to proceed to the next phase of the stu dy. Remaining covariates are defined only after 
the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendiǆ B ).  
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up: 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendiǆ A ): 
Primary outcome: Healthcare utilization exacerbation rate per year (although the trial definition include 1) 
COPD hospitalizations or 2) exacerbations that required corticos teroids and/or antibiotics, in our 
emulation, we focused on 1) hospitalizations with COPD in the primary diagnosis position or 2) 
exacerbations that required corticosteroids. We did not include antibiotic use as part of the outcome 
definition because of ou r inability to determine whether the antibiotics were being used for COPD or some 
other indication)  
Secondary outcome: 
oAll-cause death
Control outcome s of interest (control outcome s only serve to assess aspects of study validity but are not further 
interpreted):  Pneumonia  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 ϲ 6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug 
on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real -world databases is expected to be much worse than in 
the trial, the AT analysis is the primarǇ  analysis, as it targets the relative rate of outcomes on treatment.  
 
For the AT analysis, the follow -up will start the day after t he initiation of SFC or tiotropium  and will continue until 
the earliest date of the following events:  
 The date of end of continue d registration in the database,  
 End of the study perio d or ϳ30 days after cohort entry date , 
 Death , 
 Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically 
provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this 
as an exclusion reason for cohort s for the same reason.  
 The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index 
drug ( SFC or tiotropium ) н a ϲ0-day grace period , 
 The date of switching from an exposure to comparator and vice versa , 
 The date of switching  to or initiation  of other LAMA  (excluding tiotropium ) and switch or initiation to other  
LABA /ICS (excluding SFC) , LAMA/LABA, LABA  only, LAMA/LABA/ICS combination , and ICS only  inhalers . 
 
For the ITT analyses, the censoring based on the sw itching and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a 
maximum allowed follow -up time of 3ϲϱ days.

index .

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  25 
Millions of older adults will face complex medical decisions over the course of advanced illness,2  26 
yet most are unprepared.3,4 Lack of preparation can lead to uninformed choices, receipt of care 27 
inconsistent with personal goals, and lack of patient empowerment during clini cal encounters,5-9 28 
especially for individuals with limited health literacy.10 Conventional preparation, called advance 29 
care planning (ACP), has typically focused on having patients pre -specify preferences for life 30 
prolonging procedures, such as mechanical ventilation, and to document these choices in an 31 
advance direc tive (AD).11 Yet, ADs are hard to understand and are often not completed, 32 
especially by minorities.12,13 And, even when ADs are completed, they often fail to affect the 33 
care received at the end -of-life, decrease the stress of decision making, or result in what most 34 
experts agre e is the most important component of ACP – ongoing conversations between 35 
patients, their loved ones (surrogates), and clinicians.5,14-17 To overcome these limitations, we 36 
developed a new paradigm of ACP that focuses instead on prepa ring diverse, older adults to 37 
communicate their evolving wishes over time and to make real -time, complex medical decisions 38 
over the course of chronic and advanced illness.11 We propose to test this new paradigm of 39 
ACP using a patient -centered, interactive website in a double -blind, randomized, efficacy trial.  40

PRELIMINARY STUDIES  44 
We have experience conducting RCTs among diverse, older adults at the San Francisco 45 
Health Netw ork (SFHN).18 Dr. Sudore designed and tested an AD written at a 5th grade 46 
reading level among 205 chronically ill, diverse, older adults from San Francisco General 47 
Hospital (SFGH) with a 6 -month follow -up of 85%. The AD was preferred over a standard AD, 48 
with significant interactions for limited literacy (e.g., higher preference rates in patients with 49 
limited literacy). It also resulted in greater 6 -month AD completion rates (15% vs. 7%, p =.03), 50 
doubling the rates from baseline. This AD has been adopted as the official AD for SFGH and is 51 
being disseminated in California. It will serve as the active control.  52 
We designed and tested an informed consent process for diverse, older adults with 53 
limited literacy .19 We found t hat many patients do not understand simplified consent 54 
information and were unsure how to ask questions. But, informed decisions can be improved by 55 
providing both easy -to-read materials and a teach -back method. We will use this interactive 56 
consent method f or this study.  57 
Multiple steps of the ACP process :20 We found that most patients go through a series of ACP 58 
behavior al steps. Six months after exposure to the easy -to-read AD, 61% of older adults 59 
contemplated ACP, 56% discussed ACP with family or friends and 22% with clinicians, and 13% 60 
completed an AD. This work shows that measuring a full range of ACP outcomes, in add ition to 61 
ADs, and associated behavior change steps (contemplation to action) is important and informs 62 
our study outcomes. Previously described barriers to ACP, such as not wanting to burden 63 
family,21 are addressed in PREPARE.  64 
Evidence supporting the new ACP paradigm and content of PREPARE :22 We completed 13 65 
focus groups with 69 diverse, English - and Spanish -speaking older patients (mean age 78 +/ - 8, 66 
 
 7 61% non - White) and surrogates (mean age 57 +/ - 10, 91% non -White) from safety -net settings 67 
who reported making serious medical decisions. We used semi -structured interviews to ask 68 
about what best prepared them for decision making. Qualitative analysis identified 5  overarching 69 
themes, beyond ADs, that prepared patients and surrogates for decision making: (1) choose 70 
surrogates wisely and verify they know their role, (2) identify goals based on past experiences 71 
and personal values, (3) decide whether to grant leeway i n surrogate decision making, (4) 72 
inform other family and friends of one’s wishes to prevent conflict, and (5) ask clinicians 73 
questions. These themes have been incorporated as educational domains of PREPARE.  74 
Validity and reliability of the survey to measure  ACP engagement:  Surveys were designed 75 
with input from Co -Is and extensive cognitive interviews to measure discrete ACP actions (i.e., 76 
main outcomes: ACP discussions, AD completion,) and ACP behavior change (e.g., 77 
contemplation, self -efficacy, readiness). We recruited 50 older adults, aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 78 
illnesses (32% female, 42% non -White). Internal consistency 7 -day test -retest reliability, and 79 
discriminant validity (scores compared to healthy young adults – 50% female, 75% non -White) 80 
was high. Scor es did not differ by race/ethnicity or literacy, p>.05. We will also use validated 81 
surveys on ACP attitudes and methods to classify patients into behavior change categories.23,24 82 
Preliminary evidence that PREPARE is beneficial . In a recent pilot,25 we recruited 43 diverse, 83 
older adults from low -income senior cen ters. All subjects rated PREPARE easy to use (mean 84 
9/10-point scale). Pre to post ACP behavior change scores from our validated surveys (0 -124 85 
points) increased from 72 ± 33 SD to 87 ± 22, a 15 -point increase and an effect size of 0.5.  86 
Vulnerable populati ons have unique needs . The aforementioned pilot demonstrated that, 87 
unlike our work with Veterans, patients in safety -net settings are less trustful of research and 88 
require in -person recruitment. In addition, these patients are often socially isolated and r equire 89 
tailored ACP for persons without surrogates or families. They also lack ready access to health 90 
 
 8 information and ancillary support such as social workers or nurses necessitating access to ACP 91 
outside of the clinical environment. These findings add fur ther evidence for the need to tailor 92 
PREPARE for vulnerable populations and to test PREPARE within safety -net settings.   93 
 94 
OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL DESIGN  95 
Study overview:  96 
This study is a randomized, controlled trial that uses blinded outcome ascertainment to 97 
determine the efficacy of the ACP PREPARE website to engage ethnically diverse English - and 98 
Spanish -speaking older primary care patients in the ACP process.1 First, we obtained a Health 99 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver to identify individuals who meet our 100  
inclusion/exclusion criteria and have upcoming primary care appointments.  Administrative data 101  
and chart review are used to determine potenti ally eligible patients.  102  
 103  
Then primary care clinicians’ permission is obtained to allow the study team to inform their 104  
patients about the study. Patients are then recruited, screened for eligibility, and scheduled for a 105  
baseline interview before an upcoming  primary care appointment. To standardize the timing of 106  
exposure to the intervention and primary care follow -up, study participants are scheduled for 107  
baseline procedures 1 -3 weeks prior to an upcoming primary care appointment.26 108  
 109  
Next, informed consent is obtained, and those patients who provide consent are randomized to 110  
the PREPARE intervention arm (i.e., the PREPARE website with action plan exercises plus an 111  
easy -to-read advance directive plus PREPARE materials to take home, which include a website 112  
login, and a PREPARE pamphlet, booklet, and DVD) or the control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read 113  
advance directive alone). See a full description of the intervention below.  114  
 115  
 
 9 We then conduct blinded outcome ascertainment by performing chart reviews to determine ACP 116  
documentation at baseline and at the end of the study. We also conduct blinded outcome 117  
ascertainment using patient surveys at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the primary care 118  
appointment. We are choosing an active control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read advance directive) 119  
because we believe provision of an advance directive for chronically and seriously ill older 120  
patients should be the standard of care, even if it is not often “usual” care in clinical practice.8 In 121  
addition, the easy -to-read advance directive used in this study has been adopted by the San 122  
Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) and is available 123  
in the primary care clinics.  124  
 125  
Research Aims and Study Hypotheses:  126  
The aims of this study are to (1) To determine the efficacy of PREPARE to engage diverse, 127  
English - and Spanish -speaking older adults with chronic ill ness in advance care planning (ACP) 128  
compared to controls (AD only) and (2) To determine whether PREPARE efficacy varies by 129  
race/ethnicity, literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patient’s desired role in 130  
decision making.1  131  
 132  
Our primary hypothesis is that the PREPARE program plus an easy -to-read advance directive 133  
will re sult in greater documentation of ACP wishes, including advance directives and 134  
documentation of ACP discussions in the medical record, than an easy -to-read advance 135  
directive alone in elderly populations with chronic illness.  136  
 137  
Our secondary hypotheses are t hat, compared to an advance directive alone, PREPARE will 138  
result in more engagement in behavior change processes concerning ACP, including increased 139  
self-efficacy and readiness, as well as greater engagement in a full range of ACP actions, 140  
including discus sions with surrogate decision makers and other trusted family and friends. 141  
 
 10 Secondary outcomes will be ascertained using validated surveys.23,27,28 We also hypothesize 142  
that PREPARE will result in improved satisfaction with patient -doctor communication and 143  
informed medical decision making and that PREPARE efficacy may vary across moderator 144  
variables such as  patient health literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patients’ 145  
desired role in decision making.  146  
 147  
 148  
STUDY SETTING  149  
Recruitment for this randomized trial is occurring in 4 separate primary care clinics associated 150  
with the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and the San Francisco General Hospital 151  
(SFGH) in San Francisco, California. These 4 clinics are housed in 3 separate physical 152  
locations in San Francisco. SFGH is an urban, public hospital that, with the SFHN, serves 153  
racially and ethnically d iverse, low -income and indigent patients; 30% of patients are Spanish - 154  
speaking.18  155  
 156  
PARTICIPANTS AND ELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  157  
There  are no inclusion  or exclusion  criteria  based  on gender,  race or ethnicity . We assess 158  
eligibility in person. Older adults are included in this study if they self -report speaking English or 159  
Spanish “well” or “very well”; are 55 years of age or older; have ≥ 2 chronic illnesses determined 160  
by chart review; have seen a primary care clinician (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician 161  
assistant) at SFHN/SFGH -affiliated primary care clinics ≥ 2 times in the past year (an indication 162  
of established primary care); and have had ≥ 2 additional outpatient or inpatient visits in the past 163  
year (an indication of severity of illness). Their primary care clinician must also give us 164  
permission to contact them to tell them about the study.  165  
 166  
 
 11 We are recruiting patients ≥ 55 years of age (rather than ≥ 65) because adults in safety net 167  
settings exper ience accelerated aging, functional decline, and sequelae of chronic disease, 168  
necessitating decision making and ACP at a younger age than patients with higher 169  
socioeconomic status.29,30 The goal is to start ACP early to change the trajectory of decision 170  
making and care over the course of ill ness. Our inclusion criteria of ≥ 2 primary care visits and ≥ 171  
2 additional visits in the past year ensures patients have established primary care and access 172  
care frequently. This will enhance recruitment and follow -up.  173  
 174  
Patients will be excluded if their clinician is a principal investigator, co -investigator or clinician - 175  
member of the Patient -Clinician Advisory Board. They will also be excluded if they have medical 176  
record documentation of being deaf, blind, having dementia, or being psychotic or are deemed  177  
by their clinician to be too mentally or physically ill to participate. Through in -person or phone 178  
screening by study staff, patients are also excluded if they self -report vision too poor to read a 179  
newspaper, lack of a phone (needed for follow -up intervie ws and scheduling), or plans to be out 180  
of the country for ≥ 3 months; if they screen positive for moderate -to-severe cognitive 181  
impairment using the validated Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire followed by the Mini - 182  
Cog,31-33 or self -report or are determined by study staff to be blind, deaf, intoxicated or actively 183  
psychotic. Because ACP is an iterative process and people may change their preferences over 184  
time,11,34 subjects with prior ACP experiences (e.g., an advance directive) are not excluded.  185  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

 13 RECRUITMENT METHODS  187  
Data Extraction:  188  
To facilitate recruitment, we obtained a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 189  
waiver to access patients’ names, age, primary language, phone numbers, addresses, medical 190  
record numbers, as well as dates of outpatient primary care clinic appointments in the past year 191  
and up to 3 months in the future, other appointments and hospitalizations and emergency room 192  
visits in the past year, and the name of patien ts’ outpatient primary care providers. From these 193  
data, we obtain a list of potentially eligible patient participants and send a secure email to their 194  
primary care providers asking for permission for our study team to tell their patients about the 195  
study th rough a recruitment opt -out study letter, followed by phone or in -person recruitment. 196  
Weekly administrative data pulls from the electronic health record identify patients with 197  
upcoming primary care appointments and are used to target patient recruitment ef forts.  198  
 199  
Clinician Permission to Contact Patients:  200  
Upon completion of the administrative data pulls, providers from all recruitment sites are sent a 201  
letter/e -mail informing them about the research study and asking them to review a list of their 202  
patients, to  refer patient(s) on their patient list who would be appropriate for the study, and to 203  
obtain permission to contact their patients to tell them more about the study. Clinicians are also 204  
informed that if the study team receives their approval, their eligibl e participants will receive a 205  
letter describing the research study and offering them the opportunity to decline to be contacted 206  
by research personnel and/or will be contacted in clinic. Additionally, clinicians are informed that 207  
if they do not respond one week after the 3rd attempt to contact them by the study team 208  
(including by email, phone, and/or in -person), we will assume assent to contact their patients 209  
and a letter describing the study will be sent to patients on behalf of the study team. We obtain 210  
permission from all of the Service Chiefs before their clinicians are contacted.  211  
 212  
 
 14 Recruitment Methods and Materials:  213  
Study -related fliers written at a 5th-grade reading level in English and Spanish are posted in 214  
approved areas in SFHN/SFGH -affiliated primary  care clinics. Because many patients may be 215  
too ill to come to frequent clinic appointments and to be interviewed or hear about the study in 216  
busy clinic waiting rooms, we include several recruitment strategies. Therefore, in addition, opt - 217  
out letters writt en at a 5th grade reading level in English and Spanish are mailed and describe 218  
the research study as well as provide a telephone number to opt -out.  If a clinician gives us 219  
explicit permission to contact their patients, we will inform patients that their i ndividual doctor 220  
gave us permission to contact them. If the clinician merely assents by not responding to multiple 221  
attempts to reach them by study staff, patients will be sent non -personalized letters from the 222  
study team. Although patients can opt out at a ny time, those who do not call study staff to 223  
decline participation within 1 week of the mailings are deemed eligible to be contacted to 224  
describe the study, assess willingness to participate and assess study eligibility. To standardize 225  
the timing between i ntervention exposure and primary care follow -up, we schedule patients for 226  
the baseline interview and exposure to PREPARE or the control intervention 1 to 3 weeks prior 227  
to their upcoming primary care appointment. Weekly administrative data pulls from the 228  
electronic health record identify patients with upcoming primary care appointments and are used 229  
to target patient recruitment efforts. Potential participants are then contacted in the clinic.  230  
 231  
Patients who consent and enroll are paid $25 for a screening inte rview and $25 for a baseline 232  
interview as well as given a $10 taxi voucher to come back to follow -up interviews in person if 233  
they desire.  Participants are also reimbursed $25 for each of the 1 -week, 3, 6, and 12 -month 234  
interviews.  235  
 236  
Diverse, vulnerable populations are often difficult to recruit for research studies. We employ 237  
several strategies to enhance our recruitment. First, we attempt to hire individuals who have 238  
 
 15 experience with diverse populations and individuals who are bilingu al (native Spanish -speaking) 239  
and bicultural. Furthermore, we conduct extensive sensitivity training with all research staff and 240  
require staff to use approved study scripts when speaking to patients. These study scripts and 241  
all study materials used for recr uitment are vetted, updated and approved by both our patient 242  
advisory and clinical advisory boards. All materials and study scripts are written at a 5th grade 243  
reading level and are provided to patients in their preferred language (i.e., English or Spanish) . 244  
 245  
CONSENT PROCEDURES  246  
We use a modified consent process that several co -authors designed for vulnerable 247  
populations.19,26 Consent forms written at the 5th grade reading level are provided and read to 248  
participants in English or Spanish. This review is then followed by standardized “teach -to-goal” 249  
questions to ensure understanding. If potential participants cannot correctly complete the teach - 250  
back process aft er 3 attempts, the patient is deemed ineligible.  251  
 252  
The consent form has been approved by the UCSF and SFGH Institutional Review Boards, the 253  
patient/clinical advisory board, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The consent 254  
form states the follow ing for the purpose of the study: “Why is this study being done? 255  
Sometimes patients and their families have to make hard medical decisions. We want to design 256  
and test an easy -to-understand handout to help.  This handout will help people think about their 257  
values, or what is most important to them in their life. It will also help prepare patients to make 258  
medical decisions.” We use the word “handout” because, in pilot testing, both groups are given 259  
handout materials and written advance directives. For randomiz ation we explain, “We will ask 260  
you to look over a handout and answer some questions about your experience with making 261  
medical decisions. There will be two groups that will be given different handouts. You will have a 262  
50/50 chance of being in either group.”  263  
 264  
 
 16 INTERVENTION AND COMPARISON CONDITIONS  265  
PREPARE arm  266  
As previously described, PREPARE is an easy -to-use, patient -centered, interactive website that 267  
is available in English or Spanish, is written at a 5th grade reading level, includes voice -overs of 268  
all tex t for the reading -impaired and closed -captioning of all videos for the hearing impaired 269  
(www.prepareforyourcare.org ).25,26 The conceptual framework for PREPARE has been 270  
previously published and is based based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory, 38,39 with 271  
elements from the Health Belief Model,40 the Theory of Planned Behavior,41 and Behavior 272  
Change Theory.39,42 In these theories and in behavioral studies, modeling of behaviors helps 273  
people change their behavior. Successful behavi oral change interventions model skills, enhance 274  
self-efficacy, and address perceived barriers,43,44 especially literacy -appropriate interventions.18 275  
Modeling behaviors (as in PREPARE) can also improve patients’ ability to communicate with 276  
clinicians and improve outcomes,45,46 such as increased question asking behavior and a sense 277  
of control during a clinical visit,46,47 an increased desire  to participate in decision making, and 278  
even improved affect and functional status.43,48 -50  PREPARE incorporates these successful 279  
teaching methods through the modeling of behaviors in videos. Video and interactive websites 280  
are more powerful mediums to teach information and change behavior than written mat erials, 281  
especially for those with language/literacy barriers.51-57 PREPARE includes a training and goal 282  
setting component which has been shown to be effective in changing outpatient behaviors, such 283  
as exercise.58  284  
 285  
In the  design of the PREPARE website, we included essential, theory -based health education 286  
strategies, such as the use of video modeling of ACP behaviors and tailored and interactive 287  
content based on patients’ values and decision preferences. To ensure PREPARE i s easy to 288  
read and understand, we use clear health communication principles (e.g., targeting text to the 289  
5th grade reading level) informed by extensive formative research and cognitive interviewing 290  
 
 17 with the target population (i.e., racially and ethnically diverse older adults with limited health 291  
literacy and English proficiency) to ensure PREPARE content is acceptable to individuals from 292  
diverse cultural backgrounds.25 The PREPARE website leads people through a 5 -step ACP 293  
process that ranges from choosing a surrogate decision maker to asking their clinicians the right 294  
questions. While going through the website, PREPARE also helps individuals answer personal 295  
values questions about their medi cal care, and helps them create an action plan to engage in 296  
some form of ACP. Patient -generated action plans have been shown to help patients engage in 297  
other preventative and disease management activities in the outpatient setting.59  298  
 299  
After the baseline interview, participants in the PREPARE arm review all 5 steps of the 300  
PREPARE website in English or Spanish in our research offices. Participants are asked to 301  
review PREPARE on their own and in its ent irety. Research assistants are available to answer 302  
questions only if needed, but do not go through the website with the participants. At the end of 303  
the program, a summary of the patient’s medical wishes and action plan are automatically 304  
generated from the PREPARE website in written format. This information along with the 305  
participant’s PREPARE website login information is included in a take -home folder that also 306  
contains PREPARE information in pamphlet, booklet, and DVD format. We include PREPARE 307  
content in non-website formats because some patients may not have access to the internet at 308  
home. PREPARE arm participants are also given an easy -to-read advance directive in English 309  
or Spanish to review and consider completing.18,60 Participants are asked to review the advance 310  
directive form for at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes in research offices, and then to take 311  
the form home to discuss with their potential surrogates and/or their c linicians. The time frame 312  
of 5-15 minutes was chosen because our goal is only to introduce the advance directive and 313  
allow participants to ask questions. The goal is not to have patients complete the form on the 314  
day of the study, before potential discussio ns with clinicians or surrogates, unless the participant 315  
would like to do so.  316  
 
 18  317  
AD-only arm  318  
Participants in the control arm are only given the easy -to-read advance directive, are asked to 319  
review it for at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes, and to take t he form home to discuss with 320  
their potential surrogates and clinicians.  321  
 322  
Both arms: Reminder of primary care appointments  323  
One to 3 days before the patient’s next scheduled primary care appointment, research staff call 324  
the PREPARE arm participants to remin d them to bring in their study materials (i.e., action plan 325  
and advance directive) and to talk to their clinician about ACP. For the control arm, research 326  
staff members only remind patients about their upcoming appointment and do not provide 327  
additional enc ouragement about ACP.  328

A statistician not involved in recruitment or data collection uses a computer -based random 330  
number generator to create a randomization scheme using block randomization by health 331  
literacy (adequate health literacy versus limited health literacy, as determined  by a validated 332  
question concerning confidence with medical forms) and race/ethnicity (non -white versus 333  
white).61 Random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 are used to ensure an equal number of patients with 334  
limited health literacy in each group. Randomization information is associated with a unique 335  
patient identification number and is kept separate from other patient data. Due to the need to 336  
secure interview rooms for the duration of the baseline questionnaire and intervention (i.e., 337  
approximately 2 hours for the AD -only arm and 3 hours for the PREPARE arm), randomization 338  
occurred prior to scheduling a baseline interview.  339  
 340  
BLINDING  341  
 
 19 Clinicians are bl inded to patient group assignment. Although we obtain clinicians’ permission to 342  
recruit their patients, the interventions are not described, and no clinician education is provided. 343  
Participants could not be blinded to the intervention; however, they are to ld during consent there 344  
is a “50/50 chance” of getting one of two different ACP guides, and the non -assigned 345  
intervention is not described. Because each group obtains ACP materials, such as the easy -to- 346  
read advance directive, blinding is enhanced. The rese arch assistant who administers the 347  
intervention cannot be blinded to the study arm, but all follow -up outcome assessments are 348  
conducted by different and blinded staff.  At the start of all follow -up interviews, participants are 349  
reminded not to discuss the study materials they reviewed with assistants recording if they 350  
became unblinded. If unblinding occurs, a different blinded assistant conducts all subsequent 351  
interviews.  352  
 353  
INTERVENTION FIDELIT Y  354  
All staff members are rigorously trained and are required to read and adhere to a standardized 355  
study protocol manual, standardized study scripts, and standardized checklists for each contact 356  
and interview with participants. Several training videos have als o been developed for staff. 357  
Research staff are not allowed to conduct study tasks independently until they have reviewed all 358  
written and video training materials and can demonstrate complete mastery of all scripts and 359  
checklist items. In addition, a 10% ra ndom sample of all interviews is observed by senior 360  
research staff to ensure study fidelity.  361  
 362  
DATA COLLECTION METH ODS  363  
Paper surveys are collected and entered into REDCap. REDCap is managed by the UCSF 364  
Academic Research Systems Team and is stored behind st rong-string password protected 365  
firewalls on UCSF servers, not on individual laptops or desktops. All patients are given a unique, 366  
non-identifying patient identification number that is removed from any personally identifying 367  
 
 20 information (PII) or personal he alth information (PHI). All PII and PHI are stored in a Microsoft 368  
ACCESS database behind strong -string password protected firewalls on UCSF and SFGH 369  
servers. All paper files are stored in secure, locked research offices in secure, locked file 370  
cabinets.  371  
 372  
FOLLOW -UP AND RETENTION:  373  
We conduct follow -up interviews one week and 3, 6, and 12 -months after the primary care visit 374  
in the clinic, by phone. We utilize several measures to help ensure follow -up. Each follow -up 375  
interview takes between 30 to 45 minutes and participants are reimbursed $25.  376  
 377  
Method of contact for follow -up surveys:  378  
Upon enrollment, we ask participants to provide alternative phone numbers (e.g., cell or work 379  
numbers) and one to three additional phone numbers of close contacts who may know how to 380  
contact the patient in the event our study staff is unable to reach them.  Many patients in safety 381  
net settings are marginally housed, have intermittent phone access, and may change locations 382  
and phone numbers during the study period. We also ask participants if they prefer a text 383  
message or an email to schedule follow -up visits  and will use their preferred mode of 384  
communication. If these other modes of communication fail, we send out reminder letters. If 385  
needed, we also attempt to contact patients during scheduled clinic visits.  386  
 387  
Reminders for the primary care visit:  388  
Participan ts receive a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their next primary care visit. 389  
Participants in the AD -only arm are reminded to come to their scheduled appointment while 390  
participants in the PREPARE arm are reminded of their appointment and to bring th e PREPARE 391  
materials to the visit.  392  
 393  
 
 21 Reminders for study interviews:  394  
For all follow -up interviews, participants in both arms receive reminders of their upcoming study 395  
interview by phone or in person.  396  
 397  
Ascertaining reasons for loss of follow -up or withdrawal: For participants who want to 398  
withdraw, we ask them why in open -ended questions. If they cannot provide an answer, we 399  
prompt them from a list of reasons we obtained from prior advance care planning t rials, such as 400  
the study is too long, they are too busy, the study topic is too upsetting, they are too ill, etc.62  401  
 402  
 403  
MEASURES  404  
Overview  405  
Because ACP ideally is a process that occurs over time, we felt it important to measure a full 406  
range of ACP measures including ACP documentation (primary outcome) over time, and 407  
several behavior change constructs and several additional ACP actions over a 1 2-month period 408  
(secondary outcomes). The main outcome measures are described in detail below.  409  
 410  
Primary Outcome  411  
The primary outcome is documentation of ACP wishes in the SFHN/SFGH medical record. ACP 412  
documentation for the purposes of this study includes the  easy -to-read advance directive or 413  
other valid advance directives or living wills, a durable power of attorney for health care 414  
document (DPOAHC), a Physicians Orders of Life Sustaining Treatment form, or other 415  
documentation of discussions concerning patien ts’ wishes for medical care (i.e., documentation 416  
of oral directives by a physician or notes describing patients’ goals for medical care by 417  
clinicians).  418  
 419  
 
 22 We assess baseline and 12 -month ACP documentation rates and the date of documentation to 420  
determine the  length of time from study enrollment to subsequent documentation.  Patients in 421  
our study are enrolled, randomized, and exposed to the intervention 1 to 3 weeks prior to a 422  
primary care appointment. ACP documentation is timed to the date of intervention exp osure as 423  
patients may have engaged in ACP prior to seeing their primary care provider. The patient - 424  
reported outcomes in the follow -up surveys (1 week, 3, 6, and 12 -months), however, are timed 425  
to the primary care visit because those questions concern engage ment in discussions with 426  
clinicians (see secondary outcomes below).  427  
 428  
Because legal forms and documented  discussions can be used to direct medical care, we  429  
created a composite variable of any ACP documentation (forms  and/or discussions); we also 430  
plan to re port the percentage of forms and discussions separately. All medical review data is 431  
double coded by 2 independent, blinded  research assistants. Discrepancies are adjudicated by 432  
the principal investigator (R.L.S.).  433  
 434  
Secondary Outcomes  435  
Main Patient -Reported Outcome  436  
The main patient -reported secondary outcome, the validated Advance Care Planning 437  
Engagement Survey,25-27 was chosen to measure the full process of ACP. The Advance Care 438  
Planning Engagement Survey measures both ACP Behavior Change Processes,  such as 439  
knowledge, contemplation, self -efficacy, and readiness on a validated 57 -item scale. The ACP 440  
Behavior Change Process scale is measured on a 5 -point Likert scale and average 5 -point 441  
scores will be calculated. We will also measure ACP actions on the  validated 25 -item Action 442  
scale,  which assesses ACP activities (yes or no) such as identifying a surrogate decision maker, 443  
identifying values and goals for medical care, choosing the level of leeway in surrogate decision 444  
making, discussing one’s wishes wit h clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one’s wishes  445  
 
 23 in an advance directive.  Validity and reliability of the ACP Engagement Survey, as well as the 446  
questionnaire’s ability to detect change in response to an ACP intervention, have been 447  
previously desc ribed.25-27  448  
 449  
Feasibility and Satisfaction  450  
To evaluate whether and how PREPARE will be used in clinical practice and in the community, 451  
we also assess accep tability of the PREPARE website compared to an advance directive alone 452  
using validated scales of ease -of-use (10 -point scale, “ On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very 453  
hard and 10 being very easy, how easy was it to use this guide?” ) and satisfaction (comf ort: 454  
“How comfortable were you viewing this guide?”, helpfulness: “How helpful was this guide?”, 455  
and recommendations: “How likely are you to recommend this guide to others?” assessed on a 456  
5-point Likert scale (not -at-all to extremely) from our prior work.18 For the PREPARE arm only, 457  
and at the end of the 12 -month interview and after unblinding, we also ask how likely patients 458  
are to recommend the PR EPARE intervention to others.63 459  
 460  
Adverse Event Outcomes  461  
In addition, to ensure that the PREPARE program does not cause undue harm, we also assess 462  
both depression64,65 and anxiety.66,67  We administer the Patient  Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -4 463  
at baseline and at each follow -up interview.68 The PHQ -4 includes the PHQ -2 for depression 464  
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) -2 anxiety screening tool. A score of 3 or greater on 465  
a 0 to 6 scale suggests possible depre ssion or anxiety.  466  
 467  
Potential Mediating or Moderating Variables & Participant Characteristics  468  
Based on the previously published conceptual framework of PREPARE,25 we also hypothesize 469  
that PREPARE eff icacy may vary across several moderator or mediator variables (e.g., health 470  
literacy using the validated Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults s -TOFHLA, 471  
 
 24 scores 0 -3669 and dichotomized to limited = 0 -22 & adequate = 23 -36, and patient’s desired role 472  
in decision making with the medical provider using the validated Decision Control Preferences 473  
Scale (i.e., wants to make their own decision versus wants doctors/family to make decisions for 474  
them).70 We also hypothesize that PREPARE efficacy may be affected by several confounding 475  
variables (e.g., self -rated health, “How would you rate your health?” (5 -point Likert)71,72 476  
dichotomized as fair -to-poor and good -to-excellent and past experiences with ACP including 477  
prior documentation of legal forms and documented discussions. We will also assess a full 478  
range of patient -reported characteristics, as these factors may impact pat ient-clinician 479  
communication,73,74 such as age (“What is your date of birth?”), self -reported gender (“What 480  
gender do you consider yourself to be? male, female transgender, other”), finances (able to 481  
make ends meet versus not make ends meet), having a potential surrogate decision maker or 482  
not, education (“What is the highest educational level you have completed? ” less than or equal 483  
to high school or greater than high school), internet access in the home (yes or no), and 484  
religiosity and spirituality (i.e., “How religious/spiritual do you consider yourself to be?” on 5 - 485  
point Likert scale from not -at-all to extremel y).  486  
 487  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  488  
Our primary analyses will compare change in ACP documentation between study arms from 489  
baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include ACP Engagement with respect to 5 490  
ACP Actions (yes/no and a 0 -25-point scale) and Be havior Change Process scores (average 5 - 491  
point Likert scores) from baseline to 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months. Variables will be 492  
assessed for distributional and outlier values using standard summary statistics. Baseline 493  
comparability will be assessed betwe en groups using unpaired t -tests, Chi -square tests or 494  
Fisher’s exact tests. We will use intention -to-treat analysis using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 495  
Inc.) and STATA 15.0 (College Station, TX). All p -values will be 2 -tailed and set at .05 for the 496  
primar y outcome. To compare outcomes between the two arms longitudinally, we will use mixed 497  
 
 25 effects linear, Poisson, or negative binomial regression for continuous measures and mixed 498  
effects logistic regression for dichotomous measures. The mixed effects models will include 499  
fixed effects for the primary modeling terms of time (baseline and 12 months for ACP 500  
documentation and baseline and 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for ACP 501  
Engagement with time modeled using dummy variables to allow for non -linearity ); arm (AD-only 502  
versus PREPARE); an interaction term of study arm and time; and a random effect for subjects. 503  
We will adjust for the randomization blocking factors limited vs. adequate literacy,75 and any 504  
predictor variables that differ between arms. All mod els also will include random physician 505  
intercepts to account for nesting of patients within physicians.  506  
 507  
For moderator analysis, we will test for interactions by adding interaction terms to the group by 508  
time variable for health literacy (limited versus ad equate) controlling for prior ACP 509  
documentation and clustering effects by clinician. All other interaction terms are adjusted for 510  
health literacy (randomization blocking variable) prior ACP documentation and clustering effects 511  
by clinician. Additional inte raction terms to be added to the group by time variable include 512  
decision control preferences for making decisions (i.e., makes own decisions versus doctor 513  
makes decisions), age (i.e., < 65 years versus 65 years of age), sex/gender (i.e., self -reported 514  
man versus woman), race/ethnicity (i.e., white versus non -white), health status (i.e., good -to- 515  
excellent versus fair -to-poor), presence of a potential surrogate (i.e., yes versus no), and 516  
internet access at home (i.e., yes versus no). For Spanish -speakers, we  will also asses patient - 517  
clinician language (concordance vs. discordance). A p -value for interaction <0.05 is considered 518  
significant.    519  
 520  
Missing data for the primary outcome will be assessed. If there is 10% or more of missing data, 521  
we will use a mean imp utation approach and all available data will be included in mixed -effects 522  
 
 26 models. We will assess whether any research staff member became unblinded during follow -up 523  
assessment and conduct sensitivity analysis as needed.  524  
 525  
SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATIONS  526  
We will measure a full range of ACP behaviors including discussions. However, written advance 527  
directive completion of legal forms is a primary outcome and is the most well -studied.76  Power 528  
from longitudinal analyses with repeated measures will be stronger, but to be conservative, we 529  
consider power for a single post -intervention time point (e.g., 12 months ). A recent meta - 530  
analysis of written advance directive documentation studies  demonstrated a pooled effect size 531  
of 0.50 (95% CI; 0.17 -0.83),76 as did an RCT of an ACP workbook that included both behavior 532  
change constructs and a social work visit,77 and our pri or RCT of an easy -to-read AD at SFGH 533  
which showed an increased AD completion rate from 7% to 15%.18  Because both the 534  
intervention and control arm will receive the easy -to-read advance directive, we assume that 535  
both arms will have an advance directive completion rate of ≤ 15%. Based on prior studies, we 536  
assume PREPARE will result in additional benefit o f advance directive completion with a 537  
minimum effect size of 0.5 (two -fold increase) above 15%. A sample of 350, (175 per arm), will 538  
afford us 92% power (2 -tailed alpha of 0.05) to detect a difference of advance directive 539  
completion rates of 15% in control s vs. 30% in the PREPARE arm and 80% power to detect a 540  
difference of 15% vs. 27%. Power is also expected to be strong for the ACP behavioral change 541  
scale outcomes (preliminary data demonstrated a pre -to-post improvement of 0.5 SD).25 With a 542  
conservative assu mption that controls will improve by 0.1 to 0.2 SD, we will have 85% to 98% 543  
power, respectively, to conclude that the improvement is better in the PREPARE arm.  We 544  
expect a 15% drop out rate at 12 months based on our prior randomized, controlled trial at 545  
SFGH,18 and will therefore attempt to recruit 402 patients, or 201 in each arm for each language 546  
(English and Spanish) for a total recruitment of 804 patients.  547  
 548  
 
 27 Our sample size will also allow adequate power to detect clinically important interactions based 549  
on potential moderators (literacy, control preferences, language concordance) for our outcomes. 550  
In a prior trial of an easy -to-read advance dir ective in the same patient population with only 200 551  
patients, we found significant interactions for literacy.8 Thus, if we consider the power scenario 552  
of the control group ACP documentation rate of 15% and the PREPARE group of 28%, and 553  
suppose the control group rate is the same (15%) for both levels of the moderating factor, then 554  
for a moderating factor split of 1:1, we would have 80% power to detect an interaction. If the 555  
PREPARE arm ACP documentation rate is 18% for one level of the factor and 40% for the  556  
other, this corresponds to a relative rate of ACP documentation of 2.2 times as high for one 557  
level of the factor compared to the other. A 2:1 split of the moderating factor still allows 558  
detection of a 2.4 -fold increase in the relative rate of documentatio n. Power to detect 559  
interactions will likely be stronger for continuous outcomes (e.g. engagement/behavioral scales).  560  
 561  
ETHICS AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES  562  
This study is approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) (IRB reference 563  
#13-10847).  This study is guided by a Patient -Clinical Stakeholder Advisory Board that is 564  
comprised of patients and patient advocates (including native Spanish -speakers), surrogates, 565  
and SFHN/SFGH  primary care clinic staff and medical directors. It is also guided by a DSMB 566  
consisting of 4 experts in randomized trials, human subjects research and consent, vulnerable 567  
populations, palliative care, advance care planning, and biostatistics. Both advisory groups will 568  
review and approve all study protocols and related materi als. In addition, we continue to meet 569  
with both groups every 4 -6 months to review the progress of the trial, make suggestions for 570  
recruitment, review any potentially adverse events, and ensure that we are following our study 571  
protocols in a way that protect s vulnerable patient populations.  572  
 573  
HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  574  
 
 28 Protection of the rights and welfare of participants:   575  
All study staff are required to take annual training regarding the rights and protections of 576  
research participants. Additionally, weekly st udy team meetings will ensure that all study staff 577  
are following the research protocol and that all study participants are consented according to 578  
our study protocol.  579  
 580  
Furthermore, our consent process ensures that study participants have a clear understandi ng of 581  
the study and understand that they can choose to not participate in the study at any point in 582  
time, and that the care they receive will not be affected by declining to participate in our study. 583  
Our consent process involves using a consent form writte n below a 6th -grade reading level, 584  
reading the form to potential subjects verbatim, allowing time for questions and discussion, and 585  
then assessing comprehension using teach -to-goal. If questions are not answered correctly, 586  
repeated education and reassessme nt of comprehension are continued until complete 587  
comprehension is achieved. If subjects take more than three passes through the 588  
comprehension assessment, formal assessment for cognitive impairment will be completed. If 589  
patients are found to be cognitively impaired, they are excluded from the study. If they are not 590  
cognitively impaired, we will re -do teach back once more, after which the participant will be 591  
deemed ineligible for the study if they are unable to demonstrate comprehension of the study.  592  
 593  
Additio nally, we include UCSF Clinical Research Office contact information on all consent forms 594  
as required for all non -biomedical studies.   595  
 596  
Steps taken to minimize risks to subjects:  597  
We have developed a modified research consent process that has been shown to b e successful 598  
in vulnerable patient populations as described above.19 All study fliers, consent forms, and 599  
questionnaires are read to the subjects in their entirety by native English - and Spanish -speaking 600  
 
 29 research staff. Participants are reminded that they can opt out of the study at any time. All study 601  
materials are in an easy -to-read (5th grade reading level, large 14 -point font) format. The 602  
consent materials and the study interviews are conducted in the language the participant is 603  
most comfortable sp eaking (English or Spanish).  604  
  605  
This study will employ research assistants who are fluent in English or Spanish. Only fluent 606  
research assistants will be in contact and will communicate with Spanish -speaking participants. 607  
We will also ensure that all study m aterials are accurately translated into Spanish by having 608  
them initially translated from English to Spanish by native Spanish - speakers. We will then have 609  
them back translated into English to ensure accuracy. Finally, we will have the final translated 610  
docu ments reviewed for accuracy by third party native Spanish - speakers. To help participants 611  
follow along during the interview, they may review a large font Participant Version of the survey 612  
at baseline and all follow -ups that can be reviewed while the resear ch assistant is asking 613  
research questions verbatim. We use 14 -point font and color -coded, standardized, large font 614  
response options to help with understanding.  615  
 616  
Data security:  617  
- Data are stored securely in the encrypted, secure UCSF MyResearch environment  618  
- Data are coded; data key is kept separately and securely  619  
- Data are kept in a locked file cabinet  620  
- Data are kept in a locked office or suite  621  
- Electronic data are protected with a password  622  
- Data are stored on a secure network   623  
- Data are collected/s tored using REDCap or REDCap Survey  624  
 625  
Measures to ensure confidentiality and protect identifiers from improper disclosure  626  
 
 30 Risks to subjects are minimal and may include loss of confidentiality and psychological 627  
discomfort about discussing end -of-life issues . Subjects are assured that their answers to study 628  
questions will not be directly linked to their names. Instead, any identifying information is coded 629  
and separated from the data. The identifying information will only be known to the primary 630  
investigators but will not be used in data analysis. In addition, signed consent forms are kept in 631  
locked file cabinets and kept separate from the data collection instruments. Study subjects are 632  
also reminded that the information obtained will not be shared with their p roviders except in non - 633  
identifying aggregate form at the end of the study. We also make clear that the responses to the 634  
PREPARE guide are only for research purposes and will not be shared with their clinicians or 635  
put in their medical record.  636  
 637  
We will store all study materials in locked offices and locked storage cabinets. We will utilize 638  
UCSF MyResearch and REDCap to enter and maintain data in a secure environment. The 639  
paper files are stored in secure, locked research offices in secure, locked file cabinets.  640  
 641  
As some of the questions concerning end -of-life may cause psychological discomfort for some 642  
study subjects, subjects are reminded at the beginning of the interview of their right to refuse to 643  
answer any and all questions and their right to  terminate the interview at any time. We will also 644  
reassure subjects that if they choose not to be in the study or choose to terminate the interview, 645  
it will not change the medical care that they normally receive from their clinic or their clinician. In 646  
addition, we will reiterate that the information shared within the research interview will not be 647  
shared with their clinicians or used in medical care. However, subjects can take home a copy of 648  
the PREPARE guide with them and bring it back to their clinician s if they wish. Subjects are 649  
given the name and number of the primary investigator and may call if they have questions or 650  
are concerned about their participation in the study.  651  
 652  
 
 31 Required reportable information:  653  
As these interviews may be completed in people ’s home and, in the interviews, we are asking 654  
patients to describe their experiences and opinions, it is possible that reportable events such as 655  
elder abuse, suicidal or homicidal ideation may be detected. If they are detected, they will be 656  
handled accordi ng to the American Psychological Association code of ethics. If elder abuse is 657  
suspected, the participant will be encouraged to take steps to ensure their safety. They will be 658  
offered contact information for local supportive services and informed that the concerns will be 659  
discussed with the elder abuse hotline for assistance. When there are concerns about self -harm 660  
or harm to others, severity of harm will be assessed. Participants will be offered local support 661  
services and officials will be notified as nece ssary.  662  
 663  
DATA SAFETY MONITORITY PLAN  664  
Monitoring will focus on recruitment, baseline comparability of treatment groups, protocol 665  
adherence, completeness of data, accrual of primary endpoint data, safety, and follow -up rates. 666  
This monitoring will provide the basis for monthly review by the study investigators, review by  667  
the SFGH Patient -Clinician Advisory Committee, and Data Safety and Monitoring Board 668  
(DSMB), and yearly reporting to our IRBs. We will implement methods of verifying entered data 669  
and of quality control. All study materials data are kept on secure, password -protected, 670  
encrypted servers. All consent materials and any identifying information are kept in locked 671  
cabinets within locked offices, on password -protected, encrypted servers, on card -key prot ected 672  
research floors. Dr. Sudore, will be directly responsible for identifying and immediately reporting 673  
all adverse events to the IRBs Privacy Officers, and funding agency as appropriate. The SFGH 674  
Patient -Clinician Advisory Committee will ensure particip ant safety in the clinic and will meet up 675  
to 4 times per year. The formal DSMB includes 4 experts in randomized trials, human subjects 676  
research and consent, vulnerable populations, palliative care, advance care planning, and 677  
biostatistics. The DSMB will re view and approve the research protocol and plans for data and 678  
 
 32 safety monitoring; and assess data quality; participant recruitment, accrual and retention; 679  
baseline comparability of treatment groups, accrual of primary endpoints; and participant safety 680

DSMB will meet up to 4 times per year.  682  
 683  
CHARTER OF DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  684  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the National 685  
Institute of Aging (NIA) and PCORI to monitor participant safety, data quality and evaluate the 686  
progress of the study. Dr. Sudore, University of California, San Fr ancisco is conducting a 687  
comparative trial of two advance care planning interventions among English - and Spanish - 688  
speakers. The DSMB for this study includes 2 outside clinicians with expertise in randomized 689  
control trials(RCTs) and an outside biostatistician . The DSMB will review and approve the 690  
research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring; and assess data quality; participant 691  
recruitment, accrual and retention; baseline comparability of treatment groups, accrual of 692  
primary endpoints; and partic ipant safety (e.g., adverse events, protocol violations). They will 693  
also develop stopping rules for the trial. The DSMB will meet 2 and up to 4 times per year.  694  
 695

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  1051  
Background  1052  
The population is aging,1,2 and the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing, especially 1053  
among underserved and vulnerable populations (i.e., econom ically disadvantaged, racial and 1054  
ethnic minorities, the uninsured, etc.).3 A critical aspect of chronic and serious disease 1055  
management is advance care planning (ACP), a process whereby patients plan for their future 1056  
medical care. Traditionally, advance directives have been the main focus of ACP, but 1057  
unfortunately, most are written with complex, legal  language.4 This lack of attention to limited 1058  
health literacy and limited English proficiency may e xplain why advance directives are often not 1059  
completed and may explain, in part, why less than 20% of racially and ethnically diverse, older 1060  
adults engage in advance care planning (ACP) by the end -of-life.5-8  1061  
 1062  
Furthermore, for ethnic minorities, a population r apidly increasing in the U.S., medical decisions 1063  
are often complicated by a lack of trust and perceived racism.9-11 Ethnic minorities  are also more 1064  
likely to prefer aggressive treatment, mistrust advance directives, and have non -autonomous 1065  
views on decision making (i.e., prefer that family and doctors make me dical decisions for 1066  
 
 49 them).9,12-16 Hispanics/Latinos a ccount  for 15% of the U.S. population, a proportion projected to 1067  
grow to 30% by 2050.1,2 Spanish -speaking patients face significant communication barriers, and 1068  
literacy - and language -appropriate ACP tools that address unique aspects of Latino culture 1069  
(e.g., familismo or a strong commitment and orientation to the family) are  lacking.10 In addition, 1070  
the mean reading level in the U.S. is only at the 8th grade level, and for adults over 65 years of 1071  
age it is only at the 5th grade level.17,18  Patients with limited literacy often lack self -efficacy to 1072  
communicate their wishes or ask questions,19 and the combination of limited literacy and limited 1073  
English -proficiency results in low satisfaction with doctor -patient communication and decision 1074  
making.20-22 However, studies show that patients can be motivated to take action in response to 1075  
culturally - and linguistically -appropriate information they trust and can understand.8,23 1076  
 1077  
To address these gaps in advance care planning and shortcomings of advance directives, we 1078  
developed a novel, comprehensive paradigm of ACP focused on preparing patients to identify 1079  
their wishes, co mmunicate with surrogate decision makers and clinicians, and make complex, 1080  
decisions over the course of chronic and serious illness.24 This approach recognizes patients’ 1081  
wishes change based on chang ing clinical contexts and that advance directives are but one tool 1082  
to be used to inform in -the-moment decision making.25,26 To address the gaps in advance care 1083  
planning for racially and ethnically diverse older adults, and based on the new comprehensive 1084  
ACP paradigm, we creat ed the interactive, patient -centered PREPARE website 1085  
(prepareforyourcare.org) in English and Spanish that is culturally, linguistically, and literacy - 1086  
appropriate. PREPARE has been shown in pilot studies among English -speakers to help older 1087  
adults engage in  the ACP process, but it has yet to be tested in a randomized trial with both 1088  
English - and Spanish -speaking older adults.27 Both the new ACP paradigm and the PREPARE 1089  
intervention have been described in detail elsewhere.27,28 In addition, a description of a related 1090  
trial of the efficacy of PREPARE among U.S. Veterans describes the theoretical framework 1091  
underlying the PREPARE website.28   1092  
 
 50 PRELIMINARY STUDIES  1093  
We have experience conducting RCTs among diverse, older adults at the San Francisco 1094  
Health Network ( SFHN ) primary care clinics .8 Dr. Sudore designed and tested an AD written 1095  
at a 5th grade reading level among 205 chronically ill, diverse, older adults from Zuckerberg San 1096  
Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG)  with a 6 -month follow -up of 85%. The AD was preferred 1097  
over a standard AD, with significant interactions  for limited literacy  (e.g., higher preference rates 1098  
in patients with limited literacy) . It also resulted in greater 6 -month AD completion rates (15% vs . 1099  
7%, p =.03), doubling the rates from baseline. This AD has been adopted as the official AD for 1100  
ZSFG  and is being disseminated in California. It will serve as the active control.  1101  
We designed and tested an informed consent process for diverse, older adults  with 1102  
limited literacy .29 We found that many patients do not understan d simplified consent 1103  
information and were unsure how to ask questions. But, informed decisions can be improved by 1104  
providing both easy -to-read materials and a teach -back method. We will use this interactive 1105  
consent method for this study.  1106  
Multiple steps of t he ACP process :30 We found that most patients go through a series of ACP 1107  
behavioral steps. Six months after exposure to the easy -to-read AD, 61% of older adults 1108  
contemplated ACP, 56% discussed ACP with family or friends and  22% with clinicians, and 13% 1109  
completed an AD. This work shows that measuring a full range of ACP outcomes, in addition to 1110  
ADs, and associated behavior change steps (contemplation to action) is important and informs 1111  
our study outcomes. Previously described  barriers to ACP, such as not wanting to burden 1112  
family,31 are addressed in PREPARE.  1113  
Evidenc e supporting the new ACP paradigm and content of PREPARE :32 We com pleted 13 1114  
focus groups with 69 diverse, English - and Spanish -speaking older patients (mean age 78 +/ - 8, 1115  
61% non - White) and surrogates (mean age 57 +/ - 10, 91% non -White) from safety -net settings 1116  
 
 51 who reported making serious medical decisions. We used semi -structured interviews to ask 1117  
about what best prepared them for decision making. Qualitative analysis identified 5 overarching 1118  
themes, beyond ADs, that prepared patients and surrogates for decision making: (1) choose 1119  
surrogates wisely and verify they know their role, (2) identify goals based on past experiences 1120  
and personal values, (3) decide whether to grant leeway in surrogate decision making, (4) 1121  
inform other family and friends of one’s wishes to prevent conflict, and (5) ask clinicians 1122  
questions. These themes have been incorporated as educational domains of PREPARE.  1123  
Validity and reliability of the survey to measure ACP engagement:  Surveys were designed 1124  
with input from Co -Is and extensive cognitive interviews to measure discrete ACP actions (i.e., 1125  
main ou tcomes: ACP discussions, AD completion,) and ACP behavior change (e.g., 1126  
contemplation, self -efficacy, readiness). We recruited 50 older adults, aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 1127  
illnesses (32% female, 42% non -White). Internal consistency 7 -day test -retest reliabili ty, and 1128  
discriminant validity (scores compared to healthy young adults – 50% female, 75% non -White) 1129  
was high . Scores did not differ by race/ethnicity or literacy, p>.05. We will also use validated 1130  
surveys on ACP attitudes and methods to classify patients i nto behavior change categories.33,34 1131  
Preliminary evidence that PREPARE is beneficial . In a recent pilot,27 we recruited 4 3 diverse, 1132  
older adults from low -income senior centers. All subjects rated PREPARE easy to use (mean 1133  
9/10-point scale). Pre to post ACP behavior change scores from our validated surveys (0 -124 1134  
points) increased from 72 ± 33 SD to 87 ± 22, a 15 -point increa se and an effect size of 0.5.  1135  
Vulnerable populations have unique needs . The aforementioned pilot demonstrated that, 1136  
unlike our work with Veterans, patients in safety -net settings are less trustful of research and 1137  
require in -person recruitment. In addition , these patients are often socially isolated and require 1138  
tailored ACP for persons without surrogates or families. They also lack ready access to health 1139  
information and ancillary support such as social workers or nurses necessitating access to ACP 1140  
 
 52 outside o f the clinical environment. These findings add further evidence for the need to tailor 1141  
PREPARE for vulnerable populations and to test PREPARE within safety -net settings.   1142  
PREPARE has been shown to increase ACP Documentation and Engagement among 1143  
Veterans.  A prior trial of PREPARE was conducted among 414 Veterans.35 The mean age of 1144  
the cohort was 71.1 (7.8) years, 91% were men, 57% were white, 20% had limited literacy, 29% 1145  
reported fair -to-poor health status, and 51% had evidence of prior ACP documentation. The 1146  
follow -up time point was 6 months and there wa s a 90% retention rate. There were no 1147  
differences in demographic characteristics between study arms. In this VA population, advance 1148  
care planning documentation 6 months after enrollment was higher in the PREPARE  arm vs the 1149  
AD-alone arm (adjusted 35%vs 25%;  odds ratio, 1.61 [95%CI, 1.03 -2.51]; P = .04).  PREPARE 1150  
also resulted in higher self -reported ACP engagement at each follow -up, including  higher 1151  
process and action scores; P <.001 at each follow -up). These findings add further evidence of 1152  
the validity of P REPARE. However, PREPARE has never been tested among diverse, English - 1153  
and Spanish -speaking older adults in a safety -net setting.  1154  
 1155  
OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL DESIGN  1156  
Study overview:  1157  
This study is a randomized, controlled trial that uses blinded outcome ascertainment to 1158  
determine the efficacy of the ACP PREPARE website to engage ethnically diverse English - and 1159  
Spanish -speaking older primary care patients in the ACP process.36 First, we obtain ed a Health 1160  
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver to identify individuals who me et our 1161  
inclusion/exclusion criteria and ha ve upcoming primary care appointments.  Administrative data 1162  
and chart review are used to determine potentially eligible patients (Figure, Study Flow Chart).  1163  
 1164  
 
 53 Then primary care clinicians’ permission is obtained to allow the study team to inform their 1165  
patient s about the study. Patients are then recruited, screened for eligibility and scheduled for a 1166  
baseline interview before an upcoming primary care appointment. To standardize the timing of 1167  
exposure to the intervention and primary care follow -up, study partici pants are scheduled for 1168  
baseline procedures 1 -3 weeks prior to an upcoming primary care appointment.28 1169  
 1170  
Next, informed consent is obtained, and those patients who provide consent are randomized to 1171  
the PREPARE intervention arm (i.e., the PREPARE website with action plan exercises plus an 1172  
easy -to-read advance directive plus PREPARE materials to take home, whi ch include a website 1173  
login, and a PREPARE pamphlet, booklet, and DVD) or the control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read 1174  
advanc e directive alone). See Study Flow Figure and a full description of the intervention below.  1175  
 1176  
We then conduct blinded outcome ascertainmen t by performing chart review s to determine ACP 1177  
documentation at baseline and at the end of the study. We also conduct blinded outcome 1178  
ascertainment using patient surveys at 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the primary care 1179  
appointment. We are choosing an active control arm (i.e., an easy -to-read advance directive) 1180  
because we believe provision of an advance directive for chronically and seriously ill older 1181  
patients should be the standard of care, even if it is not often “usual” care in clinical practice .8 In 1182  
addition, the easy -to-read advance directive used in this study has been adopted by  the San 1183  
Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and 1184  
is available in the primary care clinics.  1185  
 1186  
Research Aims and Study Hy potheses:  1187  
The aims of this study are to (1) To determine the efficacy of PREPARE to engage diverse, 1188  
English - and Spanish -speaking older adults with chronic illness in advance care planning (ACP) 1189  
compared to controls (AD only) and (2) To determine whether P REPARE efficacy varies by 1190  
 
 54 race/ethnicity, literacy, clinician -patient language concordance, and patient’s desired role in 1191  
decision making.36  1192  
 1193  
Our primary hypothesis is that the PREPARE program plus an easy -to-read advance directive 1194  
will re sult in greater documentation of ACP wishes, including advance directives and 1195  
documentation of ACP discussions in the medical record, than an easy -to-read advance 1196  
directive alone in elderly populations with chronic illness.  1197  
 1198  
Our secondary hypotheses are t hat, compared to an advance directive alone, PREPARE will 1199  
result in more engagement in behavior change processes concerning ACP, including increased 1200  
self-efficacy and readiness, as well as greater engagement in a full range of ACP actions, 1201  
including discus sions with surrogate decision makers and other trusted family and friends. 1202  
Secondary outcomes will be ascertained using validated surveys.33,37,38 We also hypothesize 1203  
that PREPARE will result in improved satisfaction with patient -doctor communication and 1204  
informed medical decision making and that PREPARE efficacy may vary across moderator 1205  
variables such as patient health literacy, clinician -patient l anguage concordance, and patients’ 1206  
desired role in decision making.  1207

 56 STUDY SETTING  1216  
Recruitment for this randomized trial is occurring in 4 separate primary care clinics associated 1217  
with the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN) and the Zuckerberg San Francisco General 1218  
Hospital (Z SFG) in San Francisco, California. These 4 clinics are housed in 3 separate physical 1219  
locations in San Francisco. ZSFG is an urban, public hospital that, with the SFHN, serves 1220  
racially and ethnically diver se, low -income and indigent patients; 30% of patients are Spanish - 1221  
speaking.8  1222  
 1223  
PARTICIPANTS AND ELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  1224  
There  are no inclusion  or exclusion  criteria  based  on gender,  race or ethnicity . We assess 1225  
eligibility in person or over the phone. Older adults are incl uded in this study if they self -report 1226  
speaking English or Spanish “well” or “very well”; are 55 years of age or older; have ≥ 2 chronic 1227  
illnesses determined by chart review; have seen a primary care clinician (physician, nurse 1228  
practitioner, or physician assistant) at ZSFG/SFHN -affiliated primary care clinics ≥ 2 times in the 1229  
past year (an indication of established p rimary care); and have had ≥ 2 additional outpatient or 1230  
inpatient visits in the past year (an indication of severity of illness). Their primary care clinician 1231  
must also give us permission to contact them to tel l them about the study .  1232  
 1233  
We are recruit ing patients ≥ 55 years of age (rather than ≥ 65) because adults in safety net 1234  
settings experience accelerated aging, functional decline, and sequelae of chronic disease, 1235  
necessitating decision making and ACP at a younger age than patients with higher 1236  
socioecono mic status.39,40 The goal is to start ACP early to change the trajectory of decision 1237  
making and care over the course of illness. Our inclusion criteria of ≥ 2 primary care visits and ≥ 1238  
2 additional visits in the past year ensures patients have established primary care and  access 1239  
care frequently. This will enhance recruitment and follow -up.  1240  
 
 57 Patients will be excluded if their clinician is a principal  investigator, co -investigator or clinician - 1241  
member of the Patient -Clinician Advisory Board  or they had been enrolled in a prev ious pilot 1242  
study of the PREPARE website  or been exposed to the PREPARE study materials . They will 1243  
also be excluded if they have medical record documentation of being deaf, blind, having 1244  
dementia, or being psychotic or are deemed by their clinician to be to o mentally or physically ill 1245  
to participate. Participants will also be excluded if they  have  evidence of active drug or alcohol 1246  
abuse within the past 3 months determined by clinician assessment, self -report, chart review or 1247  
research staff assessment. Throu gh in -person or phone screening by study staff, patients are 1248  
also excluded if they self -report vision too poor to read a newspaper, lack of a phone (needed 1249  
for follow -up interviews and scheduling), or plans to be out of the country for ≥ 3 months; if they 1250  
screen positive for moderate -to-severe cognitive impairment using the validated Short Portable 1251  
Mental Status Questionnaire followed by the Mini -Cog,41-43 or self -report or are determined by 1252  
study staff to be blind, deaf, intoxicated or actively psychotic. Because ACP is an iterative 1253  
process  and people may change their preferences over time ,24,44 subjects with prior ACP 1254  
experiences (e.g., an advance directive) are not excluded.  1255  
 1256  
To minimize the risk of unblinding  by fellow research participants , any spouse/partner of a 1257  
currently enrolled patient who  is also a patient at SFHN/ZSFG , meets the eligib ility criteria, and 1258  
therefore, is also a potential patient participant, will be excluded from being a patient participant. 1259  
This will avoid a situation where 2 closely related people living in the same home could be 1260  
randomized to different study arms and re sult in unblinding. In addition, an individual who is 1261  
named as an enrolled patient’s potential surrogate decision maker (regardless of cohabitation or 1262  
spousal status), who  is also a patient at SFHN/ZSFG , meets the eligibility criteria, and therefore, 1263  
is also a potential patient participant, will only be eligible to be a surrogate participant in our 1264  
study and will be excluded from being a patient participant. In addition, we are excluding any 1265  
 
 58 patient who has been enrolled in a previous PREPARE -related study or is known to have 1266  
previously been exposed to PREPARE (e.g. note in medical record).  1267  
 1268  
To save research staff considerable time and effort, potential participants who miss an interview 1269  
(i.e. no show) more than 2 times (for the same baseline interview appointment) without prior 1270  
notification and rescheduling with study staff will be considered ineligible, unless there are 1271  
extenuating circumstances.  1272

 59 RECRUITMENT METHODS  1277  
Data Extraction:  1278  
To facilitate recruitment, we obtain ed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 1279  
waiver to access patients’ names, age, primary lan guage, phone numbers, addresses , medical 1280  
record numbers, as well as dates of outpatient primary care clinic appointments in the past year 1281  
and up to 3 months in the future, other appointments and hospitalizations and emergency room 1282  
visits in the past year, and the name of patients’ outpa tient primary care providers. From these 1283  
data, we obtain a list of potentially eligible patient participants and send a secure email to their 1284  
primary care providers asking for permission for our study team to tell their patients about the 1285  
study through a r ecruitment opt -out study letter, followed by phone or in -person recruitment. 1286  
Weekly administrative data pulls from the electronic health record identify patients with 1287  
upcoming primary care appointments and are used to target patient recruitment efforts.  1288  
 1289  
Clinician Permission to Contact Patients : 1290  
Upon completion of the administrative data pulls, providers from all recruitment sites are sent a 1291  
letter/e -mail informing them about the research study  and asking them to review a list of their 1292  
patients, to refer p atient(s) on their patient list who would be appropriate for the study, and to 1293  
obtain permission to contact their patients to tell them more about the study. Clinicians are also 1294  
informed that if the study team receives their approval, their eligible partic ipants will receive a 1295  
letter describing the research study and offering them the opportunity to decline to be contacted 1296  
by research personnel and/or will be contacted in clinic. Additionally, clinicians are informed that 1297  
if they do not respond one week aft er the 3rd attempt to contact them by the study team 1298  
(including by email, phone, and/or in -person), we will assume assent to contact their patients 1299  
and a letter describing the study will be sent to patients on behalf of the study team. We obtain 1300  
permission  from all of the Service Chiefs before their clinicians are contacted.  1301  
 1302  
 
 60 Recruitment Methods  and Materials : 1303  
Study -related fliers written at a 5th-grade reading level in English and Spanish are p osted in 1304  
approved areas in SFHN /ZSFG -affiliated primary care cl inics. Because many patients may be 1305  
too ill to come to frequent clinic appointments and to be interviewed or hear about the study in 1306  
busy clinic waiting rooms, we include several recruitment strategies. Therefore, i n addition, 1307  
recruitment letters and postcards  written at a 5th grade reading level in English and Spanish are 1308  
mailed and describe the research study as well as provide a telephone number to either opt -out 1309  
or to hear more about the study.   Although patients can opt out at any time, those who do not 1310  
call study staff to decline participation within 1 week of the mailings are deemed eligible to be 1311  
contacted to describe the study, assess willingness to participate and assess study eligibility. To 1312  
standardize the timing between intervention exposur e and primary care follow -up, we schedule 1313  
patients for the baseline interview and exposure to PREPARE or the control intervention 1 to 3 1314  
weeks prior to their upcoming primary care appointment. Weekly administrative data pulls from 1315  
the electronic health rec ord identify patients with upcoming primary care appointments and are 1316  
used to target patient recruitment efforts.  Potential participants are then contacted by phone or 1317  
in the clinic.  1318  
 1319  
Patients who consent and enroll are paid $50 for the baseline interview  and given $10 in MUNI 1320  
(municipal transportation vouchers)  to help participants come back to follow -up interviews in 1321  
person if they desire. Participants are also reimbursed  $25 for each of the 1 -week, 3, 6, and 12 - 1322  
month interviews . 1323  
 1324  
Diverse, vulnerable popu lations are often difficult to recruit fo r research studies. We employ 1325  
several strategies to enhance our recruitment. First, we attem pt to hire individuals who have  1326  
experience with diverse popu lations and individuals who are  bilingual (native Spanish -speaking) 1327  
and bicultural. Furthermore, we conduct extensive sensitivity training with all research staff and 1328  
 
 61 require staff to use approved study scripts when speaking to patients. These study scripts and 1329  
all study materials used for recruitment are vetted, updated and approved by both our patient 1330  
advisory and clinical advisory boards. All materials and study scripts are written at a 5th grade 1331  
reading level and are provided to patients in their preferred language (i.e., English or Spanish).  1332  
 1333  
CONSENT PROCEDURES  1334  
We use a modified consent process that several co -authors designed for vulnerable 1335  
populations.28,29 Consent forms written at the 5th grade reading level are provided and read to 1336  
participants in English or Spanish. This review is then followed by standardized “teach -to-goal” 1337  
questions to ensure understanding. If potential participants cannot correctly co mplete the teach - 1338  
back process after 3 attempts, the patient is deemed ineligible.  1339  
 1340  
The consent form is approved by the UCSF and ZSFG Institutional Review Boards, the 1341  
patient/clinical advisory board, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ). The con sent 1342  
form states the following for the purpose of the study: “Why is this study being done? 1343  
Sometimes patients and their families have to make hard medical decisions. We want to design 1344  
and test an easy -to-understand handout to help.  This handout will help  people think about their 1345  
values, or what is most important to them in their life. It will also help prepare patients to make 1346  
medical decisions.” We use  the word “handout” because, in pilot testing, both groups are given 1347  
handout materials and written advan ce directives. For randomization we explain, “We will ask 1348  
you to look over a handout and answer some questions about your experience with making 1349  
medical decisions. There will be two groups that will be given different handouts. You will have a 1350  
50/50 chance  of being in either group.”  1351  
 1352  
Due to exclusions based on  several missed baseline appointments and for staff safety and the 1353  
need to exclude or withdraw participants who were intoxicated, psychotic, or threatening, the 1354  
 
 62 consent also explains , “We also may ask you to stop taking part in this study if we feel it is in 1355  
your best interest or if you do not follow the study rules.”   1356  
 1357  
It was determined with our Patient -Clinician Advisory Board that clinicians of pat ients should be 1358  
contacted in the event that  the patie nt report s severe depression or anxiety. Our DS MB agreed 1359  
and our consent forms explain : 1360  
“We would need to contact your regular doctor or a medical provider for the following reasons:  1361  
 You report or we observe that you  are having a medical emergency,  1362  
 Such as  a serious medical illness  1363  
 Or, a serious mental illness, such as major depression  1364  
 You report that you may harm yourself, you may harm someone else, or someone is 1365  
harming you .” 1366  
 1367  
INTERVENTION AND COMPARISON CONDITIONS  1368  
PREPARE  arm 1369  
As previously described, PRE PARE is an easy -to-use, patient -centered, interactive website that 1370  
is available in English or Spanish, is written at a 5th grade reading level, includes voice -overs of 1371  
all text for the reading -impaired and closed -captioning of all videos for the hearing impaired 1372  
(www.prepareforyourcare.org ).27,28 The conceptual framework for PREPARE has been 1373  
previously published and is based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory, 48,49 with elements from 1374  
the Health Belief Model,50 the Theory of Planned Behavior,51 and Behavior Change Theory.49,52 1375  
In these theories and in behavioral studies, modeling of behaviors helps people change their 1376  
behavior. Successful behavioral change interventions model skills, enhanc e self -efficacy, and 1377  
address perceived barriers,53,54 especially literacy -appropriate interventions.8 Modeling 1378  
behaviors (as in PREPARE) can also improve patients’ ability to communicate with clinicians 1379  
and improve outcomes,55,56 such as increased question asking behavior and a sense of control 1380  
during a clinical visit,56,57 an increased desire  to participate in decision making, and even 1381  
 
 63 improved affect and functional status.53,58 -60  PREPARE incorporates these successful teaching 1382  
methods through the modeling of behaviors in videos. Video and interactive websites are more 1383  
powerful mediums to teach information and change behavior than written mat erials, especially 1384  
for those with language/literacy barriers.61-67 PREPARE includes a training and goal setting 1385  
component which has been shown to be effective in changing outpatient behaviors, such as 1386  
exercise.68  1387  
 1388  
In the  design of the PREPARE website, we included essential, theory -based health education 1389  
strategies, such as the use of video modeling of ACP behaviors and tailored and interactive 1390  
content based on patients’ values and decision preferences. To ensure PREPARE i s easy to 1391  
read and understand, we use clear health communication principles (e.g., targeting text to the 1392  
5th grade reading level) informed by extensive formative research and cognitive interviewing 1393  
with the target population (i.e., racially and ethnically diverse older adults with limited health 1394  
literacy and English proficiency) to ensure PREPARE content is acceptable to individuals from 1395  
diverse cultural backgrounds.27 The PREPARE website leads people through a 5 -step ACP 1396  
process that ranges from choosing a surrogate decision maker to asking their clinicians the right 1397  
questions. While going through the website, PREPARE also helps individuals answer personal 1398  
values questions about their medical care, and helps them create an action plan to engage in 1399  
some form of ACP. Patient -generated action plans have been shown to help patients engage in 1400  
other preventative and disease management activities in the outpatient setting.69  1401  
 1402  
After the baseline interview, participants in the PREPARE arm review all 5 steps of the 1403  
PREPARE website in English or Spanish in our research offices. Participants are asked to 1404  
review PREPARE on their own and in its entirety. Research assistants are availa ble to answer 1405  
questions only if needed, but do not go through the website with the participants. At the end of 1406  
the program, a summary of the patient’s medical wishes and action plan are automatically 1407  
 
 64 generated from the PREPARE website in written format. Th is information along with the 1408  
participant’s PREPARE website login information is included in a take -home folder that also 1409  
contains PREPARE information in pamphlet, booklet, and DVD format. We  include  PREPARE 1410  
content in non -website formats because some pati ents may not have access to the internet at 1411  
home. PREPARE arm participants are also given an easy -to-read advance directive in English 1412  
or Spanish to review and consider completing.8,70 Participants are asked to review the advance 1413  
directive form for at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes in research offices, and then to take 1414  
the form home to discuss with their potential surrogates and/or their clinicians. The time frame 1415  
of 5-15 mi nutes was chosen because our goal is only to introduce the advance directive and 1416  
allow participants to ask questions. The goal is not to have patients complete the form on the 1417  
day of the study, before potential discussions with clinicians or surrogates, un less the participant 1418  
would like to do so.  1419  
 1420  
AD-only arm  1421  
Participants in the control arm are only given the easy -to-read advance directive, are asked to 1422  
review it for at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes, and to take the form home to discuss with 1423  
their p otential surrogates and clinicians.  1424  
 1425  
Both arms: Reminder  of primary care appointments  1426  
One to 3 days before the patient’s next scheduled primary care appointment, research staff call 1427  
the PREPARE arm participants to remind them to bring in their study mater ials (i.e., action plan 1428  
and advance directive) and to talk to their clinician about ACP. For the control arm, research 1429  
staff members only remind patients about their upcoming appointment and do not provide 1430  
additional encouragement about ACP.  1431  
 1432  
RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  1433  
 
 65 A statistician not involved in recruitment or data collection uses a computer -based random 1434  
number generator to create a randomization scheme usin g block randomization by health 1435  
literacy (adequate health literacy versus limited health literacy , as determined by a validated 1436  
question concerning confidence with medical forms).71 Random block sizes of 4, 6, and 8 are 1437  
used to ensure an equal number of patients with limited health literacy in each group. 1438  
Randomization information is assoc iated with a unique patient identification number and is kept 1439  
separate from other patient data. Due to the need to secure interview rooms for the duration of 1440  
the baseline questionnaire and intervention (i.e., approximately 2 hours for the AD -only arm and 1441  
3 hours for the PREPARE arm), randomization occurred prior to scheduling a baseline 1442  
interview.   1443  
 1444  
 1445  
BLINDING  1446  
Clinicians are blinded to patient group assignment. Although we obtain clinicians’ permission to 1447  
recruit their patients, the interventions are not described, and no clinician education is provided. 1448  
Participants could not be blinded to the intervention; however, they are told during consent there 1449  
is a “50/50 chance” of getting one of two different ACP guides, and the non -assigned 1450  
intervention is not described. Because each group obtains ACP materials, such as the easy -to- 1451  
read advance directive, blinding is enhanced. The research assistant who administer s the 1452  
intervention cannot be blinded to the study arm, but all follow -up outcome assessments are 1453  
conducted by different and blinded staff.  At the start of all follow -up interviews, participants are 1454  
reminded not to discuss the study materials they reviewed with assistants record ing if they 1455  
became unblinded. If unblinding occur s, a different blinded a ssistant conduct s all subsequent 1456  
interviews.  1457  
 1458  
INTERVENTION FIDELIT Y  1459  
 
 66 All staff members are rigorously trained and are required to read and adhere to a standardized 1460  
study protocol manual, standardized study scripts, and standardized checklists for each contact 1461  
and interview with participants. Several training videos have als o been developed for staff. 1462  
Research staff are not allowed to conduct study tasks independently until they have reviewed all 1463  
written and video training materials and can demonstrate complete mastery of all scripts and 1464  
checklist items. In addition, a 10% ra ndom sample of all interviews is observed by senior 1465  
research staff to ensure study fidelity.  1466  
 1467  
DATA COLLECTION METH ODS  1468  
Live capture of research data are collected through Research Electronic Data Capture 1469  
(REDCap) software. REDCap  is managed by the UCSF Academic Research Systems Team 1470  
and is stored behind strong -string password protected firewalls on UCSF servers, not on 1471  
individual laptops or desktops. All patients are given a unique, non -identifying patient 1472  
identification number th at is removed from any personally identifying information (PII) or 1473  
personal health information (PHI). All PII and PHI are stored in a Microsoft ACCESS database 1474  
behind strong -string password protected firewalls on UCSF and ZSFG servers. To reduce 1475  
missing da ta, REDCap has been programmed to not allow study staff to progress if data fields 1476  
are left blank. We retain  the use of paper surveys in  the event the RedCap system is  down. All 1477  
paper fil es continue  to be stored in secure, locked research offices in secure , locked file 1478  
cabinets.  1479  
 1480  
FOLLOW -UP AND RETENTION:  1481  
We conduct follow -up interviews one week and 3, 6, and 12 -mont hs after the primary care visit 1482  
in the clinic, by phone, or in the home if needed due to patient functional limitations. We utilize  1483  
several measures to help ensure follow -up. Each follow -up interview takes between 30 to 45 1484  
minutes and participants are reimbursed $25.  1485  
 
 67  1486  
Method of contact for follow -up surveys:  1487  
Upon enrollment, we ask participants to provide alternative phone numbers (e.g., cell or work 1488  
numbers)  and one to three additional phone numbers of  close contacts who may know how to 1489  
contact the patient in the event our study staff is unable to reach them. Many patients in safety 1490  
net settings are marginally house d, have intermit tent phone access, and may change locations 1491  
and phone numbers during the study period. We also ask participants if they prefer a text 1492  
message or an email to schedule follow -up visits and will use their preferred mode of 1493  
communication. If these oth er modes of communication fail , we send out reminder letters. If 1494  
needed, we also  attempt to contact patients during scheduled clinic visits or make home visits . 1495  
 1496  
Participant Appointment Reminder Sheet  1497  
We created an appointment reminder sheet as a reference for patient participants. This sheet 1498  
shows the dates and times for upcoming appointments that the patient participant will have with 1499  
us. 1500  
 1501  
Reminders for the primary care visit:  1502  
Participants receive a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their next primary c are visit. 1503  
Partici pants in the AD -only arm are reminded to come to their scheduled appointment while 1504  
participan ts in the PREPARE  arm are  reminded of their appointment and to bring the PREPARE 1505  
materials to the visit.  1506  
 1507  
Reminders for study interviews:  1508  
For all  follow -up interviews,  participants in both arms receive reminders of their upcoming study 1509  
interview by phone or in person. To help participants follow along during the interview, the 1510  
participant can receive a Participant Version of the survey via mail or email, as  1511  
 
 68 preferred. No survey responses or information are  collected by mail or email. We use  14-point 1512  
font and color -coded, standardized, large font response options to help with understanding.  1513  
 1514  
Participants who miss their primary care appointment : 1515  
Participants who cancel or miss their primary care appointments and do not reschedule within 1516  
30 days of  the cancelled appointment receive a courtesy phone call to remind participants to 1517  
reschedule the primary care appointments in order to move on with the study schedule.  For 1518  
participants who cancel or miss their primary care appointments after they have been  enrolled 1519  
and randomized:  1520  
 If they have rescheduled and attend their primary care appointment within 6 months from 1521  
when they were randomized, they recei ve a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their 1522  
primary  care appointment date. We conduct follow up assessments at 1 week, and at 3, 6, 1523  
and 12 months from this  primary care appointment date,  1524  
 If they do not reschedule or attend their primary care appoin tment within 6 months from 1525  
when they were randomized, they receive a brief reminder call one to 3 days before their 1526  
new primary  care appointment date. We conduct follow up assessments at 6 and 12 months 1527  
from the  originally scheduled primary care appointm ent date.  1528  
 1529  
Ascertaining reasons for loss of follow -up or withdrawal: For participants who want to 1530  
withdraw, we ask them why in open -ended questions. If they cannot provide an answer, we 1531  
prompt them from a list of reasons we obtained from prior advance care planning trials, such as 1532  
the study is too long, they are too busy, the study topic is too upsetting, they are too ill, etc.35  1533  
 1534  
MEASURES  1535  
Overview  1536  
 
 69 Because ACP ideally is a process that occurs over time, we felt it important to measure a full 1537  
range of ACP measures including ACP documentation (primary outcome)  over time , and 1538  
several behavior change constructs and several additional ACP actions over a 12 -month period 1539  
(secondary outcomes). All study measures  used in this analysis , including validity and reliability 1540  
information in English and Spanish and t he schedule of administration (i.e., baseline, 1 -week or 1541  
3, 6, or 12 -months), are included in the O utcome Measures table below . All outcomes, includ ing 1542  
secondary outcomes not used in our main analysis , are included in our published protocol.36 1543  
The main outcome measures are described in detail below.  1544  
 1545  
Primary Outcome  1546  
The primary outcome is new documentation of ACP wishes in the Z SFG/SFHN medical record 1547  
(Table of Outcome Measures below ). ACP documentation for the purposes of this study 1548  
includes the easy -to-read advance directive or other valid advance directives or living wills, a 1549  
durable power  of attorney for health care document (DPOAHC), a Physicians Orders of Life 1550  
Sustaining Treatment form, or other documentation of discussions concerning patients ’ wishes 1551  
for medical care (i.e., documentation of oral directives by a physician  or notes describing 1552  
patients ’ goals for medical care by clinicians ).  1553  
 1554  
We assess baseline and 15 -month new ACP documentation rates and the date of 1555  
documentation to determine the length of time from study enrollment to subsequent 1556  
documentation.  Patients in our stud y are enrolled, randomized , and exposed to the intervention 1557  
1 to 3 weeks prior to a primary care ap pointment. ACP documentation is  timed to the date of 1558  
intervention exposure as patients may have engaged in ACP prior to seeing their primary care 1559  
provider. T he patient -reported outcomes in the follow -up surveys (1 week, 3, 6, and 12 -months), 1560  
however, are  timed to the primary care visit b ecause those questions concern  engagement in 1561  
discussions with clinicians (see secondary outcomes below) . This same  timeframe for ACP 1562  
 
 70 documentation was determined from a prior PREPARE trial conducted within the VA to take into 1563  
account and to standardize the expected time from intervention exposure to the primary care 1564  
visit and t he anticipated time to schedule  and complete the fin al patient interview.35  1565  
 1566  
Because legal forms and documented  discussions can be used to direct medical care, we 1567  
created a composite variable of any ACP documentation (forms  and/or discussions) ; we also 1568  
plan to report the percentage of forms and discussions separately . All medical review data is 1569  
double  coded  by 2 independent , blinded  research  assistants. Discrepancies  are adjudicated by 1570  
the principal investigator (R.L.S.).  1571  
 1572  
Secondary  Outcomes  1573  
Main Patient -Reported Outcome  1574  
The main pati ent-reported secondary outcome, the validated Advance Care Planning 1575  
Engagement Survey,27,28,37 was chosen to meas ure the full process of ACP. The Advance Care 1576  
Planning Engagement Survey  measures both  ACP Behavior Change P rocesses, such as 1577  
knowledge, contemplation, self -efficacy, and readiness  on a validated 57 -item scale . The ACP 1578  
Behavior Change Process scale is meas ured on a 5 -point Likert scale and average 5 -point 1579  
scores will be calculated. We will also measure ACP actions  on the validated 25-item Action 1580  
scale , which assesses  ACP activities (yes or no) such as identifying a surrogate decision maker, 1581  
identifying values and goals for medical care, choosing the level of leeway in surrogate decision 1582  
making, discussing one’s wishes with clinicians and surrogates, and documenting one’s wishes  1583  
in an advance directive .  Validity and reliability of the ACP Engagement Survey, as well as the 1584  
questionnaire’s ability to detect change in response to an ACP intervention, have been 1585  
previously described.27,28,37  1586  
 1587  
Feasibility and Satisfaction  1588  
 
 71 To evaluate whether and how PREPARE will be used in clinical practice and in the community, 1589  
we also assess acceptability of the PREPARE website compared to an advance directive alone 1590  
using validated scales of ease -of-use (10 -point scale , “On a scale of 1 t o 10, with 1 being very 1591  
hard and 10 being very easy, how easy was it to use this guide?” ) and satisfaction (comfort: 1592  
“How comfortable were you viewing this guide?”, helpfulness: “How helpful was this guide? ”, 1593  
and recommendations: “How likely are you to rec ommend this guide to others?” assessed on a 1594  
5-point Likert scale (not -at-all to extremely)  from our prior work.8 For the PREPARE arm only, 1595  
and at the end of the 12 -month interview and after unblinding, we also ask how likely patients 1596  
are to recommend the PREPARE intervention to others.72 1597  
 1598  
Clinical and Patient -Advisory Board Requested Outcome  1599  
Our Patient -Advisory Stakeholders requested we quantify the number and percentage of 1600  
patients who increased their ACP activities overtime. Our stakeholders perceive any increase in 1601  
an ACP activity over time as clinically meaningful. Thus, in addition to mean change in ACP 1602  
Engagement scores, they wanted to know the percent of patients who improved (i.e., had an 1603  
estimated slope > 0) over time for both Behavior Change scores , Actions scores, and both 1604  
combined. We therefore created this exploratory variable post -hoc. 1605  
 1606  
Adverse Event  Outcomes  1607  
In addition, to ensure that the PREPARE program doe s not cause undue harm, we also assess 1608  
both depression73,74 and anxiety .75,76 We measure depression using the validated Patient Health 1609  
Questionnaire (PHQ) -8 (scores 0 -24) and anxiety Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) -7 1610  
(scores 0 -21) at baseline and each follow -up.74,75 Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, 1611  
moderate, moderately severe and severe depression or anxiety.   1612  
 1613  
Potential Mediating or Moderating Variables & Participant Characteristics  1614  
 
 72 Based on the previously published conceptual framework of PREPARE,27 we also hypothesize 1615  
that PREPARE efficacy may vary across several moderator or mediator variables (e.g., health 1616  
literacy using the validated Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults s -TOFHLA, 1617  
scores 0 -3677 and dichotomized to limited = 0 -22 & adequate = 23 -36; clinician -patient language 1618  
concordance (concordant versus discordant); and patient’s desired role in decision making with 1619  
the medical provider using the validated Decision Control Preferences Scale(wants to make 1620  
their own decision versus  wants doctors/family to make decisions for them).78 We also 1621  
hypothesize that PREPARE effic acy may be affected by several confounding variables (e.g., 1622  
self-rated health, “ How would you rate your health?” [5 -point Likert]79,80 dichotomized as fair -to- 1623  
poor and good -to-excellent and past experiences with ACP including prior documentation of 1624  
legal forms and documented discussions. We will also  assess a full range of patient -reported 1625  
characteristics, as these factors may impact patient -clinician communication,20,81 such as age 1626  
(“What is your date of birth?”), self -reported gender (“What gender do you consider yourself to 1627  
be? male, female transgender, other”), finances (able to make ends meet versus not make ends 1628  
meet), having a potential surrogate de cision maker or not, education (“What is the highest 1629  
educational level you have completed?” less than or equal to high school or greater than high 1630  
school), internet access in the home (yes or no), and religiosity and spirituality (i.e., “How 1631  
religious/spir itual do you consider yourself to be?” on 5 -point Likert scale from not -at-all to 1632  
extremely).  1633

 77 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  1648  
Our primary analyses will compare change in ACP documentation between study arms from 1649  
baseline to 15 months. Secondary outcomes will include ACP Engagement with respect to 5 1650  
ACP Actions (yes/no and a 0-25-point  scale) and behavio r change scores (average 5 -point 1651  
Likert scores) from baseline to 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months. Variables will be assessed for 1652  
distributional and outlier values using standard summary statistics. Baseline comparability will 1653  
be assessed between groups usi ng unpaired t -tests, Chi -square tests or Fisher’s exact tests. 1654  
Using t -tests or Chi -squared tests, we will al so compare patient’s age and self -reported  gender 1655  
between those who refused versus those who enrolled and differences between arms of those 1656  
who withdrew versus those who did not.  We will use intention -to-treat analysis using SAS 1657  
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and STATA 15.0 (College Station, TX). All p -values will be 2 - 1658  
tailed and set at .05 for the primary outcome and Bonferroni adjusted for se condary patient - 1659  
reported outcomes. In addition, because of differences in ACP engagement among English and 1660  
Spanish speakers,8 and based on prefe rences of our stakeholders and granting agencies, we 1661  
decided, a priori , to analyze our results overall and stratified by English and Spanish language. 1662  
To compare outcomes between the two arms longitudinally, we will use mixed effects linear, 1663  
Poisson, or ne gative binomial regression for continuous measures and mixed effects logistic 1664  
regression for dichotomous measures. The mixed effects models will include fixed effects for the 1665  
primary modeling terms of time (baseline and 15 months for ACP documentation and baseline 1666  
and 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months for ACP Engagement with time modeled using 1667  
dummy variables to allow for non -linearity); arm (AD -only versus PREPARE ); an interaction 1668  
term of study arm and time; and a random effect for subjects. We wil l adjust for the 1669  
randomization blocking factors limited vs. adequate literacy,98 and any predictor variables that 1670  
differ between arms. All models also will also be adjusted for  baseline ACP documentation and 1671  
will include random physician inte rcepts to account for nesting of patients within physicians . We 1672  
will use standardized, clinically meaningful effect sizes (i.e., 0.20 -0.49 small, 0.50 -0.79 medium, 1673  
 
 78 and ≥0.80 large).99 Per stakeholder request, we will conduct post -hoc mixed -effects regression 1674  
to calculate the percentage of participants who increased their Behavior Change sco re, Action 1675  
scores, or both Behavior Change and Action scores from baseline (i.e., estimated slope > 0) by 1676  
study arm; p -values adjusted to a significance of 0.017.  1677  
 1678  
For moderator analysis, we will test for interactions by adding interaction terms to the gr oup by 1679  
time variable for health literacy (limited versus adequate) controlling for prior ACP 1680  
documentation and clustering effects by clinician. All other interaction terms are adjusted for 1681  
health literacy (randomization blocking variable) prior ACP documen tation and clustering effects 1682  
by clinician. Additional interaction terms to be added to the group by time variable include  1683  
language (i.e., English versus Spanish), control preferences for decision making (i.e., makes 1684  
own decisions versus doctor makes decisions ), age (i.e., < 65 years versus 65 years of age), 1685  
sex/gender (i.e., self -reported man versus woman), race/ethnicity (i.e., white versus non -white), 1686  
health status (i.e., good -to-excellent versus fair -to-poor), presence of a potential surrogate (i. e., 1687  
yes versus no), internet access at home (i.e., yes versus no), and, for Spanish -speakers, 1688  
patient -clinician language (concordance vs. discordance). A p -value f or interaction <0.05 is  1689  
considered significant.    1690  
 1691  
Missing data for the primary outcome will  be assessed. If there is 10% or more  of missing data , 1692  
we will use a mean imputation approach . All available data will be included in mixed -effects 1693  
models. We will assess whether any research staff member became unblinded during follow -up 1694  
assessment and co nduct sensitivity analysis as needed.  1695  
 1696  
SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATIONS  1697  
We will measure a full range of ACP behaviors including discussions. However, written advance 1698  
directive completion of legal forms is a primary outcome and is the most well -studied.100  Power 1699  
 
 79 from longitudinal analyses with repeated measures will be stronger, but to be conservative, we 1700  
consider power for a single post -intervention time  point (e.g., 15  mont hs). A recent meta - 1701  
analysis of written advance directive documentation studies demonstrated a pooled effect size 1702  
of 0.50 (95% CI; 0.17 -0.83),100 as did an RCT of an ACP workboo k that included both behavior 1703  
change constructs and a social work visit,101 and our prior RCT of an easy -to-read AD at ZSFG 1704  
which showed an increased AD completion rate from 7% to 15%.8  Because both the 1705  
intervention and control arm will receive the easy -to-read advance directive, we assume that 1706  
both arms will have an advance directive completion rate of ≤ 15%. Based on prior studies, we 1707  
assume PREPARE will result in additional benefit of advance directive completion with a 1708  
minimum effect size of 0.5 (two -fold increase) above 15%. A sample of 350, (175 per arm), will 1709  
afford us 92% power (2 -tailed alpha of 0.05) to dete ct a difference of advance directive 1710  
completion rates of 15% in controls vs. 30% in the PREPARE arm and 80% power to detect a 1711  
difference of 15% vs. 27%. Power is also expected to be strong for the ACP behavioral change 1712  
scale outcomes (preliminary data demo nstrated a pre -to-post improvement of 0.5 SD).27 With a 1713  
conservative assumption that controls will improve by 0.1 to 0.2 SD, we will have 85% to 98% 1714  
power, respectively, to conclude that the improvement is better in the PREPARE arm.  We 1715  
expect a 15% drop out rate at 12 months based on our prior randomiz ed, controlled trial at 1716  
ZSFG,8 and will therefore attempt to recruit 402 patients, or 201 in each arm for each language 1717  
(English and Spanish) for  a total recruitment of 804 patients.  1718  
 1719  
Our sample size will also allow adequate power to detect clinically important interactions based 1720  
on potential moderators (literacy, control preferences, language concordance) for our outcomes. 1721  
In a prior trial of an easy -to-read advance directive in the same patient population with only 200 1722  
patients, we found significant interactions for literacy.8 Thus, if we consider the power scenario 1723  
of the control group ACP documentation rate of 15% and the PREPARE group of 28%, and 1724  
suppose the control group rate is the same (15%) for both levels of the moderating factor, then 1725  
 
 80 for a moderating factor split of 1:1, we would have 80% power to detect an interaction. If the 1726  
PREPARE arm ACP documentation rate is  18% for one level of th e factor and 40% for the 1727  
other, this corresponds to a relative rate of ACP documentation of 2.2 times as high for one 1728  
level of the factor compared to the other. A 2:1 split of the moderating factor still allows 1729  
detection of a 2.4 -fold increase in the relat ive rate of documentation. Power to detect 1730  
interactions will likely be stronger for continuous outcomes (e.g. engagement/behavioral scales).  1731  
 1732  
ETHICS AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES  1733  
This study is approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) (IRB reference 1734  
#13-10847).  This study is guided by a Patient -Clinical Stakeholder Advisory B oard that is 1735  
comprised of patients and patient advocates (including native Spanish -speakers), surrogates, 1736  
and ZSFG/SFHN  primary care clinic staff and medical directors. It is also guided by a DSMB  1737  
consisting of 4 experts in randomized trials, human subjects research and consent, vulnerable 1738  
populations, palliative care, advance care planning, and biostatistics. Both advisor y groups  1739  
reviewed and approved all study protocols and related materials. In addition, we continue to 1740  
meet with both groups every 4 -6 months to review the progress of the trial, make suggestions 1741  
for recruitment, review any potentially adverse events, and e nsure that we are following our 1742  
study protocols in a way that protects vulnerable patient populations.  1743  
 1744  
HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  1745  
Protection of the rights and welfare of participants:   1746  
All study staff are required to take annual training regarding the rights and protections of 1747  
research participants. Additionally, weekly study team meetings will ensure that all study staff 1748  
are following the research protocol and that all study participants are consented according to 1749  
our study protocol.  1750  
 1751  
 
 81 Furthermore, our consent process ensures that study participants have a clear understanding of 1752  
the study and understand that they can choose to not participate in the study at any point in 1753  
time, and that the care they receive will not be affected by declining to participat e in our study. 1754  
Our consent process involves using a consent form written below a 6th -grade reading level, 1755  
reading the form to potential subjects verbatim, allowing time for questions and discussion, and 1756  
then assessing comprehension using teach -to-goal. If questions are not answered correctly, 1757  
repeated education and reassessment of comprehension are continued until complete 1758  
comprehension is achieved. If subjects take more than three passes through the 1759  
comprehension assessment, formal assessment for cognitiv e impairment will be completed. If 1760  
patients are found to be cog nitively impaired, they are excluded from the study. If they are not 1761  
cognitively impaired, we will re -do teach back once more, after which the participant will be 1762  
deemed ineligible for the stud y if they are unable to demonstrate comprehension of the study.  1763  
 1764  
Additionally, we include UCSF Clinical Research Office contact information on all consent forms 1765  
as required for all non -biomedical studies.   1766  
 1767  
Steps taken to minimize risks to subjects:  1768  
We hav e developed a modified research consent process that has been shown to be successful 1769  
in vulnerable patient populations  as described above .29 All study fliers, consent forms,  and 1770  
questionnaires are  read to the subjects in their entirety  by native English - and Spanish -speaking 1771  
research staff . Participants are reminded that they can opt out of the study at any time.  All study 1772  
materials are in an easy -to-read (5th grade reading level, large 14 -point font) format. The 1773  
consent materials and the study interviews are conducted in the language the participant is 1774  
most  comfortable speaking (English or Spanish).  1775  
  1776  
 
 82 This study will employ research assistants who are fluent in English or Spanish. Only fluent 1777  
research assistants will be in contact and will communicate with Spanish -speaking participants. 1778  
We will also ensure t hat all study materials are accurately translated into Spanish by having 1779  
them initially translated from English to Spanish by native Spanish - speakers. We will then have 1780  
them back translated into English to ensure accuracy. Finally, we will have the final translated 1781  
documents reviewed for accuracy by third  party native Spanish - speakers.  To help participants 1782  
follow along during the interview, they may review a  large font Participant Version of the survey 1783  
at baseline and all follow -ups that can be reviewed while the research assistant is asking 1784  
research questions verbatim. We use 14 -point font and color -coded, standardized, large font 1785  
response options to help wi th understanding.  1786  
 1787  
Data security:  1788  
- Data are stored securely in the encrypted, secure UCSF My Research  environment  1789  
- Data are coded; data key is kept separately and securely  1790  
- Data are kept in a locked file cabinet  1791  
- Data are kept in a locked office or sui te  1792  
- Electronic data are protected with a password  1793  
- Data are stored on a secure network   1794  
- Data are collected/stored using REDCap or REDCap Survey  1795  
 1796  
Measures to ensure  confidentiality and protect identifiers from improper disclosure  1797  
Risks to subjects are minimal and may include loss of confidentiality and psychological 1798  
discomfort about discussing end -of-life issues. Subjects are assured that their answers to study 1799  
questions will not be directly linked to their names. Instead, any identifying information is coded 1800  
and separated from the data. The identifying information will only be known to the primary 1801  
investigators but will not b e used in data analysis. In addition, signed consent forms are kept in 1802  
 
 83 locked file cabinets and kept separate from the data collection instruments. Study subjects are 1803  
also reminded that the information obtained will not be shared with their providers excep t in non - 1804  
identifying aggregate form a t the end of the study. We also make clear that the responses to the 1805  
PREPARE guide are only for research purposes and will not be shared with their clinicians or 1806  
put in their medical record.  1807  
 1808  
We will store all study mat erials in locked offices and locked storage cabinets. We will utilize 1809  
UCSF MyResearch and REDCap to enter and maintain data in a secure environment. In order 1810  
to be more environmentally -conscious, we will attempt to use the LiveCapture function of 1811  
RedCap an d thus reduce the use of paper resources. We will retain the use of paper surveys in 1812  
case the RedCap system is down. These paper files are stored in secure, locked research 1813  
offices in secure, locked file cabinets.  1814  
 1815  
As some of the questions concerning end -of-life may cause psychological discomfort for some 1816  
study subjects, subjects are reminded at the beginning of the interview of their right to refuse to 1817  
answer any and all questions and their right to terminate the interview at any time. We will also 1818  
reassu re subjects that if they choose not to be in the study or choose to terminate the interview, 1819  
it will not change the medical care that they normally receive from their clinic or their clinician. In 1820  
addition, we will reiterate that the information shared wit hin the research interview will not be 1821  
shared with their clinicians or used in medical care. However, subjects can take home a copy of 1822  
the PREPARE guide with them and bring it back to their clinicians if they wish. Subjects are 1823  
given the name and number of  the primary investigator and may call if they have questions or 1824  
are concerned about their participation in the study.  1825  
 1826  
Required reportable information:  1827  
 
 84 As these interviews may be completed in people’s home and , in the interviews , we are asking 1828  
patients to  describe their experiences and opinions, it is possible that reportable events such as 1829  
elder abuse, suicidal or homicidal ideation may be detected. If they are detected , they will be 1830  
handled according to the American Psychological Association code of ethi cs. If elder abuse is 1831  
suspected , the participant will be encouraged to take steps to ensure their safety. They will be 1832  
offered contact information for local supportive services and informed that the concerns will be 1833  
discussed with the elder abuse hotline f or assistance. When there are concerns about self -harm 1834  
or harm to others, severity of harm will be assessed. Participants will be offered local support 1835  
services and officials will be notified as necessary.  1836  
 1837  
Patient Depression /Anxiety  Protocols  1838  
With input from the Patient -Clinician Stakeholder Adviso ry Board, and to err on the side of 1839  
caution, we created a flow diagram with detailed instructions, including study scripts  and contact 1840  
names  and telephon e numbers  for research staff to use in the event scored in the moderately 1841  
severe depression or anxiety range on the PHQ -8 and GAD -7 or a participant expressed suicide 1842  
ideation . 1843  
  1844  
DATA SAFETY MONITORITY PLAN  1845  
Monitoring will focus on recruitment, baseline comparability of treatment groups, protocol 1846  
adherence, completeness of data, accrual of primary endpoint data, safety, and follow -up rates. 1847  
This monitoring will provide the basis for monthly review by the study investigators, review by  1848  
the ZSFG  Patient -Clinician Advisory Committee, and Data Safety and Monitori ng Board 1849  
(DSMB), and yearly reporting to our IRBs. We will implement methods of verifying entered data 1850  
and of quality control. All study  materials data are kept on secure, password -protected, 1851  
encrypted servers. All consent materials and any  identifying inf ormation are kept in locked 1852  
cabinets within locked offices, on password -protected, encrypted  servers, on car d-key protected 1853  
 
 85 research floors. Dr. Sudore, will  be directly responsible for identifying and immediately reporting 1854  
all adverse events to the IRBs P rivacy Officers,  and funding  agency as appropriate. The ZSFG  1855  
Patient -Clinician Advisory Committee will ensure participant safety in  the clinic and will meet up 1856  
to 4 times per year. The formal DSMB includes 4 experts in randomized trials, human subjects 1857  
research and consent, vulnerable populations, palliative care, advance care planning, and 1858  
biostatistics. The DSMB w ill review and approve the research protocol and plans for data and 1859  
safety monitoring; and  assess data quality; participant recruitment, accrual  and retention; 1860  
baseline comparability of treatment groups,  accrual of primary endpoints; and participant safety 1861  
(e.g., adverse events, protocol violations). They will also  develop stopping rules for the trial. The 1862  
DSMB will meet up to 4 times per year.  1863  
 1864  
CHARTER OF DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  1865  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the National 1866  
Institute of Aging (NIA) Director to monitor participant safety, data quality and evaluate the 1867  
progress of the study. Dr. Su dore, University of California, San Francisco is conducting the 1868  
"Improving Advance Care Planning by Preparing Diverse Seniors for Decision Making " study 1869  
under a R01 funded by the National Institute of Aging. The DSMB for this study includes 2 1870  
outside clini cians with expertise in RCTs and an outside biostatistician. The NIA program officer 1871  
is also included. The DSMB will review and approve the research protocol and plans for data 1872  
and safety monitoring; and assess data quality; participant recruitment, accrua l and retention; 1873  
baseline comparability of treatment groups, accrual of primary endpoints; and participant safety 1874  
(e.g., adverse events, protocol violations). They will also develop stopping rules for the trial. The 1875  
DSMB will meet 2 and up to 4 times per y ear. 1876  
 1877  
DSMB Responsibilities  1878

Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Wiley has extensive 1918  
experience with RCTs and working with safety net populations. Although Dr. Wiley is at 1919  
UCSF, he does not otherwise work with Dr. Sudore. Membership have no financial, 1920  
scientific, or other conflict of interest with the trial.  1921  
 1922  
Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest has been obtained.  1923  
 1924  
Dr. Nathan Goldstein , Mount Sinai School of Medicine, has been appointed by NIA to serve as 1925  
the Chairperson and i s responsible for overseeing the meetings, developing the agenda in 1926  
consultation with the NIA Program Official and the Principal Investigator. The Chair is the 1927  
 
 88 contact person for the DSMB. The University of California, San Francisco shall provide the 1928  
logistical management and support of the DSMB. Dr. Nathan Goldstein is also the safety officer 1929  
and contact person for serious adverse event reporting. A log of all potential adverse events and 1930  
protocol violations will be kept and reviewed quarterly by the DSMB.  Procedures for notifying 1931  
the Chair of the DSMB and the NIA Program Official will be discussed and agreed upon at the 1932  
first meeting.  1933  
 1934  
Board Process  1935  
At the first meeting the DSMB will discuss the protocol, suggest modifications, and establish 1936  
guidelines to study monitoring by the Board. The DSMB Chairperson in consultation with the 1937  
Principal Investigator and the NIA Program Official will prepare the ag enda to address the 1938  
review of study materials, modifications to the study protocol and informed consent document, 1939  
initiation of the trial, appointment of a safety officer, as needed, reporting of adverse events, 1940  
statistical analysis plan including interim analysis and stopping rules, etc.  1941  
 1942  
Meetings of the DSMB will be held 2-4 times per year at the call of the Chairperson and / or NIA 1943  
Program Official  to ensure patient safety and to review stopping rules for the trial . The NIA 1944  
Program Official or designee will attend most of the meetings. An emergency meeting of the 1945  
DSMB may be called at any time by the Chair or by the NIA should participant safety questions 1946  
or other unanticipated problems arise.  1947  
 1948  
Meetings are closed to the public because discussions may ad dress confidential participant 1949  
data. Meetings are attended by the Principal Investigator and members of his/her  staff. 1950  
Meetings may be convened as conference calls as well as in -person.   1951  
 1952  
Meeting Format  1953  
 
 89 Each meeting must include a recommendation to contin ue or to terminate the study and 1954  
whether the DSMB has any concerns about participant safety made by a formal DSMB majority 1955  
or unanimous vote. Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, the full 1956  
vote of the DSMB is required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote will rule and a minority 1957  
report should be appended. The DSMB Chair provides the tiebreaking vote in the event of a 50 - 1958  
50 split vote.  1959  
 1960  
A recommendation to terminate the study may be made by the DSMB at any time by majority 1961  
vote. The Chair should provide such a recommendation to the NIA immediately by telephone 1962  
and email. After the NIA Director makes a decision about whether to accept or decline the 1963  
DSMB recommendation to terminate the study, the PI is immediately informed ab out his 1964  
decision.  1965  
 1966  
Meeting Materials   1967  
DSMB interim report templates will be prepared by the study staff, to be reviewed by the DSMB 1968  
members at each meeting.  The reports will list the study aims, the status of the study, and 1969  
summarize safety data.  1970  
 1971  
Reports  from the DSMB  1972  
A formal report containing the recommendations for continuat ion or modifications of the study 1973  
will be prepared by the DSMB Chairperson, NIA Program Official or its designee. The draft 1974  
report will be sent to the DSMB members for review and approval.  1975  
 1976

 91 Summary of Changes  to the Protocol : The listed topics follow the outline and headers of the protocol  1999  
Topic  Date  Summary of Changes  
Funding  Feb 3 , 2014  We obtained funding from the  National Institute on Aging  (R01AG045043) to start 
recruitment of English -speakers. We then also obtained Patient -Centered Outcomes 
Research Institute ( PCORI) funding (R -1306 -01500 ) to add Spanish -speakers to our 
established t rial infrastructure and protocol.  
Funding  Mar 8, 2017  Dr. Sudore became funded, in part, by a NIA K24 (K24AG054415).  
ClinicalTrials.gov 
registration  Feb 27, 2014  When PCORI funding was obtained, PCORI required a separate Clinical.Trial.gov 
number. Thus, it was added in February 2014.  Altho ugh English - and Spanish -speaking  
recruitment was supported by two funders, this was one trial with the same staff, 
locations, procedures, IRB, and protocol.36  
Background  Apr, 2016  We updated the background to included updated references.  
Preliminary Studies  May, 2017  We updated the preliminary studies to include the findings from our published VA trial.  
The name of hospital was changed on May 3rd, 2015 from SFGH to Zuckerberg San 
Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG). This change was made throughout the protocol.  
Overview of Trial  Jan 4, 2016  We updated the protocol to include our study flow diagram for our  records . 
Eligibility screening  Jan 16, 2014  Eligibility screening in busy, loud, outpatient clinics was often difficult. With our patient -
clinicians stakeholders, we decided to include the ability  to recruit and screen by phone.  
See below under recruitme nt. 
Exclusion criteria  Jul 15, 2014  To minimize potential contamination, we excluded participants who may have been 
exposed to the PREPARE website from other sources such as being in a PREPARE -
related focus group or pilot study.  
Exclusion criteria  Oct 3, 2014  To ensure the safety of our research staff, we excluded potential participants with  
evidence of active drug or alcohol abuse within the past 3 months determined by 
clinician assessment, self -report, chart review or research staff assessment.  
Exclu sion criteria  Jan 16, 2014  To minimize the risk of unblinding by fellow research participants, any spouse/partner of 
a currently enrolled patient or an individual who is named as an enrolled patient’s 
potential surrogate decision maker (regardless of cohab itation or spousal status), who is 
also a patient at SFHN /ZFG  will be excluded from being a patient participant. This will 
avoid a situation where 2 closely related people living in the same home could be 
randomized to different study arms and result in unblinding.  
 
 92 Exclusion criteria  Jan 27 , 2014  To save research staff considerable time and effort, potential participants who initially 
scheduled but then missed the baseline interview (i.e. no show) more than 2 times 
without prior notification and reschedu ling with study staff will be considered ineligible, 
unless there were significant extenuating circumstances.  
Spanish Translation  Nov 13, 2014  All translated and back -translated study materials were approved by the UCSF IRB.  
Recruitment methods  Nov 13, 2013  We initially sent opt -out letters to potential participants. However, many SFHN /ZSFG  
patients are marginally housed, had incorrect mailing addresses, or have limited literacy. 
We also discovered that many patients were confusing the opt -out letters fo r bills from 
the hospital. With input from our Patient -Advisory Board and DSMB, we switched to 
more engaging recruitment letters and postcards that allowed patients to call and hear 
more about the study or to opt -out. They could also opt -out at any time.  
Recruitment methods  Jan 16 , 2014  It was determined by our patient -clinician stakeholders that it would be acceptable to 
recruit patients by phone in addition to in clinic recruitment. In addition, because we 
were attempting to enroll patients 1 -3 weeks pri or to a primary care visit, it was pr oving 
difficult to approach patients in clinic ahead of their primary care appointments. In 
addition, our primary care stakeholders felt it would be better for their clinic workflow to 
not have research staff always in the clinic. Therefore, we expanded our recruitment 
options, after receiving permission from the clinician and sending recruitment letters, to 
both approach potential participants in clinic as well as recruit by phone.  
Recruitment -
reimbursement  Jan 16, 20 14 We initially reimbursed $25 separately for the screening interview and $25 for the 
baseline interview that included intervention exposure. We realized that the screening 
interview was brief and often occurred over the phone  because it was  difficult to c onduct 
in busy clinic settings. We also realized, in collaboration with our patient -clinician 
advisory board, that it made more sense to reimburse participants for $50 for the 
baseline interview since these interviews were longer and in our study offices. We also 
changed from taxi vouchers to municipal transportation tokens because of the increased 
surcharge associated with taxi vouchers and participant preference.  
Consent forms  Jan 27, 2014  For staff safety and the need to exclude or withdraw participants  who were intoxicated, 
psychotic, or threatening, the consent also explains, “We also may ask you to stop 
taking part in this study if we feel it is in your best interest or if you do not follow the 
study rules.”  
Consent forms  Jan 27, 2014  Clinicians nee ded to be contacted if their patient reported severe depression or anxiety. 
We updated our consent forms to fully explain this to participants:  
 
 93 “We would need to contact your regular doctor or a medical provider for the following 
reasons: -You report or we  observe that you are having :  
 A medical emergency such as a serious medical illness  
 Or, a serious mental illness, such as major depression  
 You report that you may harm yourself, you may harm someone else, or 
someone is harming you  
Randomization  Jan 16, 2014  The initial IRB application was a Just -in-time submission for an NIH proposal. We 
initially planned to block randomize, as we did for a recent VA trial,35 by both health 
literacy and race/ethnicity. However, given the diversity of patients at SFHN /ZSFG  (over 
50% non -white), in comparison to the VA, we decided to only block randomize by health 
literacy.  
Data Collection 
Methods  Jan 16, 2014  To be more environmentally -conscious, we switched from paper surveys to use the 
LiveCapture function of RedCap. We  retained the use of paper surveys in the event the 
RedCap system was down. All paper files continued to be stored in secure, locked 
research offices in secure, locked file cabinets.  
Follow -up & Retention  May 28, 2014  We created an appointment reminder sh eet to show the dates and times for upcoming 
primary care appointments as well as upcoming study appointments to help with 
retention.  
Follow -up & Retention  Jan 16, 2014  We expanded the options for follow -up interviews to be not only in the clinic or by 
phone, but also in the home if needed as many of our patients had functional limitations.  
Follow -up & Retention  
 Jul 15, 2014  For all participants who missed their primar y care appointment and did not reschedule, 
we provided a courtesy phone call to remind participants to reschedule the primary care 
appointment.  
Follow -up & Retention  
 Jul 15, 2014  Patients were enrolled based on upcoming primary care appointments. All fol low-up 
interviews were timed to this primary care appointment. Some primary care 
appointment s were subsequently missed or cancelled . In consultation with our 
stakehol der advisory committee and the DSMB, we decided that for  participants who 
reschedule and attend their primary care appointment within 6 months , we would  still 
conduct interviews at 1 week, and at 3, 6, and 12 months from the primary care 
appointment date.  If participants  do not reschedule within 6 months , we will conduct 
follow up assessments at 6 and 12 months from the primary care appointment date.  
 
 94 Follow -up and Retention  Jan 16, 2014  All data capture was by ve rbal survey administration and many of our follow -up 
interviews occurred over the phone. T o help par ticipants follow along during the 
interview, we mailed out a Participant Version of the survey to be used during the phone 
call if desired. No data were collected by mail.  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Jan 4, 2016  We created a table displaying all study  oucome  measures, including validity and 
reliability information in both English and Spanish, number of survey items, references 
and the schedule of administration for our records and protocol.  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Mar 12, 2013  Correction : A priori , we planned to collect ACP documentation  data at 15 -months (not 
12 months  as stated in our original and published protocol ) to mirror the methods used 
in our previously published trial of PREPARE in the VA setting.35  We fixed this  typo in 
our final  protocol. From the prior VA trial,35 it was estimated that the  time from the 
intervention to the primary care visit and the average time to schedule and conduct the 
final patient interview  would be 3 months. Therefore, we s tandardize d this window for all 
participants  in this and our prior published trial .35    
Measures & Data 
Collection  Jan 16, 2014  We initially proposed to screen for depression and anxiety using the -Patient Health 
Questionnaire -2 item (PHQ -2) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder -2 item (GAD -2). 
Our DSMB felt more precise versions of this survey should be used. Therefore, we 
updated o ur methods to reflect assessment of depression and anxiety using the Patient 
Health Questionnaire -8 item (PHQ -8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 item (GAD -7).  
Measures & Data 
Collection  Sept 20 , 2017  Our Patient -Advisory Stakeholders requested we quan tify the number and percentage of 
patients who increased their ACP activities overtime. Our stakeholders perceive any 
increase in an ACP activity over time as clinically meaningful. Thus, in addition to mean 
change in ACP Engagement scores, they wanted to know the percent of patients who 
improved over time for Behavior Change scores, Actions scores, and both combined. 
We defined improvement as an estimated overall slope > 0. Therefore, we created this 
exploratory variable post -hoc and used Bonferroni corrections to set the p -value of 
significance at 0.017.  
Human Subjects 
Protections  May 28, 2014  Because we were assessing depression and anxiety as part of the trial, to err on the 
side of caution, the Patient -Clinician  Stakeholder Advisory Board helped  us create a 
flow diagram with detailed instructions,  scripts , and telephone numbe rs for how  staff 
could refer participants who report  severe depression/anxiety if that were to occur. As 
above, this potential disclosure of participant information was provid ed on the informed 
consent form.  
 
 95 Summary of Changes to the Statistical Analysis Plan  2000  
 2001  
Topic  Date  Summary of Changes  
Refusals & withdrawal  
comparisons  Sep 30, 2016  We added a description of our planned analysis to compare participants who refused 
based on age and self -reported gender. We also added a description of our planned 
analysis to compare reasons for withdrawal between study arms.  
Bonferroni corrections  Sep 30, 2017  We added Bonferroni adjusted p -values for all secondary and exploratory outcomes . 
Stratifying results by 
language  Mar 1, 2014  Our PCORI grant was funded on Mar 1st, 2014 and allowed us to add Spanish -
speaking participants to the trial. A priori and based on prior literature and the 
preferences of our stakeholders  and grant funders, w e added information about  
stratify ing our analysis based on English and Spanish -speaking participants.  
Models  Sep 30, 2016  We explain more fully the modeling terms in the mixed effects models.  
Variable added to 
adjusted models  Sep 30, 2016  In addition to health literacy and clustering by clinician, we also adjusted all mixed 
effects models for baseline ACP documentation because, in consultation with our 
stakeholders, it was felt that these patients may be different from ACP naïve 
participants.  This als o mirrors the analysis in the prior VA PREPARE trial .35  
Effect Size Definitions  Sep 30, 2016  We add ed information and references concerning clinically meaningful effect sizes.  
Exploratory Outcome  Sep 30, 2016  Based on stakeholder request, we included a description of an added exploratory 
outcome to calculate the percentage of participants who increased  their ACP 
Engagement scores. Bonferroni adjusted p -values for this post -hoc analysis were 
adjusted to a significance level of 0.017.  
Interactions  Sep 30, 2016  We more clearly defined the variables used to test for interactions and how these 
variables wer e dichotomized for analysis.

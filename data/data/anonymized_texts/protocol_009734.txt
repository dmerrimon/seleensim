Study Population:  Subjects newly or recently diagnosed with PDR, with or without  
DME  
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled 
study to evaluate the effects of emixustat in subjects with PDR . 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one the following treatment 
arms in a 1:1 ratio: 
• Emixustat, up to 40 mg (step- up tit ration)  
• Placebo  
Subjects will be treated once daily (QD) , in the evening, for a total of 
84 days . Subjects assigned to the emixustat arm will receive 5 mg QD 
oral emixustat for the first week, then the dose will be doubled on a 
weekly basis to 10 mg QD  (week 2), 20 mg QD (week 3), and 40 mg 
QD (week 4). Subjects who do not tolerate dose escalations will be returned to and held stable at the last tolerated dose; after week 4, all 
subjects will be held at a stable dose for the remainder of the study. 
Dose red uction may be undertaken only once and is only available at 
Visit 4, Visit 5, or Visit 6.  
Subjects in the placebo group will be mock -titrated on the same 
schedule as those in the step -up titration arm.  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 20 subjects from up to 7 clinical sites  in the United 
States will be enrolled.

Study Eye 
Determination: The study eye will be determined as the eye that meets all of the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
If both eyes qualify, the investigator should select the study eye as the 
eye with the least potential to req uire PRP, anti -VEGF therapy, or 
local corticosteroids during the study, in his/her opinion.  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of Administration:  Emixustat (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) tablets or placebo will be packaged in 
identical, tamper -proof, blister packaging to maintain masking.  
Study drug will be taken orally, QD, in the evening for 84 days.  
During W eek 1, subjects randomized to emixustat  will receive 4 
tablets (two placebo, two 2.5 mg) per day for  a 5 mg dose. During 
Week 2, subjects will receive 4 tablets (tw o placebo, two 5 mg) per 
day for a 10 mg dose. During W eek 3, subjects will receive 4 tablets 
(two placebo, two 10 mg) per day for  a 20 mg dose. During W eeks 4 
through 12, subjects will receive four 10 mg tablets per day for a 
40 mg dose. Subjects who do not tolerate dose escalations will be returned to and held at the last tolerated dose ; after Week 4, all

Rescue Treatment Criteria  for DME:  
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 15 of 85  All subjects will be eligible for therapy for DME in the study eye as 
of Day 29 (Visit 6) of the study if either of the following criteria are 
met: 
a. Development or worsening of DME as illustrat ed by an 
increase in central retinal thickness of ≥100 microns from any 
previous visit (as measured  by the Investigator ). 
b. A BCVA decrease of ≥10 letters  from any previous visit  that 
is deemed secondary to DME.  
Subjects for whom it is determined that treatment with PRP, anti -
VEGF therapy, or local corticosteroids in the study eye is necessary 
will discontinue study drug, be discontinued from the study, and undergo Early Termination assessments prior to any of these therapies.  
PRP, anti -VEGF agent therapy, fo cal laser therapy, or local 
corticosteroid therapy in the non- study eye is allowed at any time,  at 
the Investigator’s discretion .   
Early Termination from Study:  Subjects who discontinue from the study early will undergo an Early Termination visit where all Day 85 visit assessments will be performed when study drug is stopped, or as soon as possible after stopping study drug; they will then undergo 
study exit visi t evaluations 30 days after the last study drug dose .  
Subjects who have received study drug for less than 21 days will not 
undergo collection of an aqueous humor sample at the Early 
Termination visit.  If the Early Termination visit occurs ≥25 days 
after last study drug dose, the Early Termination and Study Exit visits 
may be combined.

using two- sided 90% and  95% t -distribution CI s and two- sided, two-
sample t -tests around the differences between treatment groups for 
quantitative measures.  For the assessment of changes from baseline 
in aqueous humor concentration of the 8 biomarkers, both absolute 
and percent changes will be analyz ed. Additionally for quantitative 
measures, 1 -sample t -tests will be completed on the change from 
baseline values within a treatment group.  Qualitative measures will 
be analyzed by exact McNemar’s test for changes within a treatment 
group and Fisher’s Exa ct Test for differences between treatment 
groups.  Differences in proportions and 90%  and 95% CIs will also be 
presented for comparisons between treatment groups for qualitative 
variables.  
Study Duration:  The protocol calls for up to 30 days between initi al screening and 
baseline (Day 1), an 84 -day dosing duration and follow -up 30 days 
after last study drug dose ; this yields a total duration of ~  20 weeks, 
or 5 months.

6.1 Background  
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in the world; it affect ed 
roughly 6% of the global population in the year 2000, and it is estimated that it will affect 300 
million people by 2025(1). Diabetic retinopathy affects 28.5% of patients in the US adult 
diabetic population ( 2) and is the main cause of permanent vision loss in the US working 
population ( 3).  
Early stages of diabetic retinal pathology involve microaneurysms, hemorrhages and other 
disruptions in retinal circu lation. This early, non- proliferative stage may be followed by 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) , characterized by the pathological formation of new 
retinal blood vessels. Despite progress in diagnostics and therapies, PDR , if untreated, may 
lead to a terminal stage of neovascularization (NV) that is characterized by the development of 
secondary neovascular glaucoma in a number of cases.  There is convincing scientific and 
clinical evidence that hypoxia is the driving force that mediates the development of retinal 
neovascularization ( NV) in patients with  diabetic retinopathy and other  ischemic retinopathies 
(4-7). 
6.2 Rationale for the  Study  
Emixustat directly modulates the visual cycle, the biochemical pathway that restores the 
chromophore ( 11-cis retinal) needed for phototransduction. It target s the RPE65 protein, which 
functions as a retinol isomerase.  RPE65 converts all -trans  retinyl esters to 11- cis retinol 
which, in turn, is converted to 11- cis retinal ; 11-cis retinal  is then  again available for 
interaction with opsin and detection of light  (Figure 1). In dark  conditions  (eg, while sleeping), 
phototransduction is inactive and photoreceptors consume large amounts of ATP and oxygen 
to fuel an ion pumping activity that is necessary to maintain electrochemical gradients across the outer segment membrane  (4).  This ion pumping activity is referred to as the dark current.  
The dark current is reversed during light adaptation when light causes the conversion of the  
chromophore 11 -cis retinal  to all -trans  retinal.  T he chromophore dissociates f rom the opsin 
protein, producing apo -opsin – which activates the phototransduction machinery causing 
closure of ion channels and a decrease in retinal ATP and oxygen consumption by 40% –60%, 
relative to the dark adapted state  (8).

Figure 1 Emixustat inhibits the RPE65 isomerase in the visual cycle 
Emixustat decreases levels of visual chromophore in photoreceptors, which is expected to 
result in increased levels of free opsin (ie, apo-opsin).  Increased levels of apo -opsin have been 
shown to prevent complete dark adaptation through constitutive activation of rod 
phototransduction; this has been theorized to prevent hypoxia and preserve vasculature of the 
inner retina .

Levels of biomarkers including interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte c hemo -
attractant protein -1(MCP -1), interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), transforming 
growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ -1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet -derived 
growth factor AA (PDGF -AA), and interleukin-1 β  have been shown to be elevated in the 
intraocular fluid of subjects with PDR (13-19).  The association of visual cycle modulation to 
the levels of biomarkers in the aqueous humor of subjects with PDR is not known. The 
Sponsor is proceeding with a Phase 2 study which will evaluate the effect of emixustat on this  
panel of biomarkers in aqueous humor.

   Page 34 of 85  8 Investigational Plan  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled study to evaluate  the 
effects of emixustat in subjects with PDR . Subjects will be randomly assigned to one the 
following treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio: 
• Emixustat, up to 40 mg (step- up titration)  
• Placebo  
Subjects will take 4 tablets of s tudy drug (emixustat or placebo) orally, QD, in the evening, for 
84 days. 
Emixustat (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) tablets or its placebo will be packaged in identical, tamper proof, 
blister packaging to maintain masking.  
During W eek 1, subjects randomized to emixustat will receive 4 tablets (two placebo, two 
2.5 mg) per day for a 5 mg dose. During Week 2, subjects will receive 4 tablets (two placebo, 
two 5 mg) per day for a 10 mg dose. During Week 3, subjects will receive 4 tablets (two 
placebo, two 10 mg) per day for a  20 mg dose. During Weeks 4 th rough 12, subjects will 
receive four 10 mg tablets per day for a 40 mg dose. Subjects who do not tolerate dose 
escalations will be returned to and held stable at the last tolerated dose; after week 4, all subjects will be held at a stable dose for the remainder of the study.  
 Subjects in the placebo group will undergo the same dosing regimen of 4 tablets, QD, with the placebo therapy.  
Aqueous humor collection for biomarkers will be conducted on Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 85 
(Visit 8) . Safety assessments throu ghout the study will include adverse events ( AEs), NL-
BCVA, LL -BCVA, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, SD -OCT, intraocular pressure ( IOP), dilated 
ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy, physical examination findings, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs ), and clinical laboratory tests  (blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis) . 
The study design is presented schematically in Figure 6.

Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. 
8.3 Study Sites  
This study will be conducted at up to 7 clinical sites in the United States.  
8.4 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
Randomization and double -masking will be used to minimize bias in subject selection and the 
evaluation of subjects during the study. A placebo control is included to provide an objective 
comparison for the saf ety and efficacy of e mixustat.  
Doses within the range previously assessed for safety have been selected , and a QD dosing 
regimen is based on the pharmacokinetic profile characterized in the Phase 1 program (Kubota 
2014). The st ep-wise dose escalation regi men and option to return to and hold subjects at a 
stable dose will allow for the evalu ation of safety and tolerability of dosing durations longer 
than 2 weeks.  
The 84- day dosing period is expected to provide the opportunity to evaluate the effects of 
emixustat on PDR -associated aqueous humor biomarkers.  
 
8.5 Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy variables will include:  
1. Aqueous humor concentration of the following biomarkers: IL -6, IL -8, interferon -
gamma inducible protein  (IP)-10, PDGF -AA, TGFβ -1, MCP -1, IL -1β, and VEGF  
2. Area of retinal NV 
3. Degree of vitreous hemorrhage  
4. Degree of preretinal  hemorrhage  
5. NL-BCVA  
6. CST as assessed by SD -OCT  in subjects with DME  
7. Retinal vessel oxygen saturation 
8.6 Pharmacodynamic Variables  
Cytokine assessments constitute the pharmacodynamic efficacy variables.

the macula) and, in the Investigator’s opinion, is not considered a 
contraindication to deferring PRP , anti -VEGF therapy , or surgical intervention. 
b. Exam evidence of NV of the angle ( NV of the iris alone is not an exclusion if it 
does not preclude deferring PRP or anti -VEGF therapy)

Investigator , might alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e g, retinal 
vein or artery occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.). A vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage is not an 
exclusion if it is out of the visual axis and, i n the Investigator’s judgement , is 
not having any effect on visual acuity. 
e. History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, 
scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within 3 months prior to the

contraceptive device with spermicide, condom with spermicide, contraceptive sponge with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, or cervical cap with spermicide.  
19. Male subjects who are not surgically sterile and are not willing to practice a medically accepted method of birth control with their female partner of childbearing potential (as 
listed above) from screening through 30 days after completion of the study. 
9.4 Determination of Study Eye  
The study eye will be determined as the eye that meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.  
If both eyes qualify, the investigator should select the study e ye as the eye with the least 
potential to require PRP, anti -VEGF therapy, or local corticosteroids during the study, in 
his/her opinion. 
9.5 Enrollment and Subject Identification Numbers  
All subjects screened for the study who sign an informed consent form ( ICF) will be assigned a 
screening number that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The screening 
number will consist of 5 digits: a 2 -digit site number and a consecutive 3- digit subject 
screening number . Randomization will be used to avoid bi as in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comp arisons. Once a subject meets all qualification criteria at 
Visits  1 and 2, they will be enrolled and randomly assigned to study treatment through the use 
of an interactive web response system (IWRS).

   Page 43 of 85  9.6 Subject Withdrawal from Treatment or Study  
Subjects may  withdraw from treatment or the study for any reason and at any time.  Subjects 
may also be removed from study for any of the following circumstances:  
• AEs 
• Investigator/Sponsor decision to withdraw subject from study 
• Subject withdrawal of consent  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
• Study termination by Sponsor  
• Other  
All subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will be withdraw n from the study. 
 Handling of Withdrawals  
At the time of withdrawal, the Investigator should advise the subject of the other avail able 
options.  When a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the reason(s) for 
withdrawal will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  For any subject who withdraws due to an AE, the reason for withdrawal must only be recorded as an AE ( no other 
reason  may be recorded) .  Whenever possible, all subjects who withdraw from the study 
prematurely will undergo assessments listed for the Early Termination visit.  
A subject who fails to return for any scheduled visit will be contacted by the site personnel in an attempt to have the subject comply with the protocol.  After randomization, if a subject 
cannot be contacted with 3 telephone calls over a period of 2 weeks  followed by a certified 
letter and there is no  known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrawn consent or AE), the 
reason for discontinuation will be recorded as “ lost to follow -up”. The date the certified letter 
was mailed will be considered the date of study withdrawal.  
In the event of a subject death during the study, the date of death (as listed on the death 
certificate) will be used as the date of study withdrawal.  It is vital to obtain follow -up data on 
any subject who is withdrawn because of an AE.  In any case, every effort must be made to 
undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures.  
The Medical Monitor should be notified promptly when a subject is withdrawn.

 Replacements   
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
 Sponsor or Regulatory Agency Termination of the Study  
Although the Sponsor intends to complete the study, the right is reserved to discontinue the 
study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons, or if required by the local regulatory authority. 
9.7 End of Study  
The end of study will be defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject.  A summary of the End of Study report will be sent to Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs), if required, within 
12 months of the end of the study. 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 45 of 85  10 Rando mization and Masking  
10.1 Randomization  
At Baseline (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment 
arms:  
• Emixustat, up to 40 mg (step- up titration)  
• Placebo  
Randomization will be stratified by DME status (DME vs. no DME) and wil l occur in a 
masked fashion according to a randomization scheme generated by an interactive web response system (IWRS). A randomization number will be assigned to each subject at this time. The screening number which was assigned when the subject enrolled will be the subject ID number for the remainder of the study 
10.2 Masking  
Study subjects, Investigators and their staff, and Sponsor personnel involved with the conduct 
and monitoring of the study will be masked to the identity of treatment until after the fina l 
database is locked. Emixustat and placebo will be identical appearing tablets , and each 
treatment will be packaged in identical, tamper -proof, blister packaging to maintain masking. 
All subjects will receive masked replacement (resupply) kits provided through the  IWRS. In 
order to maintain masking, subjects randomized to the placebo arm will be mock -titrated on the 
same schedule as those in the step -up titration arm.   
Appropriate precautions must be taken to prevent unauthorized access to the  randomizatio n 
scheme. The decision to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment is to be made by the Investigator  only if the subject’s safety requires it.  The treatment assignment for an individual 
subject may be obtained through the IWRS  only in the case of a medical emergency when 
identity of the treatment assignment is  essential for the clinical management of the subject. The 
Investigator must make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor before unmasking the treatment assignment. If  unmasking is required for emergency subject management , the 
Investigator must  document the medical rationale for unmasking and forward the information 
to the  Sponsor within 24 hours of unmasking without revealing to the Sponsor personnel the  
treatment assignment.   
If a serious adverse event ( SAE ) is assessed as unexpected and related to study drug, and meets 
the requirement for expedited regulatory submission, the Sponsor’s Drug Safety department will unmask the treatment assignment for the individual subject, if  warranted. Expe dited 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 46 of 85  reports will be submitted to regulatory authorities in accordance  with applicable regulations. 
Expedited reports will also be distributed to Investigators  without revealing the treatment 
assignment and will be submitted to IRB in  accordance with inst itutional guidelines.   
If emergency unmasking is required for any reason, the subject will be withdrawn from  the 
study.

 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 47 of 85  11 Study Treatments  
11.1 Drug Dosage and Administration  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride  
Study drug will be taken orally, QD, in the evening for 84 days . Subjects will receive 4 tablets 
per day  as follows:   
• Week 1  = 5 mg emixustat /day – two  2.5 mg tablets plus two  placebo tablets  
• Week 2  = 10 mg emixustat /day – two  5 mg tablets plus  two placebo  tablets  
• Week 3  = 20 mg emixustat /day – two  10 mg tablets plus  two placebo  tablets  
• Week 4 through Week 12  = 40 mg emixust at/day = four  10 mg tablets  
 Comparative Treatment (Placebo)  
Subjects in the placebo group will undergo the same dosing regimen  as the active treatment 
group with subjects taking 4 plac ebo tablets o rally, QD, in the evening for 84 days. The 
placebo tablets will be identical in appearance to the emixustat tablets but with only inactive 
ingredients .   
 Dose Reduction  
Subjects who do not tolerate dose escalations will be returned to and held stable at the last tolerated dose; after week 4, all subjects will be held at a stable dose for the remainder of the study.  Dose reduction is available  for s ubjects who do not tolerate dose escalations due to AE s 
that in the opinion of the investigator w ould otherwise lead t o discontinuation of study drug.  
Dose reduction  may be undertaken only once and is only available at Visit 4, Visit 5, or Visit 6 . 
 Rescue Therapy  
Rescue Treatment Criteria for PDR  
All subjects will be eligible for PRP or anti- VEGF therapy for PDR in the study eye as of D ay 
29 (Visit 6) of the study if the following criteri on is  met: 
• There is new NV or growth of NV of the retina, disc, angle,  OR iris such that the NV  is 
greater in ex tent than at Day 1  (Visit 2/Baseline).  
 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 48 of 85  Rescue Treatment Criteria  for DME  
All subjects will be eligible for therapy for DME in the study eye as of Day 29 (Visit 6) of the 
study if either of the following criteria are met:  
a. Development or worsening of DME as  illustrated by an increase in central retinal 
thickness of ≥100 microns from any previous visit  (as measured  by the Investigator ) 
b. A BCVA decrease of ≥10 letters from any previous visit that is deemed secondary to DME.  
Subjects for whom it is determined that treatment with PRP, anti- VEGF therapy, or local 
corticosteroids in the study eye is necessary will discontinue study drug, be discontinued from the study, and undergo Early Termination assessments prior to any of these therapies.  
PRP, anti -VEGF agent therapy, focal laser therapy, or local corticosteroid therapy in the non-
study eye is allowed at any time, at the Investigator’s discretion.  
11.2 Supply, Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Emixustat (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) tablets and  placebo tablets will be packaged in identical, tamper -
proof, blister packaging to maintain masking. 
11.3 Measurement of Study Drug Adherence  
Study drug will be taken orally, QD, in the evening, for 84 days . At each study visit, the 
subject will be queried regarding compliance with the treatment regimen.  
11.4 Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator will maintain accurate records of inventory and dates of receipt of all study 
drug.  In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much study drug is 
dispensed to each subject and how much is returned by each subject.  Reasons for departure 
from the expected dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
For regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all unused study drug and opened, empty blister  packaging from used study drug will be reconciled by the c linical r esearch 
associate (CRA).  Once reconciled, study drug can be returned to the Sponsor or designee 
according to applicable state and federal regulations. 
If study drug is returned by the site, it must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation 
and be clearly identified by protocol number and study site on the outermost shipping 
container.  Returned supplies should be in the original contai ners (eg, subject kits).  The CRA 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 49 of 85  should facilitate the return of unused study drug and opened, empty blister packaging from 
used study drug. 
If study drug is authorized by the Sponsor to be destroyed at the site, it is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to  ensure that arrangements have been made for the appropriate disposal.  
Written authorization should be issued by the Sponsor; procedures for proper disposal should be established according to applicable regulations, guidelines and procedures.  Appropriate  
records of the disposal should be maintained.  
11.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
In addition to the exclusion criteria, the following are excluded during the course of the study:  
• Systemic u se of a strong inducer of or a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( as 
listed in Appendix B ) 
• Anti-coagulant therapy (eg, heparins, warfarin, other oral anti -coagulants).  Anti -
platelet  therapy (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel ) is allowed.  
• Systemic anti- VEGF or pro -VEGF treatment  
If elective , urge nt, or emergency surgery  is required at any time between randomization and 
Day 85, the investigator will confer with the Medical Monitor, who will determine if a temporary discontinuation of masked study drug is warranted before and/or after the surgery.    
For subjects who undergo ocular treatments, procedures or surgeries (eg, retinal  detachment 
surgery) with the potential to affect protocol assessments or disease outcomes, the Investigator should confer with the Medical Monitor to determine whether or not the subject should continue with study drug.  
The Medical Monitor should be noti fied before prohibited medication or therapy (as listed in 
Section 9.3 Exclusion Criteria and Appendix B ) is administered unless the safety of the subject 
requires immediate action. Th e decision to administer a prohibited medication or therapy 
should be done with the safety of the subject as the primary consideration. The Medical 
Monitor will determine whether or not the subject may  continue with study participation.  The 
Investigator s hould contact the Medical Monitor if permissibility of a specific medication or 
therapy is in question to discuss whether or not the subject should continue with study participation.

Subjects who discontinue from the study early will undergo an Early Termination visit where 
all Day 85 visit assessments will be performed wh en study drug is stopped, or as soon as 
possible after stopping study drug; they will then undergo study exit visit evaluations 30 days after the last study drug dose .  Subjects who have received study drug <21 days will not 
undergo collection of an aqueous humor sample at the Early Termination visit.  If the Early Termination visit occurs ≥25 days after last study drug dose, the Early Termination and Study Exit visits may be combined. 
12.6 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary due to AEs or other reasons. The Investigator may 
examine a subject as often as is medically necessary while the subject is enrolled in the  study. 
In addition, if the Investigator believes follow -up is needed after the Study Exit  or Early

This section describes the study assessment procedures.  For timing of study assessments, see 
the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A ).  For full details on each study assessment, refer to the 
Study Manual. 
13.1 Informed Consent  
At Visit 1 (Screening, within 30 days prior to Baseline  [Day 1] ), obtain a signed ICF from each 
subject prior to performing any study related procedures (including any pre -treatment 
procedures or withdrawal from exclusionary medications).  Informed consent  must be obtained 
and documented in the subject’s chart prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed 
solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for research.  
13.2  Eligibility Assessment  
At Visit 1 (Screening  [Day - 30 to Day - 1], within 30 days prior to Baseline  [Day 1] ), each 
inclusion and exclusion criterion must be chec ked for each subject, as well as restricted and 
prohibited prior and concomitant therapy.  At Baseline ( Visit 2 /Day 1), eligibility requirements 
must be reviewed to determine if the subject is still eligible to continue in the study.  
13.3 Demographic Data 
Demog raphic data, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and iris color, will be collected at the 
screening visit. 
13.4 Medical, Surgical, and Ocular History  
A medical, surgical, and ocular history should be obtained from each subject at S creening (Day 
-30 to Day - 1) and updated at Baseline (Day 1), and any time the Investigator learns of 
information that should be included in the subject’s medical, surgical, or ocular history. 
13.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All current therapies and relevant prior therapies (see Section 11.5) will be assessed at Baseline 
(Visit 2/Day 1).  Concomitant therapies will be collected and recorded throughout the study. 
13.6 Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be conducted at the Screening visit (Day - 30 to Day - 1) and a 
urine pregnancy test will be conducted at Baseline ( Visit 2/Day 1), Visit 6/Day 29 (± 1 day), 
Visit 7/D ay 57 (±  5 days), and Visit 8/Day 85 (± 5 days ; Study Exit ) for women of 
childbearing potential .

13.11 Aqueous Humor Collection for Biomarkers  
A 50 μl sample of aqueous humor will be collected from the study eye by paracentesis  and 
shipped the same day on dry ice . 
13.12 Visual Acuity  
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be measured using the ETDRS retro -illuminated 
chart, the ETDRS  electronic visual acuity (ETDRS -EVA)  system, or the standard ETDRS wall 
chart  in normal luminance lighting  (NL -BCVA) .  NL-BCVA  will be recorded as total letter 
score in each eye.  
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 60 of 85  Low luminance BCVA (LL- BCVA) will be measured af ter BCVA is measured in normal 
luminance.  A 2.0 log unit neutral density filter (ie, a filter that lowers luminance by 100 times, 
such as a Kodak Wratten filter, Rochester, NY) , provided by the Sponsor, will be placed over 
the best correction for each eye in order to perform LL- BCVA . 
Visual acuity testing should precede any examination requiring contact with the eye.  In order to provide standardization and well -controlled assessments of BCVA during the study, all 
BCVA assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions during the entire study.  The Investigator should also consistently use the same 
correction, chart type, and measurement procedure for an individual subject during the entire 
study. 
Detailed instructions  for obtaining BCVA will be provided in a study- specific BCVA protocol.  
13.13 Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy  
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed prior to dilating the pupil.  Magnification will be 
consistent with standard clinical practice.  The subject will be s eated during the examination.  
This procedure should be conducted in the same manner for all subjects and will include an 
assessment of each of the following as normal or abnormal:  
• Eyelids  
• Conjunctiva  
• Cornea  
• Anterior chamber  
• Iris 
• Lens  
All abnormal findings  will be described.  
13.14 Intraocular Pressure  
IOP will be measured in each eye and results will be recorded in mm  Hg. 
At visits where IOP is to be measured, a single measurement will be made.  Contact or non-contact tonometry can be performed.  The same tonomet ry method should be used throughout 
the study. 
The tonometer must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject in the study undergoes 
the first examination and according to manufacturer specifications during the study, until the 
last subject has exi ted the study.

will be transmitte d to and evaluated  by the central reading center.  
The study personnel who perform retinal oximetry imaging  will be trained and certified by the 
central reading center prior to enrollment of subjects. 13.21 Evaluation of Adverse Events  
All AEs (serious and nonser ious) must be recorded i n the source documents and AE  eCRFs, 
regardless of causal relationship with study drug or procedures.  A Es must be captured from 
the time the subject signs the ICF  through the earlier of either the final study visit or 30 days 
after the last study drug dose.  T he following information will be collected  about each AE:  
severity, onset and resolution dates  and times , frequency, seriousness, relationship to study 
drug, action taken, outcome , location, and  whether the AE caused the subject to discontinue  
from the study. 
 Definitions  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug 
and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. 
AEs may include:  
• Any unfavorable sign, medical diagnosis, or symptom.  Whenever possible, the 
Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis under a 
single AE term (eg, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped together as “upper resp iratory tract infection”).  
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 63 of 85  • An unfavorable change of a pre -existing condition that occurs during the 
protocol -defined reporting period. 
• Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, ophthalmic assessments, or vital signs .  
If possible, abnormal laborator y results or changes in vital signs that meet the definition 
of an AE should be reported as a clinical diagnosis , rather than the abnormal laboratory 
value (eg, “hypertension” rather than “blood pressure increased”).  
Special considerations include:  
• A medic al or surgical procedure, itself, should not be captured as an AE.  The 
Investigator should determine whether or not the medical condition or diagnosis 
necessitating such treatment is an AE, eg, the worsening of a pre -existing condition or a 
new diagnosis. 
• Changes in pre -existing medical conditions, including worsening severity , frequency, 
or character during the protocol -defined reporting period, should be recorded as AEs.  
• Death itself is not considered an AE .  The cause of death should be reported as an S AE. 
• Pregnancy is not an AE.  Pregnancy in a female subject or the partner of a male subject 
should be reported to the Sponsor in accordance with Section 13.21.4. 
A treatment -emergent AE  is any  AE that  occurs after the subject has  received the first dose 
of study drug, whether or not it is considered causally related to the study drug. 
A Serious Adverse Event inclu des any event  that, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• Life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event).  
It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if i t were more 
severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
Hospitalization for surgery planned before study entry is not considered an SAE. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  of offspring.  
• An important medical event that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization, but might jeopardize the subject or might require inter vention 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 64 of 85  to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the  definition  above.  Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm , 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizati on, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
AE Severity:    
AEs will be graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) v 4.03.  The criteria can be accessed at:  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf . 
The term “severe” is a measure of intensity.  A severe AE is not necessarily a serious AE.  
Study Drug Causalit y:  Relationship of an AE  to treatment will be assessed by the 
investigator as follows:  
Causality  Definition  
Related  There is a reasonable causal association with administration of 
the drug; the event is confirmed by stopping and/or restarting the drug or is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis ; 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE . 
Not related  There is no causal or temporal relationship to the study drug 
administration; related to other etiolog ies such as concomitant 
medications or conditions. 
 
 Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs that occur during their study participation.  The 
Investigator will assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs at all scheduled and unscheduled 
visits.  The occurrence of AEs should be  elicited  by non- direct que stioning of the subject at 
each visit , eg,  “Have you had any problems since your last visit?”  The Investigator may detect 
AEs while performing a physical examination or other assessments.  All AEs (serious and 
nonserious) reported by the subject will be reviewed by a qualified Investigator in the study and must be recorded on the source documents and AE  eCRFs.  
An AE  that is serious must be reported on a n SAE form to the Sponsor ’s Drug Safety 
department  no later than 24 hours after the I nvestigat or becomes  aware of the event.  
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 65 of 85   
 
 
 
A
ll SAEs occurring after the ICF  is signed but before administration of study drug that are 
considered related  to a protocol procedure must also be reported to Drug Safety within 24 
hours after the clinical site becomes aware of the event.  
For SAEs that occur before the first dose of study drug is administered and that are considered 
unrelated  to any study procedure by the Investigator, record the SAE on the AE  eCRF only; 
completion of an SAE form and reporting to Drug Safety is not required for such events.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in intensity , outcome, or the relationship to study drug, a follow-up 
SAE report should be sent to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the clinical site becomes aware 
of the change in status. 
 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies 
The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting.  Reports of those 
SAEs that qualify for expedited reporting will be submitted to regulatory agencies in accordance with applicable local regulation (eg, 21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 
312.32).  Expedited reports will be also distributed to Investigators and will be submitted to the 
IRB in accordance with institutional guidelines and local regulation. 
 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  However, any report of pregnancy that occurs in a fem ale 
subject or the female partner of a male subject during study participation or within 90 days after the subject’s last dose of study drug, and that becomes known to the Investigator, must be reported to the Sponsor even if the subject is withdrawn from study. 
If a subject or Investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant prior to study drug 
administration, the study drug administration must be withheld until the results of blood serum 
or urine pregnancy tests are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the study drug and must not be enrolled in the study.  If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must be withheld immediately until the 
result of the serum pregnancy test is known.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial.  

 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 66 of 85  The Investigator must follow the pregnancy to conclusion and will collect data on both 
maternal and fetal outcome including f ollow -up information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome.  Normal outcomes will be communicated to the Sponsor within 30 calendar days of birth/delivery.  Infants will be followed for a 
minimum of 6 months.  
All abnormal pregnancy outcomes and/or any AE for the child or fetus (including miscarriage) 
will be recorded on the AE  eCRF and SAE form.  The associated SAE form will be sent to and 
followed up by the Sponsor according to the procedure described in Secti on 13.21.2. 
An AE  eCRF and/or SAE form , as appropriate, will be completed for subjects who are 
maternal to the child or fetus and if the subject sus tains an AE .  The SAE form will be sent to 
the Sponsor in accordance with Section 13.21.2. 
 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as any dose higher than the defined or prescribed dose of study drug.  
Occurrences of overdose leading to AE s will be reported on the AE  eCRF.  
An overdose leading to an SAE will be reported to the Sponsor in accordance with the 
procedur e described in Section 13.21.2. 
 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Subjects with ongoing SAEs will be followed until the event(s) is resolved , stabilized , no 
longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator, or the subject dies or withdraws consent. 
Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health .  Stabilization means 
the Investigator does not expect any further improve ment or worsening in the subject’s 
condition. All nonserious AEs will be followed through the last scheduled or unscheduled visit.  
For a nonserious AE that is first identified on the last scheduled contact  (and with onset 
< 30 days after the last study drug dose) , the event must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the 
current status noted, but no further follow -up needs to be performed.  
 Follow -up of Post -study Serious Adverse Events  
Any new SAE reported by the subject to the Investigator , with onset after the earlier of the 
final study visit or 30 days after the last study drug dose and that is determined by the 
Investigator to be associated with the use of study drug, should be reported to the Sponsor.

   Page 70 of 85  16 Statistical Analysis and Study Variables  
Eight subjects per arm yields 80% power to detect a difference between emixustat and placebo 
in each aqueous humor biomarker, assuming an effect size of 1.31, using a two- sample  t-test 
and a two -sided alpha level of 0.10. To account for potential early termination subjects, 2 
additional subjects per treatment arm, for a total of 10 subjects per arm, will be enrolled.  
Subject demographic and baseline data will be summarized by tre atment arm for all 
randomized subjects.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum), and categorical variables will be summarized using the count and percentage of subjects in each 
category.  
Primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized using standard quantitative (sample size, 
mean, SD , median, minimum, maximum, and 90% and 95% t -distribution confidence intervals 
[CI] around the mean) and qualita tive (frequency counts,  percentages , and exact 90% and 95% 
CIs around the percentages) summary statistics and assessed using two- sided 90% and 95% t -
distribution CIs and two- sided, two- sample t -tests around the differences between treatment 
groups for qua ntitative measures.  For the assessment of changes from baseline in aqueous 
humor concentration of the 8 biomarkers, both absolute and percent changes will be analyzed. Additionally for quantitative measures, 1 -sample t -tests will be completed on the change from 
baseline values within a treatment group.  Qualitative measures will be analyzed by exact 
McNemar’s test for changes within a treatment group and Fisher’s Exact Test for differences 
between treatment groups.  Differences in proportions and 90% and 95% CIs will also be 
presented for comparisons between treatment groups for qualitative variables.   
The assessment of safety will be based on the summaries of ocular and non -ocular AEs, NL-
BCVA, LL -BCVA, ophthalmic examination  findings ( slit lamp  biomicros copy, dilated 
ophthalmoscopy, IOP, gonioscopy) , SD-OCT, vital signs, physical examination findings , 
ECGs, and clinical laboratory values.  Subjects will be summarized in the group according to 
the treatment received, and all subjects receiving emixustat will be combined into one group.  
AEs reported during the study will have their verbatim terms mapped to the corresponding 
thesaurus terms from the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) coding dictionar y.  All summaries of AEs will be based on  the assigned 
MedDRA Preferred Term and System Organ Class, and summaries will be given for each of 
the two randomized treatment arms.

17.1 Case Report Forms  
As part of the responsibilities assumed  by participating in the study, the Investigator agrees to 
maintain adequate case histories for the subjects treated as part of the research under this 
protocol.  The Investigator agrees to maintain an accurate eCRF and source documentation as 
part of the case history for each subject.  Source documentation may include chart notes, 
laboratory reports, and ECG strips. 
All requested information is to be filled in on the eCRF.  If an item is not available or is not 
applicable, this should be indicated.  Blank data fields should not be present unless otherwise 
directed.  
Each completed eCRF must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator in a timely 
manner.  
17.2 Monitoring of the Study  
The CRA, a representative of the Sponsor, will follow the study closely.  T he CRA will 
maintain necessary email, telephone, fax, and/or mail contact with the Investigators and study site) and will visit the study sites at periodic intervals.  The CRA will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, revie w of study records and source 
documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the Investigators and study site 
staff.  During those visits, the CRA will compare the subject data recorded in the eCRF against source documents at the clinical s ite. 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by the Sponsor or its designee for 
compliance with applicable government regulation with respect to the International Conference 
for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E6 (R1):  Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guideline and current standard operating procedure s. 
17.3 Inspection of Records  
Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study- related monitoring, audits, 
IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access t o all study records.  The 
Investigator or study site may be audited by the Sponsor or its representatives and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, representatives of the Sponsor, the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA), or other regulatory 
agency access to all study records.  
The Sponsor will review eCRF  data and perform electronic edit checks on the data.  
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original  
 
   Page 73 of 85  The Investigator should promptly notify the Sponsor of any audits scheduled by any regulatory 
authorities and promptly forward copies of any audit reports received to the Sponsor. 
17.4 Study Record Retention  
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining 
to the conduct of a clinical study must be retained by the investigator.  Original source 
documents for each subject should be included in this documentation.  Study documentation 
should be retained by the Investigator until notified by the Sponsor in writing that retention is no longer necessar y.  Study documentation includes records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, 
and subject medical records.  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
Investigator/institution as to when this documentation no longer needs to be retained.  
Records  containing subject medical information must be handled in accordance with the 
requirements of the applicable privacy rules and consistent with the terms of the subject 
authorization contained in the IC F for the study.  Care should be taken to ensure that such 
records are not shared with any person or for any purpose not contemplated by the ICF .  
Furthermore, eCRFs and other documents to be transferred to the Sponsor should be completed in strict accordance with the instructions provided by the Sponsor, inc luding the instructions 
regarding the coding of subject identities.  Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, written agreement must be obtained from the Sponsor.  If requested, the Investi gator will provide the Sponsor, applicable 
regulatory agencies, and applicable IRB with direct access to original source documents.  
Essential documents should be retained until at least 15 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 15 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug.  These documents should be retained 
for longer, howe ver, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement 
with the Sponsor.

18.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The Investigator agrees that the study will be conducted according to the Good Clinical 
Practice principles of the ICH  E6 (R1) guideline and the principles of the World Medical 
Association Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving 
Human Subjects 1964, including all amendments and Notes of Clarification.  The Investigator 
will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations. 
18.2 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent in compliance with Title 21 of the CFR Part 50 shall be obtained 
from each subject prior to entering the  study or performing any unusual or non- routine 
procedure that involves risk to the subject.  An ICF  template may be provided by the Sponsor 
or designee to investigative sites.  The ICF will be submitted by the Investigator to his or her 
IRB for review and approval prior to the start of the study.  If any institution- specific 
modifications to study- related procedures are proposed or made by the site, the ICF  should be 
reviewed by the Sponsor and/or its designee, if appropriate, prior to IRB submission.  If the 
ICF is revised during the course of the study, all active participating subjects must sign the 
revised form.  
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject and/or his/her legal guardian will be given a full explanation of the nature of the study and the action of the study drug.  The subject/legal guardian will be informed that participa tion is voluntary and that they can 
withdraw from the study at any time.  The subject/legal guardian will be allowed to read the approved ICF.  Once the Investigator is assured that the subject/legal guardian agrees to 
participate in the study, the subject /legal guardian will be asked to give consent by signing the 
ICF. 
The Investigator shall provide a copy of the signed and dated ICF to the subject and/or legal 
guardian.  The original shall be maintained in the subject’s medical records at the site.
 
18.3 Instit utional Review Board  
Federal regulations and ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB prior to participation of human subjects in research studies.  Prior to the study onset at any given 
Investigator site, an appropriate IRB must approve the protocol, ICF, advertisements to be used 
for subject recruitment, and any other written information regarding this study that is to be 
provided to the subject or the subject’s legal guardian.  Documentation of all IRB approvals

19.1 Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain subject confidentiality.  All records will be kept in a secure storage area with limited access.  Clinical informatio n will not be released without the written 
permission of the subject (or the subject’s guardian), except as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, its designee, the FDA (or other international regulatory agency), or the IRB.  
The Investigator  and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or 
use for any purpose other than performance of the study, any data, record, or other unpublished confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study.  Prior written agreement from the Sponsor or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any said confidential information to other parties. 
19.2 Modification of the Protocol  
The Investigator may implement a change from the protocol without prior Sponsor and IRB 
approval only to eliminate an immediate hazard to a subject, in which case, Sponsor and IRB must be notified of the change within 24 hours.  
Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the FDA and IRB and approved 
prior to subje cts being enrolled into an amended protocol. 
19.3 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation occurs when the Investigator or subject has failed to adhere to significant protocol requirements.  All important deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion crite ria, 
conduct of the trial, subject management or subject assessment should be documented.  Specific categories to be documented include but are not limited to:  
• Subjects who enter the study even though they do not satisfy the entry criteria  
• Subjects who develop withdrawal criteria during the study but are not withdrawn  
• Subjects who receive the wrong treatment or incorrect dose  
• Subjects who receive an excluded concomitant treatment  
Other protocol deviations to be considered include nonadherence to the protocol that results in a significant additional risk to the subject. 
 Acucela Inc   Protocol  
 Emixustat Hydrochloride   Study 4429- 203, Original

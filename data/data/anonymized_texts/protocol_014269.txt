1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  I/II trial of clofarabine  for the treatment  of patients  with relapsed  or 
refractory  mature  T- and NK-cell lymphomas.  Earlier  and ongoing  phase  I and II trials  
established  safety  and anti-tumor  activity  of clofarabine  in patients  with acute  leukemia  
and solid  tumors.  The only two patients  with T- and NK-cell lymphoma /leukemia  who 
were  treated  with clofarabine  had complete  responses  which  led to our interest  in 
studying  this agent  in patients  with T- and NK-cell lymphoma.  
 
With  the exception  of ALK -1 expressing  ALCL  and certain  pediatric  lymphomas,  T-cell 
lymphomas  are a heterogeneous  and poor prognostic  subset  of non-Hodgkin’s  
lymphomas  (NHL).  Overall,  standard  chemotherapy  regimens  achieve  complete  
responses  in about  40% of patients  and produce  2- and 5-year survival  rates  of 20 – 30% 
[1-3]. In more  specific  analyses,  outcomes  for patients  with intermediate  or poor 
prognosis  based  upon  the international  prognostic  index  (IPI) have  a 0 - 23% survival  at 
five years  and a 0 - 10% failure -free survival  with no plateau  on the curves  suggesting  
that very few of these  patients  are cured  of their disease  [2-4]. 
 
The long-term goal of this research  is to improve  outcomes  for these  patients  by 
identifying  new agents  with activity  against  T-cell lymphomas  in the hope  of generating  
more  effective  treatment  regimens.  The primary  objective  of this study  is to evaluate  the 
utility  of clofarabine  in the treatment  of T- and NK- cell lymphoma  by defining  the 
maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  and the dose limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  in these  patients.   
A preliminary  assessment  of efficacy  will also be made  by enrolling  an expanded  cohort  
of patients  at the MTD  in the phase  II portion  of the study.  
 
The study  population  is patients  with relapsed  or refractory  T- or NK-cell lymphoma  of 
with the following  histologies:  blastic  NK-cell lymphoma,  adult  t-cell 
lymphoma/leukemia,  t-cell prolymphocytic  leukemia,  t-lymphoblastic  lymphoma,  
unspecified  peripheral  t-cell lymphoma,  angioimmunoblastic  t-cell lymphoma,  anaplastic  
large  cell lymphoma,  subcutaneous  panniculitis -like T-cell lymphoma,  enteropathy -type 
t-cell lymphoma  and hepatosplenic   t-cell lymphoma.  
 
 
Patients  eligible  for treatment  on this protocol  will be treated  with intravenous  clofarabine  
for three  consecutive  days approximately  every  three  weeks.  For the phase  I           
portion  of the trial, an accelerated  titration  design  will be utilized  until certain  toxicity  
criteria  have  been  met. Then,  a standard  titration  design  will be used for the remainder  of 
the phase  I portion  of the trial. Once  the maximum  tolerated  dose has been  defined,  a 
Simon  minimax  two-stage  design  will initiate.  To complete  this study,  we expect  to 
enroll  20-38 patients  over 18 months.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
• To determine  the maximum  tolerated  dose of intravenous  clofarabine  using  the schedule  
outlined  below  that can be administered  safely  to patients  with relapsed  and refractory  T- 
and NK-cell lymphomas.  
• To define  the toxicity  of clofarabine  using  the proposed  schedule  in patients  with 
relapsed  and refractory  T- and NK-cell lymphomas.  
• To make  a preliminary  assessment  of efficacy  of intravenous  clofarabine  at the maximum  
tolerated  dose in patients  with relapsed  and refractory  T- and NK-cell lymphomas.  
o The primary  statistical  endpoint  to evaluate  efficacy  in the phase  II portion  will be 
response  rate. Data  will also be collected  on response  duration.  
 
3.1 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.2 T-cell lymphomas -Classification  
 
T- and NK-cell lymphomas  form  a heterogeneous  group  of Non-Hodgkin’s  lymphomas  
(NHLs).  They  are relatively  uncommon,  comprising  10-15% of all newly  diagnosed  
NHL  in the U.S.  The proportions  are reversed  in Asia where  70-80% of NHL  may be of 
the T-cell phenotype.  Under  the World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  classification  
schema,  T-cell lymphomas  are divided  into disorders  that are precursor  T-cells,  
predominantly  extranodal  or predominantly  nodal  lymphomas.  These  categories  are 
further  subclassified  into the following  entities:  
 
Precursor  T-cell

Blastic  NK-cell lymphoma  Peripheral  T-cell 
Lymphoma,  unspecified  Transformed  Mycosis  Fungoides

3.3 T-cell Lymphomas:  Prognosis  
 
Most  of the T- and NK-cell lymphomas  are aggressive  diseases  requiring  systemic  
chemotherapy  and are associated  with a poorer  prognosis  compared  to their B-cell 
counterparts.  Larger  clinical  series  of T-cell lymphomas  report  median  survivals  of less 
than 2 years  [1-3] and 5-year survival  rates between  20-30% [1-4]. Failure -free surviv al 
for IPI intermediate  and high risk patients  is between  0-10% in the larger  series  with no 
plateau  on the curves  for these  populations  [2-4].  This poor prognosis  is related  to both 
decreased  sensitivity  to chemotherapy  with lower  response  rates  than their intermediate  
grade  B-cell counterparts  as well as a propensity  for T-cell lymphomas  to present  with 
poor risk factors.  In the series  by Lopez -Guillermo,  only 43% (62/144)  of patients  with 
non-anaplastic  large  cell T-cell lymphoma  achieved  a complete  response  (CR)  while  a 
nearly  equivalent  number,  41% (59/144)  were  non-responders  to therapy  [2].  Poor  risk 
patients  had similarly  poor response  rates  in other  studies  with CR rates of 42% and 39% 
[4, 5].  
 
3.4 Relapsed  and Refractory  T-cell Lymphomas:  Therapy  
 
There  are few studies  which  specifically  investigate  optimal  treatment  regimens  for 
patients  with T-cell lymphomas.  Instead,  most  patients  with T- or NK-cell lymphomas  
have  been  treated  like aggressive  B-cell lymphomas.  Based  on a retrospective  analysis  of 
a series  of T-cell patients,  the prognosis  for T-cell lymphomas  is worse  than B-cell 
lymphomas.  This difference  is primarily  seen among  the high and high-intermediate  risk 
patients  by International  Prognostic  Index  (IPI).  Five-year overall  survival  and disease - 
free survival  were  only 26% and 20%,  respectively.  Hence,  many  patients  with T-cell 
lymphomas  fail to achieve  a complete  response  to initial  therapy,  and many  others  
experience  an early  relapse  [3, 6]. For example,  50% of patients  with peripheral  T-cell 
lymphoma  present  with stage  IV disease  which  is associated  with a 10% four-year 
disease -free survival  [7]. Therefore,  while  T- and NK- lymphomas  are not common,  
most  patients  will relapse  and become  refractory  to therapy.  
High  dose therapy  followed  by an autologous  transplant  or less commonly  an allogeneic  
stem  cell transplant  is a common  treatment  strategy  for relapsed  and refractory  T-cell 
lymphomas.  Transplantation  has only been  successful  in patie nts with chemosensitive  
disease.  For those  patients  who have  chemosensitive  disease  and are transplanted,  a

subset  of patients  will be cured.  The remainder  of these  patients,  who either  are not 
chemosensitive  at relapse  or relapse  after high dose therapy  and stem  cell transplantation,  
are left without  curative  treatment  options.  In order  to improve  the outcome  in this patient  
population,  novel  agents  need  to be investigated  to find an effective  treatment  regimen.  
There  have  been  relatively  few studies  exploring  the utility  of specific  agents  in relapsed  
T-cell lymphomas.  Existing  data is largely  limited  to small  series,  pilot studies,  and 
retrospective  experience.  These  results  are described  below.  
For patients  with relapsed  and refractory  T-cell lymphomas  (T-cell NHL),  
deoxycoformycin  (pentostatin)  has been  utilized  with some  success.  It has been  associated  
with a 50% overall  response  rate (ORR)  and a 7% CR in relapsed  patients  with T-cell 
NHL  (n=14).  Despite  its relatively  high response  rate in these  heavily -pretreated     
patients,  the median  duration  of response  was only 6 months  [8]. Another  
deoxycoformycin  study  conducted  in relapsed/refractory  mature  T-cell malignancies  
showed  an ORR  of 38%.  Greater  than 50% of the responses  were  seen in patients  with 
Sezary  syndrome.  Forty -eight  percent  of patients  with T-cell prolymphocytic  leukemia  
(T-PLL)  responded  to deoxycoformycin;  three  of whom  had a CR lasting  8 -12 months  
[9]. Although  single -agent  deoxycoformycin  may be active  in many  T-cell malignancies,  
the responses  are not durable.  
There  are two series  of patients  with relapsed  or refractory  T-cell lymphoma  treated  with 
gemcitabine,  a deoxycytidine  analogue.  In a small  study  of 10 patients  who had 2 – 3 
prior  therapies  for their T-cell lymphoma,  1200  mg/m2  of weekly  gemcitabine  resulted  in 
a 60% ORR  and a 20% CR, with a median  duration  of response  of 13.5 months  [10].  
Forty -four patients  with previously  treated  mycosis  fungoides  and peripheral  T-cell 
lymphoma  (PTCL)  were  enrolled  in a larger  phase  II trial and treated  with the same  dose 
and schedule  of gemcitabine.  Seventy  percent  responded  to therapy;  11% of whom  
achieved  a CR. Treatment  with gemcitabine  was well-tolera ted and resulted  in a 15 
month  median  duration  of response  in patients  achieving  a CR. 
Alemtuzumab,  a humanized  anti-CD52  monoclonal  antibody  has been  used in the 
treatment  of relapsed  or refractory  T-cell lymphomas,  particularly  in T-PLL and PTCL.  
Keating,  et al conducted  a retrospective  analysis  of 76 patients  with heavily  pretreated  T- 
PLL.  These  patients  achieved  a 51% ORR  and a 39.5%  CR. The median  time to 
progression  (TTP)  was 4.5 months  [11].  In a prospective  phase  II trial, patients  with 
relapsed  T-PLL who were  treated  with alemtuzumab  achieved  a 76% ORR  and a 60% 
CR. The median  disease -free interval  was 7 months,  a significant  improvement  from  the 
brief  response  (3 months)  associated  with conventional  CHOP  therapy  or pentostatin  
[12].  In another  phase  II trial, alemtuzuma b was given  to 14 patients  with heavily - 
pretreated  PTCL  and found  to have an ORR  36%.  However,  these  positive  results  were  
mitigated  by a high treatment -related  mortality  of 35% [13].  
Denileukin  diftitox,  or ONTAK,  a fusion  protein  composed  of the receptor -binding  
domain  of IL-2 and diphtheria  toxin,  is approved  for cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma.

Preliminary  results  from  a phase  II study  of denileukin  diftitox  in relapsed/refractory  B- 
and T-cell NHL  demonstrated  an ORR  of 21% (n= 28). Responses  were  seen in both B- 
and T-cell lymphomas  as well as CD25+  and CD25 - tumors  [14].  Other  studies  using  
denileukin  diftitox  as a single  agent  and in combination  with CHOP  for the treatment  of 
PTCL  are underway.  
3.5 Rationale  for use of clofarabine  in relapsed  and refractory  T- and NK- cell 
lymphoma  
 
T- and NK-cell lymphomas  are rare malignancies  and comprise  a poor prognosis  subset  
of NHL.  With  the exception  of transplantation  which  cures  only a minority  of patients,  
there  are no curative  options  for patients  with relapsed  T-cell malignancies.  Many  of 
these  patients  are refractory  to standard  chemotherapy  and thus,  they are not candidates  
for high dose therapy  and stem  cell transplantation.  Even  among  the patients  who 
received  transplants,  many  will relapse  and die of their disease.  Due to the lack of 
effective  treatments  for the majority  of those  with T- and NK-cell lymphoma,  active  
drugs  are sought  to ultimately  improve  the long-term outcome  of these  patients.  
 
Nucleoside  analogues  are widely  utilized  and among  the most  active  agents  for the 
treatment  of hematologic  malignancies.  The cytosine  analogue,  gemcitabine,  is active  
against  both Hodgkin’s  and Non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma.  As mentioned  in section  3.3, this 
agent  also has activity  against  relapsed  and refractory  T-cell lymphoma  [10, 15]. A 
guanosine  analog,  nelzarabine  or arabinosyl  guanine  prodrug,  has activity  against  T-cell 
ALL  and CLL  [16].  The deoxyadenosine  analogues,  fludarabine,  cladribine  and 
deoxycoformycin,  have  varying  degrees  of activity  against  CLL,  hairy  cell leukemia,  
lymphoma  and Waldenstrom’s  macroglobulinemia.  In several  studies,  deoxycoformycin  
has produced  responses  in patients  with T-cell malignancies.  At Memorial  Sloan - 
Kettering  Cancer  Center,  the use of deoxycoformycin  is also being  explored  as part of an 
upfront  combination  treatment  regimen  for patients  with T-cell NHL.  
 
Clofarabine,  a second -generation  deoxyadenosine  analogue,  was developed  in order  to 
increase  efficacy  and minimize  toxicity  compared  to the first-generation  agents  such as 
fludarabine,  cladribine,  and deoxycoformycin.  Like fludarabine  and cladribine,  it 
requires  intracellular  phosphorylation  by deoxycitidine  kinase  to be metabolized  to the 
cytotoxic  triphosphate  form.  Fludarabine  inhibits  DNA  synthesis  through  DNA  
polymerase;  whereas,  cladribine  accomplishes  this task through  inhibition  of 
ribonucleotide  reductase.  Clofarabine  triphosphate  inhibits  both DNA  polymerase  and 
ribonucleotide  reductase.  In addition  to its more  potent  inhibition  of DNA  synthesis,  
clofarabine  is also an attractive  agent  to investigate  based  on promising  results  in early 
trials  for both myeloid  and lymphoid  leukemias.  
 
In a phase  I trial conducted  at the MD Anderson  Cancer  Center,  a 16% overall  response  
rate was observed  in adult  patients  with relapsed  acute  leukemia  who were  treated  with 5

days of clofarabine  at doses  between  11.25  and 55 mg/m2/d. Six patients  with either  CLL  
or lymphoma  were  also treated  on this protocol  at lower  doses.  Two of the CLL  patients  
had a partial  response  at the 15 mg/m2/d dose [17].  In another  phase  I trial conducted  in 
heavily  pretreated  pediatric  patients  with acute  leukemia,  a 32% overall  response  rate was 
observed;  20% of whom  achieved  a complete  remission.  Thirty -two percent  of adult  
patients  with relapsed  or refractory  acute  myeloid  leukemia  achieved  a complete  response  
in a phase  2 trial conducted  by Kantarjian,  et al [18].  Additional  trials  with clofarabine  are 
ongoing  in patients  with relapsed  or refractory  lymphoma  and ALL.  
 
To date,  only two patients  with T- or NK-cell lymphoma  have  been  treated  with 
clofarabine;  both of whom  achieved  a complete  response.  In the 3 phase  I/II trials  
mentioned  above,  there  was one patient  with a T-cell malignancy  who was treated  with 
clofarabine  [19].  This patient  achieved  a complete  remission  after failing  to respond  to 3 
prior  regimens.  To our knowledge,  only one other  patient  with a T-cell malignancy  has 
been  treated  with this agent.  This patient  had recurrent  T-cell lymphoblastic  lymphoma  
and achieved  a complete  remission  after 2 cycles  of clofarabine  (52 mg/m2/d for 5 days).  
He was treated  on protocol  at this institution  and failed  3 prior  salvage  therapies.   Further  
study  of clofarabine  is warranted  given  the limited  treatment  options  for patients  with T- 
or NK-cell lymphoma.  
 
In the phase  I trial of patients  with both solid  and hematologic  malignancies,  there  were  
two dose-limiting  toxicities  [17].  In the patients  with solid  tumors  including  those  with 
CLL  and lymphoma,  the dose-limiting  toxicity  was myelosuppression.  For these  
patients,  the maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  was defined  at 2 mg/m2/d for 5 days.  
Myelosuppressive  toxicity  was graded  differently  for patients  with acute  leukemia.  For 
these  patients,  failure  of the leukocyte  count  to return  to normal  within  6 weeks  of 
initiation  of therapy  was a dose-limiting  toxicity.  Since  prolonged  myelosuppression  was 
not observed  in the patients  with acute  leukemia,  the dose of clofarabine  was escalated  to 
55 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive  days.  Two of the 4 patients  treated  at 55 mg/m2/d had a 
grade  3 hepatic  toxicity.  The maximum  tolerated  dose for this group  of patients  was 40 
mg/m2/d for 5 days.  
 
The animal  studies  and early  phase  I/II trials  of clofarabine  have  used the 5 consecutive  
day schedule  based  on prior  experience  utilizing  this schedule  in other  nucleoside  
analogues  such as fludarabine.  The only alternative  dosing  schedule  studied  for 
clofarabine  is once  weekly.  Results  utilizing  the once  weekly  dosing  have  not been  
reported  to date.  Plasma  pharmacokinetic  data performed  in the phase  II trial 
investigating  the use of clofarabine  in patients  with relapsed  leukemia  demonstrated  a 
higher  plasma  clofarabine  triphosphate  level  at the end of infusion  on day 3 compared  to 
the levels  at the end of days 1 and 2.  More  specifically,  the level  was 10 μM, 20 μM, 
and 25 μM at the end of the second,  third  and fourth  infusion,  respectively.  In a second

patient,  the clofarabine  triphosphate  concentration  in the plasma  increased  more  rapidly  
(30 μM at the end of the first infusion  to 65 μM at the end of day 3) [17-19]. 
 
Due to the variability  in the plasma  clofarabine  triphosphate  levels  and lack of rationale  
for a 5 consecutive  day schedule,  we are proposing  an alternative  schedule.  Lymphomas  
are particularly  sensitive  to other  purine  analogues  as evidenced  by increased  retention  of 
plasma  triphosphate  concentrations.  For example,  the elimination  half-life of fludarabine  
is much  longer  in patients  with lymphoid  malignancies  compared  to relapsed  leukemia  
(24 hours  vs. 7 hours).  In the phase  II clofarabine  study,  high levels  of plasma  
triphosphate  (40 μM) were  required  to achieve  the maximum  tolerated  dose in relapsed  
leukemia.  The triphosphate  level  within  the blasts  was less than 5 μM [18].  Since  most  
of the patients  treated  on phase  I trials  have  been  relapsed  leukemia  patients,  the 
pharmacodynamics  for patients  with lymphoid  neoplasms  in unknown.  Because  of 
increased  lymphoid  cell sensitivity  to purine  analogs  and the possibility  of longer  
elimination  as well as our belief  that single  dosing  is suboptimal,  a 3 consecutive  day 
schedule  is being  proposed  for this study.  
 
As clofarabine  will be administered  for 3 consecutive  days instead  of 5 days,  the starting  
dose for the first cohort  of patients  was increased  to 4 mg/m2/d. This dose is similar  to the 
MTD  for solid  tumor  patients  (12 mg/m2/wk compared  to 10 mg/m2/wk for those  who 
were  treated  at the MTD  with the 5 day schedule).  The DLT  at this dose in the solid   
tumor  study  was myelosuppression.  Since  duration  but not degree  of myelosuppression  is 
a defined  DLT  in this study  and this dose was safe in other  ways,  we have  chosen  it as our 
starting  dose and expect  the MTD  to occur  at a higher  dose level  than observed  in patients  
with solid  malignancies  but lower  than that of the leukemia  patients  (200          
mg/m2/wk).  [17].  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single  institution,  open -label,  phase  I/II study  designed  to evaluate  the safety  and 
efficacy  of intravenous  clofarabine  in patients  with previously  treated  T- and NK-cell 
lymphomas.  During  the phase  I portion  of the study,  cohorts  of patients  will be treated  
with escalating  dose levels  of clofarabine.  Once  the maximum  tolerated  dose has been  
defined,  additional  patients  will be accrued  to the phase  II portion  of the study.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  will receive  intravenous  clofarabine  once  daily  for three  consecutive  days.  
Doses  of clofarabine  will start at 4 mg/m2/day and will be escalated  to higher  dose levels  
as described  in Section  9.2. If the toxicity  criteria  have  not been  exceeded  at the day 22 ±

2 evaluation,  the next course  of therapy  will be administered.  Interim  restaging,  as 
defined  in Section  9.6, will be performed  at the conclusion  of 2 cycles  of clofarabine.  
The dose-limiting  toxicities  will be based  on the first cycle  of therapy.  
 
4.4 Duration  of therapy  
 
Treatment  may continue  as long as there  is a clinical  benefit  as defined  below  and the 
criteria  for removal  from  study  has not been  met as defined  in Section  13.0.  After  2 
cycles  of clofarabine,  patients  will be permitted  to receive  additional  cycles  if they have  
either  stable  disease  or a response  (PR or CR).  (Refer  to Section  12.2 for definitions  of 
response.)  After  4 cycles  of treatment,  only those  patients  who achieved  either  a PR or 
CR may receive  additional  cycles  of the study  drug.  Responding  patients  can be treated  
up to 2 cycles  beyond  their maximum  response.  
 
 
5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.2 Clofarabine  
 
Clofarabine  ([2-chloro -9-(2-deoxy -2-fluoro --D-arabinofuranosyl)  adenine];  Cl-F-ara-A; 
CAFdA)  is a second -generation  purine  nucleoside  analogue  which  was designed  as a hybrid  
molecule  of fludarabine  (F-ara-A) and cladribine  (2-CdA,  CdA).  Because  clofarabine  has a 
chloro  group  at the 2-position  of adenine,  its chemical  structure  is more  closely  related  to 
CdA  than to F-ara-A. Halogenation  at the 2-position  of adenine  renders  this class  of 
compounds  resistant  to cellular  degradation  by the enzyme  adenine  deaminase  [20].  
 
Clofarabine  is a white  to off white  solid.  It is formulated  at a concentration  of 1 mg/mL  in 
sodium  chloride  (9 mg/mL)  and water  for injection.  An investigational  supply  of clofarabine  
will be supplied  by Genzyme  in 2 vial sizes:  a 10 mL flint vial and a 20 mL flint vial. Then   
10 mL flint vial contains  5 mL (5mg)  of solution  and the 20 mL flint vial contains  20 mL (20 
mg) of solution.  Vials  should  be stored  at room  temperature  (15-30oC).  Clofarabine  is stable  
for 24 months  at 25oC and 60% relative  humidity  and for 6 months  at 40oC and 75% relative  
humidity.  Clofarabine  for injection  should  be filtered  through  a sterile  0.2 m syringe  filter  
and then further  diluted  with 5% dextrose  injection  (D5W)  USP or 0.9%  sodium  chloride  
injection  USP.  The resulting  admixture  can be stored  at room  temperature  but should  be used 
within  24 hours.  (See Investigator’s  Brochure)  
 
Clofarabine  is sequentially  metabolized  intracellularly  by deoxycytidine  kinase  to the active  
5’-triphosphate  metabolite.  It has a high affinity  for the activating  phosphorylating  enzyme,  
deoxycytidine  kinase,  equal  to or greater  than that of the natural  substrate,  deoxycytidine.  
Clofarabine  inhibits  DNA  synthesis  by decreasing  cellular  deoxynucleotide  triphosphate  
pools  through  an inhibitory  action  on ribonucleotide  reductase,  and by terminating  DNA  
chain  elongation  by competitive  inhibition  of DNA  polymerases.  The affinity  of clofarabine

triphosphate  for these  enzymes  is similar  to or greater  than that of deoxyadenosine  
triphosphate.  In preclinical  models,  clofarabine  has demonstrated  the ability  to inhibit  DNA  
repair  by incorporation  into the DNA  chain  during  the repair  process.  Clofarabine  5’- 
triphosphate  also disrupts  the integrity  of mitochondrial  membrane,  leading  to the release  of 
the pro-apoptotic  mitochondrial  proteins,  cytochrome  C and apoptosis -inducing  factor,  
leading  to programmed  cell death  [21-25]. 
 
Clofarabine  has been  shown  to be active  against  a wide  range  of in vivo and in vitro human  
tumor  models,  including  solid  and hematologic  tumor  types  [26].  Toxicology  studies  of 
clofarabine  in mice,  rats, and dogs  showed  that rapidly  proliferating  tissues  were  the primary  
target  organs  of toxicity,  and except  for the cardiotoxicity  and hepatotoxicity  seen in rats 
treated  with clofarabine,  these  results  were  similar  to those  observed  in studies  with 
cladribine  and fludarabine  [26] Additionally,  the developmental  toxicities,  including  growth  
retardation  and skeletal  alterations,  observed  in rats and rabbits  are characteristic  effects  of 
chemotherapeutic  agents  like cyclophospha mide  that are capable  of altering  the normal  
pattern  of apoptosis  and/or  altering  DNA  function  [26].  
 
To date,  there  are three  published  trials  investigating  clofarabine  in acute  leukemia,  solid  
tumors  and lymphoproliferative  disorders  [17-19]. The MTD  of clofarabine  in adult  patients  
has been  determined  to be 40 mg/m2/day in acute  leukemia,  which  is slightly  lower  than the 
tolerable  daily  dose for pediatric  patients,  52 mg/m2/d. Patients  with acute  leukemia  who 
were  treated  with higher  doses  of clofarabine  in the two phase  I and one phase  II trials  
experienced  grade  3 fatigue,  hypotension,  hyperbilirubinemia,  transaminitis,  
nausea/vomiting,  diarrhea,  rash and/or  palmoplantar  erythrodysesthesia.  The only grade  4 
toxicity  was hepatic  which  occurred  at 40 mg/m2/d in 3 adults  and 70 mg/m2/d in 1 child.  
Other  grade  1 or 2 toxicities  include  myalgias,  arthralgias,  anorexia,  constipation,  mucositis,  
edema,  drug fever  and neurologic  toxicity.  For the patients  with either  a solid  tumor  or 
lymphoproliferative  malignancy,  the dose-limiting  toxicity  was myelosuppression.  This was 
not a toxicity  for the leukemia  patients  since  myelosuppressive  toxicity,  for this patient   
group,  was defined  as marrow  with less than 5% cellularity  and without  evidence  of  
leukemia,  lasting  more  than 6 weeks  from  the start of therapy.  The non-hematologic  
toxicities  for the patients  with solid  tumors  or lymphoproliferative  disorders  occurred  
infrequently  and were  mild.  Grade  1 nausea  and anorexia  were  noted  in two out of 19 treated  
patients  [17].  Overall,  the treatment  was very well-tolerated.  
 
As of 01 October  2004,  a total of 377 patients  (245 adult  patients  and 132 pediatric  patients)  
have  been  treated  with clofarabine  in 4 phase  I trials,  6 phase  II trials,  and an emergency  
expanded  access  program  [27].  In patients  who were  treated  at dose levels  which  varied  
from  2 mg/m2/d  up to 70 mg/m2/d,  the most  common  toxicity  which  occurred  in 25% 
(94/377)  of patients  was a grade  3 or 4 infection.  The majority  of these  infections  were  of 
bacterial  origin.  A few of these  events  were  attributed  to fungus  (n=5)  or were  of a viral 
origin  (n=6).  Greater  than 5% of patients  but less than 10% had a Grade  3/4 fever  and/or

fever/neutropenia.  Except  for infection,  fever,  and fever/neutropenia,  there  were  no other  
non-hematologic  toxicities  which  occurred  in at least 5% of patients.  
 
A decrease  in left ventricular  systolic  function  of unclear  etiology  has been  observed  in 
pediatric  acute  leukemia  patients  (n=55)  treated  with clofarabine  at the 52 mg/m2/d dose  
level.  In the phase  II study  (unpublished  data)[28],  the change  in systolic  function  was 
transient  in the majority  of cases.  On close  inspection,  the timing  of the decrease  in systolic  
function  coincided  with other  clinical  events  such as sepsis  and may have  been related  to 
either  the clinical  event  itself  or the drug(s)  used to treat the problem.  Unfortunately,  in some  
cases,  the decrease  of LV function  occurred  when  clofarabine  was given  within  6 months  of 
the last anthracycline  dose,  making  it impossible  to determine  if the decline  was related  to 
clofarabine  or to the prior  anthracycline  therapy.  Of note,  clofarabine  was given  to one child  
with preexist ing severe  LV dysfunction  with no significant  further  deterioration.  
 
Small  pericardial  effusions  were  a frequent  finding.  They  did not result  in any significant  
hemodynamic  effect  and required  no intervention.  They  were  detected  more  frequently  in the 
initial  patients  entered  on the trial and the effusions  were  almost  absent  in the later patients.  
This may reflect  changes  in the protocol  made  to accommodate  the fluid  retention  seen in the 
early  patients  [28].  
 
Capillary  leak syndrome  also occurred  rarely  in 4 out of 60 pediatric  leukemia  patients  [28].  
Again,  all of the pediatric  patients  were  treated  at the 52 mg/m2/d dose.  There  were  2  
patients  who had grade  4 capillary  leak syndrome  which  resulted  in death  and may have  been  
from  the study  drug.  There  was one patient  had a grade  3 adverse  event.  Concurrent  medical  
conditions  such as sepsis  and/or  disease  progression  may have  made  these  patients   
susceptible  to this toxicity.  
 
In this study,  the starting  dose of 4 mg/m2/d for 3 consecutive  days was chosen  based  on the 
MTD  for both solid  and lymphoproliferative  disorders.  In all of the published  clofarabine  
trials,  patients  were  treated  for 5 consecutive  days.  With  a MTD  of 2 mg/m2/d, patients  with 
solid  and lymphoproliferative  disorders  received  a weekly  total dose of 10 mg/m2/wk. With  
a starting  dose of 4 mg/m2/d for 3 consecutive  days,  patients  will receive  12 mg/m2/wk. We 
predict  that the DLT  will occur  around  the third  dose level  since  it is defined  differently  
compared  to the prior  trials.  The DLT,  in this study,  is defined  in terms  of delayed  count  
recovery  rather  than grade  3 or 4 myelosuppression  at any time following  treatment.

sulfa  may receive  alternate  prophylaxis  such as aerosolized  pentamidine  300 mg 
once  per month.  PCP prophylaxis  will begin  with the first cycle  of chemotherapy.  
• Acyclovir  400 mg po bid or the renally  adjusted  equivalent  will be 
administered  as prophylaxis  against  Herpes  Zoster.  It will begin  with the first 
cycle  of chemotherapy.  
• Darbepoietin  or erythropoietin  may be administered  as per hospital  policy.  
Discontinuation  of either  of these  medications  or increasing  the dose is based  on 
standard  dose and response  criteria.  
• Growth  colony  stimulation  factor  should  be administered  beginning  24-72 hours  
after the conclusion  of each 3 day treatment  cycle.  The type and dose of the 
growth  colony  stimulation  factor  will be determined  as per hospital  policy.  
 
9.5 Re-treatment  criteria  
 
Patients  will receive  additional  cycles  of clofarabine  as long as they meet  the 
following  criteria  at the time  of re-treatment : 
 
• ANC  ≥ 1000  cell/µl  (or ANC  ≥ 500/µl  for patients  who were  enrolled  at this 
level  in the phase  II portion  of the trial only)  
• Platelet  ≥ 75,000  /µl (or platelet  ≥ 50,000/µl  for patients  who were  enrolled  at 
this level  in the phase  II portion  of the trial only)  
• Non-hematologic  toxicity:  if the toxicity  is less severe  than a grade  4 
infection  and/or  a grade  4 hemorrhage,  and it resolves  to ≤ grade  1 or baseline  
as per CTCAE  v3.0 toxicity  criteria  at the time of retreatment.  
 
Repeat  cycles  of clofarabine  are administered  on approximately  a 21 day schedule  
unless  the patient  does not meet  re-treatment  criteria  as defined  above.  For those  
patients  who do not meet  the above  parameters  at the day 22 ± 2 evaluation,  their next 
cycle  of therapy  may be held up to 2 weeks.  After  any treatment  delay,  the patient  
will be re-evaluated  the following  week  (up to day 36 ± 2 days).  If the patient  meets  
re-treatment  criteria  at the next evaluation,  the next cycle  of clofarabine  will be 
administered  at the full dose.  If the patient  does not meet  re-treatment  criteria  at both 
the day 29 ± 2 and the day 36 ± 2 evaluation,  this patient  will be removed  from  the 
study  unless  there  has been  a prior  documented  response  (CR or PR) to therapy .

9.7.3 Progression  of disease  
Patients  with progression  of disease  at any time will be declared  treatment  failures  
and removed  from  the study.  
 
9.8 Dose  reduction  
 
Patients  can be retreated  with  clofarabine  at a reduced  dose  if all the following  
conditions  are met:  
 
• Clinical  or radiologic  response  (PR or CR) 
• The non-hematologic  toxicities  in the prior  cycle  were  not a life-threatening  
infection  or hemorrhage  
• Re-treatment  criteria  have  been  met as defined  in section  9.4 
 
Determination  of Dose  
If the above  conditions  are met, patients  will be treated  at the next lower  dose level.  
 
 
10.0  EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
10.1 Prior  to each cycle  of chemotherapy,  the patient  will have an interval  history,  
toxicity  evaluation  and physical  examination,  including  vital signs,  and 
performance  status.  
10.2 CBC  with differential,  and comprehensive  profile  will be required  prior  to each 
cycle  of chemotherapy.  
10.3 After  completion  of 2 cycles  of clofarabine,  the patient  will be assessed  or 
reassessed  for response  as per section 9.6. 
10.4 If the patient  has achieved  a complete  response  (CR),  a repeat bone  marrow  
biopsy  will be performed  only in those  cases  where  it had been  previously  
positive.  
10.5 Following  completion  of the treatment  plan,  responding  patients  should  be 
followed  at three  month  intervals  for the first two years  post-therapy  to document  
duration  of response.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
As stated  in section  5.0, the dose-limiting  toxicity  for patients  with solid  tumors  or lymphoid  
malignancies  was myelosuppression.  For the patients  with acute  leukemia  who were  treated  with 
much  higher  doses  of clofarabine  (40-52 mg/m2/d), the dose-limiting  toxicity  was hepatotoxicity  
and rash.  More  specifically,  potential  toxicities  include  hyperbilirubinemia,  transaminitis,  
neutropenia,  leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia,  nausea,  and vomiting.  Other  side effects  
which  have  been  seen rarely  in early  trials  include  rash,  myalgia,  fatigue,  diarrhea,  constipation,  
mucositis,  urinary  incontinence,  headache,  fever,  chills,  anorexia,  palmar -plantar  
erythrodysesthesia,  anxiety,  bone  pain,  cough,  tachycardia,  congestive  heart  failure,  abdominal  
pain,  seizure,  hypertension,  respiratory  distress,  and capillary  leak syndrome.  
 
An objective  of this study  is to obtain  information  on the safety  and efficacy  of clofarabine  for 
patients  with previously  treated  mature  T-and NK-cell lymphoma.  It is the Investigator’s  
obligation  to report  all adverse  experiences  (AE’s),  regardless  of association  with study  drugs.  
 
11.2 Definitions  of AE’s  
 
11.2.1  Adverse  Experience : An AE is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a 
patient  administered  a pharmaceutical  product  which  does not necessarily  have  a causal  
relationship  or association  with the treatment.  Laboratory  abnormalities  should  only be 
recorded  as AE’s  if they are associated  with clinical  sequelae  and/or  require  an intervention.  
11.2.2  Serious  Adverse  Experience  (SAE) : An SAE  is considered  to be any experience  
occurring  at any dose that results  in any of the following  outcomes:  (1) is fatal or life- 
threatening  ("Life -threatening"  means  that the event,  as it actually  happened,  placed  the 
subject  at immediate  risk of death.),  (2) is disabling,  (3) results  in hospitalization  or 
prolongation  of hospitalization,  or (4) results  in congential  anomaly  or occurrence  of 
malignancy.  Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death  may be considered  SAE’s  
when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  and may 
require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this 
definition.  
11.2.3  Expected  Adverse  Experience:  Any AE that is identified  in the current  
Investigator’s  Brochure  or in Section  5 and/or  Section  11 is considered  an expected  AE. 
11.2.4  Unexpected  Adverse  Experience : An AE which  is not previously  reported  (in 
nature,  severity,  or incidence)  in the current  Investigator’s  Brochure  or general  
investigational  plan.

11.3 Serious  Adverse  Experience  Reporting  Requirements  
 
For Participating  Sites:  
 
Any SAE  will be reported  to the local  institution’s  IRB.  In addition,  it will need  to be sent to 
MSKCC  as the coordinating  center  and Genzyme  as soon  as possible  but no later than 5 days 
from  the onset  of the event.  
 
The Study  PI will fax a copy  of all SAE’s  within  5 days to outside  site principal  investigators  
to report  to their own local  IRB’s.  
 
Participating  sites should  send the following  information  to the coordinating  center:  
 
1. The initials  of the subjects,  patient  MRN  #, MSKCC  protocol  # and title 
2. The date the event  occurred  
3. A description  of the SAE  
4. An explanation  of how the SAE  was handled  
5. A description  of the subject's  condition  
6. Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
7. Indication  if the event  is considered  related  to the treatment  (drug,  device,intervention)  
8. Indication  if an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form  as a 
result  of the SAE.  
9. Name  of the site and person  reporting  the event  
Refer  to section  17.2.  
11.4 SAE  Followup  
 
For all SAEs  occurring  during  the study,  within  30 days of the last administration  of study  
drug,  or prior  to alternative  therapy  (whichever  occurs  first),  the investigator  must  submit  
follow -up reports  to Genzyme  regarding  the patient’s  subsequent  course  until the SAE  has 
subsided,  or until the condition  stabilizes  (in the case of persistent  impairment),  the patient  
receives  alternative  treatment,  or the patient  dies. 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  and progression  of disease  will be evaluated  in this study  using  a modification  
of the international  criteria  proposed  by the Cheson  et al. [29].

12.1.1  Measurable  disease:  Measurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be accurately  
measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  as > 15 mm with 
conventional  techniques  (PET,  CT, MRI,  x-ray). All tumor  measurements  must  be 
recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
12.1.2  Non-measurable  disease : All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  small  lesions  
(longest  diameter  < 15 mm with conventional),  are considered  non-measurable  disease.  
Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphoma  
cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  abdominal  masses  (not followed  by CT or 
MRI),  and cystic  lesions  are all non-measurable.  
 
12.2 Response  Criteria  
 
Response  criteria  will be based  on assessment  following  every  2 cycles  of clofarabine.  The 
criteria  are as follows  (GTD  = Greatest  Transverse  Diameter;  SPD = Sum of the Products  of 
the Greatest  Diameter):  
 
12.2.1  Complete  Remission  (CR):  
• No clinical,  radiographic  or diagnostic  evidence  of disease.  
• No disease  related  symptoms.  
• Abnormal  biochemical  values  (eg. LDH)  clearly  attributable  to lymphoma  must  
have  normalized.  
• Lymph  nodes,  nodal  masses  regressed  to “normal”  size: 
• If >1.5 cm before  treatment,  regressed  to ≤ 1.5 cm in GTD.  
• If 1.1 to 1.5 cm before  treatment,  regressed  to ≤ 1 cm in GTD  (or >75%  in 
SPD).  
• Spleen  and all previously  enlarged  organs  decreased  in size. Spleen  must  not be 
palpable  on exam  
• Bone  marrow  free of disease  on repeat  aspirate  and biopsy  if initially  positive.  
• Normalization  of PET scans.  
 
12.2.2  Complete  Remission/unconfirmed  (CRU):  
Patients  meeting  the above  criteria  for CR with the following  exceptions:  
• Residual  node  mass  of >1.5 cm in GTD  regressed  by > 75% in SPD 
• Individual  nodes  previously  confluent  regressed  by >75%  in SPD 
• Indeterminate  bone  marrow  (increased  number  or size of lymphoid  aggregates  
without  cytologic  or architectural  atypia.)  
 
12.2.3  Partial  Remission  (PR)  
• ≥ 50% decrease  in SPD of the six largest  dominant  nodes/nodal  masses.  
• No increase  in size of other  nodes,  liver or spleen.

IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  06-065A(4)  
Amended:  8/26/08  
- 22 -  
  
 
• Splenic  and hepatic  nodes  regressed  at least 50% in SPD 
• No new sites of disease.  
• Bone  marrow  and organs  other  than the spleen  and liver cannot  be considered  
for evaluation  for PR because  involvement  at these  sites is considered  evaluable  
but not measurable.  
 
12.2.4  PET negative  Partial  Remission  (PET - PR) 
• Patient  meets  above  criteria  for PR with resolution  of previous  PET positive  
lesions.  
 
12.2.4  Stable  Disease  (SD)  
• Patients  who have  achieved  less than a partial  remission  but who have  not 
developed  findings  consistent  with progressive  disease.  
 
12.2.5  Progressive  Disease  (PD)  
• In patients  previously  CR, Cru, PR or SD. 
• ≥ 50% increase  in SPD of any previously  identified  abnormal  node.  
• Appearance  of any new lesion  during  or at the end of therapy  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
• Ineligibility  of the patient  as defined  in inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
• Significant  protocol  violation  
• Non-compliance  of the patient  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  which  in the judgment  of the investigator  and/or  treating  physician  
renders  further  treatment  on protocol  contrary  to the patient’s  best medical  interest.  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue  treatment  and/or  observation  
• Unrelated  medical  illness  or complication  that increases  the risk of protocol  therapy  to 
unacceptable  levels.  
• Progression  of disease  
• Decision  by the Investigator  that termination  is in the patient's  best medical  interest.  
• Loss  to follow -up 
• Death  of the patient

14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
14.2 Study  Endpoints  
 
The two major  objectives  of this study  are: (1) to determine  the maximum  tolerated  dose of 
intravenous  clofarabine  using  the schedule  outlined  above  in patients  with relapsed  T- and 
NK-cell lymphomas  and (2) to determine  the response  rate at this defined  dose.  
 
14.3 Study  Design  
 
To accomplish  the first objective,  an accelerated  titration  design  will be used for the first 
patient.  The next patient  can be treated  at the next dose level  using  the accelerated  titration  
design  if the currently  treated  patient  does not had the following:  1) a grade  2 non- 
hematologic  toxicity,  or 2) a delay  in the recovery  of platelets  or neutrophils  at the day 22 ± 2 
day evaluation.  
 
If either  of these  criteria  has been  met (listed  above),  a standard  titration  scheme  will be used 
where  groups  of at least three  patients  will be treated  with escalating  doses  of clofarabine.  A 
modified  Fibonacci  design  was used to determine  the size of the dose escalations.  
 
Regardless  of whether  an accelerated  or standard  titration  design  is used,  a patient  cannot  be 
enrolled  to the next dose level  (next  cohort)  until all patients  within  the current  cohort  satisfy  
one of the following:  1) the patient  is off study,  or 2) the patient  has started  the next cycle  of 
clofarabine.  
 
 
14.4 Dose -Escalation  of clofarabine  
 
Patients  will be entered  on the study  and treated  with clofarabine  at an escalating  dose as 
defined  in section  9.2. Dose  escalation  will proceed  as follows:  
 
14.4.1  Accelerated  titration  design  
 
• The next patient  will be treated  at the next dose level,  if the patient  does not have  
either:  1) a grade  2 non-hematologic  toxicity,  or 2) a delay  in the recovery  of 
platelets  or neutrophils  at the day 22 ± 2 day evaluation.  
 
If the above  criteria  have  not been  met, the next patient  will be enrolled  at the same  
dose level  using  the standard  titration  design.  See section  14.3.2.

Refer  to section  14.4 for the definition  of DLT and MTD.  
 
• If none  of the initial  three  patients  in a cohort  experience  dose-limiting  toxicity  
(DLT), then a new cohort  of three  patients  will be treated  at the next higher  dose 
level.  
 
• If one of the three  patients  in a cohort  experiences  DLT, then up to three  additional  
patients  will be treated  at the same  dose level.  Escalation  will continue  if        
only one of the six patients  experiences  DLT. 
 
• If two or more  patients  in a cohort  experience  DLT, then the maximum  tolerated  
dose (MTD)  will have  been  exceeded,  and no further  dose escalations  will occur.  
The previous  dose level  will be considered  the MTD.  
 
• If only three  patients  were  treated  at a dose level  under  consideration  as the MTD,  
then up to three  additional  patients  will be accrued.  If no more  than one of the six 
patients  at that dose level  experience  DLT, then that dose level  will be confirmed  
as the MTD.  If two or more  patients  in that cohort  experience  DLT, then the 
previous  dose level  will be studied  in the same  fashion.

all patients  within  the current  cohort  satisfy  one of the following:  1) the patient(s)  are off 
study,  or 2) the patient(s)  have  started  the next cycle  of clofarabine.  
 
14.5 Definitions  of DLT and MTD  
 
DLT  is defined  as any of the following:  
 
• ≥ Grade  2 thrombocytopenia  (platelet  < 75,000)  lasting  ≥ 36 ± 2 days  from  first 
day of clofarabine  infusion,  
 
• ≥ Grade  3 non-hematologic  toxicity  according  to NCI’s CTCAE  v 3.0 
 
MTD  is defined  as the highest  dose studied  for which  the incidence  of DLT is less than 
33%.  The percentage  of patients  who experience  toxicity  at each dose level  will be 
calculated,  with a 95% confidence  interval.  
 
14.6 Efficacy  of single -agent  clofarabine  
 
The purpose  of the phase  II portion  of the trial is to estimate  the response  rate for single - 
agent  clofarabine  using  the maximum  tolerated  dose with the schedule  outlined  above.  A 
Simon  minimax  two-stage  design  will be used in which  a 10% response  rate is considered  
not promising,  a 35% is considered  promising,  and the probabilities  of a type I error  
(falsely  accepting  a non-promising  therapy)  and type II error  (falsely  rejecting  a promising  
therapy)  are both set at 0.10.  In this scenario,  the maximum  number  of                   
patients  accrued  to the phase  II portion  of the trial would  be 18 patients.  In the first stage  
of the design,  8 patients  will be accrued,  i.e., an additional  2 patients  to those  who were  
treated  at the MTD  in the phase  I portion.  If one or more responses  (either  a PR or CR) 
are observed  among  these  8 patients,  then an additional  10 patients  will be accrued  to the 
second  stage.  If there  are no responses  (PR or CR) among  the initial  8 patients,  the trial 
will be discontinued.  
 
Using  the minimax  design,  there  is a 43% probability  of stopping  the trial early  due to a 
non-promising  therapy,  or less than a 10% response  rate. The drug is worthy  of further  
investigation  if there  are 4 or more  responses  (PR or CR) of the 18 patients  treated  at the 
MTD.  The design  yields  at least a 90% probability  of a true positive  result  if the 
response  rate (CR or PR) is at least 35%.

14.7 Toxicity  and Response  
 
Frequencies  of toxicities  based  on NCI CTCAE,  v 3.0 and response  (using  the criteria  in 
Section  12.0)  will be tabulated.  
 
14.8 Patient  Accrual  and Duration  of Study  
 
A minimum  number  of three  patients  and a maximum  number  of 48 patients  will be 
needed  to complete  this study  if we assume  that there  are no more  than 5 dose levels  
using  the standard  titration  design.  The Lymphoma  Service  will see approximately  1-2 
patients  each month  who meet  eligibility  requirements  for this trial. The amount  of time 
required  to complete  this trial will depend  on the number  of dose levels  studied,  the 
number  of patients  accrued  to each dose level,  and the number  of responses  seen in the 
first stage  of the phase  II portion  of the study.  We anticipate  that this trial will take 
approximately  1.5 years  to complete.

16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth  by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html .  The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials  are monitored  for data,  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and 
II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  
trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for it’s 
level  of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation

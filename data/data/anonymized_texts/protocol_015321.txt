 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  Testing Product Messages in Colombia  
Funder  Bloomberg Philanthropies  
Study Rationale  According to the WHO, obesity and overweight are health 
conditions afflicting over a billion people worldwide. Obesity and 
overweight can lead to numerous health problems including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and various types of cancers (1). Colombia is not immune to this globa l 
health problem. In Colombia in 2016, more than half of adults were overweight and more than 22 percent of adults were obese (2). Additionally, obesity and overweight impact Colombian children. The Colombian Ministry of Health reports that approximately 1 8% 
of Colombian youth are overweight (3). As a result of this increasing health problem, the Colombian government has begun to take actions to address overweight and obesity in Colombia. The Colombian government  (the Congress, the Ministry of Health) 
recently approved a law  that would require warnings on the front of 
packages high in critical nutrients  to inform consumers and reduce 
the intake of these unhealthy foods and beverages (4). Similar laws have been implemented in countries around the world, such as 
Chile, Peru, and Israel (5). Research is needed to inform the design of this law. The purpose of this study is to test the potential effectiveness of different labels to be used on the packaging of foods and drinks to promote healthy diets in Colombia. This research is time sensitive and politically relevant and will help to inform Colombian Ministry of Health as to how product labeling will 
help to dissuade consumption and inform Colombians of product 
healthfulness  prior to the implementation.  
Study Objective(s)  Primary  
• To identify the impact of nutrient warnings on product 
selection and other outcomes compared to GDA labels, 
Nutriscore labels, and a no -label control, in Colombia.  
Secondary  
• To determine the effect of the nutrient warning label and 
the impact of the nutrient warning label on behavioral outcomes .
 
Study Design  
 Participants will electronically acknowledge their consent to 
participate in the study . The study platform (Qualtrics ) will 
randomize  participants to one of the four front -of-package label 
5 
 conditions: nutrient warning, Nutri -Score, GDA, or a no -label 
control. The participants will complete a fruit -drink selection task, 
inquiring about healthfulness of fruit drinks with each des ignated 
front- of-package label. After completing the fruit- drink task, the 
participant will complete a single product assessment task. After 
these, the participants will answer  objective understanding and 
perceived message effectiveness  questions about a  breakfast cereal.  
Finally, the participants will see one product with all three label types and select the most discouraging label. The study will end 
with  standard demographic questions . 
Subject Population  
key criteria for Inclusion 
and Exclusion:  Inclusi on Criteria  
1. 18 years old or older  
2. Currently reside in Colombia  
Exclusion Criteria  
        1. Participated  in previous studies linked to this study  
Number Of Subjects  Approximately 8,000 
Study Duration  Each subject’s participation will last approximately 15- 20 minutes.  
The entire study is expected to last 1 month . 
Study Phases  (1) Screening: screening for eligibility and obtaining consent  
(2) Randomization: Randomly assigning participants to one of four  
conditions  
(3) Survey: Direct participants to a Qualtrics survey measuring 
product selection and  perceptions  and reactions  to front- of-package 
labels , as well as standard demographics.   
Statistical Analysis Plan  We will descriptively report unadjusted means (and standard 
deviations) and percentages for the primary and secondary 
outcomes.  We will use linear regression for continuous outcomes 
and logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes. We will conduct 
pairwise comparisons of the predicted means to examine differences  by all label types. We will examine whether primary 
outcomes differ by education . 
DATA AND SAFETY 
MONITORING PLAN Researchers will store the study data on a remote terminal server, and only research investigators and staff will have access to the data.

 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Introduction  
According to the WHO, obesity and overweight are health conditions afflicting over a billion 
people worldwide. Obesity and overweight can lead to numerous health problems including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and various types of cancers (1). Colombia is not immune to this global health problem. In Colombia in 2016, more than half of adults were overweight and more than 22 percent of adults were obese (2). Additionally, obesity and overweight impact Colombian children. The C olombian Ministry of Health reports that 
approximately 18% of Colombian youth are overweight (3).  
 
As a result of this increasing health problem, the Colombian government has begun to take actions to address overweight and obesity in Colombia. The Colombian government (the Congress, the Ministry of Health) passed a law  in 2021 that would require nutrient warnings on 
the front of packages high in critical nutrients  to inform consumers and reduce the intake of 
these unhealthy foods and beverages (4). Similar laws have been implemented in countries around the world, such as Chile, Peru, and Israel (5).  
 
Research is needed to inform the design of this law. The purpose of this study is to test the 
potential effectiveness of different labels  to be used on the packaging of foods and drinks to 
promote healthy diets in Colombia. This research is time sensitive and politically relevant and will 
help to inform Colombian Minis try of Health as to how product labeling will help to dissuade 
consumption and inform Colombians of product healthfulness prior to the implementation.  
STUDY OBJECTIVE   
The purpose of this study is to determine what type of front- of-package label, whether a 
Nutri -Score label, nutrient warning label , or a guideline daily amount  (GDA)  label 
discourage purchases of “high in” fruit drink products for a dult Colombian  consumers.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
o Selection of the less healthy fruit drink as the fruit drink the participant would 
rather buy . 
o Correctly identifying which fruit drink was higher in sugar . 
Secondary Outcomes   
o Perceived message effectiveness . 
o Purchase likelihood of a product in the next week if it were available. 
o Percentage of participants that correctly identify the less healthy product when 
selecting between two products . 
o Percentage of participants who correctly identify that the product contains excess 
sugar, satur ated fat, or sodium . 
o Percentage of participants selecting each nutrient label as most discouraging them from consuming the product.

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN (brief overview)  
Study Design  
The study design is a between -subjects rando mized controlled trial. Qualtrics  will 
randomly assign participants to one of four study arms in the Qualtrics survey. 
Participants will have an equal chance of being randomized to any of the trial arms.  
 Study Arms:  
1. Control Arm: no warning labels  
2. Nutri -Score Label Arm : one label with a color -coded ranking A -E of the relative 
healthfulness of a product.  
3. Nutrient Warning Label : one black, octagonal warning label with the text: “Execeso de 
[azúcares ; grasas saturadas; or /sal/sodio] . Minsalud” followe d by the text: “Evitar Su 
Alto Consumo”  
4. Guideline Daily Amount Label Arm: five blue rectangular boxes including calories, 
total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium given in kcal, g, respectively, and mg for 
sodium. Followed by the text: “De los valores d iarios de referencia de nutrientes en 
una dieta de 2000 kcal.”  
 
 
In Qualtrics , participants will be asked to complete three tasks . The products  presented in 
each task will have a Nutri -Score label, nutrient label, GDA label, or no labels , depending 
on which arm the participant has been randomized to .  

8 
  
As the purpose of the study is  to inform Colombia’s front -of-package labeling policy, we 
set out to test front- of-package labels that have been implemented in other countries. 
Potential labeling options were determined through consultation with a food and health 
advocacy coalition in Colombia, who provided insight on which labels were most likely to 
be proposed as regulatory options in the Colombian legislature or Ministry of Health. As a 
resu lt of these conversations, we decided to compare the GDA label (which the food 
industry has promoted), Nutri -Score label, and a no- label alternative to the nutrient 
warnings on specific outcomes related to identifying and discouraging selection of ultra -
processed foods. We hypothesized that the nutrient warnings would perform best on all 
outcomes, as previous research has found nutrient warnings to perform best on such 
outcomes  (6). 
 
After completing drink/product selection task, participants will complete a Qualtrics survey measuring reactions to and perceptions of all three labels  as well as standard 
demographics. Upon completion, participants will earn a pre- determined amount of 
points from Offerwise for completing the stu dy. Participants are able to convert points 
into money once they accumulate a specified amount.  
 
Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects  
Participation in the study will last approximately 15 -20 minutes . The entire study is 
expected to  last one month . 
 
Study Population  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. 18 years old or older  
2. Currently reside in Colombia  
 
Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Participation in previous studies linked to this study  
STUDY PROCEDURES (what will be done)  
Study Steps  
Participants  will be recruited through Offerwise, a market research company with over 
300,000 panel participants in Colombia. If interested, panel members will complete a 
screener in Qualtrics to see if they are eligible. If they are not eligible, panel members will 
be redirected to a termination page indicating th ey are not eligible to participate. If they 
are eligible, panel members will  be redirected to a consent form. If they agree to the 
consent form, they will acknowledge their consent by clicking an arrow to proceed to the 
study.  
 
9 
 Following online consent, Qualtrics will equally randomize participants to one of the four 
front- of-package label conditions: nutrient warning, Nutri -Score, GDA, or a no -label 
condition . On Qualtrics, participants will complete three tasks . They will be asked to 
complete a selection task, in which participants will be  asked to select which fruit drink is  
higher in sugar, which they would rather buy, and which is  most unhealthy. The fruit 
drinks will be  displayed with the labels corres ponding to the participant’s randomly 
assigned label condition . We will only include selection tasks for one type of product due 
to survey space constraints . Following the selection tasks, the participant will be asked to 
complete a single product assessment task . They  will view a prompt that read s: “The next 
questions are about food products. You will look at a few different products and answer 
questions about each one. Please keep in mind that this study seeks to evaluate your  
survey responses and not the sale of the product.” Then, they will answer  a series of 
questions about the yogurt, cookies, and sliced bread, which will show  the participant’s 
randomly assigned label condition.  The participants will answer  all questions about one 
product at a time (di splayed in random order). After these, the participants will answer  
objective understanding and PME questions about the breakfast cereal. The breakfast cereal is always displayed last as the nutrient warning condition contain s two labels.  
Finally, the part icipants will be  randomly assigned to see the yogurt, cookies, or sliced 
bread again (one product only). However, this time, the product will not fashion a label. 
Instead, the three label types (nutrient warnings, GDA, and Nutri -Score) will be  displayed 
underneath the product and the participant will be  asked to select the most discouraging 
label. The study will end  with standard demographic qu estions . 
 
Subject Completion/Withdrawal Procedures  
A study participant is determined to have completed the study when they have finished 
and exited the study survey. To withdraw their data from the study, a participant would 
have to contact the study team or the university IRB.  
 
Screen Failure Procedures  
Prior to entering into the study, individuals will complete a survey screener. If the 
individual is younger than 18 years old  or does not live in Colombia, they will be deemed 
ineligible. Such participants will be redirected to a screen notifying them that they are 
ineligible for the study.  
SCREENING AND MONITORING EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS 
(how measurements will be made)  
Measurements will include results fro m the selection and assessment tasks as well as 
subjective responses by participants.  Second ary outcomes will include a variety of 
measurements, including perceived message effectiveness , 5-point Likert scale 
questions, and identification  questions.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN     
Hypotheses  
Primary Outcomes  
The overall purpose of this study is to identify the impact of nutrient warnings on product 
selection and other outcomes compared to GDA labels, Nutriscore labels, and a no -label 
control, in Colombia. The primary objectives of this study are to  evaluate our hypotheses 
that, compared to GDA, Nutriscore, and control, a nutrient warning label will lead to:   
 1. Lower selection of the less healthy product in a set of two products as the product 
the consumer most wants to buy.     
2. Better ability to correctly identify which product of a set of two has higher levels of sugar.    
 
We will also explore whether the impact of the nutrient warning (vs. other study 
conditions) on these two primary outcomes di ffer by respondent’s educational level.  
 
11 
 Secondary Outcomes 
We hypothesize that the nutrient warning label (compared to other label types) will:  
 1. Have higher perceived message effectiveness . 
2. Be the most discouraging label . 
 
We hypothesize that the nutrient warning label (compared to all other conditions) –  and 
all conditions compared to the control –  will: 
 1. Increase the ability to correctly identify the most unhealthy product when compared 
with two options . 
2. Increase the ability to correctly identify  whether a single product contains excess 
sugar, saturated fat, or sodium . 
3. Lower intentions of purchasing a product high in the nutrient of concern in the next week if it were available.  
 
Statistical Methods  
We will use complete case analysis to handle an y missing data. We will descriptively 
report unadjusted means (and standard deviations) and percentages for the primary and 
secondary outcomes.  
 
We will use a two- sided critical alpha of 0.05 to conduct all statistical tests.  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
 
For PME, we will take the average of the 3 items for each product type if alpha>.70. For 
all outcomes assessed between -subjects only, we will then assess whether the outcomes 
vary by study arm with regression models (linear for continuous outcomes and logi stic for 
dichotomous outcomes).  
 For outcomes with multiple measurements per -person, we will fit mixed effects linear 
regression models for continuous outcomes (including PME) and a mixed effects logistic regression model for binary outcomes (including pr oduct selection, label selection, 
identification of healthier products), treating the intercept as random to account for repeated measures.   
 We will include indicator variables for warning message (between -subjects) and product 
type (within -subjects), as well as an interaction of warning message and product type. 
We will use postestimation commands to conduct pairwise comparisons of the predicted means to examine differences by all label types. We will correct for multiple 
comparisons. To evaluate the most  discouraging label, we examine the proportion of 
participants that selected each warning label as the most discouraging and will conduct z-
12 
 tests to explore statistical significance of these differences. To assess whether the effect 
of the warning label on  the primary outcomes differs by education, we will test for an 
interaction of warning label with low versus high education level (specified as dummy 
variables) and use a Wald chunk test to determine the joint interaction. We will use 
postestimation comman ds to predict means by warning label and education level and 
conduct pairwise comparisons of the predicted means.      
 
Sample Size and Power  
Using an ANOVA model in G.Power. 3.1.9.4, we estimate  that with a sample of ~8,000, 
alpha of 0.05, and 80% power, we can detect an effect of f=0.037 for each of the primary 
outcomes between each arm and the control, which translates to an odds ratio of 1.14.  
 
Outliers and Exclusions  
We will exclude participants from analysis if they are  duplicate responders, complete  the 
study in less than two minutes, or if they do  not answer at least one primary or 
secondary outcome . 
SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
Provided that this study is conducted completely  online, and participants do not have any 
interactions with study staff there is no anticipation of adverse events. However, the 
investigators have provided an email to contact as well as the IRB contact information, on the consent form , should a participant be concerned about any aspects of the research 
study.  
DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGMENT  
Researchers will store the study data on a remote terminal server, and only research investigators and staff will have access to the data.   
RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  
Participants will be Offerwise participants who have voluntarily signed up to complete 
tasks remotely, including research surveys. Our study sample will include only those who self-enroll in the study based on interest, availability, and meeting the inclusi on criteria. 
There is no specific advertisement for this study. Rather, Offerwise identifies  users for the 
survey based on the inclusion criteria (age 18 or older  and resides in Colombia)  and 
informs them of the study opportunity . 
CONSENT PROCESS  
To provide consent, individuals will first complete a survey screener in Qualtrics. If they 
are eligible for the study, they will be redirected to the study consent form. If the participant agrees to the consent form, they are informed that by continuing to the study, they are consenting to participate. The consent process is completed entirely online, and at no point in the study do participants interact with the study team.

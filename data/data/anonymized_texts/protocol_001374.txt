Study Description:  
This randomized, double -blind, active - and placebo- controlled, 3- arm, 3 -period crossover study is 
designed to validate the DIDS scenarios using the CRCDS -2 driving simulator by assessing the acute 
effects of cannabis relative to placebo on simulated driving performance. Assay sensitivity will be 
demonstrated by the significant effect of alprazolam 0.75 mg on driving and cognitive endpoints.  
 
Following a screening/training period of up to 14 days, eligible subject s will be admitted to NADS on 
Day 1  of Perio d 1. B aseline performance for  cognitive testing will be obtained and subjects will 
practice the CRCDS2 -MiniSim driving simulator , then they will be taken to a supervised off -site 
residen tial facility from the end of Day 1 procedures until the start of proc edures on Day 2. Subject s 
will be randomized 1:1:1 into one of 6 treatment sequences as shown in the table below  on Day 1. 
Study drug will be administered by inhalation on Day 2 ( first subject dosed at approximately 08:40) ; 
precise timing is relative, as subject dosing will be staggered/offset to accommodate staffing and 
subject flow . Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn pre- dose and again 40 
minutes post -dose and 3.25 hours post -dose. Symbol Digit Coding (SDC) , Pathfinder Number (PFN), 
Readiness to Drive Question, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) will be administered 
approximately 30 minutes post -dose. Driving assessments will begin approximately 45 minutes 
following dosing (i.e., at approximately 09 :25). Driving performance will be assessed via the 
approximate 1- hour Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS), on the CRCDS2- MiniSim driving 
simulator, comprised of suburban, urban and highway driving tasks. The scenario includes challenges 
design ed to assess lane position control, speed control, safety awareness and responsivity, driving-
related decision making, multitasking, and vigilance . Immediately after completing the driving 
simulation, subjects will be administered the visual analog scales,  or VAS, followed by the cognitive 
test battery ( SDC, Visual Sequence Comparison [VSC] , Divided Attention Test – Dual [DAT -Dual], 
PFN, SDC Delayed Recall [SDCDR], Shifting Attention Test – Instruction, Matching to Sample 
[MTS] , Dual Task Test  – Combined [D T Combined], and Test of Variables of Attention [TOVA] ). At 
approximately 3.5 hours post -dose the cognitive test battery (i.e., SDC, VSC, DAT -Dual, PFN, 
SDCDR, SAT Instruction, MTS, DT Combined, TOVA ) and self -report measures will be repeated.  
 
  
 5  Subject s will undergo initial driving simulator training and practice during the Screening period and 
will complete a practice drive on Day 1 of each treatment period.  
 
Subject s will be discharged from NADS  on the afternoon of Day 2 of each period approximately 5.33 
hours post -dose, provided they are medically stable for discharge in the opinion of the Investigator  
based on the criteria established by the medical monitor . The subject  will not be able to drive 
themselves home and will have transportation arranged. 
 
After a washout of at least 7 days and no more than 10 days between administration of the last dose in 
one period and administration of the first dose in the next period, subject s will be readmitted to 
NADS  on Day 1 of Period 2 and receive study drug accor ding to the assigned treatment schedule. All 
study assessments will remain the same as in Period 1. The same process will be repeated for Period 
3.  
 
Seven days (±2  days) after discharge from Period 3, subject s will receive a follow -up/end- of-study 
phone c all from the site to evaluate the presence of any AEs and collect any new concomitant 
medication/procedure information.

changes to the SAP following da tabase lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
Analysis Sets 
Randomized Set : All subject s who are randomized  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) : all randomized and treated subject s that have at least one primary efficacy 
measure (SDLP) in any t reatment period.  
Safety Set  (SS)  will include all subject s administered at least one dose of any study drug.  
PK Set  will include subject s in the Safety Set who have at least one collected blood sample from 
which a valid blood concentration can be measured.  
Primary analysis  
The FAS will be used for the primary analysis.  
The comparison of primary interest is cannabis versus placebo (Day 2) as a function of frequency of 
self-reported cannabis use. The statistical significance of alprazolam versus placebo (p<0.05) 
comparison for SDLP is considered only to validate the experi ment as having the ability to detect 
effects (i.e., assay sensitivity).  
Formal statistical tests (when performed) will be 2 -sided and tested at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance.  
Secondary Analyses  
The FAS will be used for secondary analyses.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of cannabis  will be assessed by the incidence of TEAEs, and by changes from 
baseline in vital signs, ECG parameters, and suicidal ideation and behavior using the C -SSRS.  
Safety data will be listed by subject  and summarized by treatment. All safety summaries will be 
performed on the SS.  
PK Analyses  
  
 9  The potential relationship between THC  blood  concentration and SDLP or other driving or cognition 
endpoints will be examined using regression techniques.

    5. INTRODUCTION 
Following recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  that the 
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) establish a list of approved medications and classes of 
medications that may be used safely when operating a vehicle (NTSB, 2000 as cited in Kay and Loga, 2011) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  released its Drugs 
and Human Performance Fact Sheets  (Cooper & Logan, 2004, as cited in Kay and Logan 2011) 
representing the current scientific knowledge in the area of drugs and human performance for 16 substances. However, studies determining effects on performance and on driving reflect myriad study methodologies . Similar efforts by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA, 2007 as 
cited in Kay and Logan, 2011) and by the European Union to produce lists characterizing the impairing effects of drugs yiel ded similarly fraught issues regarding the inability to generalize 
results secondary to methodological differences across studies . Subsequently, NHTSA convened 
an expert panel in 2008 and 2009 (Kay and Logan, 2011) with the goal of determining whether a list of drugs could be developed indicating which drugs or classes of drugs may pose a risk to driving.   Kay and Logan (2011) reported that the panel agreed that a limited number of drugs generally pose a low risk to driving when taken according to approved prescribing information under appropriate medical oversight. However, the panel also recognized that even among drugs generally considered safe for driving, adverse reactions and interactions may occur that could impair driving performance. The panel was of the opinion that some specific drugs and drug classes are clearly impairing, including sedatives, hypnotics, sedating antihistamines, narcotic analgesics, hallucinogens, antipsychotics, and muscle relaxants, even at therapeutic or sub-therapeutic doses . Furthermore, the panel noted that a potent barrier to categorizing drugs with 
respect to driving impairment risk is “lack of a common, standardized protocol for assessing the impairing potential of drugs,” (Kay and Logan, 2011, p. 7) . That is, there is recognition of the 
need for a structured, standardized protocol to assess the driving impairment risk of drugs, as current systematic reviews reveal inconsistencies in methodology, failures to address inconsistencies relative to dosing, time since dosing, subject characteristics and pattern of use, and the use of non -standardized testing methodologies .  
 As a result, a tiered assessment protocol was proposed, including the following tiers: I) pharmacology/toxicology review to identify drugs likely to impair driving; II) epidemiological review to identify the relative risk of impairment for drugs/drug classes based on comparison to control populations or by culpability assessment; and III) standard behavioral assessment (Kay and Logan, 2011) . Tiers I and II ide ntify the drugs most likely to impair driving, leading to the 
activation of Tier III . The current study is designed as a structured, standardized approach based 
on the Essential Driving Ability Domains (EDAD) Model described in Kay and Logan (2011) in order to validate a standardized protocol to evaluate drug impaired driving.  
 
Bulk cannabis was chosen as the study drug given its known chemical properties  and range of 
cannabis THC concentrations . This source of cannabis has been used for a series of NHTSA and 
NIDA sponsored driving studies conducted at NADS  (Brown et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; 
Hartman, Anizan, Jang, Brown, Yun…Huestis, 2015; Hartman et al., 2015a; Hartman et al., 
2015b; Hartman et al., 2016; Hartman, Brown, Milavetz, Spurgin, Pier ce…Huestis, 2015;

    Hartman, Jang, Spurgin, Yun, Gorelick…Huestis, February 2015; Miller et al., 2020; Smith et 
al., November 2018) .  
5.1. Study Rationale  
 
SELECTION OF CANNABIS FOR VALIDATION OF ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY: As the legal atmosphere surrounding cannabi s use continues to evolve, the potential for increased 
usage among drivers raises questions regarding its effects on driving ability. Epidemiological studies have examined the relationship between cannabis use and motor vehicle crash risk, injury risk, and fatal crash risk . Cannabis tends to be the most common illicit substance present in 
injured drivers (Legrand et al., 2013; Brubacher et al., 2016) and the second only to alcohol as the most common recreational substance among injured drivers (ibid) . While  the presence of 
cannabis in injured drivers in Italy occurred to a lesser extent than did the presence of cocaine and benzodiazepines (Siliquini et al., 2007), another study found individuals aged 35 – 54 years who reported using cannabis within the past year had significantly greater odds of reporting having been in a motor vehicle collision (Mann et al., 2010). Cannabis use has been shown to be associated with self -reported instances of road rage, driving mistakes, and accident risk in 
Pakistani truck dr ivers (Mir et al., 2012).  
 Methodological and design differences and limitations notwithstanding, the majority of case -
controlled studies show an increase  in motor vehicle crashes (MVC) for drivers under the 
influence of cannabis (DeBalzoa et al., 2018; Kuypers et al., 2012; Jamt et al., 2018; Li et al., 2013; Baldock & Lindsay, 2015; Chihuri & Chen, 2017) . Of two case- controlled studies  that did 
not find an increase in crash risk , one found an association between cannabis use and unsafe 
driving (Dubois et al., 2015) while the other  study reported inconclusive results for the effect of 
cannabis when used in isolation (Steinemann et al., 2018) . DeBalzoa et al. (2018) found a high 
degree of association between cannabis use and collisions resulting in driver injuries yet concluded that risk of serious injury and fatal injury for individuals testing positive for cannabis alone was relatively low . Contradictory findings have been reported for the role of cannabis 
(alone) in fatal crashes (Gjerde et al., 2011; Chihuri & Chen, 2017; Martin et al., 2017) .  
 Experimental research investigating the effects of cannabis on driving have been conducted with over-the-road and simulated driving tests . There has been little consistency in the methodology 
applied across researchers and generally a lack of replication . Investigators have studied drivers 
with markedly different characteristics  which likely interact with the effect of the drug ( e.g., 
pattern s of substance use , prior driving experience , and age ). Published studies also show a wide 
range of doses and delivery systems and generally fail to show an association between exposure and serum THC. Furthermore, driving simulator studies have not been conducted using anything approaching a standard set of driving challenges or tasks.   In spite of these methodological issues, there is general agreement that cannabis increases weaving . However, t he relationship between cannabis exposure and magnitude of we aving 
remains to be determined . The impact of cannabis on lane crossings has been in consistent . 
Cannabis (without concomitant alcohol  consumption) generally results in slower driving speeds 
and greater headway distances in nighttime conditions . With respect to neurocognitive testing, 
cannabis has consistently been shown to impact performance under multitasking conditions.  
21 
 
 21  
     
SELECTION OF ALPRAZOLAM FOR USE AS ACTIVE COMPARATOR: Alprazolam is the 
most frequently prescribed benzodiazepine for treating panic di sorder and anxiety disorders 
(RxList, 2005 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007) . The cognitive and psychomotor effects of 
alprazolam have been well -documented in older studies (Verster and Volker, 2004b as cited in 
Leufkens et al., 2007; Bertz et al., 1997 a s cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Ellinwood et al., 1985 
as cited in Leukens et al., 2007; Greenblatt et al., 1988 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Kroboth 
et al., 1998 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Rickels, 2004 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; 
Scavone et al., 1992 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Smith et al., 1984 as cited in Leufkens et 
al., 2007; Subhan et al., 1986 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Vermeeren et al., 1995 as cited in Leufkens et al., 2007; Verster et al., 2002 as cited in L eufkens et al., 2007) . While limited in 
number, results from the more recent studies available reveal that alprazolam has an adverse impact on driving performance . The most consistent findings are increased weaving (Leufkens et 
al., 2007; Stone et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2018; CRC data on file 2019 and 2020; Verster et al., 2002) , increased lane departures  (Sone et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2018; CRC data on file 2019 
and 2020; Pearlman et al., 2020; Verster et al., 2002) , and poor speed maintenance  (Brown et al., 
2018; Pearlman et al., 2020; CRC data on file 2017, 2019, and 2020; Verster et al., 2002) . 
Additional safety endpoints show increased collision risk and failure to adjust speed in corners  
(CRC data on file 2017, 2019, 2020; Verster et al., 2002) .  
With regards to neurocognitive functioning, alprazolam has been shown to impair immediate and 
delayed recall of word lists  (Leufkens et al., 2007; Reissig et al., 2014; Hindmarch et al., 2005; 
Snyder et al., 2005) , impair tracking ability  (Hindmarch et al. , 2005; Leufkens et al., 2007; 
Verster et al., 2002) , slow reaction times  (Leufkens et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2015; Reissig et al., 
2014; Hindmarch et al., 2005; CRC data on file 2017, 2019, 2020) , and adversely a ffect 
information processing speed (Reiss ig et al., 2014; Hindmarch et al., 2005; CRC data on file 
2017 and 2019; Pearlman et al., 2020) . 
 PURPOSE OF PRESENT STUDY: T he primary purpose of th e current  study is to establish a 
standardized protocol for assessing drug impaired driving. Validation of this methodology is to be accomplished with a study using cannabis, alprazolam,  and match ing placebo . As part of this 
research effort , investigators  have worked to identify the driving tasks and cognitive abilities 
found to be most vulnerable  to the impairing effects of cannabis . In addition, an effort was made 
to identify  the subject characteristics associated with increased vulnerability to the impairing 
effects of cannabis . Worked was conducted to develop a methodology for determining when 
drivers are safe to resume driving after drug exposure . The current study is designed to test  these 
hypotheses .  
Simulated driving will be performed using an updated version of Cognitive Research 
Corporation’s Driving Simulator (CRCDS2 MiniSim) . The prior version of this simulator has 
been used in dozens of driving studies submitted for regulatory review. Driving performance will 
be assessed using an approximate 1- hour Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS), comprised of 
suburban, urban and highway driving t asks. The scenario s include challenges designed to assess 
lane position control, speed control, safety awareness and responsivity, driving- related decision 
making, multitasking, and vigilance . These domains correspond to the Essential Driving Ability 
22 
 
 22  
    Domains described by Kay and Logan ( 2011) . In addition, cognitive functions  associated with 
driving performance and self -report  measures will also be administered.  
Consistent with the principles outlined in the FDA Guidance for Industry ( 2017), this study 
includes both a positive  (active)  and placebo control  condition. The study is  designed to assess 
the duration of drug effects . Readiness to resume driving will be assessed using both self -report 
and objective testing. Subjects will include  regular (daily)  users and weekly users of cannabis . 
The intent is to  assess the impact of pattern of drug use on driving performance . A cross -over 
study design will be utilized to maximize statistical power.  
Cannabis  will be administered once in the morning on Day 2. Ef fects on driving and cognition 
will be assessed from 30 to 45 minutes after dosing. Cognitive and self -report measures will be 
repeated approximately 3.5 hours post -dose to assess residual effect . There will be a  one-week 
washout between  treatment periods . Subject s will be instructed  to refrain from drug use for 7 
days prior to treatment period 1 and to continue to abstain from (non- study) drug use for the 
duration of the trial.  
Alprazolam  was selected as the active comparator  and to fur ther validate the CRCDS -2 and the 
DIDS scenario . The negative effect of Alprazolam  on driving performance has been 
demonstrated in both on- the-road and simulated driving studies  (Pearlman et al., 2019; CRC, 
data on file; Leufkens 2009;  Leufkens & Vermeeren  2014; Mets 2011; Simen 2015; Verster 
2011) . Additionally, as alprazolam is the most commonly prescribed psychotropic in the U.S., 
use of the drug remains a  concern for traffic safety .  
5.2. Dose Rationale  
One dose of cannabis  will be evaluated in this study:  
• Bulk cannabis (6.18% THC/ <0.025% CBD) in a 500mg dose providing 30.9 mg THC  
administered by inhalation via vaporiz ation  on Day 2 in each of 3 treatment periods  
This dose  was selected based  on comparability of THC concentr ations with  a currently in 
development medicinal cannabis medication, PPP001 ( Tetra Bio -Pharma Inc ), that  provides 26.6 
mg THC . Prior research conducted by the research team also demonstrates  tolerability of THC 
concentrations of  this level (6 -7% THC in a 500mg vaporized dose).  
The active comparator , alprazolam , will be administered at a dose of 0.75 on Day 2, based on 
previous demonstration of impaired performance on the driving simulator tes t following 
administration of a single oral dose at this level ( CRC, data on file ).

mg on driving and cognitive endpoints. A  secondary objective of the study is to assess the effects 
of cannabis  on cognitive and psychomotor functioning relative to placebo. Another  objective of 
this study is to evaluate the potential relationship between THC  blood concentration and driving 
perfo rmance endpoints.

    7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, active - and placebo -controlled, 3- arm, 3-period crossover 
study to assess the effects of cannabis on simulated driving performance and related cognitive 
functions in healthy male and female adult cannabis users . The study design is provided in 
Figure 1. The schedule of assessments is provided in Table 1.  
 
Following a screening/training period of up to 14 days, eligible participants will be admitted to 
NADS  on Day 1 of Period 1. B aseline performance for cognitive testing will be obtained and 
subjects will practice the CRCDS2 -MiniSim driving simulator . Participants will be randomized 
1:1:1 into one of 6 treatment sequences as shown in  Table 4.  Study drug will be administered by 
inhalation on Day 2 with the alprazolam dosing approximately 40 minutes prior to the cannabis dosing ( the first cannabis dose will occur at approximately 8:40) ; precise timing is relative, as 
subject dosing will be staggered/offset to accommodate staffing and subject flow . Blood samples 
for pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn pre -dose and again 40 minutes post -dose and 3.25 
hours post -dose. Symbol Digit Coding (SDC), Pathfinder Number (PFN), Readiness to Drive 
Question, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) will be administered approximately 30 minutes post -dose. A baseline KSS will also be administered prior to dosing. Driving 
assessments will begin approximately 45 minutes following dosing. Driving performance will be assessed via the approximate 1 -hour Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS), on the CRCDS2-
MiniSim driving simulator, comprised of suburban, urban and highway driving tasks. The 
scenario includes challenges designed to assess lane position control, speed control, safety awareness and responsivity, driving- related decision making, multitasking, and vigilance . 
Immediately after completing the driving simulation, subjects will be administered the visual analog scales, or VAS, followed by the cognitive test battery ( SDC, Visual Sequence 
Comparison [VSC] , Divided Attention Test – Dual [DAT -Dual], PFN, SD C Delayed Recall 
[SDCDR], Shifting Attention Test – Instruction [SAT -Instruction], MTS, Dual Task Test  – 
Combined [DAT – Combined], and TOVA) . At approximately 3.5 hours post -dose the cognitive 
test battery (i.e., SDC, VSC, DAT -Dual, PFN, SDCDR, SAT – Inst ruction, MTS, DTT – 
Combined, TOVA ) and self -report measures will be repeated.  
 
Subject s will undergo initial driving simulator training and practice during the Screening period 
and will complete a  practice drive on Day 1 of each treatment period.  
 Subject s will be discharged from NADS  on the afternoon of Day 2 of each treatment period 
approximately 5.33 hours post -dose, provided they are medically stable for discharge in the 
opinion of the Investigator . The subject  will not be able to drive themselves home and will have 
transportation arranged.  
 After a washout of at least 7 days , but no more than 10 days , between administration of the last 
dose in one period and administration of the first dose in the next period, subject s will be 
readmitted to NADS  on Day 1 of Period 2 and receive study drug according to the assigned 
27 
 
 27  
    treatment schedule. All study assessments will remain the same as in Period 1. The same process 
will be repeated for Period 3.  
 Seven days (±2 days) after discharge from Period 3, subject s will receive a follow -up/end- of-
study phone call from the site to evaluate the presence of any AEs and collect any new 
concomitant medication/procedure information.  
 
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table 1. The following regimens will be assessed:  
• Cannabis (inhaled) on Day 2 
• Alprazolam 0.75mg on Day 2 
• Placebo  on Day 2  
Subject s will receive 0.75mg of alprazolam  (over -encapsulated)  or matching placebo capsule 40 
minutes prior to administration of inhaled cannabis or matching placebo inhalation/vaporizer on 
Day 2 of each Treatment Period . Matched placebo tablets  and/or vaporizers will be administered 
as necessary to maintain the blind across the 3 treatment regimen s. 
7.2. Number of Subject s 
Approximately 12 subject s will be randomized and dosed. Efforts will be made to randomize an 
approximately equal number of male and female subject s. Efforts will be made to randomize an 
approximately equal number of “low frequency users” (i.e., 1 – 10 uses of cannabis per month) 
and “high frequency users” (i.e., > 20 uses of cannabis per month) .  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subject s will be randomized into one of 6 treatment sequences ( Table 3).

Note: Matched placebo capsule or vaporizers  will be administered as necessary to maintain the blind across the 3  
treatment s. 
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
NHTSA may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons 
including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to subject s, or for 
administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, NHTSA will provide written 
notification to the Investigator. The investigational  site must promptly notify its  ethics committee 
and initiate withdrawal procedures for subject s.

All other meals and snacks during inpatient periods will be provided according to standard 
procedures  while at the supervised off -site residential facility . 
9.3. Prior Medications, Concomitant Medications, and Restrictions  
9.3.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Supplements  
All medications (prescription and non- prescription, and herbal medications/natural health 
products) taken by subject s during the 30 days prior to Screening until the completion of the 
follow -up phone call will be recorded. Th e reported medications will be reviewed and evaluated 
by the Investigator to determine if they affect a subject ’s eligibility or continued participation in 
the study.  
33 
 
 33  
    Subject s are permitted to take hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and 
acetaminophen (up to 2 grams per day) during the study. On a case -by-case basis, the 
Investigator is permitted to allow the use of concomitant medications to treat an AE. Wherever 
possible, the Investigator should obtain approval from the Sponsor’s Medica l Monitor prior to 
administering the medication.   
9.3.2. Prohibited Medications  
Prohibited medications include the following:  
• any prescription or over -the-counter medication known to cause sedation within 7 days 
prior to admission for Period 1 and throughout study participation ;

administration will be recorded. Any reasons for non- adherence will also be documented.  
9.5. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized, double -blind, active - and placebo -controlled study. On Day 1 of Period 1, 
subject s will be randomized 1:1:1 into one of 6 treatment sequences (   
34 
 
 34  
    Table 3). The active and placebo treatments are identical in appearance within each group and 
matched placebo will be administered as necessary to maintain the blind ( Table 4).  
The allocation to treatment sequence will be based on a randomization schedule generated by blinded study personnel . The randomization schedule will be kept strictly confidential, accessible 
only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. A copy of each randomization schedule will be held by the Study Pharmacist .  
9.5.1. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject  is 
at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study drug received. All circumstances surrounding a n early  unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject  is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject ’s records and in the 
CRF. If the subject ’s or study center personnel’s data have been unblinded, the subject  will be 
permanently discontinued from the study. 
9.6. Subject Compensation  
Subjects will be compensated for their  time and effort. Subjects who complete all study 
procedures successfully will receive up to $1100. For subjects that do not complete, prorated compensation will be provided as show below. For each study visit, there will be an incentive for 
completing one  of the drives safely in the time allowed. This incentive compensation is $25 per 
visit.  
  Base Incentive  Max Total  
Screening  $50   $50 
Visit 1   $275 $25  $300

    10. STU DY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Description of Study Drugs  
Dried bulk cannabis plant material obtained from the NIDA Drug Supply Program  will be used 
for this protocol . The a ctive cannabis contains 6.18% THC and the placebo cannabis contains no 
detectable THC or CBD . Cannabis will be inhaled using a Volcano® Digit Vaporizer  device . 
Each subject  will be administered  a dose of cannabis  as described in Section  9.1.  
Alprazolam tablets will be sourced by the pharmacy at the clinical site through commercial 
suppliers. Each subject  will be administered a dose of 0.75mg as described in Section  9.1. 
Alprazolam  tablets will be over -encapsulated .  
Placebo capsules contain only the excipients listed for the active alprazolam  capsule.  
10.2. Study Drug Pa ckaging and Labeling  
Bulk cannabis received from the Research Triangle Institute via the NIDA Drug Supply Program 
will be maintained with appropriate labeling .  
Alprazolam  tablets will have commercial packaging and labeling.  
Each container of study drug will be clearly labeled with study- specific information meeting all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
10.3. Study Drug Storage  
Upon receipt of the medication, an investigator, or the responsible pharmacist or designee, will inspect the medication and acknowledge receipt in accordance with the study -specific process.  
Cannabis  should be stored frozen ( -15 to - 25°C ) by the site and humidified at room temperature 
for 18 -48 hours prior to administration
. Alprazolam  should be stored per the package insert 
requirements. The study medication may not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
The Investigator or a designee will  be responsible for ensuring appropriate storage, 
compounding, dispensing, inventory, and accountability of all clinical supplies. An accurate, 
timely record of the disposition of all clinical supplies must be maintained.  
10.4. Study Drug Preparation  
The study drug will be dispensed or administered according to applicable standard operating procedures. Once dispensed, study drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other subject s. 
10.5. Study Drug Administration  
A cued -puff procedure will be used to standardize the administration of cannabis . Dried bulk 
cannabis plant material obtained from the NIDA Drug Supply Program is ground (via herb 
mill/grinder provided by Volcano® manufacturer) and 500 mg is heated to a te mperature of 
210°C by the hot air generator to vaporize THC (Hazekamp, 2010; Pomahacova et al., 2009) . 
The vapor is collected in a plastic balloon with a one -way valve. This valve shuts when removed 
36 
 
 36  
    from the Volcano® device , preventing the escape of vapor. A mouthpiece is attached to the valve 
and allows for subject -controlled inhalation of the cannabis vapor. Each session utilizes a new 
balloon to ensure hygienic administration. The Volcano® Digit Vaporizer is operated according 
to the manufacturer’s specifications . 
Subjects will be trained to the Foltin Puff Procedure  (Foltin, Brady & Fischman, 1986; Wilsey et 
al., 2013) , which includes the following steps : “get ready” (5 seconds), “inhale” ( 5 seconds), “hold 
vapor in lungs” ( 10 seconds), and “exhale and wait ” (40 seconds) . The subject repeatedly inhales 
the vapor over  10 minutes. Subject s will be instructed to inhale at their  capacity ; that means 
without any dizziness, nausea, vomiting, panic,  or difficulty breathing.  
All study treatments will be administered following co nsumption of breakfast  as outlined in 
Section  9.2. 
10.6. Study Drug Accountability, Handling, and Disposal  
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The Investigator or a 
designee must keep a record of all study drug received, used, and returned/discarded. It must be clear from the records what study drug each subject  received on each dosing day. 
NHTSA or designee will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with appropriate notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation. 
The Investigator, pharmacist,  or qualified  designee  is responsible  for dr ug accountability, 
reconciliation,  and record  maintenance (i.e., receipt,  reconciliation,  and final  disposition 
records).  
After the study is completed, all unused study medication must be returned as directed or 
destroyed on site per the site’s SOPs.  
37 
 
 37  
    11. PHAR MACODYNAMIC AND PHARMACOKINETIC 
ASSESSMENTS  
All PD and PK assessments will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). The time of study drug administration will be considered as 
time zero.  
11.1. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
11.1.1. DIDS  Driving Scenario on the CRCDS 2-MiniSim  
This study employs the Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS) comprised of suburban, urban, 
and highway driving tasks . The scenario includes challenges designed to assess lane position 
control, speed control, safety awareness and responsivity, driving- related decision making, 
multitasking, and vigilance . Data will be captured in electronic format . Det ails are provided in 
the Cognitive Research Corporation Driving Simulation Testing Operations Manual. 
11.1.2. CogScreen Cognitive Test Battery  
The CogScreen computer -based cognitive test battery  will be administered by trained and 
certified study center personnel. Subject s enter responses by tapping a stylus on an LCD 
touchscreen monitor. Details are provided in the CogScreen® Examiner Manual, CogScreen 
LLC.  
11.1.2.1. Digit Symbol Substitution Test (CogScreen Symbol Digit Coding)  
Symbol Digit Coding (SDC) is a computer analogue of the conventional digit 
symbol -substitution task found in the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS -R, 1981) 
Digit Symbol subtest. SDC will be used in this study to measure attention, visual scanning, working memory, and speed of information processing. Immediate and delayed recall for the digit-symbol pairs will also be assessed.  
11.1.2.2. CogScreen Visual Sequence Comparison Test  
The CogScreen Visual Sequence Comparison Test (VSC) will be used in this study to measure  
visual attention, working memory, visual -sequential processing, and visual -perceptual speed .  
11.1.2.3. CogScreen Divided Attention Test  
The CogScreen Divided Attention Test (DAT) will be used in this study to measure visual 
monitoring, choice visual reaction time, impulsivity, divided attention, working memory, verbal -
sequential processing, visual -perceptual speed, and capacity for multitasking. 
 
11.1.2.4. CogScreen Matching to Sample Test  
The CogScreen Matching to Sample Test (MTS) will be used in the study to measure visua l 
perceptual speed, spatial processing, and visual working memory. 
38 
 
 38  
    11.1.2.5. CogScreen Pathfinder Number Test

The CogScreen Dual Task T est (DTT) will be used to measure visual -motor tracking, divided 
attention, and working memory. 
11.1.4. Test of Variables of Attention   
The Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA)  will be used in this study to measure visual 
vigilance.  The TOVA provides measures of  response consistency, speed of response, 
impulsivity, and focus .  
The TOVA will be administered by trained study center personnel. Subject s will perform the test 
by interacting with an electronic monitor screen. Details are provided in the TOVA Manual.  
11.1.5. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale  
The KSS ( Akerstedt and Gillberg 1990; Akerstedt 2014)  will be used to assess subjective level 
of sleepiness. This is a subject  self-reported measure of situational sleepiness and provides an 
assessment of alertness/sleepiness at a particular point of time. Subject s will rate their sleepiness 
level using a 9- point categorical Likert -type scale with the following anc hors:  
 (1) “extremely alert”  
 (2) “very alert”  
 (3) “alert  
 (4) “rather alert”  
 (5) “neither alert nor sleepy”  
 (6) “some signs of sleepiness”  
 (7) “sleepy, but no effort to keep awake”  
 (8) “sleepy, some effort to keep awake”  
 (9) “very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep”  
11.1.6. Self-perceived Safety to Drive Question  
Prior to driving, the subject  will be asked a simple question as to whether they feel safe to drive 
(“Right now do you feel safe to drive?”). Subject  will answer “yes” or “no”.  
39 
 
 39  
    11.1.7. Visual Analog Scales to Assess Subject s’ Self -appraisal and Motivation  
Visual analog scales will be performed to assess a subject ’s self -appraisal of driving performance 
and motivation to drive one’s best. Immediately after completing the driving simulatio n (DIDS ), 
subject s will assess their own performance and their level of motivation to perform at their best 
during the DIDS . 
Subject s will respond to 2 questions:  
1. How well do you think you drove for the last 60 minutes?  
2. How motivated did you feel to drive at your best during the last 60 minutes of driving?  
Subject s will record their response to each question by drawing a vertical line on a 100- mm 
horizontal, linear VAS printed on paper  or administered electronically . For the self -assessment of 
driving performance, 1 end of the line is marked “Not Satisfactory” and the other end of the line 
is marked “Satisfactory”. For the motivation item, 1 end of the line is marked “Not Motivated” 
and the other end is marked “Motivated”. Scores on the 100- mm linea r scale will be measured to 
the nearest millimeter from the left with a ruler  or recorded by the electronic system .  
11.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
11.2.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Separate PK blood samples will be collected and processed for analysis of THC  and alpra zolam  
blood concentrations. Three separate samples will be collected : pre-dose, at 40 minutes  (± 5 
minutes) post -dose on Day 2, and at 3.25 hours ( ± 5 minutes) post -dose on Day 2. Additional 
details  regarding the collection and processing of PK samples wil l be provided in a separate PK 
manual.  
Blood will be collected and stored into labeled sample containers until analysis. These samples 
(whole blood) will be refrigerated at NADS until transported to the Iowa DCI Crime Lab for analysis. The Iowa DCI Crime L ab will discard extra blood, using at least one aliquot for 
analysis and one aliquot for backup. The backup sample will be maintained at - 70°C until study 
close and then discarded.  
Blood volumes required for PK sampling are available in Appendix A . 
11.2.2. Sample Analysis  
Bioanalysis of blood samples for the determination of THC  concentrat ions will be conducted 
utilizing a validated LC -MS/MS method.  
40 
 
 40  
    12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1.1. Demography and Medical History 
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, and ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale will b e conducted at Screening to ensure subject s 
have no recent history of sleep disorder.  
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height, weight, and BMI will be measured and documented as outlined in Table 1.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be conducted to assess the subject ’s overall health and physical 
condition. A full or brief physical examination will be completed at the times outlined in Table 1. 
A full physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose 
and throat (HEENT), neck/thyroid/lymphatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and 
neurological systems, musculoskeletal/extremities, and skin. A brief physical examination will include assessment of general appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and 
neurological systems. Unscheduled symptom -directed physical examinations may also be 
conducted per Investigator’s discretion. Whenever possible, the same individual should perform 
all physical exam inations for a given subject .  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by an Investigator as abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents.  
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include blood pressure, heart rate, r espiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and temporal  
temperature (° F). Heart rate and blood pressure will be collected in the supine position after the 
subject  has been resting for approximately 3 minutes.  
All abnormal vital signs will be interpreted by the Inve stigator or designee as abnormal NCS, or 
abnormal CS in source documents.  
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Six-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject  has been resting in a supine position for at 
least 5 minutes. The ECG variables will include ventricular he art rate and the PR, QRS, QT, and 
QTcF intervals.  
All abnormal ECGs will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal NCS, or abnormal CS in 
source documents. The standard intervals, any rhythm abnormalities, and the Investigator interpretation will be noted on the eCRF.  
12.1.5.1. Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol  
A urine drug screen will be conducted for the assessment of selected drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, THC, cocaine, methadone, phencyclidine, 
opiates, 3,4- methylenedioxy- methamphetam ine (MDMA), and oxycodone). A breathalyzer 
alcohol screen will be conducted.  
41 
 
 41  
    12.1.5.2. Pregnancy Screen  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all women at Screening; thereafter, a urine 
pregnancy test will be conducted for women of child- bearing potential at all subsequent periods . 
12.1.6. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner , 2011) . This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject  with respect 
to suicidal ideation and behavior, and a post -baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality s ince 
the last study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal 
ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe).  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at S creening (lifetime history and 
past 24 months). 
12.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Adverse Event Definitions  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject  
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associa ted with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the first administration of any study drug or any worsening of a preexisting medical condition/AE with onset after the first administration of any 
study drug a nd through the follow -up phone call. The term study drug includes any study drug, a 
comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs and ECGs are considered AEs if they result in d iscontinuation of study treatment, require therapeutic medical intervention or if 
the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Any abnormalities that meet the 
criteria for an SAE should be reported in an expedited manner.  
All AEs that occ ur after any subject  has signed the informed consent and throughout the duration 
of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to the Medical Monitor . 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject ’s last AE assessment in the stu dy are followed up by 
the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
The Sponsor or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any subject  with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
42 
 
 42  
    12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death ; 
• Is immediately life -threatening;  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity ; 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect . 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the  subject  or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpat ient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject  has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form provided by NADS and  Acclaro . Any SAE that is ongoing when the subject  completes their final 
study visit, will be followed by the Investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline status.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be consi dered an 
SAE, even if the subject  is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject ’s 
consent to participate in the study. 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the subject ’s consent to partic ipate in the study and at the time 
of the procedure or treatment. 
12.2.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each AE (not related or related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the 
relationship of AEs and SAEs to the study drug.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the study drug if there is not a 
reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by the study drug. Factors pointin g towards this assessment include but are not limited to the lack of temporal 
relationship between administration of the study drug and the event, the presence of biologically implausible relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a mo re likely alternative explanation for the AE

    Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the study drug if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under 
investigation. Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited 
to a positiv e rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration 
of the drug and the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, 
improvement following discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible 
relationship between the drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for 
the AE  
12.2.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, an investi gator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study drug or withdraw 
early fro m the study.  
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject  or does not make subject  
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relie f of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject  uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; subject  is able to continue in study; 
treatment (including but not limited to prescription drugs) for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on subject ’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment 
with study drug; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject  hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 12.2.1.2. An AE of severe intensity may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site must notify Acclaro or designee wi thin 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Acclaro or designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Acclaro or 
designee within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original 
SAE information in the source docum ents. 
44 
 
 44  
    Serious events occurring after the designated follow -up time for the study, should be reported to 
Acclaro or designee according to  the timelines noted above only if the Investigator considers the 
SAE related to study drug.  
Acclaro or designee is res ponsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the Ethics Committee (EC) of all 
SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspec ted unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its EC of all SUSARs.  
Appropriate personnel at NADS  will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. 
The PI or designee will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law.  
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a female subject  becomes pregnant after first administration of study drug, pregnancy 
information must be collected , recorded , and submitted to Acclaro  or designee within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. The female subject ’s participation in the study will be termin ated.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  The status of the pregnancy 
is not followed once participation in the study ends. 
12.4. Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a subject  or taken by a subject  that exceeds 
the dose described in protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF ; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to 
the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to the sponsor or designee even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded. 
45 
 
 45  
    13. STATISTICS  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any 
deviations from or changes t o the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all subject s who are randomized.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized and treated subject s that have at least 
one primary efficacy measure (SDLP) in any treatment period.  
The Safety Set (SS) is defined as all subject s administered at least one dose of any study drug.  
The PK Set is defined as all subject s in the SS who have at least one collected  blood sample from 
which a valid blood concentration can be measured.  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All subject s will be used in the analyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available. No imputation process  will be 
used to estimate missing data.   
13.3. General Considerations  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be c alculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
All data supporting the development of the summary tables and figures will be listed. 
13.4. Demographics and Baselin e Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, body weight, height, and BMI) will be summarized for the SS as well as the FAS separately. No formal statistical comparison between the groups will be performed. 
Medical history will be listed by subject .  
Pregnancy test results and drug/alcohol screens will be listed but not summarized.  
13.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
All PD analyses will use the FAS Set.  
The FAS will be used for the primary analysis . Summary statistics will be provided (mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) for each treatment. Figures will be provided 
for the within -subject  difference scores by treatment and day as both a histogram and scatter plot. 
Data listings for driving simulator data will be provided.  
46 
 
 46  
    SDLP data will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed 
effects for sequence, period, and treatment and random effect for subject . A log- transformation 
of SDLP values to obtain normal distribution of data will be considered, if necessary. An 
unstructured covariance structure and Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom will be used. In the 
event an u nstructured covariance structure fails to converge, a variance components covariance 
structure will be assumed. In addition to treatment effect, p -values for significance testing of 
period and sequence effects will be provided. Pair -wise comparisons of dif ferences in means and 
two-sided 95% CIs on differences will be provided for all active treatments versus the placebo 
treatment.  
The comparison of primary interest is  cannabis  versus placebo on Day 2 as a function of 
frequency of self -reported cannabis use . The statistical significance of alprazolam versus placebo 
(p < 0.05) comparison for SDLP is considered only to validate the experiment and having the ability to detect effects (i.e., assay sensitivity) .  
Formal statistical tests (when performed) will be 2 -sided and tested at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance. Cannabis  will be considered non- inferior to placebo if the two- sided upper 95% 
confidence limit on the difference in SDLP between that dose and pl acebo is less than 4.4 cm, 
and it can be concluded that the effect of cannabis  on driving is less than that seen at 0.05% 
BAC, which is a level associated with increased crash risk. No adjustment to alpha levels will be made for either the comparison of al prazolam  to placebo, or for secondary endpoints or analyses.  
 As a supportive analysis, pair -wise, within -subject  differences in SDLP greater than 4.4 cm in 
absolute value will be compared using McNemar test. Furthermore, these pair -wise, within 
subject  differences in SDLP will be tested for symmetry about zero (Laska  et al. , 2012) using the 
maximally selected McNemar test. If there is no significant difference between placebo and cannabis  and if the distribution of paired differences is symmetrical around zero, it can be 
concluded that cannabis  does not impair driving.
 
Driving performance , cognitive, and self -report  endpoints will be evaluated and presented using 
a mixed model for repeated measures. L ane exceedance will be log -transformed (more 
specifically  ln[x+1]) before analyses.

Safety data will be listed by subject  and summa rized by treatment. All safety summaries will be 
performed on the SS. 
13.6.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA version 22.0 or higher. The analysis of AEs will be based on 
the concept of TEAEs presented by treatment. TEAEs will be summarized by System  Organ 
Class (SOC) and preferred term, and by treatment. TEAE summaries will be provided showing 
the number and percentage of subject s who experienced at least one  TEAE. In addition, 
summaries will be provided by severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and by causality (related or 
not related) to study drug (see Section 12.3). If more than one  TEAE is coded to the same 
preferred term for the same subject  within the same treatment period, the subject  will be counted 
only once for t hat preferred term using the most severe occurrence for the summarization by 
severity.  
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and serious TEAEs including death will also be 
summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening befo re the start of study drug)

13.6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study.  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to Scree ning and through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the first dose of study drug will be denoted 
“Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the first dose of study drug and continuing beyond the 
first dose of study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation of the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (i .e., those with a start date on or after the first dose of 
study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study dr ug that are ongoing or with a 
stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior ” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications/procedures will be listed by subject , start date, and 
verbatim term.

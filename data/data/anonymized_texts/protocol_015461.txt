Formulation:  Oral, capsules which are identical for each dose  
Objectives:  Key Objective  
• To assess the tolerability and safety of two doses of APD371 in 
subjects  with Crohn’s Disease  (CD) experiencing abdominal pain 
treated for up to 8 Wk.  
 
Exploratory Objectives : 
• Determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (including 
metabolites) and average PK parameters (C max, tmax, AUC 0-8) of 
two doses of APD371 TID

Study  Population:  The study population will consist of adult male and female subjects  
aged 18  to 80 years who are diagnosed with abdominal pain due to 
quiescent to mildly active CD, as defined by a weekly average 
abdominal pain score ( AAPS) ≥ 4 over one week ( 0 [no pain] to 10 
[worst possible]) , with minimal intestinal inflammation, confirmed 
with a simple endoscopic score ( -CD) score < 10 or fecal calprotectin  
(FCP)  <500 mcg/g . Endoscopy results obtained within 1 month prior 
to screening may be utilized.  
Concomitant therapy may include all anti -inflammatory therapy for 
CD, including 5 -aminosalicylates,  antibiotics, immunomodulators, 
and oral or topical corticosteroids (prednisone ≤20  mg/day, 
budesonide at a  dose ≤9  mg/day, or equivalent steroid)  on stable 
maintenance dose s. Subjects  who have received/are currently 
receiving anti -tumor necrosis factor - or other biologic therapy will 
be allowed to continue on these therapies if the dose/regime n has 
been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to screening  and no intended 
change in these therapies during the study is anticipated.    
Inclusion criteria

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD371 -004   
Amendment 02 (10 August 2017 ) Confidential   Page 9 of 67 Sample Size:  It is p lanned to treat and complete safety and tolerability assessments 
in approximately  16 subjects. Since subjects maybe replaced if they 
are withdrawn due  to major protocol violations, it is estimated a  
maximum of 20 subjects maybe be dosed .  These numbers will be 
appropriate for a preliminary evaluation of safety and tolerability, 
provision of PK profiles of APD371 at two doses and exploratory 
analysis of efficacy end points.  
Safety 
Assessments:  • Adverse event reporting to include ; Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction ( SUSARs)  
• Clinical laboratory tests to include ; hematol ogy, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis   
• Physical examinations  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:  Blood samples for the assay of APD371 and metabolites M1  
, M2 , and M4  will be 
collected at the following time  points:  
• Wk 0 (Day 1) : prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (prior to second daily 
dose), 9 , 10 and 24 hours post first daily dose.  
• Wk 2, 4, and 6: prior to first daily dose  
• Wk 8 (Day -1, last day dosing): prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (prior 
to second daily dose),.  
• An additional blood sample for PK analysis will be collected, if 
possible, at the time of any intolerable AE or SAE.  
Efficacy 
assessments:  • The analgesic effect of APD371 o n abdominal pain will be scored 
by subjects  in a diary using the A PS.  The score will be based on 
the 11 -point numeric rating scale  from 0 [no abdominal pain] to 
10 [worst possible abdominal  as follows;  
During Screening  Twice daily for at least 7 consecutive days;  
1. Early morning, approximately 06:00 - 08:00  
2. Late evening, approximately 20:00 - 22:00.  
During Treatmen t Three times a day every day (Day1 to 56) ;  
1. Before the morning dose and any other study procedures  
2. At 1.5 hours after the morning dose  
3. Before the evening dose.  
• Additional efficacy assessments will include  achievement of 
clinical improvement [defined as a two- component PRO  score 
(Stool frequency and abdominal pain)  of <11] , clinical response 
from b aseline to Wk  8, and change from baseline in CRP and fecal  
calprotectin  at week 4 and 8 .

Amendment 02 (10 August 2017 ) Confidential   Page 10 of 67 Data Analyses:  Safety and tolerability data reported will include incidence of 
withdrawals and incidence and proportion of subjects with TEAEs, 
SAEs and SUSARs by dose and by duration of treatment.  
Compliance with treatment will be determined by tablet counts.  
The following parameters will be calculated from APD371 plasma 
concentrations on Wk 0 (Day 1 ) and Wk 8 (Day -1, last day):  
Cmax, tmax and AUC 0-8 
Plasma concen tration data from predose samples collected during Wk 
2, 4, 6, and 8 will be used to determine C trough. 
Parameter estimates for C max and AUC 0-8 will be evaluated to assess 
dose-proportionality.  
The following parameters will be calculated from plasma 
concen tration data for M1 , M2 , and 
M4  on Wk 0 ( Day 1 ) and Wk 8 (Day -1): 
Cmax, tmax and AUC 0-8 
The ratio of each metabolite to APD371 will be calculated for C max, 
AUC 0-8. The analgesic effect of two doses of APD371 will be 
report ed using summary statistics as a change from baseline in AAPS 
at each week for trough, peak and combined assessments. Differences 
between trough and peak APS scores will also be assessed by 
summary statistics and appropriate non -parametric methods.  
The pro portion of subjects with clinical improvement /response will 
be determined for each dose and combined at Wk 8 and be compared 
between 2 doses .

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD371 -004   
Amendment 02 (10 August 2017 ) Confidential   Page 17 of 67 1 INTRODUCTION  
The two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC), 
which is limited to the colon, and Crohn’s disease (CD), which can affect any 
segment of the gastrointestinal tract. In both types the most common symptoms are 
diarrhea and  abdominal pain. Treatments for pain associated with IBD that are  
currently available have been borrowed from other pain conditions and are not 
specific for abdominal pain.  They include opioids that  have the potential for 
developing tolerance/tachyphylaxis , addiction and abuse, and potentially fatal 
respiratory depression, gabapentinoids that are safer than opioids but also produce 
adverse cognitive effects, tricyclic antidepressants that show some efficacy but can 
also produce somnolence, hypotension, and arrhythmias, and non -steroidal anti -
inflammatories (NSAIDs; drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen) which when 
administered long term may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal 
injury/bleeding, cardiac events, hypertension, kidney injury, a nd death. Due to the 
limitations and side -effects of currently available treatments for abdominal pain, there 
is a need for an alternative approach  to targeted pain management, especially for 
abdominal pain , that  is poorly managed in IBD due to limited spe cific options.  New 
research suggests the etiology of abdominal pain in IBD arises from  dysregulat ion of 
the endoc annabinoid system , offering the promise of a novel therapeutic target . 
APD371 is a n ew chemical entity developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the 
treatment of abdominal pain due to IBD  which includes CD . APD371 is an  orally 
available, selective cannabinoid -2 (CB 2) receptor agonist .  
The CB 2 receptor is a member of a family of G  protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 
that mediate the effects of several structurally related endocannabinoids such as 
anandamide and 2 -arachidonolglycerol .1,2 Although expression of CB 2 was initially 
thought to be predominantly restricted to immune cells in the periphery, recent data 
suggests that this receptor is also expressed in the nervous system  in perivascular 
microglial cells and in brainstem neurons. CB 2 is up -regulated in both dorsal root 
ganglia and peripheral neurons following injury.3 Preclinical data  using CB 2 agonists 
and receptor knockout mice has validated the receptor as a potential target for the 
treatment of pain and neuro -inflammation.4,5 However, the therapeutic utility of non -
selective, b rain penetrable cannabinoid agonists is limited by undesirable 
psychotropic effects associated with activation of the cannabinoid -1 receptor  (CB 1). 
Such side -effects are not apparent upon CB 2 receptor activation. Selectivity for CB 2 
activation over CB 1 activation is thus an essential feature needed for therapeutic 
compound s directed at CB 2.  
The binding affinity, potency, and selectivity of APD371 for recombinant CB 2 
receptors were determined using radioligand binding assays and G PCR  signaling 
assays. A PD371 was shown to be a full agonist of the CB 2 receptor with a K i of 6 nM 
for human CB 2 and EC 50 values between 6 nM and 8 nM for the human, rat, and dog 
receptors.6,7 At test concentrations up to 10 μM, APD371 did not interact with 
recombinant human, rat , or dog CB1 receptors, indicating a >1000 -fold selectivity 
across these species.8,9

Amendment 02 (10 August 2017 ) Confidential   Page 18 of 67 The e fficacy of APD371 in alleviating pain was evaluated in multiple rodent models  
of chronic pain, including  the monosodium iodoacetate  (MIA) -induced model of 
osteoarthri tic joint pain, which shares similar pathophysiology with clinical 
osteoarthritis  in humans . When administered to rats by acute and subchronic oral 
dosing or by continuous subcutaneous infusion , APD371 significantly suppressed 
allodynia induced with MIA . APD371 -induced analgesia was maintained after 
animals were pretreated with rimonabant (CB 1 receptor antagonist) or naloxone 
(µ-opioid receptor inverse agonist) but not with (CB 2 receptor  antagonist), 
demonstrating on -target selectivity of APD371 in vivo.6 Subchronic and continuous -
infusion dosing with APD371 did not induce tachyphylaxis.  The efficacy of APD371 
in alleviating pain was also demonstrated in the paclitaxel -induced rodent model of 
neuropathic pain  and the painful peripheral neuropathy rodent models of type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes.  
 
1.1 Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
The Cannabinoid system in IBD is dysregulated1 and the enzymes that breakdown 
endocannabinoids (e.g. , fatty acid amid e hydrolase -FAAH) are increased in active 
inflammatory Crohn’s disease. The enzymes th at synthesize endocannabinoids (e.g., 
N -acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine -specific phospholipase -NAPE -PLD) are 
decreased in active inflamma tory Crohn’s disease and s ome en docannabinoids are 
decreased in active inflammatory IBD . 
The CB 2 receptors are located in the target tissue gastrointestinal (GI) cells and local 
immune cells in both humans and in rodents10 and are found in epithelial cells , 
immune cells , and in enteric neurons where CB 2 mediated sensitivity is observed at 
visceral afferent nerve endings10. 
The CB 2 receptor is increased in the ulcerative margin in Crohn’s  disease,10 and 
cannabinoids have been shown to be effective in clinical trials for Crohn’s pain. For 
example, c annabis has been demonstrated to induce  a clinical response in patients 
with Crohn's disease in a prospective placebo -controlled study ,11 and treatment of 
Crohn's disease with cannabis in an observational study showed improvements in the 
pain score .12 
Several preclinical animal studies su pport these observations which sugge st that CB 2 
activation can alleviate abdominal pain  without the unwanted cognitive effects of 
CB1 receptor activation . A CB 2 agonist has been shown to block mesenteric nerve 
firing and this effect is blocked in CB 2 knockouts13. Similarly, a reduction of 
intestinal pain by probiotic Lactobacillus Acidophophilis  (LCFM) administration in a 
butyrate -induced model of colonic hyperse nsitivity  is blocked by a CB 2 receptor 
Antagonist14. 
 
Arena has completed two phase 1 studies  with APD371. The aim of both studies was 
to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of APD371 across a range of

Based on the se two safety studies in human volunteers, a safety a nd tolerability study  
in CD subjects with abdominal pain treated with maintenance doses of  APD371 
rangi ng from 25 mg to 100  mg TID for 8 weeks  is proposed .  
 
1.2 Ethics and Regulatory Considerations   
The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Title  22 of the 
United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50 (21CFR §50 
[Protection of Human Subjects], 22 CFR § 56 [Institutional Review Boards (IRB)], 
and 22 CFR §312 [Investigational New Drug (IND)]) and applicable regulatory 
requirements, the  study protocol, and where applicable, Sponsor  and/or Contract 
Research Organization (CRO) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The protocol 
and informed consent will be submitted for consideration by the appropriate IRB and 
written approval from the Chai r or designated deputy of the IRB/IEC is required 
before clinical activities of the study can commence.  
The IRB must be notified promptly by the Investigator of the following:  
• Deviations from, or changes to , the protocol to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the trial subjects ; 
• Changes increasing the risk to subjects  and/or affecting significantly the 
conduct of the trial ; 
• All adverse events (AE)s  that meet the definition of a serious adverse event 
(SAE ); 
• New information that may adversely affect the safety of the subjects  or the 
conduct of the trial . 
 
Any changes to the protocol will be made by means of a formal written protocol 
amendment. All amendments will require IRB approval before implementation exce pt 
when changes to the protocol are required immediately to eliminate hazards to the 
trial subjects .

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2a study in subjects  diagnosed with abdominal pain due to quiescent to 
mildly active CD.  The study design is a randomized, multi  center, open -label, group 
comparison  consisting of two cohorts dosed with  APD371 in approximately  16 
subjects  (8 subjects  in each cohort) . Randomiz ation will be stratified by sex . A study 
plan is provided in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. APD371 -004 Study plan  
 
Subjects  will enter a screening period of up to 28 days  during which they will record 
their APS on a diary card.  If the ir AAPS  is >4 and they satisfy all other eligibility 
criteria, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive  APD371 doses of 25 mg or 
100 mg  capsules TID for 8 weeks  (until Day 56).  
Eligible subjects will be randomized and on Day 1 subjects will arrive at the study 
site in the early morning will undertake study evaluations and will stay overnight for 
safety monitoring until discharge 6 hrs after first dose on Day 2. Following the first 
day of treatment s ubjects  will return for weekly safety and tolerability assessments  for 
the first two weeks and then once every other week  until the end of the treatment 
period . Safety assessments will inclu de physical examinations, AE reporting, vital 
signs, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)  and clinical la boratory tests including 
blood sampling.  
 
Subjects will record their APS during Screening twice daily for at least 7 consecutive 
days within the Screenin g period (Day -28 to Day -1); early morning and late evening, 

APD371   Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol: APD371 -004   
Amendment 02 (10 August 2017 ) Confidential   Page 22 of 67 approximately (06:00 - 08:00 and 20:00 - 22:00). During treatment , subjects will 
record their APS three times a day on each treatment Day (Day 1 to Wk 8 ), before the 
morning dose, at 1.5 hours af ter the morning dose and before the evening dose.  
They will also record their stool frequency  on a daily basis.  
 
There will be two serial PK assessments; one at the beginning of the study Wk 0 (Day 
1, 2) and another at the end of the study Wk 8 (Day -1) and Wk 8. A single PK 
collection will be performed in the clinic prior to the subject’s first daily dose on Wks 
2, 4 and 6.  A final PK sample collection will be performed at the follow -up visit will 
occur on Wk 10.   If subjects discontinue the study (Early  Termination), a final PK 
sample will be collected .  
  
3.2 Study Duration  and Dates  
 
For each subject,  the study duration will last a total of approximately 14 weeks 
consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of 8 weeks and a 
follow -up period of two weeks .  
Subjects  will undergo Screening procedures within 29 days prior to dosing . If 
eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be checked -in at the study site  early morning on 
Day 1 , they will overnight at the study site  on Day 1 during which they will be 
randomized, treated with their first dose of APD371 and assessed for safety, 
tolerability, PK and efficacy. They will then be allowed to re turn home 6 hours after 
the first dose of APD371 on Day 2.  
The schedule of procedures and visits for the study is provided in Table  1. 
3.3 Rationale for Study Design  
As described in Section 1.1, APD371 has previously been administered to healthy 
adult subjects at single doses of up to 400 mg  and in multiple dose of up to 200  mg 
for 10 days TID . This proposed m ultiple -dose study is  primarily designed to evaluate 
the safety , tolerability , and PK  of two oral doses of APD371 in patients with CD with 
abdominal pain in order to provide reliable safety, tolerability, and PK data that will 
guide drug dose and therapeutic regimen choices in subsequent clinical studies .

At completion of the study, all study medication will be reconciled by the Sponsor’s 
monitor and then  returned at the direction of t he Sponsor to be retained or destroyed 
according to applicable U SA regulations. Prior to any action being taken with study 
medication after the study is completed, the Investigator will contact the Sponsor Contact 
listed in the Synopsis for approval of suc h action.  
4.6 Dosage and Administration  
Investigational product will be dispensed to the subjects under the superv ision of the 
Investigator or his/her designee as determined by the randomization schedule . Dispensing 
will occur every two weeks at Wk s 0, 2, 4  and 6.  
Subjects should not crush, break, chew, or dissolve the capsules.  There are no f ood 
restrictions around dosing  with the exception of  ingestion of grapefruit j uice or prune 
juice . 
For each of the planned dose cohorts (APD371 25  mg and 100  mg) subjects  will self-
administer  study treatment TID  
 on Days 1 to 56. Subjects will be requested not to take their morning dose 
of study medication on the day of a planned study visit schedule  
 until instructed to do so by the Investigator or his/her 
designee. There will be a total of 8 subjects randomized to each dose cohort.   
4.6.1  Dose Interruption and Stopping Rules  
Adverse Events (AEs) of s upine SBP decrease , supine DBP decrease , postural BP 
decrease , HR increase  and HR decrease  will be closely monitored.  I f such an AE occurs 
in patients taking the study drug, the Investigator must assess whether the AE meets the 
study drug interruption/stopping rules  and proceed as recommended  in the below table .     
If the study drug is interrupted due to the criteria described in the table, the patient will be 
evaluated as part of an unscheduled visit to assess their status and the I nvestigator will 
determine n ext course of action.  If necessary, subsequent visits to assess the outcome of 
the event will be scheduled.  Once the re -start criteria are met, study drug will be re -
started under medical supervision.  Additional visits may be scheduled at the 
investigat or’s discretion to more closely monitor patient status.  
Any patient that develops postural hypotension will not be discharged from the study site  
with study drug until the event completely resolves and safety and tolerability of the 
reduced dose in the pat ient is confirmed.

4.8.1  Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized after the Investigator has verified that they are eligible per 
criteria in Section 3.5 and Section 3.6.  Subjects will then be enrolled into this study and 
assigned to APD371 25 mg TID or 100 mg TID accord ing to a randomization schedule.  
Subjects will be randomized based on gender.   
Randomization will take place across all study sites using a centralized master list held by 
the study manager.  When a site is ready to enroll a subject, they will contact th e study 
manager to get the appropriate dose group assignment and unique subject number.  The 
subject’s identification number will be used on all of that subject’s case report forms 
(CRF). Any subject identification numbers that are assigned will not be reu sed even if the 
subject does not receive treatment. All subjects must start treatment within 1 week of 
randomization.  
4.8.2  Blinding

5.1 Informed Consent  
For any subject to be  screened t he Investi gator will obtain a signed Informed Consent Form 
(ICF).  The ICF must be reviewed and approved by the Investigator’s designated IRB and by 
the Sponsor. The ICF should include all the elements as outlined in Section 4.8.10 of the ICH 
guideline for GCP (E6).  
All subjects will be informed in writing of the nature of the proto col and investigational 
therapy and  its possible hazards, and of their right to withdraw at any time, before they will 
be permitted to sign the ICF.  The subject’s me dical record should contain written 
documentation indicating that informed consent was obtained.  
5.2 Medical History  
During  the S creening  Visit , a complete medical history and a social history, including 
smoking, caffeine , and alcohol use, will be c ollected b y subject interview er. Concomitant 
medications, recent blood donations, illnesses, and participation in other investigational drug 
studies will also be recorded. A review of the subjects screening medical history will be 
performed at the time of presentati on on Day 1 (pre -treatment) to update findings including 
the requirement for a AAPS ≥ 4 (from a subject diary) and to document any pre -treatment 
AEs.  
5.3 Physical Examination  
Body measurements (height and weight) will be taken at the timepoints indicated in th e 
Schedule of Events (Table 1). A complete physical examination including weight will be 
performed at the initial Screening visit. Abbreviated physical examinations (includes body 
weight and evaluation of changes to previously observed abnormal findings) will be 
completed at the time of presentation to the clinic prior to initial dose administration , at the 
Follow -up Visit Wk 10 and at early termination noting changes in any body system since the 
previous examination.  
5.4 Vital Signs  
Supine blood pressure, puls e rate, temperature, and respiratory rate will be measured after the 
subject has been resting in the supine position for 5 minutes at the timepoints indicated in the 
Schedule of Events (Table 1). All once daily vital sign assessments are take place before 
morning dosing or equivalent times when not dosed at approximately 08:00.  Vitals signs 
will be measured after any 12 -lead ECG measurement but prior to any blood draw that is 
scheduled at the same timepoint. Pulse rate will be measured with a pulse oximete r.  
Active -Standing Test  
The Active -Standing Tes t15 that measures BP  and heart rate  before and after changing the 
position from supine to standing will also be performed.  The test will be performed by  the

the supine position for 5 minutes and then after 1 and 3 minutes of standing.     
The test will be  performed  at the following timepoints:  
• Day 1: pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours after first dose  
• Day 2 : 2, 4 and 6 hours after the first dose  
• Week 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 visits  2 hours after the first dose   
The activ e-standing test will be performed if subjects discontinue the study (Early 
Termination).  
 
5.5 Abdominal Pain assessment  
5.5.1  Abdominal Pain Score  and Average Abdominal Pain Score  
The abdominal pain s core (A PS) is a PRO  using an NCR rating scale which is recorded in a 
subject  diary.  The 11 point NCR scale ranges from 0 [no abdominal pain] to 10 [worst 
possible abdominal pain] will be recorded by subjects in a diary as follows;  
During Screening.  Twice daily for at least 7 consecutive days within the initial Screening 
period (Day -28 to Day -1), at the following times;  
1. Early morning, approximately 06:00 - 08:00  
2. Late evening, approximately 20:00  - 22:00.  
 
The Screening assessment of AAPS will be based on the average of the last (most recent) 7 
days of morning and evening diary records within the screening period.  
During Treatm ent. Three times a day on each treatment Day (Day 1 to 56) at the foll owing 
times;  
1. Before the morning dose and before any other morning dose study procedures  
2. Approximately a t 1.5 hours after the morning dose  
3. Before the evening dose.  
Note: Subjects will also be required to complete the diary before their first mo rning dose on 
Wk 0 (Day 1) , and at the End-of-Treatment Visit at Wk 8 in the early morning (06:00 - 
08:00).  If a subject discontinues the study, Early Termination, the APS score will be 
assessed.  
The average abdominal p ain Score ( AAPS) is the average of t he APS score over ea ch weekly 
assessment period (W k 1 to Wk  8). These average score s will be determined automatically in 
the eCRF from the diary cards  records inserted into the eCRF.

5.8 Electrocardiography  
5.8.1  12-lead Safety Electrocardiograms  
Safety 12-lead ECGs will be recorded from an ECG mach ine and will be printed and 
reviewed on site by the Investigator  or designee. Typically,  all 12 -lead ECGs will be 
obtained as single tracings, with the exception of the pre -treatment  ECG obtained on Day -1, 
whic h will be  a trip licate recording. If a 12 -lead ECG shows an abnormality, then 
two additional ECGs should be obtained as soon as possible for confirmation. Abnormalities 
of particular i nterest include increased PR or  corrected QT ( QTc) intervals , either absolute 
prolongati ons or clinically noteworthy increases from baseline values.  
Electrocardiogram s will be recorded with subjects resting in the supine  position. Subjects 
will have been in the supine  position for 10 minutes prior to ECG recording , which will be  
performed prior to any vital sign measurement and/or blood draw that may be scheduled at 
the same time  point.  
Intervals to be provided on the confirmed read for each 12-lead ECG are: RR, PR,  QRS, QT, 
QTc, QTcB, and QTcF. All interval measurements will be made from a single lead (lead II). 
If lead II is unsuitable for measurement, the following lead p rogression will be used: I, V4,  
V5, V3, any suitable lead.  
The Investigator  will be responsible for review and interpretation of 12-lead ECGs on site 
and for determining if the ECG is normal, abnormal clinically insignificant , or abnormal 
clinically significant. Findings will be documented in the eCRF.  This information will be 
used in the ongoing safety review during the conduct of the study . 
A 12-lead ECGs will  be collected at Screening; at the start of Wk 0 (Day 1)  and at Wk 8 
(Day -1) prior to and 1.5 hours after the first daily dose; and at the Follow -up Visit at Wk 10 . 
12-lead ECGs will be collected prior to any vital sign measurement and/or blood draw that is 
scheduled at the same time point.

Total blood volume collected for PK samples will be approximately 100 ml.  
A PK sample collection manual will be provided to instruct  on the type of anticoagulant  to be 
used, the material supplies, and the sample processing, storage , and shipping procedures.  
Plasma samples will be stored at the local laboratory  and shipped to th e analytical lab for 
analysis.  
At the end of each cohort, biological samples (e.g. plasma) should be packed, labeled, and 
shipped on dry ice to the designated bioanalytical CRO for analysis. Samples should be 
shipped in accordance with the hospital SOPs or  guidance, and only on a Monday, Tuesday 
or Wednesday, to minimize the possibility of the samples b eing in transit over a weekend.  If 
duplicate samples are being shipped, confirmation should be obtained of arrival at the 
analytical lab of one set of sample s before the second set  is shipped .  
5.12 Adverse Events Assessments  
Adverse event s will be recorded and reported in accordance with ICH GCP and 
22 CFR§312.32. The definitions of AEs and SAEs will be as given in the ICH Topic E2A, 
ICH Guideline “Note for Guidan ce on Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Stand ards for Expedited Reporting.”  
5.12.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
Subjects will be instructed that they may report AEs at any time . Adverse event s will be 
regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between  the Screening Visit and the time of 
administration of the first dose of study medication . All events reported following study 
medication administration will be recorded as TEAEs . 
Monitoring of AEs will be continued up to 30 days after  the last  study medic ation 
administration . In the event that an AE is not resolved or stabilized by this time, the Sponsor 
in consultation with the Investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or 
close -out the event in the database if no further follow -up is necessary.  

APD371   Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  APD371 -004    
Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 44 of 67 For this study, an AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject 
administered any dose of study medication (APD3 71) and which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal rela tionship with this treatment.” An AE can therefo re be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the product. AEs 
can be any of the following:  
• Unfavorable change s in general condition ; 
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms ; 
• Concomitant disease or accident;  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
in the course of a clinical study ; 
• Pre-existing conditions which worsen in s everity or frequency or which have new 
signs/symptoms associated with them . 
Adverse events may be elicited by asking the question: “Since you were last asked, have you 
felt unwell or different from usual in any way?” Any adverse or unexpected events, signs  and 
symptoms, will be fully recorded on the A E Form including details of severity , onset, 
duration, outcome and relationship to the drug as determine d by the Investigator . Whenever 
possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a un ifying diagnosis 
(e.g., self-limited  fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured as an 
upper respiratory infection rather than by the i ndividual signs and symptoms). Adverse 
event s may  also be reported at any time. The type and duratio n of follow -up of subjects after 
AEs will be documented.  
5.12.2  Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in the following 
outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Is life-threatening ; 
• Require d/prolonged hospitalization ; 
• Disability/ incapacity ; 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect ; 
• Important medical e vent. 
All SAE s will be captured from the time of  Screening  to 30 days after the dose of study drug, 
and will be monitored until resolution or stabilization . 
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a n SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one 
of the outco mes listed in this definition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood

Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 45 of 67 dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in -subject hos pitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Elective hospitalization and/or surgery for clearly pre -existing conditions (for example a 
surgery that has been scheduled prior to the subject’s entry into the study) will not be 
reported as an SAE. All other hospitalizations, including elective hospitalizations for any 
condition that was not pre -existing, will be reported as a SAE .  
Any AE considered serious by the investigator or which meets SAE criteria must be reported  
to PPD Pharmacovi gilance (PVG ) the remote data capture (RDC) system within  
24 hours from the time study site personnel first learn  about the event. The following contact  
information is to be used for SAE reporting:  
. 
PPD Medical Affairs/Pharmacovigilance  
PPD PVG Hotline:  
PPD PVG Fax line:  
 
In the event that the RDC  entry is not possible (e.g., system failure or access problems), the  
study site should complete the paper SAE report form and fax the form to PPD PVG within  
24 hours of awareness of the event. The RDC  system should be updated as soon as it is  
available.  
 
A full description of every serious adverse event will need to be provided to PPD PVG (this  
may be supported by source documentation such as laboratory reports or a discharge  
summary should the patient be hospitalized).   
Other situations as defined in ICH Topic E2A, ICH Guideline , 22 CFR§ 312.32, and EU 
Volume 10, may also qualify for expedited reporting . In these situations,  the process will be 
as detailed for SAEs above:  
• SAEs which  could be associated with the tri al procedure s; 
• SAE s and AEs of special interest including Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs) that could materially influence the benefit -risk a ssessment of a 
medicinal product, such as: a clinically important increase in the rate of a serious 
suspected adverse re action over that listed in the Investigator B rochure.   
Subjects who become pregnant during the study wil l be discontinued immediately. Although 
not considered a n SAE or AE, pregnancies occurring during the period of study drug 
administration (Day 1 to Day 1 1) until 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be 
reported to the Sponsor Contact and IRB in the same manner as a n SAE.  
Pregnancies will be followed every trimester thro ugh the first well baby visit. For female 
partners who become pregnant by male study subjects during the course of the study, 
reasonable efforts will be made to collect information on the partner’s pregnancy thr ough the 
first well baby visit as provided by the male study subject.

Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 46 of 67 5.12.3  Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of each AE will be assessed at onse t by a nurse and/or physician. When 
recording the outcome of the AE the maximum severity of the AE ex perienced will also be 
recorded. The severity of the AE will be graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0317 definitions, listed below:  
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated;  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasiv e intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) *; 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limi ting 
self-care ADL**;  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences ; urgent intervention indicated;  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using 
the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
 
5.12.4  Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Study Medication  
The relationship of an AE to investigational product(s) will be classified using modified 
World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria (Edwards and Biriell, World Health Organization 
Collaborating Cent re for International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows.  
Rela ted:  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on  
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this 
definition ; or an event  that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals  where i nformation on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Not related :  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with sufficient 
evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no 
temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered afte r 
onset of event; investigation shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other 
cause; etc.) ; or an event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes 
a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or unde rlying 
disease provide plausible explanations .

Action taken  for AEs  will be documented in the eCRF according to the following : 
• Concomitant medication  or other treatment  
• Withdrawal from study  
 
5.12.7  Action Taken for Study Drug  
Any action taken with study drug will be defined based on  ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline 
and documented in the eCRF according to the following:  
• Drug Withdrawn  
• None (not changed)  
• Dose Reduced    
• Unknown  
• Not Applicable  
 
5.12.8  Collection of Extra Laboratory Samples/In vestigations  
In the event of a clinically important AE, a suitable sample may be collected for drug assay 
or fo r additional laboratory tests. The Investigator must ensure that the sample i s properly 
labeled and stored. The Investigator and others responsib le for care of the subjects should 
institute any supplementary investigations of significant AEs based on the clinical judgment 
of the likely causative factor. This may include seeking a further opinion from a spec ialist in 
the field of the AE. The Sponsor  (or designee) may suggest special tests based on expert 
advice.  
5.12.9  Follow -up of Adverse Events Present at Last Scheduled Study Visit  
Adverse events present at the last study day ( Wk8 ) that require follow -up or a repeat 
laboratory test will be assessed at the last Follow -up visit (Wk 10)  and i f still present will 
APD371   Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc

Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 48 of 67 continue to be followed -up for 30 days after the last day of study treatment, according to the 
CRO’s procedures for AE follow -up.  
Adverse event s that have not resolved or stabilized at  30 days after the last subject’s last 
study dose, will be reviewed with the Sponsor on an individual basis to determine if the 
database will be locked and subsequently updated once the events of ongoing AEs are 
resolved or if database lock will be held.  
5.13 Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
All medications ( OTC  and prescribed)  that are  taken by subjects and all procedures that are 
performed during the Screening period and during the study must be recorded in the eCRF 
with start date/time and stop date/tim e, if known.  
5.14 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug  
The study will be terminated early if, in the opinion of the Sponsor, Investigator, or IRB, an 
unacceptable risk to the safety and welfare of subjects is posed by the continuation of the 
study i n light of review of the key safety data.  
Subjects  will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason  should they so wish. The I nvestigator  may remove a subject if, in his/her opinion, it is 
in the  best interest of th e subject. A subject may be withdrawn from the study for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Deviation/ noncompliance with the protocol;  
• A serious or intolerable AE occurs;  
• The S ponsor or Investigator terminates the study;  or 
• Withdrawal of consent - any subject may withdraw his/her conse nt from the study at 
any time. The Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to document the specific 
reason why consent is withdrawn.  
 
5.14.1  Handling of Withdrawals  
Although a subject  is not obliged to give his/her reason for withd rawing prematurely, the 
Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the 
subject ’s rights. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the subject will remain under the 
supervision of the study physician  until in satisfactory health. Reasonable efforts will be

Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 55 of 67 7 DATA MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Data Collection  
All data will be collected according to the Sponsor or CRO’s SOPs.  
Upon databas e lock, to include resolution of all queries, the CRO, if applicable, will provide 
SAS Transport Files (SAS XPT) datasets to the Sponsor and to the biostatistician for analysis 
using secure electronic data transfer per the Sponsor’s specifications.  
7.2 Data Co ding  
7.2.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ; version 18.0 or later ) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest 
such as onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maximum 
severity, causal relationship to study  medication, and action taken. Whenever possible, a 
constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., 
self-limited  fever, runny nose, cough, and s cratchy throat should be captured as an upper 
respiratory infection rather than by the i ndividual signs and symptoms). Adverse event s will 
be regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between Screening and the time of 
administration of the first dose of study medication . All other AEs that occur after the first 
dose of study medication will be considered to be ‘treatment -emergent’.  
7.2.2  Concomitant Medications  
Due to the variability in how medications are recorded, a standard naming convention is 
required in order to t abulate this data effectively. A common method of standardization is to 
categorize medica tions by their preferred term. In order to do this, medications will be coded 
using the W HO Drug Dictionary, Format C.  
7.2.3  Medical History  
Medical history will b e coded using MedDRA (version 18.0 or later).

Amendment 02 (10 August  2017)  Confidential  Page 56 of 67 8 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the  responsibility of the 
Sponsor  or designated CRO . Full d etails of the statistical analyses will be written  in a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to database lock.  Any 
changes made to the pre -specified statistical analysis plan, will be listed in the Clinical Study 
Report along with an explanation as to why they occurred.  
8.1 General Considerations  
This is a proof -of-concept study design and there are no formal hypothesis tests being 
specified, Descriptive statistics for proportion based and continuous variable s will be 
reported. Subgroup analysis by randomization stratification  factor sex will be performed to 
assess potential safety and efficacy differences between males and females. Non-inferential 
between dose cohort comparisons for main study endpoint measures will be performed using 
parametric or non -parametric methods as ap propriate and nominal p -values  (2-sided) will be 
reported . The 95% confidence intervals for main study endpoint measures  will also be 
reported . 
8.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
No formal sample size and power calculation were performed. For this initial study in 
subjects  it is planned to treat and complete safety and tolerability assessments in 
approximately  16 subjects , which is reasonable to assess the main study endpoints . Since 
subjects maybe replaced if they are withdrawn due to major protocol violations, a maximum 
of 20 subjects  will be randomized in the study.  It is expected that this number of subjects 
will provide guidance for the assessment of tolerability in this population and quantify  the 
extent of abdominal pain relief.  
8.3 Analysis Populations  
The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study medication.  
The PK  Completers Population  will be defined as all subjects who receive APD371  and have 
at least 5 of the 9 scheduled PK collections on Wk 0 ( Day 1), Wk 0 (Day 2)  - 2 or Wk 8 ( Day 
-1) and Wk 8 , including the pre -dose sample.   
The Efficacy population  will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study medication and have completed at least one consecutive week of APS up to Week  4.

8.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The PK analysis will be conducted by the Sponsor ’s representative  or designated CRO 
employing noncompartmental  methods   
. Only subjects who are given active APD3 71 drug and have evaluable 
plasma concentration -time profiles will be included in the analysis.  
Individual APD3 71 and metabolites M1 , M2 , and M4 (  
plasma concentrations at specified timepoints will be listed for each subject and will be 
summarized by dose level. Individual plasma concentration -time profiles of APD3 71 and 
metabolites M1, M2 and M4 will be plotted on both a linear and a semi -logarit hmic scale for 
each dose level.  Mean values will also be presented graphically for each dose level.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of APD3 71 and metabolites M1, M2, and M4 may be listed for 
each subject and summarized by dose level. The following PK parameters may be 
determined for APD3 71 and metabolites unless otherwise specified : 
Wk 0 (Day 1) and Wk 8 (Day  -1) 
Cmax maximum plasma concentration  
tmax time of maximum plasma con centration  
AUC 0-8 area under the plasma concentration -time curve over dosing 
interval  (8 hours ) 
Wk 0 (Da y 2), 2, 4, 6, 8  
Ctrough plasma concentration observed before treatment administration 
during repeated dosing  
 
The individual elapsed sampling times  will be used for all plasma PK parameters . For the 
purpose of calculating descriptive statistics and PK parameters, plasma concentrations below 
the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to zero . After the peak, any measurable 
concentrations obs erved after two or more consecutive concentrations below the LLOQ will 
be considered anomalous and excluded from the PK analyses . Any quantifiable 
concentrations at pre -treatment on Day 1  will be set to zero.  
Unrounded data will be used for estimation of s ummary statistics and PK analysis. Data will 
be rounded for reporting purposes only, with data presented to 3 significant figures for

revised informed consent be approved as determined by the IRB.  
• Documentation and explanation of individual protocol deviations on the appropriate 
eCRF page or in letters to the Sponsor.  
• Submission of reports of SAEs to PPD Medical Affairs/  Pharmacovigilance  within 
24 hours after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information .  
• Submission of  written  reports of SAEs, as outlined in the protocol,  to the IRB within 
15 calendar days of their disclosure.  
• Submission of timely progress reports to the IRB and Sponsor at appropriate intervals 
on a schedule determined by the IRB.  
• Maintenance of appropriate records: Federal regulations require an Investigator to 
prepare and maintain adequate and an accurate case history  designed to record all 
observations and other data (such as study drug accountability) pertinent to the 
investigation on each in dividual enrolled in the study. These rec ords must be 
maintained by the I nvestigator until at least two years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least two years have 
elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product.  
 
In addition, I agree to provide all the information requested in the eCRF in a manner to 
assure legibility and accuracy. To this end, I shall carefully follow the instructions  for

Confidential and/or proprietary information of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  4.6.1 Dose Interruption and Stopping Rules  
Adverse Events (AEs) of supine SBP decrease, supine DBP decrease, postural BP decrease, HR increase and HR 
decrease will be closely monitored.  If such an AE occurs in patients taking the study drug, the Investigator must 
assess whether the AE meets the study drug interruption/stopping criteria and proceed as recommended  in the below 
table .     
If the study drug is interrupted due to the criteria described in the table, the patient will be evaluated as par t of an 
unscheduled visit to assess their status and the Investigator will determine next course of action.  If necessary, 
subsequent visits to assess the outcome of the event will be scheduled.  Once the re -start criteria are met, study drug 
will be re -started under medical supervision.  Additional visits may be scheduled at the investigator’s discretion to 
more closely monitor patient status.  
Any patient that develops postural hypotension will not be discharged from the clinical research unit with study d rug 
until the event completely resolves and safety and tolerability of the reduced dose in the patient is confirmed.

Subjects will be randomized after the Investigator has verified that they are eligible p er criteria in Section 3.5 and 
Section 3.6.  Subjects will then be enrolled into this study and assigned to APD371 25 mg TID or 100 mg TID 
according to a randomization schedule.  Subjects will be randomized based on gender.   
 
Randomization will take place  across all study sites using a centralized master list held by the study manager.  When a 
site is ready to enroll a subject, they will contact the study manager to get the appropriate dose group assignment and 
unique subject number.  The subject’s identif ication number will be used on all of that subject’s case report forms Revised to clarify the

The Principal Investig ator and study site staff should exert every effort to secure subject attendance to the Follow -Up 
visit.  Three attempted telephone contacts should be documented by study personnel before a subject can be 
considered lost to follow -up.  Furthermore, key res earch personnel should mail a certified letter to the subject’s 
address if no response to 3 telephone contacts remain unanswered.  If the subject or a family member does not 
respond, the certified letter receipt should be filed in the individual’s research  record with a copy of the letter sent.  Amended to clarify abbreviated 
physical examination, include 
Active -Standing Test  and p rovide 
clarification on process to 
appropriately document subject 
lost to follow -up.

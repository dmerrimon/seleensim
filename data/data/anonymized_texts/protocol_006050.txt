Summary of Objectives and Design
 
A wide variety of restorative materials are available for dental restorations.  The most 
popular current materials include glass ceramics and full contour zirconia.  Glass ceramic 
materials are generally preferred for their high translucency mimicking enam
el
-
like esthetics of 
natural teeth and zirconia is preferred for high strength applications.  Both of these materials are 
available for clinical treatment using chairside CAD/CAM technology.
 
The introduction of an induction sintering oven (SpeedFire oven/Dentsply Sirona) opened 
the opportunity for chairside full contour zirconia crowns by decreasing sintering times for 
zirconia to under 30 minutes.  3M Chairside Zirconia (3M) was marketed in 2
019 and offers 
improved esthetics and high strength for monolithic zirconia restorations with an efficient 
processing time.
 
Chairside CAD/CAM restorations are generally delivered with adhesive resin cements.  The  
cement may or not require pre
-
treatment of the tooth by etching or a bonding agent.  This creates 
potential confusion for a clinician as to what the optimal material 
selection and treatment 
process should be.  A new adhesive resin cement (Suglue 3/3M) is the latest generation of dual 
cured resin cements from 3M with the innovation to use different tooth pre
-
treatment options, 
self
-
etch, selective enamel etch, or total 
etch depending on the type of restoration.  This 
simplifies the selection process for delivery of restorations by minimizing the amount of different 
materials required.
 
This investigation will be a longitudinal clinical trial to study the long
-
term clinical 
performance of a new adhesive resin cement for chairside CAD/CAM restorations.  Lithium 
disilicate chairside CAD/CAM onlays (IPS emaxCAD/Ivoclar) will be adhesively bo
nded using a 
selective enamel etch technique with a new generation universal adhesive based on Scotchbond 
Universal Adhesive (3M) and a new generation resin adhesive cement based on RelyX Ultimate 
(3M).  Full contour zirconia crowns (3M Chairside Zirconia/
3M) will be cemented using a self
-
adhesive technique with the new generation adhesive cement.  All restorations 
may
 
be followed 
up to five years of service.

Specific Aims
 
The specific aims of this project are:
 
 
1.  Evaluate the short
-
term post
-
operative sensitivity 
associated with a self
-
etching resin 
cement for adhesive luting of chairside zirconia crowns.
 
 
2. Evaluate the short
-
term post
-
operative sensitivity associated with the adhesive luting 
technique for ceramic onlays using a selective enamel etch technique and a universal adhesive 
and dual cure resin cement.
 
 
3.  Evaluate the longitudinal clinical performance of lithium disilicate ceramic onlays and full 
contour zirconia crowns 
for up to
 
five years of clinical service
, for a minimum of 3 years
.  The 
onlays and crowns will be evaluated with FDI criteria (Hickel et al., 2007 and 2010) for esthetic 
properties include surface luster, surface staining, margin staining, color match and 
translucency;  functional properties include anatomical form, material f
racture, retention, margin 
adaptation, occlusal contour and wear, and proximal contact and contour; and biological 
properties include post
-
operative sensitivity, recurrence of caries, erosion, abfraction as well as 
gingival index, and plaque index.

Research Plan: Methods and Materials
 
 
6.1
 
Subjects
 
 
 
The patient population will be selected from current patients under clinical treatment at 
the University of Michigan Dental Clinics.  Patients need to volunteer for the study and must sign 
the informed consent. Patients will be over 18 years of age, of ei
ther gender, and of any ethnic 
background.  Each patient should have at least one carious lesion or defective restoration to be 
restored on a maxillary or mandibular premolar or molar. Each lesion or defective restoration 
should exhibit sufficient size to
 
extend at least one
-
half the intercuspal width of the tooth 
requiring an onlay or full crown restoration. The onlays may contain between one and three cusps 
on the selected tooth as long as an occlusal margin will be present.  All teeth will test vital an
d be 
asymptomatic at the beginning of treatment.  No more than two restorations will be placed per 
patient.  If a patient presents with more than two acceptable teeth for the study, molar teeth will 
be included prior to premolar teeth.  Exclusion criteria 
will include:

Informed Consent
 
 
 
The Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan must review 
and approve the investigation protocol.  Patients can be recruited to the study as soon as the 
contract is finalized, and funding is provided.  Patients who are elig
ible for the study will be 
screened by the Clinical Research Coordinator and fully informed of the nature of the study and 
the need for long
-
term availability.  Each patient who participates in the study will sign an 
informed consent agreement and the orig
inals will remain at the University.  (A copy is included in 
the Appendix).  
Patients will be charged $375 for each restoration.  This will fund an incentive 
fund for patient recalls.  As an incentive for patients to be available for the recall intervals, 
patients will receive $50 for every yearly recall that they return to be exam
ined.
  
Patients will also 
receive free bitewing radiographs at the three
-
year recall appointment as part of routine, standard 
of care for monitoring dental restorations.  Specific study data is not dependent on the 
radiographs.
 
 
After admission to the study a subject may withdraw at any time for any reason. The right 
of each subject to withdraw and the right of each subject to confidential treatment of personal 
data will be respected at all times. The PI will record any subject’s
 
withdrawal and the reason(s).

Restoration Placement
 
 
 
A pre
-
operative questionnaire will be completed jointly by the patient, Clinical Research 
Coordinator, and treating doctor at the restorative appointment (copy enclosed in Appendix).  
This will establish the baseline information from which to compare the r
esponses at subsequent 
times.  Teeth to be restored will be tested subjectively as described in the Data Collections 
section to follow.  The level of sensitivity will be recorded using a criterion
-
referenced rating 
scale.  The use of the scale will be expl
ained to the patient prior to beginning the evaluation.  A 
Caries Risk Assessment will be completed for each patient at baseline based on the number of 
restorations the patient reports having received in the previous 12 months.  
Low Caries Risk
 
will 
be scored for patients having 0 or 1 restoration placed in the previous 12 months.  
Moderate 
Caries Risk
 
will be scored for patients having 2 or 3 restorations placed in the previous 12 
months.  And 
High Caries Risk
 
will be scored for patients having 4 or more r
estorations placed in 
the previous 12 months.
 
 
 
Pre
-
treatment
 
 
 
 
The shade of the tooth to be restored will be determined prior to tooth preparation with a 
Classic Shade guide (Vita).
 
 
 
Preparation
 
 
 
 
All restorative procedures will be performed under standard local anesthesia with no 
increased risks incurred by patients participating in the study beyond those involved in routine 
dental treatment.  An Isolite System, or similar device, will be used to
 
isolate the tooth for cavity 
preparation, optical imaging, and cementation of the restorations.  An Optragate may also be 
used to retract tissues during digital imaging.
 
 
 
Onlay Preparation
 
 
 
The occlusal walls of the chairside CAD/CAM onlay preparation will be tapered 10

from the cavosurface
 
to the pulpal floor to ensure distinct occlusal margins.  The flare of the 
proximal boxes will conform to standard criteria with proximal walls exposed for convenience in 
finishing the margins.  There will be no bevels on margins and all floors and walls 
will be relatively 
perpendicular to the cavosurface.  Any additional design modifications will be in accord with the 
unique parameters of the computergraphic design software.  The onlay will have a 1.5 mm

minimal thickness in the central fissure and 2.0 mm minimal thickness over functional cusps.  If 
in the judgement of the operator, less than 1.0 mm of dentin thickness remains over the pulp, a 
glass ionomer base (Vitrebond/3M) may be selectively placed pri
or to completing the 
preparation. 
 
 
 
Crown Preparation
 
 
 
The occlusal walls of the chairside CAD/CAM crown preparation will be tapered 10

with the axial
-
pulpal angles rounded.  There will be no bevels on margins.  Any additional design 
modifications will be in accord with the unique parameters of the computergraphic design 
software.  The crown will have an axial thickness of greater than 0.
8 mm, 1.0 mm minimal 
thickness in the central fissure, and 1.5 mm minimal thickness over functional cusps.  If in the 
judgement of the operator, less than 1.0 mm of de
ntin thickness remains over the pulp, a glass 
ionomer base (Vitrebond/3M) may be selectively placed prior to completing the preparation.
 
 
 
Restoration Fabrication
 
 
 
The manufacturer's instructions will be strictly adhered to in the imaging, design, and 
manufacturing of the onlays and crowns using the CEREC system (Dentsply Sirona).  Following 
imaging of the tooth preparation with the CEREC PrimeScan, the onlay or cr
own will be designed 
using the CEREC software (5.0).  The onlays will be milled from prefabricated blocks of IPS 
emaxCAD (Ivoclar), a lithium disilicate ceramic.  They will be stained, glazed and crystallized per 
manufacturer’s instructions to create the f
inal contour and finished surface.  The crowns will be 
milled from prefabricated blocks of 3M Chairside Zirconia (3M) and then sintered in the 
SpeedFire oven (Dentsply Sirona) per manufacturers guidelines.  The crowns will be hand 
polished to create the fi
nal contour and finished surface prior to restoration delivery.
 
 
 
Crown Cementation
 
 
 
Once the crown is ready is for cementation, the internal surface of the crown will be 
cleaned with air/water spray and air dried with oil
-
free air.  
 
All of the zirconia crowns will be cemented with a dual cure resin cement, Suglue 3 (3M).  
Suglue 3 is the latest generation of dual cure adhesive resin cement based on the previously 
marketed RelyX Unicem 2/RelyX Ultimate adhesive cement chemistry. The in
ternal surfaces of 
the zirconia crown will be air abraded with 30 

m aluminum oxide (CoJet sand/3M) at a pressure

of 30 psi to create a uniform, matte surface.  The crown will be cleaned with alcohol, rinsed with 
water, and dried with oil
-
free air.  
 
 
 
The cavity preparation will be thoroughly cleaned with water spray for 10 seconds and 
dried carefully with care taken to prevent over
-
drying the preparation leaving a glossy surface to 
the tooth.  Suglue 3 Cement will be injected directly into the crown 
from the automix syringe.  The 
crown will be inserted to complete seating and the excess cement removed.  The crown will be 
light cured for 10 seconds from the facial, lingual and occlusal for a total cure of 30 seconds.
 
 
 
Onlay Cementation
 
 
 
The PVS replica technique will not be used for the onlays since onlay preparations are not 
as uniform as crown preparations with inconsistent areas for measurement between onlays.  The 
internal surfaces of the IPS emaxCAD onlays will be etched for 20 sec
onds with 4.9% 
hydrofluoric acid gel, rinsed for 20 seconds, and then air dried with oil
-
free air.  ADH
-
19 will be 
actively applied (scrubbed) with the disposable applicator to the etched ceramic surface for 20 
seconds then lightly air dried until there is
 
no movement and the solvent has evaporated 
completely.
 
 
 
The cavity preparation will be etched for 20 seconds with 37% phosphoric acid 
(Scotchbond Universal Etchant/3M), rinsed thoroughly with water, and lightly air dried leaving a 
moist surface that is glossy in appearance.  ADH
-
19 is the latest generation of
 
universal bonding 
agents from 3M based on the Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (3M) chemistry.  A thin coating of 
ADH
-
19 universal bonding agent will be actively applied (scrubbed) with a disposable applicator 
and air dried until there is no movement and the
 
solvent has completely evaporated.  Suglue 3 
Cement will be injected directly into the tooth preparation from the automix syringe. The onlay 
will be inserted into the cement to complete seating and the excess cement removed.  All onlays 
will be light cure
d for 10 seconds from the facial, lingual and occlusal for a total cure of 30 
seconds.
 
 
 
Finishing and polishing will be initiated after visible light curing of the luting agent.  A series 
of diamond finishing burs, rubber abrasive points and cups, finishing strips, and diamond 
polishing pastes will be used for removal of excess cement, final 
contouring of the restoration, 
and adjustment of the occlusion.

Data Collection
 
 
7.1
 
Post
-
Operative Sensitivity
 
 
 
To evaluate the immediate post
-
operative sensitivity, patients will be contacted by 
telephone once a week after the 
initial appointment for four weeks or until the restoration is 
reported asymptomatic.  A criterion
-
referenced rating scale will be used to measure sensitivity.  
The phone interview will be used as a follow
-
up procedure to minimize recall loss as the patien
t 
is not required to return to the clinic.  During the phone interview a criterion
-
referenced rating will 
be made of functional tooth sensitivity using the following scale.  Patients will only be asked to 
return for an evaluation if they are having continu
ed discomfort or any indication of premature 
occlusal contact.
 
 
Sensitivity Criteria:
 
1=  No sensitivity is experienced at anytime
 
2=  Slight
 
sensitivity is experienced occasionally but it is not uncomfortable
 
3=  Moderate sensitivity is experienced occasionally, and it is noticeably uncomfortable
 
4=  Severe discomfort is noted routinely with cold or pressure stimulation
 
 
 
7.2
 
Clinical Evaluation
 
 
 
Two independent evaluators will examine all restorations in the study.  Clinical 
evaluations will be made at baseline, six months, one year, two years
 
and 
three years
. If feasible, 
subjects will return for additional follow
-
up visits at 
four 
and five years
. Evaluation criteria
 
are
 
based on FDI criteria (Hickel et al., 2007 and 2010) for 
esthetic properties include surface luster, 
surface staining, margin staining, color match and translucency;  functional properties include 
anatomical form, material fract
ure, retention, margin adaptation, occlusal contour and wear, and 
proximal contact and contour; and biological properties include post
-
operative sensitivity, caries, 
gingival index, and plaque index  (see Appendix for FDI criteria description).  Disagreeme
nts in 
evaluations will be discussed between the evaluators and a consensus judgment will be reached 
and recorded for every criteria.

Data Management
 
 
 
Case Report Form (CRF)
 
For this study, all required data will be entered into the electronic CRFs (eCRFs), by the end of 
each
 
d
ay by 
Anja Buschhaus
, the Research Clinic Coordinator at the University of Michigan
. 
Approval is required by the principal investigator Dennis J Fasbinder
. Up to 
5
0 sets of paper 
copies of the CRFs may be provided to the site in the event that computer access is limited. If 
paper CRFs are used, they are the source data and must be entered into the eCRF by the end of 
each day. If study
-
related data
 
are recorded for the first time directly into the eCRF, then the 
eCRF is the source document. Completed paper and eCRFs will be rev
iewed by the site monitor 
to ensure accuracy and consistency of subject data. Any discrepancies found during CRF review 
are to be clarified by the Investigator or designee. 
 
In case paper format would need to be used t
he entries will be made with blue ball
-
point pen.  In 
case of necessary corrections, the wrong entry will be crossed out and the new entry will be 
written beside it.  No erasure is allowed for corrections.  Changes or corrections will be dated and 
initiali
zed by the investigator or assigned person(s).  The documentation of each patient visit 
(baseline, follow
-
ups) must be signed and dated by the conducting investigator.
 
If paper versions 
would be used the data wou
ld be directly entered into Clindex for electronic data capture by 
Anja 
Buschhaus.

The completed CRFs and Adverse Events/Incident Reports will be retained together with 
the investigator’s study file for a period of 10 years after completion of the study at the study 
center.  
 
3M intends to use electronic data capture (eDC) software (Clindex) for this study. Sites will be 
trained on the eDC software prior to study enrollment. Each site will be provided with a manual, 
including instructions on how to complete the CRFs and how to 
make CRF corrections. Data may 
be recorded onto data collection sheets (provided by 3M) prior to data entry or may be entered 
directly into the eDC system. Once the forms are completed, the monitor will review the CRFs to 
assure accuracy and completeness. 
The Investigator must review and sign the CRFs for each 
subject in a timely fashion following completion.
 
 
 
 
Adverse Event / Adverse Device Effect Form 
–
 
Incident/Near Incident form
 
 
 
In case of occurrence of any Adverse Event or Adverse Device Effect the appropriate form 
provided by 3M has to be filled in by the investigator.   In case of any near incident or any event 
that could lead or led to any medical hazard for the investigator (
user) of the investigational 
device the Incident/Near Incident form provided by the sponsor has to be filled in by the 
investigator. 
 
Any adverse reactions to the treatment provided as part of the study will be fully 
investigated and recorded on the Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect form (See Appendix), 
including details of the appropriate clinical action taken. An adverse event is def
ined as any 
unintended adverse experience associated with the study materials or study procedures that 
results in an unplanned medical assessment or treatment or changes the risk to subjects. 
 
 
Restoration Failures
 
If a crown or onlay fails
 
during the term of the study, the investigator will provide complete 
information on the manner of the failure and the proposed resolution to the study contact person 
at 3M.   Failures associated with the bonding agent, cement, crowns and onlays that may b
e 
expected in this study include:
 

 
loosening or complete loss of the crown or onlay


 
fracture and/or chipping of the crown or onlay
 

 
surface roughening or discoloration of the crown or onlay
 
Upon a determination that the crown or onlay failure did not result from other identifiable 
causes, and with 3M’s prior approval, the Institution will make arrangements to replace the 
crown or onlay or carry out appropriate alternative treatment (i.e. repl
acement with a fixed or 
removable partial denture) at 3M’s expense. 3M will not be responsible for any expenses incurred 
without its prior approval.  
If a crown or onlay fails after the term of the study, 3M will not be 
responsible for any costs incurred i
n its repair or replacement.  
3M will have no responsibility for 
any other treatment a patient may receive during the term of the study or after the study has 
ended. 
 
 
 
 
Monitoring
 
 
 
Monitoring visits will take place at the study center.  During these visits, questions on the 
study conduct will be discussed and the study documentation will be reviewed. The study 
monitor will check whether the Clinical Investigation Plan was followed 
and whether the 
investigational device was applied according to the Instructions for use.  The monitor will verify if 
appropriate patient consent is available for each patient and that it was included before 
enrolment.
 
 
 
Furthermore he/she will check the availability, completeness, logicalness, accuracy and 
legibility of certain study documents, the CRFs and the Adverse Event/Incident forms. The 
occurrence of any new Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect/(near) incident wi
ll be reported in 
the monitoring report and copies of the forms will be collected.  Certain data in the CRFs will be 
verified with source documents (patient files). 
 
The study will be monitored at appropriate intervals by the study monitor, or his/her 
designee, by means of visits to the study site to evaluate study data and any photographs.  Study 
monitoring visits will involve review of the study status and any issues
 
pertaining to it. All 
Informed Consent forms, HIPAA forms will be reviewed for signatures; all CRF’s will be reviewed 
for completeness of data entry and that the study protocol is being followed; the subjects’

profiles will be checked to ensure they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Materials will be 
checked for adequate storage and sufficient quantity to meet the study needs. 
 
 
 
Data collection and Data corrections
 
 
 
During monitoring, CRFs will be checked for accuracy, legibility, logicalness and 
completeness, that all patients have given informed consent, meet selection criteria, and have 
had treatments randomly allocate in accordance with the study protocol.  Resu
lting changes in 
the data will be initialized and dated by the person who changed them.  If all open questions 
could be cleared with the investigator, copies of the signed Adverse Event/Incident forms will be 
provided for the Study Monitor’s file.  Data en
try will be done by 
Anja Buschhaus
, Research Clinic 
Coordinator of the Cariology, Restorative Sciences Clinical Research Unit.

Statistical Analysis
 
            
In general, all analyses will be conducted separately by type of restoration; onlay or crown. 
Means and standard deviations were calculated for all clinical measurements and assessments. 
Categorical variables were summarized in frequency distributions. 
 
There will be two datasets analyzed at each recall period; (1) one dataset consisting of subjects 
who were enrolled up to and including that recall period, and (2) one dataset consisting of all 
subjects with baseline data. In the second dataset (2) primary
 
and secondary outcome variables 
which are missing will be imputed using the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), 
wherein the last observed values for that variable will be carried forward to all remaining 
timepoints.
 
The primary analysis for this study will be the percent of intact/surviving restorations from 
baseline to the end of each recall period. This will be estimated using the Kaplan
-
Meier method, 
there will be no direct comparisons within this analysis. The med
ian survival time of a restoration 
will be presented alongside survival curves.
 
The secondary analyses for this study will relate to the FDI criteria for esthetic properties 
including surface luster, surface staining, margin staining, color match and 
translucency;
 
 
functional properties including anatomical form, material fracture, re
tention,

margin adaptation, occlusal contour and wear, and proximal contact and contour; and biological 
properties including post
-
operative sensitivity, caries, gingival index, and plaque index
 
 
(see 
Appendix for FDI criteria description). The FDI criteria will be 
assessed at each recall period 
versus their respective baseline scores for a particular restoration within a particular subject. FDI 
criteria which are measured in an ordinal
-
discrete manner will be assessed using the Wilcoxon
-
signed rank test. Criteria wh
ich are measured continuously such as PI and GI will be assessed 
using the student's t
-
test, in the event that the PI and GI scores do not appear to be Normally 
distributed this assessment will shift to be done using the Wilcoxon
-
signed rank test.
 
A two
-
sided alpha of 0.05 will be used for all comparisons. There will be no adjustments made for 
multiplicity.
 
All statistical analyses will be performed 
e.g. 
using SAS version 9.4 or above (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC)
.

Project Time Line
 
 
 
The recruitment of patients and clinical placement of restorations will begin immediately 
upon approval and funding of the project.  It is anticipated to take 9
-
12 months to recruit and 
place the restorations required for the study.
 
Protocol Amendments and Discontinuing the Study
 
After approval of the study protocol, any changes to the content of the study 
documentation must be described in an Amendment Form and be approved by the PI, 3M, and 
the reviewing IRB 
prior to implementation.  Any decision as to whether to prematurely stop the 
study will be taken jointly by the PI, 3M, and the IRB. Where early termination of the study occurs, 
subjects will receive appropriate follow up dental treatment.

Equipment
 
 
 
A CEREC system including a CEREC OmniCam and PrimeScan, MCX mill, Programmat 
oven, and SpeedFire oven is available at the University of Michigan for use during the study.  All 
other instrumentation required for placement and clinical evaluation of the re
storations is 
available through the Research Clinic of the Department of Cariology, Restorative Sciences, and

Facilities
 
 
 
The Graduate General Dentistry Clinic maintains a two chair Clinical Research Unit for 
clinical research within the department.  A full time Clinical Research Coordinator is dedicated to 
the Clinical Research Unit as well.  She will coordinate and schedu
le all patient appointments, 
maintain recall schedules, and collate data collected.  A Certified Dental Assistant will also 
provide clinical support as well.  Additional dental materials and instruments as well as 
personnel support will be provided by the 
Graduate General Dentistry Clinic as needed.

Additional Sponsorships:
 
 
 
No other sponsorships are presently available or will be applied to this project.
 
 
 
In the event that study restorations should fail and require replacement, patients may 
elect to have a laboratory
-
fabricated restoration placed instead of another test restoration.  
This 
would incur a significant cost to the investigators that is not included in the budget.  Replacement 
restorations would be fabricated in the Graduate General Dentistry Clinic at the prevailing charge 
per unit. 3M will pay the cost of these replacement
 
restorations in accordance with Section 7.3 
Restoration Failures.

11.4.1 Intense hypersensitivity.
 
11.4.2 Delayed with minor subjective 
symptoms.
 
11.4.3 No clinical detectable sensitivity.
 
 
 
Intervention necessary
 
but not replacement.
 
12. 4.1 Caries with 
cavitation and 
suspected undermining caries
 
12.4.2 Erosion in dentin
 
12.4.3 Abrasion/ abfraction in 
dentin.
 
Localized and accessible can be

APPENDIX I: Protocol Synopsis  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
The US prevalence of childhood -onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of cardiovascular 
risk, has increased to epidemic  proportions in recent decades.1,2  Persons  with major mental illnesses in the 
public sector, including childhood -onset illnesses, lose a mean of 25 -30 years of potential life expectancy 
compared to the general population, primarily due to obesity -related conditions like cardiovascular disease 
(CVD ).3,4  Children with mental illness who are treated with antipsychotic medications are at additional risk for 
obesi ty and related risk conditions,5 increasing observed rates of  adverse cardiovascular events.6  Early 
results from the Metabolic Effects of Antipsychotics in Children study (MEAC; PI Newcomer, MH072912)  
indicate that 12 weeks of initial antipsychotic treatment is associated increases in directly -measured ad iposity 
and insulin resistance,7,8 a cardiometabolic profile change predictive of CVD and diabetes risk.  
Despite known elevations in obesity -related premature mortality seen w ith childhood -onset versus 
adult -onset obesity,9 including early development of carotid plaques10  and fatty liver,11 there remains  an 
under -appreciation of these risks in children, and extremely low screening rates for even basic risk factors in 
children.12,13 Progress has been made in the last 10 years, as a variety of noninvasive techniques have begun 
to be applied in children. These techniques, including  carotid intima media thickness (IMT) measured by 
ultrasound, body composition measured by dual energy X -ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and hepatic triglyceride 
content measured using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging -estimated proton density fat fraction (PDFF) , allow 
for the early, noninvasive study of metabolic risk. Unfortunately, none of these promising methods have been  
applied to the high -risk population of children with psychiatric disorders, and cardiac triglyceride content has 
not been evaluated in children at all.  
This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease risk, including whole -body adiposity, 
hepatic triglyceride content  and carotid IMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, 
respectively. The overall aim of this two -study research plan is to characterize risk using these 
sensitive biomarkers in children with mental heal th disorders, and evaluate the magnitude of change 
observed in these biomarkers in children receiving an established weekly behavioral weight -loss 
(BWL)  intervention. This will be accomplished with a  randomized, controlled test of the effects of a 1 6-week 
behavioral weight loss intervention on CTGC, PDFF  and IMT in overweight/obese antipsychotic  (AP)-treated 
children  randomized 2:1 t o weekly BWL  treatment or monthly diet and exercise education or usual care (UC), 
versus nonpsychiatric (NP) overweight or obe se children undergoing the weekly BWL treatment.  
 
Study Aims for this pilot randomized controlled trial:  
Aim 1: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a BWL  intervention on DEXA -measured whole body 
adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic  (AP)-treated children compared to  nonpsychiatric (NP) overweight 
or obese healthy controls, and in  AP-treated youth randomized to monthly Usual Care  (UC) .  
Aim 2: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a BWL  intervention on PDFF  in overweight/obese 
AP-treated children compared to  NP overweight or obese healthy controls, and in AP -treated youth 
randomized  monthly U C.  
Aim 3: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a weekly behavioral weight loss intervention on 
CIMT in overweight/obese AP-treated children compared to  NP overweight or obese healthy controls, and in 
AP-treated youth randomized  monthly U C. 
 
Primary Hypothesis: Change in DEXA -measured total fat and PDFF /IMT will be more pronounced in the 
weekly weight loss i ntervention groups compared to the monthly Usual Care intervention.  
 
Exploratory Aims:  
a) To evaluate the effects of 16 weeks’ of weekly versus monthly weight loss intervention on changes in 
standard cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., fasting lipids, in sulin, glucose, adiponectin, fibrinogen, high 
sensitivity C -reactive protein and very low density lipoprotein particle size).  
b) To evaluate baseline psychiatric symptom severity on treatment adherence and changes in biomarkers 
during treatment.  
 
 
 
 
 
PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT & SELECTION  
This project aimed to  recruit overweight or obese mentally ill antipsychotic treated (AP) and healthy 
non-psychiatric (NP) participants.  The majority of AP participants in the proposed study will be well -
characterized su bjects participating in the Metabolic Effects of Antipsychotics Children study (MEAC, PI: 
Newcomer; MH 072912), the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic at WUSM, BJC Behavioral Health Clinics, 
community psychiatrists, and the Volunteer for Health Registr y. Healthy control subjects will be recruited from 
Washington University and Children’s Hospital general pediatric clinics, referred from community pediatricians, 
and from Volunteers for Health. Recruitment i nclude d all races and ethnic groups  and both genders, with 
targeted enrollment reflecting the overall gender distribution of males and females for “externalizing” dis orders

mood disorder not otherwi se specified), anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive 
disorder, separation anxiety, social and other specific phobias) as well as other disorders, including autism 
spectrum disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome an d pervasive developmental disorder not 
otherwise specified), psychotic disorders (schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia and psychotic disorder not 
otherwise specified) and movement disorders (tic disorder, Tourette’s Syndrome) ( EXCEPT  for the Obese or 
Overweight Control Group , none of whom  can meet criteria for any DSM -IV Axis I psychiatric illness);  iv) 
Participants treated with  psychotropic medication may not have any medication changes for 1 month prior to 
study enrollment at the di scretion of the PI, and Antipsychotic -Treated Participants must be treated with an 
antipsychotic > approximately 6 months  with no antipsychotic medication dose changes for 1 month; vi)  The 
Healthy Overweight or Obese Control Group may not be currently tak ing any prescription medications 
(multivitamins, over the counter medications,  glucocorticoid nasal spray and inhalers are permitted, as well as 
non-sedating antihistamines such as but not limited to Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine)); and vii)

MEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL & DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS  
Diagnostic assessment with both child and caregiver reports was  administered with the semi -
structured, standardized  MINI Kid . Behavioral assessments will include d Aberrant Behavior Checklist 
(ABC),15,16 and the  Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist/Adult Behavior Checklist (CBCL/ABCL) . Medical 
Records (MR)  and Medical History Forms  were  used to document each participant’s personal and family 
medical history. The Duke Pubertal Status Questionnaire (P SQ)17 was completed by participants at least 10 
years old, and by both caregiver and participant when the participant is younger than 10. A Locator Form , 
including extensive contact information of both participant and caregiver that has historically allowed us to 
achieve a follow -up rate of >90% in all of our past studies, was completed at  baseline to enhance the ability to 
locate participants throughout the course of the study.  
Medication: a medication history will be obtained by self -report clinician interview  at baseline and at 
scheduled study follow -up assessments; medication name, dose and refill history will be verified by contact 
with prescribing provider and/or pharmacy. M edication may be titrated as necessary for target symptom relief 
by the patient’s tr eating clinician, but will not be modified through the proposed study or for one month prior to 
study enrollment.    
Locator Form:  This form is completed at baseline to enhance the ability to locate participants at the 
three -month follow -up. This form inclu des all contact information necessary for locating biological parents, 
step-parents and parents residing outside of the household as well as spouses, significant others, siblings, 
grandparents, close friends and neighbors of the participants. In our experi ence families do not object to 
supplying this information and understand that it will only be used to locate them without, under any 
circumstance, revealing why the University is looking for them other than that they are study participants  
Medical Records (MR) and Medical History Form:  This information is obtained by  
telephone to acquire mailing or faxing preference and then mailing or faxing consents to the various 
physicians, other health care providers, and hospitals. Consents accompany mailing materials  with prepaid 
return postage or with instructions for faxing materials back to us. The Medical History Form is administered to 
the mother  about the child.  
 MINI -Kid:18 The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) is a short, structured diagnostic 
interview developed initially in 1990 by psychiatrists and clinicians in the United States and Europe for DSM -III-
R and ICD -10 psychiatric disorders.  The interview takes 15 minutes to administer, and is conducted with both 
parent and child, deferring to parent report when child report is unclear or unreliable.  
Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC):15,16 This instrument is a five -factor scale comprising 58 items 
under the categories of (I) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; (II) Lethargy, Social Withdrawal; (III) Stereotypic 
Behavior; (IV) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and (V) Inappropriate Speech. The 15 -item Irritability subscale 
includes questions about aggression, self -injury, tantrums, agitation, and unstable mood on a scale of 0 to 45. 
It has been estimated that our cut -off of ≥ 18 on this subscale will identify individuals that are 1.3 to 1.5 SD 
above  the mean.  
Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist/Adult Behavior Checklist (CBCL/ABCL):19 The CBCL/ABCL 
serves as a general screening measure of behavior problems, competencies, and school functioning, and has 
well-established norms. It obtains reports from parents, other close relatives, and/or guardians regarding 
children’s competencies and behavioral/emotional problems. A shorter version of the CBCL/ABCL, not 
including the 20 competence items covering the child’s activities, social relations, and school performance, was 
created for the large Missouri sibship study, which does. These shor tened versions will be used for the 
proposed Studies. The revised CBCL/ABCL has 113/126 items that describe specific behavioral and emotional 
problems, plus one open -ended item for reporting additional problems.  
Child Acceptance and Mindfulness Measure (C AMM) :20 The CAMM is a  25-item measure of 
mindfulness and assesses the degree to which children and adolescents observe internal experiences, act with 
awareness, and accept internal experiences with out judging them.  
 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS):21 The rater/cl inician -administered versions of the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) for research assess severity and intensity of suicidal 
ideation, types of suicidal behaviors, and lethality of suicide attempts at time points and over time periods that 
are typical for randomized control trials.  The scale has been validated in children and adolescents, and 
includes 6 yes or no questions regarding suicidal thoughts, intent and behavior.  
The International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ):22 Comprises a set of 4 questionnaires. 
Long (5 activity domains asked independently) and short ( 4 generic items) versions for use by either telephone 
or self -administered methods are available. The purpose of the questionnaires is to provide common 
instruments that can be used to obtain internationally comparable data on health –related physical activ ity. 
Pediatric Quality of Life Scale -both child and parent proxy report versions (PedsQL) :23 ages 8 -12 
(Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Version 4) Lists 23 items of potential problems a child might have faced 
over the past month.  Requests a 5 -point scale answer for each question from 0 (Never a problem) to 4 (almost 
always a problem). Quest ions revolve around possible problems with Physical, Emotional, Social, and School 
functioning.  
Duke Pubertal Status Questionnaire (PSQ): This instrument17 is completed by participants at least 10 
years old. The PSQ has demonstrated high reliability with physical examination. Rather than a physical exam, 
the PSQ relies on participant self -report of Tanner Stage by endorsement of the appr opriate cartoon 
representation of the respondent’s pubertal status. The PSQ has been accepted by the WU HRPO for the 
evaluation of pubertal status . 
Hepatic 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) -estimated proton density fat fraction  
(PDFF) : 1.5T Siemens Magneton Vision scanner (Sie mens, Erlanger, Germany) were  conducted to quantify 
hepatic triglyceride cont ent.24  Participants were placed in a supine position the scanner using standard array 
coils.  Hepatic triglyceride content was determined within a voxel size of 15  × 15 × 20 mm3 by using a point 
resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) single -voxel technique. Data were averaged from 20 scans and obtained with  
a repetition time of 2 seconds . Spectra were acquired at echo times of 24, 30, 35, 40, 50 ms a t upper left lobe 
and mid to lower lobe voxels and at an echo time of 24 ms at the mid -lobe voxel to estimate and correct for the 
T2 decay of the signals. Images were corrected for relaxation and analyzed using jMRUI, a Java -based 
graphical user interface quantification package that allows time -domain analysis of in vivo  MR data.25  All 
frequencies, i.e., chemical shifts, were measured relative to the principal w ater 1H resonance, which is 
referenced as zero Hz.   
Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) : to assess Percent total body fat and percent total fat -free 
mass (Hologic QDR 1000/w, Waltham, MA).26  Appendicular skeletal muscle mass will be estimated from these 
data as described and validated by Heymsfield  et al.27 In addition, changes in bone mineral density (BMD) will 
be ca lculated for the exploratory aim. The error of regional fat free mass determination by this technique, as 
compared with computerized tomography, is less than 5% .26,27 
9-13-MHZ B -mode Carotid Ultrasound : (Vivid E9, GE Medical Systems using automatic ed ge 
detection software ) for the measurement of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in the longitudinal and cross -
sectional axes. IMT was expressed as the average minimum, mean and maximum thickness measured over a 
1 cm region of the bilateral posterior com mon carotid walls approximately 1 -2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb. 
Studies will be reviewed and analyzed by two independent readers, who will be blinded to subject data. The 
intra- and inter -observer intraclass correlation coefficients for IMT measuremen ts at our laboratory are 0.91 
and 0.88, respectively.28 
Plasma Analyses : including traditional measures of cardiometabolic risk such as fasting lipids, glucose 
insulin an d free fatty acids, high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, fibrinogen, very low 
density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle size, and safety labs, including renal and hepatic function tests, blood 
electrolytes, a complete blood count and thyroid  stimulating hormone (TSH), will be obtained.  
Electrocardiography (ECG) : will be performed to screen for any cardiac function abnormalities. 
Medical assessments will be performed by Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU), Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU), Cl inical Trials Unit (CTU) or Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR) staff under PI Supervision.  
 
BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT DESCRIPTION & FIDELITY MONITORING  
Intensive Behavioral Weight Loss:  The Family Based Social Facilitation Behavioral Weight Loss 
Treatment (FBSFT)29 program is a family -based, behavioral weight loss program that is based on t he Traffic 
Light Program and has been employed in studies with overweight and obese children, as well as with children 
who have diabetes.30 FBSFT was modified to fit the needs of disruptive and behaviorally disturbed youth and 
their families. It is known that families of children with disruptive behavioral disorders commonly have high 
dropout rates in th erapy studies.31 Reasons for high attrition rates are multiple and include difficulty with 
transportation, as well as school and work absenteeism associated with the frequent visits, especially  for low -
income families. The modified program includes 16 weeks of weekly session s with the participating youth and 
their adult legal guardian and caregiver. Phone contacts will only replace in -person visits if absolutely 
necessary to achieve the visit. Subjects will be provided transportation to and from visits as needed.  
 Diet and E xercise Education:  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Diabetes 
Association (ADA), American Heart Association (AHA) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have all 
recommended that physicians and families monitor for overweight and obesity, a nd have issued general 
guidelines about how to limit caloric intake and promote physical activity. The Society for Adolescent Medicine 
recommends that primary care providers counsel youth at regular visits using a program called Project EAT, 
which combines  clinician -provided education regarding physical exercise and healthy diet choices, focusing on 
positive body image and encouraging family involvement ( http://www.epi.umn.edu/research/EAT ).32 All 
participants who are not randomized to the behavioral weight loss intervention arm of the proposed study will 
participate in a therapeutic dietary education -only intervention consisting of the initial recommendations 
regarding healthy diet and activity levels of a research clinician (Care as Usual). Follow up education will be 
conducted at monthly intervals concurrent  with visits for regularly scheduled study visits.  
Treatment Fidelity Monitoring : Behavioral intervention treatment fidelity is determined by structured, 
direct observation of individuals carrying out the behavioral intervention, evaluating for evidence of  1) 
adherence to the treatment protocol and 2) competence in the treatment delivery. The demonstration of 
treatment fidelity is critical to the development of a valid behavioral intervention, such that the intervention 
cannot be tested for efficacy in a ra ndomized clinical trial, nor can said intervention be considered evidence -
based until this  critical step is accomplished.33,34  Therefore , a primary goal of the proposed project is to 
demonstrate treatment fidelity of the TLP modified for use in mentally ill children. This will be accomplished by 
video -taping all sessions, whi ch will be reviewed by the PI for treatment fidelity using an established treatment 
fidelity and competence rating scale for an evidence -based pediatric behavioral weight loss intervention 
(personal communication, Denise Wilfley, PhD, 6/2011).  
Credibility and Expectations Scale:   Patient expectations during psychotherapy are often regarded 
as a variable that could affect the course of treatment.  Both the child and parent prior to initiation of the 
intervention will complete the Credibility and Expectations for Improvement scale.   This information will allow 
the therapist to fully address the child/parents’ expectations during therapy and further educate as needed.  
Understanding of Materials Scale:  In order to determine the understanding of the scales and program 
presented, the th erapist/research staff will complete an Understanding of Materials Scale after each session 
with both parent and child participants.  This will allow the therapist and PI to periodically evaluate the general 
level of understanding and determine if changes to the protocol are needed.   
Homework Quality Scale:  Completion of homework assignments is a major component in the 
psychotherapy throughout this program, with the ability to impact the successful outcome of the 
treatment.  The Homework Quality Scale will  be completed by the therapist/PI after each session and will be 
used to assess the quality of homework in relation to the outcome of the therapy at the end of the study.   
Working Alliance Inventory: The Working Alliance inventory measures the quality of the therapeutic 
relationship between the therapist and the patient (or youth and parent in this case). For the present study, 
both parent and child will be asked to anonymously fill out the “Client” version of the inventory and mail back in 
a self -addresse d, stamped envelope provided to them at the 8 and 16 week sessions. The therapist will also fill 
out the Therapist version of the WAI at the same time points.  
Modified TLP Therapist Fidelity Rating Checklist: This checklist includes items to assess therap ist 
fidelity to the manualized therapy, and also includes therapist competency measures. This checklist has been 
used to monitor therapy fidelity in federally funded studies of both TLP and FBT behavioral weight loss 
programming.  
 
  
DATA MAN AGEMENT, SAFETY  & ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
Power:  Our interest in conducting this study was to evaluate feasibility of delivering the weight loss 
intervention in antipsychotic (AP) treated versus nonpsychiatric (NP) overweight or obese youth, and to 
assess  the effect of w eight loss on metabolic measures of interest – CIMT/DEXA/PDDF in the AP -treated and 
NP active intervention groups as well as in a usual care (UC) reference group of obese youths . Comparisons 
of interest were between each  of the two active treatment groups and UC, as well as between  the two active 
intervention groups themselves (AP -treated vs. NP).  Limited prior research in this area complicated power 
calculations for this pilot study.  
Previously published carotid IMT numbers indicating significant differen ces between obese children 
with and without metabolic syndrome criteria provide a crude proxy for the difference between an active 
intervention group and UC, suggesting  that we should be able to detect a difference of 1.27 +/ - 0.005 in intima 
media stiffne ss (units are logarithmically transformed and are therefore unitless).10 Power to detect differences 
in CIMT between the 3 treatment groups using a sample size of 20 per group, an alpha of 0.05, and an effect 
size of 0.16 was calculated to be 0.17.  
Previou s reports of hepatic triglyceride content in the general population indicate that 33.6% of the 
population meet criteria for hepatic steatosis (> 95th percentile of hepatic triglyceride content of 5.56%, 
corresponding to 55.6 mg/g) based on weight criteria,  with obese patients being more likely to meet criteria for 
steatosis than healthy controls.35  Power to detect differences in Hepatic Triglyceride Content between the 3 
treatment groups using a sample size of 20 per group, an alpha of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.49 was 
calculated to be 0.92.  
DEXA power calculations were based on previously noted weight loss of up to 8 -10% in other studies of 
behavioral weight loss interventions between 2 and 5 months in length with known SDs on the observed mean 
change.36,37 Based on our previous experience with antipsychotic treated and untreated children, we 
anticipated that the baseline DEXA % fat would be 14-15 kg of body fat, or roughly 30 -40% body fat . 
Anticipating up to a 5% loss from baseline fat measured by DEXA,  less than the 8 -10% observed in other 
studies, due to potential effects of the ongoing mental health condition and the antipsychotic treatment in this 
sample, we estimated a  difference  between active treatment groups (AP -treated vs. NP ) of 2 +/-3 kg loss from 
a baseline of 15 kg  total fat. Power to detect differences in DEXA Total Fat between the 3 treatment groups 
using a sample size of 20 per group, an alpha of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.53 was calculated to be 0.96.  
Analytic approach:  the primary goal was to compare changes over time in the three risk factors 
(CIMT/DEXA/PDDF) among three groups: obese AP -treated children randomized to the weekly intervention, 
obese NP children also receiving weekly behavioral weight loss treatment, and  an obese  usual care (UC) 
reference group.  Comparisons of interest were  between each  of the two active treatment groups and UC, as 
well as between  the two active intervention groups themselves (AP -treated vs. NP).  Because this is a pre -post 
design with d ata collected only at baseline and at 16 weeks, our analytic strategy used an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), in which the 16 -week value of the risk factor is the dependent variable and the 
predictors are the baseline value of the risk factor and the stud y group (three level factor), with contrasts of 
interest listed above.  Other analyses performed adjusted for covariates such gender and age to determine 
whether baseline -adjusted between group differences at 16 weeks can be explained by such 
covariates.  Because of the relatively small sample size in this study, we performed separate analyses of 
covariance that include precisely one additional covariate, in addition to the baseline value of the risk factor of 
interest in each analysis.   
Recruitment and In formed Consent: All key personnel involved in the design and conduct of the 
research inv olving human participants receive d the required education on the protection of human research 
participants prior to funding of this project. Procedures to recruit parti cipants for the protocol and obtain their 
informed consent were  conducted and supervised by the P.I. Targeted educational and recruitment in -services 
were  conducted at all appropriate facilities in order to make providers and administrators aware of this p roject 
and to assist in identifying eligible participants. Clinicians and administrators at these sites were  informed 
about the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits of the protocol, as well as the inclusion and excl usion 
criteria, so that they could  best discuss the research project with individual patients/guardians that might be 
eligible and interested, making referrals as appropriate for study screening.  The P.I. or Collaborators discuss ed 
the study, including the risks and benefits of participation,  with potential participants, their parents/guardians, 
and relevant family members to obtain informed consent/assent from interested individuals. Written informed 
consent was obtained from the participant (age 18) , or from the guardian with written assent from the 
participant (ages 6 -17).  Guardians were  included in all informed consent processes. The consent form, which 
incorporat es HIPAA authorization, contained  a description of the purpose and procedures, risks and their 
minimization, and possible benefi ts. Participants and their guardians were  assured that they are free to 
withdraw consent/assent at any time and discontinue participation without prejudice to their current or future 
medical care.  The objectives of the project, all of the requirements for participation, and any possible 
discomforts and risks were  clearly explained to the participants orally and in w riting in lay terms which they 
were able to comprehend. Participants  and their parent s/guardians  had at least 24 hours to consider their 
involvement in the study. The subject/guardian signed  an informed consent form, approved by the Washington 
University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board, before participation  in the study.  Once  written 
informed consent/assent was provided to the participant and  his/her guardian, study staff continue d to review 
what to expect in the next study visit during each phone and face -to-face contact and prior to all procedures. I f 
at any time a subject d eclined to participate and withdrew  consent/assent, they were  withdrawn immediately 
from the study at their request.    
Protection Against Ris k:  The risks of breaching confidentiality were  strictly limited by the use of 
locked and restricted access to data as well as numbers rather than names in the database that were  created 
for this project. No identifiers were  included in any computer files or reports generated by this study. All key 
personnel involved in the design or conduct of research involving the human participants receive d the required 
education on the protection of human research participants prior to funding of this project. The discomfort 
associated with blood drawing or cathete r place ment is usually mild and brief and if it persist ed, participation 
was discontinued. All blood was drawn on the clinical resea rch units (CRU, PCRU and CTU), well-staffed 
medical inpatient and outpatient facilities within the Washington University Med ical Center. The risk of adverse 
events during the blood drawing and IV access procedures was monitored by the nurse, who was in 
attendance at all times; treatment was facilitated by the extensive medical resources available on the clinical 
research units.  The risks of blood drawing and catheter insertion were  minimized by use of sterile technique 
and the exclusion of participants with coagulopathy. If the need for medical attention arises , all the resources  of 
a large teaching hospital wer e available for s ubject evaluation and treatment. The clinical research units are 
equipped with a defibrillator and all appropriate emergency medications. Any physical or emotional discomfort 
with any procedures was handled by allowing patients to stop and rest, or ultimat ely to discontinue the 
procedure whenever they desire.  
 Only highly trained research staff or physicians were  utilized to collect data and these individuals were  
experts in confidential and professional interaction with study participants. Participants were  informed in the 
informed consent document that any suicidal or homicidal information obtained from a child/adolescent was 
shared with parent(s) to protect the life of the child/adole scent. If a child/adolescent wa s found to be suicidal or 
homicidal du ring any evaluation, the individual  performing the evaluation provide d the family with immediate 
knowledge of suicide and homicide precautions.  The research staff member provide d the family with 
appropriate mental health ca re referrals, if the family did  not already have a mental health caretaker. If the 
suicidal or homicidal participants we re 18 years old, precautions and referrals were  given directly to the 
participant and to the participants’ adult househol d members. If the participant was  the sole adult  household 
member and suicide/homicide is not deemed to be imminent, precautions and referrals, including emergency 
room contacts, were provided. If any participant would have been  deemed to be imminently suicidal and/or 
homicidal, 911 was contacted as soo n as possible. Participants were also  informed in the informed consent 
document that  the research staff member would provide a request for a referral for professional care  if clinically 
warranted . To protect against any misuse of knowledge about study part icipation, participants were  educated 
in the informed consent document that employers or insurers could act negatively if they learned of the study 
participation. Furthermore, participants were  informed that they may choose not to tell their insurers about  their 
study participation. Participants were also  told that the study will be covered by a federal Certi ficate of 
Confidentiality, which  protects against subpoenas of the research materials.  
 While the proposed study assumed  responsibility for the minima l risks develop ing during the course of 
the behavioral weight loss treatment , participation also offered  a unique opportunity to decrease these risks 
through the high-quality  care described in the protocol , allow ing for early intervention and prevention of  
cardiometabolic risk potentially associated with childhood obesity. All participants were  monitored at a level 
that exceeds the current standard of care.  
The PI review ed the results of all study -related tests and procedures, including the interpretation of 
fasting and safety labs, DEXA , CIMT and MRI scans , and ECGs. In the event of an abnorma l lab result, the PI 
notified  the participant, guardian and other relevant treating clinicians (e.g. psychiatrist, primary care provider 
or pediatrician), and formal safety testing and/or stopping rules as noted in section 5 were applied , as defined 
by existing public health guideline s for diabetes and cholesterol screening in youth.  For incidental abnormal 
DEXA, MRI or ECG findings, an official confirmation by staff radiologist or cardiologist (for DEXA and MRI, or 
for ECG, respectively) was obtained. In the event of a confirmation of  an abnormal finding with relevant clinical 
correlation determined by the PI, a clinical consultation would have been  obtained and appropriate further 
medical workup and/or treatment initiated as necessary.  
Some patients may not have an adequate psychiatri c response to an initial antipsychotic trial. These 
subjects may be treatment resistant, or have severe symptoms that could benefit from alternative therapies 
that are not included in the current study. Inclusion criteria include d a history of defined adeq uate response to 
antipsychotic medication and psychiatric symptom stability in order to ensure that children enrolled in the study 
are appropriately and optimally treated. In order to maintain clinical equipoise in the proposed study, ongoing 
evaluation of  the need for and safety of antipsychotic treatment is necessary. Clinical evaluation of each 
subject occur red during study visits, in addition to ongoing clinical care provided by the treating psychiatrist. 
Study staff  maintain ed weekly phone contact with  the family of ea ch participant, and provide d additional 24 -
hour availability for any research -related issues as needed. The development any psychiatric symptom 
exacerbation, or other adverse events related to psychiatric symptoms was assessed by the PI on  an individual 
basis, and continued participation in the study was determined on an individual basis in consultation with the 
participant’s treating psychiatrist. Any medication changes resulting from psych iatric symptom exacerbation 
were determined by the  participant’s treating physician, and the participant’s data was flagged as such. 
Medication changes during the course of the study associated with acute symptom exacerbation did not result 
in disqualification.  
Finally, because the study population  for th e proposed study consisted  solely of children, ongoing 
assessment for other safety issues relate d to child abuse and neglect were  necessary. The written In formed 
Consent document contained  language notifying participants and their parents/guardians that th e study staff 
will notify the appropriate authorities if child abuse or neglect is suspected. If study staff suspect ed that a child 
was being abused/neglected, staff were to  immediately notify the PI and the issue would have been  discussed 
with the researc h and treatment teams. If appropriate, reports would have been made to Division of Child and 
Family Services child abuse hotline within 24 hours, and the child’s family notified of the report.  
Data & Safety Monitoring:  This study did carry significant risk  and wa s not a Phase III clinical 
intervention study requiring a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC). Thus, safety monitoring was 
conducted as follows. There were no adverse events reported during the study period.  
Adverse events (AEs) definition: AEs are defined conventionally as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a research participant that develops during the planned observation period in the study. The AE 
and study participation do not have to be causally related.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) definition:  SAEs are also defined conventionally, as any medical 
occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or 
significant disability, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an e vent requiring medical intervention to 
prevent any of these examples of an SAE. SAEs may be mild (transient, easily tolerated by the participant), 
moderate (causes discomfort or interrupts the study or the participant’s usual activities), or severe (causes  
considerable interference with usual activities) in severity.  
Causality of adverse events:  The causality of each AE in terms of relationship to administration of 
treatmen t or study -related tests was  assessed as definite (reasonable temporal relationship, with or without 
supporting laboratory data), probable (reasonable temporal relationship and other possible causes can be 
reasonably excluded), possible (reasonable temporal relationship and other possible causes are at least as or 
more likely), and unrelat ed (temporal relationship is not reasonable or other causes are reasonably more 
likely).  
Collecting/reporting of adverse events : In the study, all adverse experiences, whether  expected or 
unexpected, were  reported to the DSMC. Any adverse experience occurr ing to a greate r severity than 
expected was  reported to the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the 
Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU)/Clinical Research Unit (CRU)/Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), and to the 
National Institute s of Health (NIH). The HRPO, PCRU/CRU/CTU, the PCRU  Research Participant Advocate 
(RPA) and NIH will be notified of any serious unexpected adverse experience within seven working days of 
occurrence. If the event is fatal, the HRPO, PCRU/CRU/CTU, RPA and NI H will be notified within 24 hours of 
occurrence. The H RPO, PCRU/CRU/CTU, and NIH receive d annual reports regarding all adverse experiences.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan : The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this protocol will 
include adverse event and other reporting by the P.I. to IRB and oversight and monitoring by the P.I. as well as 
the CRU/PCRU Research Participant Advocate (RPA). Summary reports to the IRB will be provided 
annually.  Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, to  the CRU/PCRU Advisory Committee via the 
RPA, and to the Sponsor: (a) death – immediately; (b) life -threatening —within 7 calendar days; and (c) all 
other SAEs within 7 calendar days using the Electronic SAE System.  
            The stopping criteria and gu idelines include d the following: 1) if, based on a totality of evidence likely to 
influence clinical practice, there wa s clear evidence of harm or harmful side effects of the procedures used in 
this protocol  then the protocol would be  suspended at least un til acceptable modifications have been made; 2 ) 
in the event that a SAE occurred that wa s judged to increase risk to all participants, the study would  be 
stopped and an investigation would  be conducted and a findings report generated and provided to the 
Sponsor, IRB and the CRU/PCRU Advisory Committee via the CRU/PCRU RPA before the study were to be  
resumed; 3) were there  SAEs or AEs that occur red at a frequen cy greater than 5%, they were  added to the 
consent document if not alread y addressed, and enrollment would  be halted while a determination wa s made 
regarding the potential risks to participants.  All reports sent to IRB were  reported to the Sponsor  (NIH) , per 
HRPO guidelines. Thus, th e DSMP for this protocol was  in full compliance with the Washi ngton University 
PRU/C PCRU /CTU DSMP.

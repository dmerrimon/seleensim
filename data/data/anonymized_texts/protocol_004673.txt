PI: Brett D. Atwater, MD  
PROTOCOL VERSION DATE : 03/02/2023  ii ABSTRACT  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
affecting more than 46 million people worldwide.1 Direct current cardioversion 
(DCCV) is used to terminate an episode of symptomatic or hemodynamically 
unstable AF.  The success rate for DCCV is 90 -95% and is dependent on patient and 
procedural characteristics including obesity, use of antiarrhythmic dru gs, pad 
placement, type of shock waveform and shock energy.  Biphasic defibrillation 
waveform shocks improve DCCV success rates for AF to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) 
compared to monophasic shocks. Various biphasic shock waveforms are available : 
The Rectiline ar Biphasic Waveform (RBW) is used by the Zoll series R defibrillator 
while the Biphasic Truncated Waveform (BTW) is used in the FDA approved 
Lifepak model 15 and 20  defibrillators . Despite their routine use in clinical 
practice, no adequately powered prospective head- to-head randomized controlled 
trials  (RCT) have compared the safety or efficacy of the two biphasic waveforms 
for DCCV of AF to NSR.  
The primary objectives for this pragmatic prospective randomized controlled trial are to 1) compare the efficacy of first shock  DCCV  from AF to NSR using 
anterolateral pad placement and a full-output 200J RBW synchronized shock from 
a Zoll series R defibrillator or  a full output 360J BTW synchronized shock from a 
Lifepak 15  or 20  defibrillator; 2) compare the DCCV efficacy of first or second full 
output shock 3) compare the DCCV efficacy of third  or fourth full output shock 
after treatment group cross over  after first failing 2 consecutive full output shocks 
from the originally assigned treatment group . The secondary objective is to 
compare the frequency of skin irritation or damage after first or second shock cardioversion from either defibrillator.  
Data will be derived from approximately 5 60 patients arriving to Inova sites of care  
in AF scheduled to undergo either AF ablation with expected DCCV or elective 
stand -alone AF DCCV. Patients will be included if they are in AF prior to their 
procedure and are willing to sign the consent form and comply with the research procedures. Participants will be excluded if they are in a rhythm other than AF on 
arrival to IHVI, have not been appropriately anticoagulated with warfarin or direct 
oral anticoagulant, or have known left atrial appendage thrombus prior to their 
procedure.

PI: Brett D. Atwater, MD  
PROTOCOL VERSION DATE : 03/02/2023  vi Study Duration:  Each subjec t’s participation will last  from screening  until 1 
minute after the  final  DCCV shock is delivered .  
Study Phases:  1. Screening: Patients arriving in AF scheduled to 
undergo DCCV or AF ablation  with possible DCCV  at an 
Inova site of care  will be screened in the peri -
procedure holding area.  
2. Intervention: Patients will be randomized to a Zoll or Lifepak defibrillator to perform the DCCV.  All shocks will be full output (200J for Zoll shocks and 360J for Lifepak shocks). Follow up will be assessment and documentation of rhythm 1 minute after the last 
shock is delivered.    
Efficacy Evaluations:  1. Proportion of patients in NSR by ECG or monitor 1 minute after the first DCCV shock.  
2. Proportion of patients in NSR by ECG or monitor 1 minute after the first or second DCCV shock.  
3. Proportion of patients in NSR by ECG or monitor 1 minute after a third  or fourth crossover treatment 
assignment shock after failing first and second shock 
on original treatment assignment.  
Safety Evaluations:  1. Number of patients with skin redness, pain or 
discomfort under the shock electrodes (excluding those with cross -over)  
2. Number of patients with arrhythmic events (asystole, atrioventricular block, transient bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmia) within 10 minutes of the last DCCV shock   
3. Frequency of pacemaker or ICD dysfunction after shock among patients with prior pacemaker or 
defibrillator implant  
Statistical and Analytical Plan:  Based on the best available literature we expect the first shock DCCV success rate to be 93% in our population.  A total sample size of 538 subjects (269 in each group) will be needed to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis (a difference of effi cacy < 5%). The analysis 
will be performed on the intention -to-treat population.  
The proportions will be compared using both risk difference and risk ratio with corresponding 95% CI. 
Effects of treatment will be estimated by modified

 BACKGROUND  
Direct current cardioversion (DCCV) is widely used for restoring normal sinus rhythm 
(NSR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)1,2. More than 1500 DCCV procedures were 
performed in the Inova health system in 2022.  Identifying the safest and most 
efficacious method is important.  Despite decades of clinical use, the ideal shock 
waveform and energy for DCCV from AF to NSR are still unknown. Two FDA approved 
external defibrillation de vices  (Zoll series R and Lifepak 15 /20) are used to deliver DCCV 
shocks in clinical practice  in the Inova Health System .  These devices differ in shock 
waveform and maximum energy delivery. The Zoll Series R device uses a Rectilinear 
Biphasic Waveform (RBW) with a maximum energy of 200 Joules while the 
Physiocontrol  Lifepak Series 15/20 device s use a Biphasic Truncated  Exponential (BTE)  
Waveform with a maximum energy  of 360 Joules. Four  small stud ies (n=50 -101 patients 
per group)  have  compared the efficacy of RBW and BTE waveforms for DCCV of AF to 
NSR3,4,5,6. None of the studies were adequately powered to detect clinically meaningful 
differences in efficacy or safety of the waveforms . All 4 studies u sed a protocol starting 
with low energy shocks (50 -100J) and escalating the output over multiple shocks .  Since 
these studies  have been published, maximum energy shocks were found to be more 
effective and safer than escalating low -energy shocks for DCCV7 and maximum energy 
first shocks are now recommended  in European guidelines8. We therefore propose an 
adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of maximum energy RBW and BTE shock waveforms delivered by the Zoll series R and 
Physiocontrol  Lifepak Series 15/20 devices respectively.  
1.1 Study Disease(s)  or Condition(s)  
AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting more than 46 million people worldwide.  
More than 86,000 patients have been diagnosed with AF in the Inova health system in the past 
year.  AF is frequently associated with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath and 
palpitations.  DCCV is a commonly performed procedure to temporarily restore NSR in patients with symptomatic AF or in those with hemodynamically intolerable AF.   
1.2 Product(s) / Agent(s)  
The Zoll series R defibrillator is an FDA approved device with indications for defibrillation of cardiac arrest where there is an apparent lack of circulation and for synchronized DCCV of certain atrial and ventricular arrhythmias . It is indicated for adult and pediatric patients. The 
device is connected to the patient through the one -step cable  and the manufacturer 
recommends also connecting a separate ECG cable .  The Zoll series R defibrillator has been 
deployed across the Inova health system and is currently available for clinical use in all clinical areas performing DCCV.  For this study the device will be used on label and according to 
manufacturer recommendations.  All shocks will be synchronized and delivered in the manual 
mode  at 200J through the one touch hands -free pads.  No shocks will be delivered through 
paddles. The Physiocontrol Lifepak 15  and 20  monitor/defibrillators are FDA approved device s 
with indications for termination of certain fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia.  Delivery of energy in synchronized mode is a method for

PROTOCOL VERSION DATE: 03/02/2023  3 treating AF, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and in relatively stable 
patients with ventricular tachycardia.  The Lifepak 15  and 20  defibrillator s have been deployed 
across the Inova health system and are  currently available for clinical use in all clinical areas 
performing DCCV. For this study all shocks will be delivered in the manual mode at 360J synchronized through hands -free pads.  No shocks will be delivered through paddles.  
 
1.3 Rationale  
Four small studies (n=50 -101 patients per group) have compared the efficacy of RBW 
and BTE waveforms for DCCV of AF to NSR3,4,5,6. None of the studies were adequately 
powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in efficacy or safety of the 
waveforms and all used escalating low -energy shocks.  Since these studies have been 
published, maximum fixed energy shocks were found to be more effective than 
escalating low -energy shocks for DCCV and maximum energy first shocks are now 
suggested in European guidelines8. We therefore propose an adequately powered 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy and safety of maximum energy 
RBW and BTE shock waveforms delivered by the Zoll series R and Lifepak  15 and 20  
devices respectively.  
 
1.4 Relevant Literature and Data  
In 1959 Lown developed a direct current waveform to improve efficacy and reduce 
adverse events associated with defibrillation performed with alternating current.  The monophasic waveform he developed was in use until the 1980s when biphasic waveforms were shown to further improve defibrillation success.  Several biphasic 
waveforms have been developed including the BTE and RBW waveforms.  These 
waveforms have been incorporated into competing FDA approved devices manufactured by Zoll, Phillips, and Physiocontrol/Medtronic.   
 
• The first comparative study of biphasic DCCV shock waveforms was published in 
20033. Investigators randomized 101 patients with AF to DCCV using escalating 
RBW shocks from a Zoll M series defibrillator (50, 100, 200, 200J) or escalating 
BTE shocks from a Physiocontrol Lifepak -12 defibrillator (50, 100, 200, 200J). If 
the four th shock at 200J failed in either arm a single 360J shock was delivered 
from the BTE device. Patches were placed in an antero -posterior location. The 
overall efficacy was 97.9% in the BTE group and 100% in the RBW group 
(p=0.29).  The study was underpowere d to detect a clinically significant 
difference between groups.  Enrollment  would have allowed the study to detect 
an efficacy difference of 20% or more.  
• The second observational study was published in 20044. Patients with AF 
underwent DCCV with a  series of escalating  RBW shock s from a Zoll series M

Medtronic Physiocontrol Lifepak 12 defibrillator.  If DCCV was unsuccessful at 
the maximum deliverable energy patients were crossed over to the other device.  
Patches were placed in an antero -posterior location. 145 patients were enrolled 
but treatment allocation was not randomized because of patient refusal or 
physician refusal to participate in the study.  The success rate was 97% in both 
groups (p=1.0).  2/71 patients in the RBW group failed maximum energy shock 
(200J) and crossed over to the 360J RBW shock and were suc cessfully converted.  
2/71 patients in the BTE group failed maximum energy shock (360J) and crossed 
over to the RBW group.  Both also failed the RBW shock.  
• The third comparative study  of the RBW and BTE  waveforms was published in 
20055.The investigators randomized 188 subjects with AF in a 1:1 fashion to 
receive escalating low energy RBW shocks (50, 75, 100, 120, 150, 200 J) or BTE 
shocks (50, 70, 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, 360 J) . The shock strength was escalated 
until success or maximum energy was delivered.  If maximum energy shock 
failed, the patient crossed over to the opposite waveform.  47 patients were 
excluded leaving a total of 141 patients (71 in RBW and 70 with BTE shocks ).  The 
authors found a maximum energy success rate of 93% in patients receiving a 
RBW shock and 97% in patients receiving a BTE shock (p=0.44). Unfortunately,  
the small study sample size would have allowed the authors to detect a 
minimum difference in success rate of 14% or more, while a clinically relevant 
efficacy difference of 5% or more was impossible to detect.  
• The fourth comparative study of commercially available biphasic waveforms was 
published in 201 36. The investigators randomized 199 patients to receive DCCV 
using either a RBW  from a Zoll series R defibrillator or BTE  from a Phillips 
Heartstart XL defibrillator using 50, 100, 150, 200, 200 J. The shock strength was 
escalated until success or maximum energy was delivered.  95% of patients in 
the RBW and 90.9% of patients in the BTE arms successfully converted to NSR 
(P=0.838).  Unfortunately,  the small study sample size allowed the study to 
detect differences in efficacy of 20% or more and they did not deliver maximal 
energy (360J) shocks using the BTE waveform, limiting the clinical applicability of 
the findings.  
• Since the 4 comparative studies were published, a randomized controlled study 
in 2021 showed  anterolateral patch placement improved DCCV success rate 
compared to anteroposterior placement9. Further, a DCCV protocol using fixed 
maximum energy shocks was found to be more effective than escalating low -
energy shocks7. No adequately powered studies have compared a first maximum 
shock efficacy of RBW (200J) to BTE (360J) waveforms incorporating these 
recommendations and an anterolateral patch location.

5.3 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding/Randomization  
Patients will be randomly allocated to either treatment group in a 1:1 fashion.  Randomization will be blocked by treatment location (Electrophysiology labs  versus 
other environments due to the differing pad locations in these two environments ). A 
randomization sequence will be created in the RedCAP file. Randomization envelopes will be created and stored in the pre -procedure electrophysiology holding area s or 
electrophysiology labs or the DCCV procedure areas .  In the envelope will be the case 
report form with the treatment assignment listed on it. Prior to the DCCV  procedure 
staff will open an envelope to learn the treatment assignment and then use the 
assigned defibrillator.  Patients, staff, and investigators will be unblinded.  The clinical 
staff will complete the CRF.  They will attach the rhythm strip or ECG acquired 1 minute 
after the shock and place it back in the envelope.  They will seal the envelope and place 
it in a secure location to be gathered by the study team.

 RECRUITMENT METHODS 
8.1 Methods  
8.1.1 Recruitment  
Patients in AF presenting to the pre -procedure holding areas prior to DCCV or catheter 
ablation of AF at Inova care sites will be screened for possible enrollment.  Patients will 
be provided an opt- out information sheet before being enrolled in the study.   
8.1.2 Screening  
Screening will occur immediately before the patient undergoes a DCCV procedure.  
Screening will be performed by the performing physician investigator.  Because the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are identical to those for DCCV of AF, no additional chart review will be needed by the physician investigator for study screening.  
Prior to a DCCV procedure the chart is reviewed and a face to face discussion is had with the patient. These processes will be used to also screen for study inclusion since t he 
same data will be used to determine if they are a candidate for DCCV AND whether they can be included in the study. Screening will occur on site just prior to scheduled DCCV procedures by the investigators performing the procedure. Screening will occur without 
prior consent/assent/HIPPA authorization under a HIPPA and/or Informed Consent Waiver.  
Projected Participants  
Recruitment will stop when approximately 560  participants are 
screened/consented. It is expected that approximately 560  participants 
will be enrolled to produce 544 evaluable participants.

The R Series System Semiautomatic And Manual Mode Is Indicated For 
Use In Early Defibrillation Programs Where The Delivery Of A Defibrillator 
Shock During Resuscitation Involving CPR, Transportation, And Definitive 
Care Are Incorporated Into A Medically -Approved Patient Care Protocol.  
The R Series System Semiautomatic And Manual Mode Is Indicated For 
Adult And Pediatric Patients.   
 
The Lifepak model 15 and 20  Monitor/Defibrillator was approved with 
the following indications on 8/22/2018 (downloaded from 
www.accessdata.fda.gov  on 3/3/2023.)   Manual defibrillation is indicated 
for the termination of certain potentially fatal arrhythmias, such as 
ventricular fibrillation and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Delivery 
of this energy in the synchronized mode is a method for treating atrial fibrillatio n, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and, in 
relatively stable patients, ventricular tachycardia.  
 
10.1.2  Dosing and Administration  
The dose of energy for all shocks delivered from the Zoll series R defibrillator will be 200J.  The dose of energy for all shocks administered from the Lifepak series 
15/20  will be 360J.  A patient may receive a second shock at the same output if 
the first shock is unsuccessful.  If the second shock is unsuccessful the original defibrillator and pads will be removed,  and the alternate defibrillator applied.  
10.2 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization  
10.2.1  Randomization  
Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 fashion to RBW or BTE waveforms and their associated maximal outputs.  Randomization codes will not be broken.

 DATA ANALYTICS  
12.1 Study Endpoints  
Efficacy assessments for the primary endpoints will occur using data obtained at screening and the DCCV study visit.  Specifically,  the endpoint of NSR will be acquired by 
monitoring strip or 12 lead ECG 1 minute after each DCCV shock is delivered.   
 
Primary Endpoints  
12.1.1  The frequency of NSR one minute after a single full output DCCV shock is 
delivered by a Zoll Series R RBW waveform defibrillator and a Lifepak Series 15/20 BTE waveform defibrillator.  
12.1.2  The frequency of NSR one minute after the first or second full output DCCV shock is delivered by a Zoll Series R RBW waveform defibrillator 
and a Lifepak Series 15/20 BTE waveform defibrillator.  
12.1.3  The frequency of NSR one minute after the first or second full output DCCV shock is delivered by a Zoll Series R RBW waveform defibrillator 
and a Lifepak Series 15/20 BTE waveform defibrillator after crossing over 
from the alternative defibrillator after failing 2 consecutive full output shocks at maximum output.  
Secondary Endpoints  
12.1.4  The frequency of adverse events including skin irritation, pain, or 
burning; arrhythmic events including asystole, atrioventricular block, 
transient bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmia within 10 minutes of the 
last DCCV shock; and the frequency of pacemaker or ICD dysfunction after shock among patients with prior pacemaker or defibrillator implant.  
Transient bradycardia will be defined as symptomatic bradycardia requiring the use of temporary pacing, atropine, isuprel, or epinephrine for rate support. Th e secondary safety endpoint will be assessed only 
among patients who do not cross -over from one defibrillator to the 
other.  
12.1.5  End of Study Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study If he or she has completed all phases of the study including screening, enrollment,

The end of the study is defined as completion of the last visit shown in the Schedule of Activities.  
12.2 Analytics  
All analyses will be performed on an intention to treat basis.  We calculated the sample size on the basis of the 3 prior randomized studies that compared RBW and BTE shocks for DCCV of AF.  In these studies,  the mean overall shock success 
was 90 -97% and the first shock success varied from 54% -90% albeit the first shock 
was delivered at a lower energy than maximum output.  We therefore estimate 
that the mean first shock success rate will be  93%.  A clinically meaningful 
difference in first full output shock efficacy is 5% . A total study sample size of 544 
patients (272 in each group) is needed to provide a power of 80% to reject the null hypothesis (a difference in efficacy of < 5%) . 
 
 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
13.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
13.1.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Inova PI will monitor and review the study progress, participant safety, and the accuracy and security of the data.  This will be a minimal 
risk study. The risks of participation are limited to unexpected loss of confidential PHI.   
13.1.1.1  Communication Plan  
This is a single center study.  There are no collaborating institutions.  
 
13.1.2  Risk Assessment  
The research interventions include on -label use of two FDA approved 
defibrillators for DCCV of AF.  These procedures include the risks of asystole, arrhythmia, stroke and skin burn or irritation. These risks are present whether or not these procedures are performed as part of a 
research study. The only risk associated with participation in the study is accidental loss of PHI.  This risk will be minimized by temporarily storing the paper case report forms in secure location s and long -term storage  of 
all data in a REDCAP database with shredding of the paper case report 
forms.  
13.1.3  Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
There is no benefit to individual participants in the research study,

Truncated Exponential Waveform Shocks for Cardioversion of Atrial Fibrillation (Zoll vs 
Lifepak -RCT)  |  
PI: Brett D. Atwater, MD  
PROTOCOL VERSION DATE: 03/02/2023  15 however, the study results will inform IHVI and all other hospitals if there 
are clinical differences in efficacy or safety of the two commercially available defibrillators.  These findings may improve the likelihood of successful and safe DCCV for our future patients  as well as patients cared 
for in hospitals around the world.  The results will be reported on 
clinicaltrials.gov where they will be available to the device manufacturers and the FDA.  The results will also be published in a peer reviewed manusc ript and presented at a major society meeting.  
13.1.4  Risk-Benefit Assessment  
Overall risks to research participants are minimal and limited to potential loss of PHI.  The benefit of participation is improvement in our knowledge 
of the mechanism of cardioversion and improvement in the safety and 
efficacy of this commonly performed procedure.  Because the benefits of the study far outweigh the minimal risks, we are justified in pursuing the 
study.  
13.2 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
13.2.1  Adverse Event s Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, significant adverse events ( SAEs ) are not expected. If any unanticipated problems 
related to the research involving risks to participants or others happen during  this study (including SAEs), they will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with 
Policy – Reporting of Adverse Events, Unanticipated 
Problems and Protocol Violations, ORI 11.16 . AEs that do not meet 
prompt reporting requirements will be summarized in the  narrative or 
other format and will be tracked and documented internally by the study team but not submitted to the IRB .
 
The investigator will comply with the requirements of ORI policy and of the reviewing IRB of record for the reporting of protocol deviations, adverse events, and unanticipated problems presenting risk to participants or others (UPIRSOs) to the IRB. If the Inova IRB is not the IRB of record, the Investigator must still submit prompt reports of any potential serious or continuing non -compliance or UPIRSOs 
to the Inova IRB via the electronic submission system consistent with ORI policy.  
13.2.2  Follow -Up Report to and from IRB  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAEs are followed until either resolved or stable

16.3.4  Adults Unable to Consent-  Since consent will not be required, adults 
unable to consent will be enrolled.  
16.4 Documentation of Consent: A waiver of documentation of consent has been 
submitted.  
16.5 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care. They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study treatment or visit schedules, AEs, or due to reasons lis ted 
below. The Investigator or Sponsor may also withdraw participants who violate the study plan, or to protect the participant for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons. It will be documented whether  each participant completes the study. If the 
Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the participant completes or withdraws from the study, the participants will be 
communicated based on the IRB’s directions.  
16.6 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
Discontinuation from study intervention does not mean discontinuation from the 
study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by the study protocol. If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to ch anges from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified 
designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  
16.7 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participant may voluntarily withdraw from the study or discontinue the study intervention at any time. 
 
Participants may discontinue the study intervention, but remain in the study for follow -up, especially for safety and efficacy of study endpoints

PROTOCOL VERSION DATE: 03/02/2023  18 An Investigator ma y discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the 
following reasons:  
16.7.1  Significant study intervention non -compliance.  
16.7.2  Any Clinical Adverse Event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical 
condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant.  
16.7.3  Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study 
intervention.  
16.7.4  If the participation meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed 
or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation.  
16.7.5  Participant unable to receive DCCV  on the scheduled date/time . 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the paper  Case Report Form (CRF).

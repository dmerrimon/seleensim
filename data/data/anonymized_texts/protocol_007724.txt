4 of 41  1. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
 
This study will utilize an in vitro high throughput chemosensitivity assay, mRNA expression 
microarray data, and patient mutational analysis , as available,  to choose specific drugs or drug 
combinations for the treatment of patients with relapsed (2nd salvage or greater) or refractory (to 
at least 2 inductions) acute leukemias.   
  
1.1.The primary objective is to  test patient cells in a high throughput assay against 
individual drugs and drug combinations within 21 days to enable optimal choice of 
drug combinations for therapy .  In addition, gene expression that reveals activation 
of druggable pathways or mutations in genes that confer susceptibility to specific 
agents may also be considered in choice of treatment.  
 
 1.2.The secondary objective is to evaluate the response to the chosen therapy. 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
Current approaches to acute leukemia  result in complete remission for most child ren and the 
majority of adults. Approximately 50% to 70% of patients can achieve long- term disease control 
when undergoing transplantation in early phases of the disease ( De Lima et al. 2004 ). However, 
despite a high rate of complete remission to induction chemotherapy, the majority of patients 
with acute leukemia will relapse. Even in acute lymphocytic le ukemia (AL L), which is generally 
responsive to chemotherapy, nearly 10% to 30% of children are at risk for relapse ( Tzortzatou -
Stathopoulou et al. 2001).  It is generally believed that patients who undergo allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplant have a high likelihood of cure. However, those transplanted with 
detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) have a high  risk of relapse after transplant.  MRD 
tends to be proportional to risk of relapse (Campana, 2009).  In fact, most adults and some 
children will relapse with acute leukemia within 6 to 24 months. For patients diagnosed with 
acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ), the projected 5- year survival is only 25% (American Cancer 
Society , 2015). For patients who have failed multiple attempts at induction, or those who have 
failed 2 salvage regimens for relapsed AML, or those with initial remission duration of less than 
six months, the results of treatment are very poor (Estey et al. 1996). For  patients with  a first  
complete remission duration of less than 12 months or no init ial CR, there was a 0% chance of 
achieving CR with second salvage induction. Consequently, for patients unable to achieve an 
initial remission, the 4 -year survival rate is 23% (Othus et al. 2015). Even for patients being 
treated with a first salvage regime n, a poor risk group can be identified by criteria including 
relapse free interval, age at relapse, cytogenetics, and whether they had a prior stem cell 
transplant. These patients had a 12 month survival of only 16%, and a 5 year survival of 4% 
(Breems et al. 2005). There are numerous conventional and experimental chemotherapy 
regimens available for such patients, but with few exceptions, we cannot predict response. 
Furthermore, traditional regimens are known to fail in patients who have had two or more 
salvage regimens.  
This, in combination with the morbidity and mortality a ssociated with side effects of  
chemotherapeut ic agents, is why we pursued a prior feasibility trial utilizing a high throughput

5 of 41  chemosensitivity assay to guide individual drug selection for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid 
leukemia. Entitled “Treatment for Relapsed AML Based on a High Throughput Drug Sensitivity 
Assay” (NCT # 01872819), this trial finished patient accrual in October 2015. 
The in vitro high throughput drug sensitivity assay  used in this initial trial was  comprised of both 
investigational drugs and FDA approved drugs. This assay is CLIA -certified for patient 
diagnostic purposes and testing was  performed in the Quellos High Throughput Core Facility, 
University  of Washington Medicine, Seattle WA.  Thus far, we have tested a total of 46 AML 
patient blood samples (30 preclinical and 16 on the prior trial) enriched for blasts to exceed 80-
90%, using magnetic bead isolation methods when needed.  Two 384- well plates  accommodate 
testing of 80 drugs at 8 concentrations each plus controls.  Cells were added to matrix protein 
coated non- tissue culture -treated 384 -well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 50µL of 
complete media (containing pen/strep and 10mM HEPES buffer) using a Thermo Scientific 
Matrix WellMate, and incubat ed overnight to allow adhesion.  Compounds (50nL) were added 
(ranging from 5 pM to 100 µM) to patient samples using the CyBio CyBi- Well Vario and 
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 96 hours.  The final solvent concentration, (DMSO) in the assay 
was 0.1%.  CellTiter- Glo (Promega) was dispensed into the individual wells with the WellMate 
following the manufacturer’s recommended procedures and, following 20 minutes incubation on 
an orbital shaker, luminescence was measured on a Perkin Elmer EnVision Multi- label plate 
reader  to assess viable cells.  Measurements were corrected for background luminescence and 
percentage cell viability is reported as relative to the DMSO solvent control. IC 50 values were 
calculated by fitting data using least squares method to the standard four- parameter logistic 
model where:  
“Y” = (“Y min”+(“Y max”/(1+((“X”/”IC 50”)Slope), and Y = % viability, Y min = minimal % viability, 
Ymax = maximal % viability, X = compound concentration, IC 50 = concentration of compound 
exhibiting 50% inhibition of cellular viability, Slope = the slope of the resultant curve.  Curve 
fitting was performed using idbs XLFit software (Microsoft Excel). 
The novel aspect of the assay is that the cell survival is measured on a substratum to which the 
cells are adherent, a property which confers drug resistance for all hematologic malignancies. 
Recent studies (McMillin et al. 2010 and Straussman et al . 2012) demonstrate the importance of 
the microenvironment in drug sensitivity testing.  Our adherence strategy, although it does not 
substitute for microenvironment, is a component previously demonstrated sufficient to reproduce 
drug resistance in AML (Becker et al . 2009).    
Preliminary testing of 46 patients’ leukemic blasts confirmed that each patient’s cancer has 
unique in vitro  chemotherapeutic susceptibility (Figure 1). By comparing the EC50 of each drug 
across all 46 patients, we are able to discern an in dividual patient’s relative  in vitro  susceptibility 
to any given drug.

patients and 160 drugs. Red = cell death, Green = cell survival. Hierarchical clustering is shown 
for patients and drugs. Note that each patient exhibits a unique pattern of drug susceptibility.  
 
Fifteen patients were enrolled in the  initial feasibility  study. Individual drugs were chosen on the 
basis of EC50 and drug availability, and patients received the single agents at the accepted 
maximal tolerated dose.  Within an average of 11.6 (median 9, range 4-28) days, 13 patients 
received single drugs to which their cells appeared to be sensitive with an EC50 range of 0.026-
0.175umol/L, including cladrabine, mitoxantrone, bortezomib or vinblastine. All patients 
exhibited a decline in blast number after receipt of the indicated drug, on average, by 92.6% 
(range 80.5-99.8%) (Figure 2). One patient achieved CR and 2 patients achieved partial complete 
remission  (Becker et al. 2014) .

Other groups have used similar assay based approaches to profile in vitro chemosensitivity of an 
individual patient’s AML blasts to traditional chemotherapy  (Bennett  et al.  2014). In vitro 
chemosensitivity assays may also be useful for estimating a novel agent’s utility in AML. 
Pemovska et al  (2013) identified targeted agents both investigational and approved for other 
indications that exhibited significant cytotoxicity in an in -vitro assay. Several of these agents (ex 
dasatinib, sunitinib and tems irolimus) were employed in assay -guided treatment resulting in brief 
but marked reduction in leukemic burden. Recognizing the inherent limitations of in vitro 
testing, two separate groups have developed systems to perform sensitivity testing of several 
chemotherapeutic agents simultaneously within living solid tumors (Klinghoffer et al. 2015; 
Jonas et al. 2015). 
The incorporation of mutational analysis and gene expression data in  the choice of chemotherapy  
has the potential to further refine the approach . Specific mutations in genes implicated in AML 
can determine responsiveness to certain therapeutic agents.   For example, p rior studies  
demonstrated  that tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations found in the FLT3  gene confer 
chemo therapy resistance to some FLT -3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, but not to others such as 
crenolanib  (Zimmerman et al. 2013 ; Zhang et al 2014).  
Our group is currently analyzing our own in vitro assay data for correlations between gene 
expression and in vitro drug sensitivity. To this end, we developed a novel computational 
method, named SPARROW, to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data by identifying 
genes that represent important molecular events in publicly available AML expression data 
(Logsdon et al. 2015) . In particular, it aims to identify  hub regulators  whose expression levels 
are predictive of many downstream gene expression levels. We have found that high expression 
of several hub regulators correlates well with increased sensitivity to certain classes of drugs. As 
would be expected, high expression of FLT3  was associated with increased sensitivity to FLT3  
inhibitors sunitinib, AP24534 and tandutinib. High expression of SMARCA4  and TRF2 were both 
associated with increased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors daunorubicin, mitaxantrone, 
etopsoside and topotecan. (Lee et al. 2014). 
We now propose a second assay-directed therapy trial in adult and pediatric ref ractory acute 
leukemia that will utilize drug combinations and incorporate genetic information in the choice of 
drugs.

4. STUDY DRUG INFORMATION 
 
Our original drug sensitivity assay included 115 investigational drugs and 45 FDA approved 
drugs. Approximately 60 of these exhibited activity against at least half the 46 patient samples 
tested to date. The second -generation  assay includes 77 investigational drugs and 70 FDA 
approved drugs. The latter FDA approved drugs are approved for oncologic indications though 
not necessarily acute leukemia.  Several of these drugs are tested in combination mirroring 
frequently used anti- leukemic regimens. Table 1 is a list of the drugs included in the 147- drug 
panel and their mechanism s of action.  If mutational analysis reveals an aberrant  pathway for 
which there is an available targeted inhibitor, such a drug will be added to the assay if it can be 
obtained.

5. PRETREATMENT EVALUATION  
 5.1. Screening Evaluations/Procedures  
1. Signed, written informed consent: Consent must be completed prior to performi ng 
any study- related procedures.  
2. The following standard of care evaluations, if done, may  be reviewed  within the 
electronic medical record  to assist with determin ing eligibility for the study , unless 
required per the i nclusion/exclusion criteria : 
a.      Medical history: Detailed documentation of disease and treatment history with    
outcomes 
b.     ECOG performance status (Appendix A)  
c.       Concurrent medical conditions.   
d.     Serum chemistries: Electrolytes (so dium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests (aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), total bilirubin  
e.      Initial standard of care diagnostic bone m arrow reports,  may  include 
hematopathology, cytogenetics / FISH, flow cytometry and mutation status. 
f. MUGA scan may be performed prior to treatment for participants receiving 
anthracycline therapy  
 
6. PLAN OF TREATMENT   
6.1. Chemosensitivity Assay 
A blood sample of 25 cc in sodium heparin will be sent to the research laboratory for 
testing in the high throughput assay, and results will be available in about a week. For 
patients with less than an absolute blast count in t he per ipheral blood of 5.0 X 109/L, a 
bone marrow sample of 10 cc will be sent. If this aspirate contains an inadequate number 
of blasts, another bone marrow aspirate may be obtained  with patient approval.  
Investigator discretion will be used for analyzing the adequacy of the cell counts .  Gene 
expression data will be obtained via methods described elsewhere (Logsdon et al. 2015). 
Mutational analysis will be performed with the MyAMLTM, CLIA validated next 
generation sequencing assay, which screens for mutations in 196 genes associated with 
AML. (www.genection.com/myaml.html).  
1. Treatment with  any chemotherapeutic agent necessary to control leukemic 
burden is permitted  during the time of testing and drug procurement. These 
agents must be stopped prior to initiation of assay -guided therapy.  
2. If leukemia is present in a location other than the blood or bone marrow, a 
sample of fluid or a biopsy from that location (for example, a skin or tumor 
sample or spinal fluid) may be sent to the research laboratory for testing in the 
high throughput assay.

6.2. Drug Choice 
A drug or combination of 2-3 drugs tested in combination will be chosen  from only the 
FDA approved drugs listed in Table 1 based on availability, insurance clearance, degree 
of apparent in vitro respo nse (lowest  absolute EC50  or lowest EC50 relative to other 
patients  for individual drugs ), prior publication of drug or drug combination use in other 
leukemia patients and  difference in class of drug compared to the drugs to which the 
patient has previously not responded. In addition, gene expression that reveals activation 
of druggable pathways or mutations in genes that confer susceptibility to specific agents 
may also be considered in choice of treatment.  If an inhibitor is available that has the 
same target (e.g.-a specific kinase) as the one tested, this drug may be substituted. For 
combination regimens, we intend to only utilize regimens for which there are clinical data 
in humans. Additional  FDA approved drugs or combinations of drugs may be added to 
the assay panel in the future if there is evidence to suggest efficacy in leukemia patients. 
However, the protocol will be amended to include these drugs prior to their use in any 
assay -guided treatment regimen.   
6.3. Drug Dosing 
Individual drugs will be used in doses that have been utilized in humans with anti- cancer 
response, at standard or maximum tolerated dose. Drug combinations will be used at 
standard doses or doses for which there is published experience. Appendix E contains a 
list of sample  dosages, though they may change if new data emerges showing superior 
outcomes with alternative dosing strategies.  
6.4. Consent f or Individua l Regimens  
In addition to the consent for this study, there will be an individual general clinical 
consent for treatment  that is not considered a research consent and may include printed 
information that describes the drug or drug combination, mechanisms of drug action in 
lay terms and applicable side effects , this activity is considered standard practice and is 
not strictly performed for research, these consents may vary in appearance. Additionally, 
an alternative clinical trial consent may be used if the patient is found to be eligible for a 
clinical trial which may contain an ass ay-guided regimen or agent. Th ese consent s will be 
signed after assignment of the drug or drug combination. These consents will be obtained 
for the first two treatment regimens directed by the study, and afterward consent will be 
obtained only as required per institutional policy by treating physic ians. 
6.5. Duration of Therapy 
Subjects may receive up to two distinct assay-guided regimens  that will be monitored for 
response and adverse events for the study. Treating physicians have discretion to 
continue treatment thereafter based on data from the study and the responses and survival 
of the patients will be monitored, but not the adverse events. 
7. ON STUDY EVALUATIONS  
1. The on-study period begins at initiation of study procedures and response data to 
any study directed therapies will be collected  for a period up to 2 years. Adverse events

per standard of care.  
4.   Bone marrow aspirations by standard practice with measure of cellularity and 
percent of blasts , bone marrow at blood count recovery to document remission status. 
Reports for subsequent bone marrow evaluations throughout period of treatment.  See 
Appendix B for the study calendar.   
5.   Grade 3 and higher adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE, 
Version 4.0 
8. FOLLOW -UP 
1. Response data. All reports for bone marrow evaluations done as standard of care 
following this treatment,  including morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics/FISH and 
mutation studies, will be collected.   
2. Subsequent complete blood count, renal function, and liver function tests obtained 
for clinical reasons for a period of up to one month post the last consolidation 
chemotherapy cycle, as needed to define toxicity or duration of response.  
3. Reports on each patient’s course post stem cell transplant , if applicable,  will be 
reviewed to determine response and duration of remission.  
4. Disease free and overall survival data will be assessed by contacting the referring 
MD or the patient every three months for the first two years .  
9. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE  
Responses to treatment will be on the basis of 1) standard crite ria as well as 2) the degree of 
cytoreduction.  
9.1. Definition of Response  by standard criteria  
Response will be evaluated using European LeukemiaNet criteria, which are outlined in  
Appendix C. 
 9.2. Degree of Cytoreduction  
  The percent cellularity of  the bone marrows obtained within 2- 3 weeks of treatment and 
 the percent leukemia by morphology and flow cytometry will be monitored by the study 
 team, and compared to the pre- treatment levels.  
 9.3. Duration of Response 
 Time to progression will be noted for patients, regardless of whether they undergo stem 
 cell transplant.

Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria and who signed consent will be enrolled by the study 
coordinator. See Appendix  D for the registration form.  
11. FORMS TO BE KEPT  
Case report forms, diagnostic pathology reports, and laboratory test results will be kept in a 
secure location that protects confidential information or electronically with security access.  
Follow up information regarding survival and information about time of relapse and subsequent 
therapy will also be maintained.  
 
12. REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
 12.1. Adverse Event Monitoring and Reporting 
The principal investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who enroll 
in the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 
will be used for adverse event reporting.  Non -hematologic toxicities >grade 3 will be 
recorded  from assay -guided therapy administration through 14 days after last 
administration of study therapy and will be followed until resolution. 
 
12.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experien ce that occu rs at any dose 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life threatening adverse event.  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization * 
• Persistent of significant disability/incapacity.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Requires surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
*For the purposes of this study, hospitalizations or prolongation of 
hospitalizations  for protocol-scheduled procedures, blood product transfusions, or 
for social reasons (i.e. awaiting transport home) will not be considered a SAE; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalizations for fever and/or infection will 
be considered expected, and not be considered a SAE. 
12.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In accordance with FHCRC/UW Cancer C onsortium IRB policy, all adverse events (AEs; 
whether occurring on- site or off -site), which in the opinion of the principal investigator 
are (1) unexpected, and (2) related or possibly related to the research, and (3) serious or 
suggests that the research  places research participants or others at a greater risk of 
physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized, will be 
submitted to the IRB within 10 calendar days of learning of the problem. 
 
IRB Approved

9226 
18 of 41  AEs that do not meet the requirement for expedited reporting will be reported to the IRB 
as part of the annual renewal of the protocol. 
 
 
13. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Ongoing trial oversight is carried out by the principal investigator, Dr. Percival  and the primary 
research coordinator .  These individuals will meet regularly to review recently acquired data, and 
adverse events.  
Institutional support of trial monitoring  is provided in accordance with the Fred Hutch/University 
of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  Under the 
provisions of this plan, Fred Hutch Clinical Research Support (CRS) coordinates  data and 
compliance monitoring by consultants, contract research organizations, or CRS  employees 
unaffiliated with the conduct of the study. Independent monitoring visits occur at specified 
intervals determined by the assessed risk level of the study and the findings of previous visits.  In 
addition, protocols are reviewed at least annually by the Fred Hutch/ UW Cancer Consortium 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  and the Fred Hutch  Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The DSMC  reviews accrual, adverse events, stopping criteria,  and adherence to the data 
and safety monitoring plan. The Fred Hutch  IRB reviews the study progress and safety 
information to assess continued acceptability of the risk-benefit ratio for human subjects. 
Approval of both committees is necessary to continue the study.  
 
14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1. Experimental Design  
This is  a feasibility  study with the primary objective of combining drug treatments and 
initiating therapy based on the results of the drug screen for poor risk patients with any  
refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.  The sample size is determined by funding and 
time constraints, rather than testing of specific hypotheses.  Information from this study 
will enable us to determine effective combination s of drug treatments based on in vitro 
response and mutational analyses.  
Given the large expenditure of time and funds for each patient, we would like to see the 
primary objective achieved in at least 40 -50% of the patients. We will consider the study 
successful (feasibility demonstrated) if  we are able to choose and initiate a combination 
drug regimen within 21 days in 9 out of 15 patients. With that outcome, we could say 
with 90% confidence that the true feasibility rate is at least 40%.  Based on our previous 
study, where 14 of 15 patients were successfully tested and treated within 21 days, we 
believe that the true feasibility rate in this study c ould be 70% or more. In that case, we 
have an 87% chance of observing a 9 out of 15 success rate or better.  
Although efficacy is not a primary endpoint, the overall objective of individualized 
therapy is to increase the rate of CR, and ultimately survival.  However, the goal of this 
study is to establish feasibility, and subsequent trials will be needed to validate the 
approach and establish superiority over current standard of care.

19 of 41  Patients who sign consent can be screened for eligibility. Part of  the definition of 
eligibility is to be able to obtain ~10 million leukemia blasts for analysis (or per lab 
ability to assay). Patients for which enough cells are not obtained will be considered 
screen failures.   
Patients who receive assay results and do not receive drug due to other circumstances, 
such as inability  to return to center , patient/doctor decision to not be treated per study 
recommendation , or patient/doctor preference for palliative care, will be considered 
discontinuation.  Patients who discontinue for this rationale will be replaced in order to 
complete all objectives  of this study; we will continue to follow outcomes of patients who 
discontinue. 
14.2. Stopping Rules 
The study will be stopped if we fail to demonstrate feasibility. Operationally, this will be 
triggered if the 7th patient  fail s to receive treatment , indicating that the objective of 
treating 9 of 15 patients will not be met.

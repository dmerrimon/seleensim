If an investigator is seeing a patient with TSC in their clinic who is having 8 or more seizures per month, they will make a judgment regarding whether the benefits of clinical trial participation may outweigh the risks of clinical trial participation (with any alternative treatments taken into account). If the clinician feels that they do, then they will explain the study to the participant (or legally authorized representative [LAR]). If the participant/LAR is fully 
informed and provides consent, then this will be documented, and the 
screening activities can begin.

Site-Specific  
Global 
Rationale for the Amendment 
The rationale for the major changes in this protocol amendment are as follows: 
• The availability of new Phase 2 data raised the question of a cannabidiol (CBD) interaction. As a result, 
patients taking CBD will be monitored closely for adverse events (AEs), and specifically sedation-related AEs throughout the study. Patients were also stratified according to concomitant CBD use. 
• The allowance of an additional 2 weeks of titration after the 4 weeks titration period at the start of the maintenance period was removed as were specific dosing paradigms for participants taking Epidiolex > 10 mg/kg/day. This change will ensure that all patients will have the same target dose regardless of their background CBD therapy.  
Description of Changes  Section(s) Affected by Change  
Minor editorial updates throughout for grammar, consistency, and clarity. Throughout the document 
Protocol date and version added to the header. Protocol header 
Protocol short name ‘TrustTSC’ added to the protocol title.  Title page, sponsor signatory, Investigator agreement and Section 1.1 
The Investigational New Drug (IND) number was updated and the EudraCT number was added.   Title page 
Updated the key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Added: 
• Number (%) of participants considered treatment responders during the 
maintenance phase.  Section 1.1, Section 3, Section 9.3.3  
Updated the overall study design so that there was no longer an additional allowance for titration during the maintenance period and to remove specific dosing paradigms for patients taking Epidiolex > 10 mg/kg/day as this will ensure all patients have the same target dose regardless of background therapy.  
Removed: 
• With 2 additional weeks allowed, if necessary, for tolerance and use of 
concomitant cannabidiols (Epidiolex/Epidyolex) as follows.  
• For participants not taking concomitant Epidiolex or taking Epidiolex at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day or less, the target dose is:   
• 63 mg/kg/day for those weighing 28 kg or less, or  
• 1800 mg/day for those weighing more than 28 kg. 
• For participants taking concomitant Epidiolex at a dose greater than 10 mg/kg/day, the target dose is:  
• 42 mg/kg/day for those weighing 28 kg or less, or  
• 1200 mg/day for those weighing more than 28 kg.  
• The reduction of the GNX target dose for patients on cannabidiol > 10 mg/kg/day is based on Section 1.1, Section 1.2, Section 4.1, Section 4.3, Section 6.2, Section 8.1.2

63 mg/kg/day up to a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg for participants > 28 kg regardless of concomitant Epidiolex use. Also added dosing requirements for patients who continue in the OLE.  
Added: 
In Part B, for participants who continue to the OLE, the total daily dose that the 
participant was taking at the completion of Part A will be maintained. The titration 
schedule in Table 2 will be followed until the target total daily dose for the participant is reached. Section 6.2 
Updated the requirements for discontinuation of study intervention to remove mention of drug-induced rash. Section 7.1 
Removed the additional 2 weeks of dose titration, for tolerance, that was specified 
and in additional to the standard 4 weeks dose titration period.  Section 8.1.2 
Updated details for the physical/neurological/developmental examinations to 
specify this was applicable from ages 1 to 17 years instead of 2 to 17 years.  Section 8.3.1 
Updated to specify concomitant anti-epileptic drug (AED) levels will be obtained 
centrally and collected at Visit 17 for patients who continue in the OLE. 
Added:  
• Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the above 
concomitant AED levels collected at Visit 17 (Week 20) Section 8.3.6 
Updated the drug screen section to state that this could be performed at any time 
during the study at the investigator’s discretion and that concomitant use of THC 
and non-approved CBD was not permitted. 
Added:  The plasma drug screen can be performed at any time during the study per the 
investigator’s discretion. Concomitant use of THC and non-approved CBD is not permitted on study and will result in participant withdrawal from the study. Section 8.3.7 
Updated the multiplicity adjustment to specify that statistical hypothesis testing will be performed on 4 rather than the previously stated 3 key secondary endpoints as an additional endpoint has been added as part of this amendment.  Section 9.1.1 
Updated the specified analysis sets to include the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) and amended the ITT set so that it no longer required patients to have received at least 1 dose of the IP. The exclusion of subjects from the efficacy analyses who failed to reach at least 50% of their respective target dose was also removed. 
Added:  Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) set - All randomized participants who receive at 
least 1 dose of the IP. Participants will be summarized within the treatment group to which they were randomized. This population will be used for sensitivity analysis for efficacy. Section 9.2 
Updated the sensitivity analyses planned for the primary efficacy endpoint to 
include 3 rather than 2 analyses. 
Added: 
• To examine the primary outcome measure by using mITT population. Section 9.3.2.1

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 175 Updated secondary endpoint analysis to add an additional analysis for treatment 
responders during the maintenance period. 
Added: 
• Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥ 50% 
reduction from baseline in primary endpoint seizure frequency during given 
period. Section 9.3.3 
Revised male contraception requirements to state these should be continued for 30 days after the last dose of IP. Section 10.5.2 
Updated the dosing instruction for oral suspension in Appendix 8 to remove the example dose titration and maintenance tables and to add instructions for Part A (double-bind dose titrate, maintenance and taper) and Part B (double-blind crossover to open-label extension period). The patient instructions were also updated to match the package insert. Section 10.8 
Revised the title for Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) in Appendix 10 to specify that this was to be used for Clinicians as well as for Caregivers. Section 10.10

1.1 Synopsis 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo- controlled Trial of Adjunctive Ganaxolone 
(GNX) Treatment in Children and Adults with  Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-related 
Epilepsy (TrustTSC).  
Brief Title:  
Adjunctive GNX Treatment Compared with Placebo in Children and Adults with TSC-related Epilepsy.  
Indication: TSC-related epilepsy. 
Rationale:  
TSC is a multi-system disorder of embryonal cort ical development that can affect many organs 
through the overgrowth of benign tumors known as hamartomas. While the disease phenotype 
can be extremely variable, neurologic manifestatio ns such as epilepsy can be seen in up to 90% 
of patients with TSC ( Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). The condition is caused by inherited 
mutations in either the TSC1  (hamartin) gene, located on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2  
(tuberin) gene located on chromosome 16p13.3. TS C occurs with a frequency of 1:6,000 and a 
mutation is found in 85% of patients ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). The gene products TSC1 and 
TSC2 form a regulatory complex responsible for limiting the activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), an important intracellular regulator of growth and metabolism 
via its inhibition of the small GTPase Rheb (Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). Everolimus 
(Afinitor
®), amTORC1 inhibitor, has been shown to decrease seizures ( Mizuguchi et al, 2019 ; 
French et al, 2016 ). More recently, cannabidiol (CBD; Epidiolex®) demonstrated seizure 
reduction efficacy in a randomized controlled trial ( Thiele et al, 2021 ).  
TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of epilepsy, with seizure type and characteristics 
that vary by age ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). Infantile spasm (IS) is the most common seizure type 
presenting in infancy and represents the first ma nifestation of epilepsy in 50% of patients. In 
older children and adults, focal impaired awareness seizures (previously classified as complex 
partial seizures) are the most common ( Chu-Shore et al., 2010 ); other focal and generalized 
seizures may also occur. Over 30% of pa tients develop treatment-refractory epilepsy 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014). While seizures have typically been ascribed to cortical or subcortical 
tubers and subependymal nodules, epilepsy in TSC can  be considered multifactorial in origin as 
seizures can originate in other brain areas or can occur in TSC patients without tubers 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to play  a central role in the development of 
TSC-related epilepsy, possibly due to  altered expression of endogenous GABA A receptor 
modulators ( Di Michele et al, 2003 ). The 3α5-reduced-tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) metabolites 
of progesterone, including 3 α, 5α-THP (allopregnanolone), are positive allosteric modulators of 
the GABA A receptor. In contrast, 3 β5-THP acts as functional antagonists of the GABA A receptor

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 175 by reducing the ability of 3 α5-THP to exert a potentiating effect on the GABA A receptor. 
Di Michele et al, 2003  have demonstrated decreases  in allopregnanolone and 3 α, 5β-THP relative 
to 3β5-THP enantiomers in patients with TSC-related epilepsy but not in patients with TSC 
without epilepsy or in controls. This change in the ratio of 3 α5- and 3β 5-THP enantiomers could 
alter neuronal excitability mediated by GABA A receptors and predispose to the development of 
epilepsy in TSC. The role of GABA A receptor mediation is also supported by the greater efficacy 
of vigabatrin, a specific and irreversible i nhibitor of GABA-aminotransferase leading to 
increased synaptic GABA levels, in seizures due to TSC relative to other epilepsies (Curatolo et al, 2001 ). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential role of 
neuroactive steroids in the trea tment of TSC-related epilepsy.  
GNX is the 3 β-methylated synthetic analog of allo pregnanolone, an e ndogenous allosteric 
modulator of central nervous system (CNS) GABA
A receptors. GNX has potency and efficacy 
comparable to allopregnanolone in activ ating synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors at a 
site distinct from benzodiazepines and barbiturates ( Carter et al, 1997 ). GNX has protective 
activity in diverse rodent seizure models ( Reddy and Rogwski, 2012 ; Bialer et al, 2010 ). Clinical 
studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of  900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling et al, 2017 ; Laxer et al, 2000 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; Pieribone et al, 2007 ). Further, 
GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractory pediatric epilepsy. In an open-label 
study (OL), pediatric participants aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan et al, 2000 ). There 
were 15 participants with a history of IS who co mpleted treatment; 5 of the 15 participants had a 
decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25% to 50%, and 
5 had a decrease of < 25%. There was 1 participant who became spasm-free and 1 non responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from Weeks 2 to 7.  
In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, GNX ha s been shown to reduce anxiety, hyperactivity, 
and attention in children with fragile X syndrome ( Ligsay et al, 2016 ). Similar behavior 
problems occur in individuals with TSC, with  rates of approximately 50% for attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autistic spectrum disorder ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
In TSC-related epilepsy, Study 1042-TSC-2001 was a Phase 2, single arm study with GNX. The 
primary objective was to assess the preliminar y safety and efficacy of GNX as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of seizures in participants aged 2 to 65 years with genetically or clinically confirmed TSC-related epilepsy. The study consisted of a 4-week baseline followed by 
a treatment phase, consisting of a 4-week titration and 8-week maintenance period. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the percent reduction in countable, TSC-associated seizures from the 
baseline through the end of the Period A treatme nt phase. Review of data for the primary 
endpoint showed a median 16.6% reduction in  28-day primary endpoint  seizure frequency 
relative to the 4-week baseline period, with 30. 4% of patients achieving a 50% or more seizure 
reduction. The clinical study report (CSR) for this study was completed on 08 Mar 2023. 
It is hypothesized that the augmentation of GABA
A-receptor mediated signaling with GNX 
treatment will reduce seizures in patients with  TSC. Changes in neurobehavioral symptoms, 
mood, sleep and quality of life will also be assessed.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 175 Overall Design:  
This is a Phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in children and adults with TSC-rela ted epilepsy. The study consists of a 4-week 
prospective baseline phase, defined as the firs t 28 days following screening, followed by a 
double-blind phase consisting of a 4-week titratio n period and a 12-week maintenance period.  
Participants eligible for inclusion in this doubl e-blind study must have inadequately controlled 
seizures after exposure to at least 2 anti-seiz ure medication (ASMs) administered at adequate 
doses and for adequate durations, with approximately 8 seizures per month in the 2 months prior 
to screening and seizure-free periods of not more than 1 week.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent from the participant or their parent(s)/ legally 
authorized representative (s) (LARs), as appr opriate, has been appropriately obtained.  
An interactive response technology system will be used to randomize participants, dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blin d throughout the duration of the study.  
Participants or their parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are expected to complete electronic seizure 
diary (eDiary) entries to document the number an d type(s) of seizures daily throughout the study. 
A variety of clinician and caregiver administered instruments will be used to assess efficacy, and 
will include:  
• Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S). 
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) by parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and clinician. 
• Caregiver Global Impression of Change in  Seizure Intensity/D uration (CGI-CSID). 
• Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS). 
• Pediatric Quality of Life – Family Impact Module (Peds-QL-FIM). 
• Short Form 36 (SF-36). 
• Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life (ELDQOL). 
The titration schedule is as follows: 
• Start – Day 1. 
• Titration 1 – Day 7. 
• Titration 2 – Day 14. 
• Titration 3 – Day 21. 
• Final titration – Day 28. 
• Maintenance begins on Day 29 (Start of Week 5). 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension)  will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose based on  the participant’s starting weight 63 mg/kg/day 
with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for patients more than 28 kg).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 175 The Phase 2 data for GNX in TSC raised the question of a CBD interaction. In the trial of 
23 treated patients, approximately  half were on cannabidiol, and there was an association 
between higher CBD doses and increased somnolence. Given the small sample size, more definitive conclusions were not possible. As a result, patients taking CBD should be monitored 
closely for any sedation-related adverse even ts (AEs) throughout this Phase 3 protocol. 
Participants may have the dose of investiga tional product (IP) temporarily or permanently 
decreased at any point in the maintenance period to manage tolerability.  
Any dose adjustments that are not part of the pr especified titration schedule should be discussed 
with the sponsor medical monitor prior to making the change. If it is not possible to contact the 
medical monitor prior to the dose adjustment, the medical monitor should be notified as soon as 
possible after making the change.  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  Participants who discontinue the IP should underg o a 2-week taper period. The taper period may 
be shortened at the discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated. Participants who 
discontinue the IP before the scheduled completi on of the study will return to the site 2 weeks 
after the end of taper to complete the safety follow-up assessments.  
Following completion of the double-blind phase, participants who are compliant with study 
conduct will have the option to enroll and be treated with GNX in a separate open-label 
extension study (OLE), 1042-TSC-3002. All particip ants entering the OLE will have their dose 
of study medication adjusted in a double-blind cross-titration over 4 weeks such that all are 
receiving GNX at study completion. Participants who do not continue in the OLE will undergo a 
2- to 4-weeks double-blind down-titration and taper if discontinuing IP (See Figure 1). 
Disclosure Statement:  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm treatment study that is participant, 
caregiver, and investigator blinded.  
Number of Participants:  
Approximately 200 participants with TSC will be screened with the aim of randomizing 
approximately 128 participants (64 per arm), aged 1 to 65 years (inclusive). For Europe (EU), 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Oceania (OC) Male or Female participants aged 
2 through 65 years, inclusive. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either GNX or placebo as adjunctive therapy with their standard ASMs.  
Note: Enrolled means the participant, or their LAR(s), has agreed to participate in the study 
following completion of the informed consent process and screening. Potential participants who 
are screened for the purpose of determining elig ibility for the study, but who subsequently are 
not eligible for study entry, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the 
protocol.

include intrauterine devices (that have been in place for at least 1 month prior to the 
screening visit), hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal 
ring, injectables, and implants), and surgi cal sterilization (such as oophorectomy or tubal 
ligation). When used consistently and correc tly, “double-barrier” methods of contraception 
can be used as an effective alternative to highly effective contraception methods. 
Contraceptive measures such as Plan BTM, sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are 
not acceptable methods for routine use.

Note: The Epilepsy Study Consortium will review and classify all seizure types reported by the 
investigator, incorporating the medical history, seizure desc ription, and historical 
records (including electroencephalogram [EEG], when available). This review and classification does not need to be completed prior to study entr y but should be complete d in parallel, and may 
complete after the participant has been enrolled in the study. 
Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria apply:  
1. Previous exposure to GNX. 
2. Pregnant or breastfeeding. 
3. Participants who have been taking felbamate for less than 1 year prior to screening. 
4. Participants taking CBD preparations other than Epidiolex
®. 
5. A positive result on drug screen for CBD or  tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at Visit 1 
(screening), with the exception of results that are fully explained by prescribed Epidiolex®,

6. Concurrent use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prednisone or other glucocorticoid 
is not permitted, nor use of the strong inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), rifampin 
and St. John’s Wort.  
Participants on ACTH, prednisone, or other systemically (non-inhaled or topical) 
administered steroids should be off the product > 28 days prior to screening.  
Rifampin and St. John’s Wort must be discontinued at least 28 days before Visit 2, study 
drug initiation.  
Note:  
a. Use of concomitant intranasal or pro re nata (PRN) topical steroids for dermatologic 
reactions and allergic rhinitis are allowed during the study.  
b. This exclusion criterion does not prohibit the use of approved ASMs. 
7. Changes in any chronic medications within the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. All 
chronic concomitant medications must be relatively stable in dose for at least 4 weeks prior 
to the screening visit unless otherwise noted. Small dose adjustment to manage tolerability and safety events is permitted and should be discussed with the study medical monitor. 
8. Participants who have epilepsy surgery pla nned during the study or who have undergone 
surgery for epilepsy within the 6 months prior to screening. 
9. An active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease, or CNS 
disease deemed progressive as evaluated by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This 
includes tumor growth which in the opinion of the investigator could affect primary endpoint

the participant at increased risk or interfere with the assessment of safety/efficacy. This may 
include any illness in the past 4 weeks which in the opinion of the investigator may affect 
seizure frequency. 
11. Hepatic impairment sufficient to affect patient safety, or an aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) > 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening or baseline visits and confirmed by a repeat test.  
12. Biliary impairment sufficient to affect patient safety, or total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN at screening or baseline visit and confirmed by a repeat test. In cases of Gilbert’s Syndrome, 
resulting in stable levels of total bilirubin greater than ULN, the medical monitor can 
determine if a protocol exception can be made.  
13. Renal impairment sufficient to affect patient safety, or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) < 30 mL/min (calculated using the Cock croft-Gault formula or pediatric glomerular 
filtration rate [GFR] calculator or Bedside Sc hwartz), will be excluded from study entry or 
will be discontinued if the criterion is met post baseline ( Levey et al, 2006 ). Cases of 
temporary renal insufficiency should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine the 
participant’s study continuation. 
14. Exposed to any other investigational drug or i nvestigational device with in 30 days or fewer 
than 5 half-lives prior to the screening visit. For therapies in which half-life cannot be readily

19. Participants receiving traditional Chinese medicine therapies within the prior 28 days of the 
screening. 
Intervention Groups and Duration:  
Eligible participants will collect 4 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data prior to starting treatment. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment with GNX or placebo. 
Stratification of randomization will be perf ormed based on whether the patient is taking 
concomitant CBD or not. GNX is to be titrated to the target dose over 4 weeks. The total double-
blind phase (titration and ma intenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Participants who complete the study may be eligible to participate in the OLE. However, 
participants who discontinue IP should undergo a 2- week or shorter taper period, as clinically 
indicated, and complete the safety follow- up assessments 2 weeks after the final dose.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of 175 2 INTRODUCTION 
Ganaxolone (GNX) is a small molecule being deve loped for use as an ASM in rare pediatric 
seizure disorders including cyclin-dependent kina se-like 5 deficiency disorder (CDD), tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC)-related epilepsy, and status epilepticus (SE).  
GNX has also been investigated in adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraine, 
postpartum depression (PPD), and children with protocadherin (PCDH)-related epilepsy, and 
fragile X syndrome (FXS). 
2.1 Study Rationale 
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to play  a central role in the development of 
TSC-related epilepsy, possibly due to  altered expression of endogenous GABA A receptor 
modulators ( Di Michele et al, 2003 ). The 3α5-reduced-tetrahydroprogesterone  (THP) metabolites 
of progesterone, including 3 α, 5α-THP (allopregnanolone), are positive allosteric modulators of 
the GABA A receptor. In contrast, 3 β5-THP acts as functional antagonists of the GABA A receptor 
by reducing the ability of 3 α5-THP to exert a potentiating effect on the GABA A receptor. 
Di Michele et al (2003) have demonstrated decreases  in allopregnanolone and 3 α, 5β-THP 
relative to 3 β5-THP enantiomers in patients with TSC-related epilepsy but not in patients with 
TSC without epilepsy, or in controls. This change in the ratio of 3 α5- and 3β5-THP enantiomers 
could alter neuronal excitability mediated by GABA A receptors and predispose to the 
development of epilepsy in TSC. The role of GABA A receptor mediation is also supported by the 
greater efficacy of vigabatrin, a specific and irreversible inhibitor of GABA-aminotransferase 
leading to increased synaptic GABA levels, in seizures due to TSC relative to other epilepsies 
(Curatolo et al, 2001 ). These findings provide compelling evidence for the potential role of 
neuroactive steroids in the trea tment of TSC-related epilepsy.  
It is hypothesized that the augmentation of GABA A-receptor mediated signaling with GNX 
treatment will reduce seizures in patients with  TSC. Changes in neurobehavioral symptoms, 
mood, sleep, and quality of life will also be assessed. 
2.2 Background 
2.2.1 Disease Background  
TSC is a multi-system disorder of embryonal cort ical development which can affect many organs 
through the overgrowth of benign tumors known as hamartomas. While the disease phenotype 
can be extremely variable, neurologic manifestatio ns such as epilepsy can be seen in up to 90% 
of TSC patients ( Krueger and Northrup, 2013 ). The condition is caused by inherited mutations in 
either the TSC1  (hamartin) gene, located on chromosome 9q34, or the TSC2  (tuberin) gene 
located on chromosome 16p13.3. TSC occurs with a frequency of 1:6,000 and a mutation is found in 85% of patients ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). The gene products TSC1 and TSC2 form a 
regulatory complex responsible for limiting the act ivity of mTORC1, an important intracellular 
regulator of growth and metabolism via its inhi bition of the small GTPase Ras homolog enriched

CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 175 in brain (Krueger and Northrup, 2013). Everolimus (Afinitor®), a mechanistic target of 
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, has been shown to decrease seizures (Mizuguchi et al, 2019 ; French et al, 2016 ). More recently, CBD (Epidiolex
®) demonstrated 
seizure reduction efficacy in a randomized controlled trial ( Thiele et al, 2021 ).  
TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of epilepsy, with seizure type and characteristics 
that vary by age ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014). Infantile spasm (IS) is the most common seizure type 
presenting in infancy and represents the first ma nifestation of epilepsy in 50% of patients. In 
older children and adults, focal impaired awareness seizures (previously classified as complex 
partial seizures) are the most common ( Chu-Shore, 2010 ); other focal and generalized seizures 
may also occur. Over 30% of patients develop treatment-refractory epilepsy (Jülich and Sahin, 2014). While seizures have typically been ascribed to cortical or subcortical 
tubers and subependymal nodules, epilepsy in TSC can  be considered multifactorial in origin as 
seizures can originate in other brain areas or can occur in TSC participants without tubers 
(Jülich and Sahin, 2014).  
2.2.2 Investigational Product Background:  Ganaxolone 
Ganaxolone (GNX) (3 α-hydroxy-3β -methyl-5 α-pregnan-20-one) is a small molecule under 
investigation for use as an ASM in rare pediat ric seizure disorders and SE. GNX is a Schedule V 
Controlled Substance in the United States (US). The 50 mg/mL GNX oral suspension is approved in the US for the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 
(CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. GNX is the 3β-methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanol one, an endogenous allosteric modulator of 
central nervous system (CNS) GABA
A receptors. GNX has potency and efficacy comparable to 
allopregnanolone in ac tivating synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA A receptors at a site distinct 
from benzodiazepines and barbiturates ( Carter et al, 1997 ). GNX has protective activity in 
diverse rodent seizure models ( Reddy and Rogwski, 2012 ; Bialer et al, 2010 ). Clinical studies 
have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant  activity with an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile in the dose range of  900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling et al, 2017 ; Pieribone et al, 2007 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; Laxer et al, 2000 ). Further, 
GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractory pediatric epilepsy. In an open-label 
(OL) study, pediatric participants aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan et al, 2000 ). A 
total of 15 participants with a history of IS co mpleted treatment; 5 of the 15 participants had a 
decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25% to 50%, and 
5 had a decrease of < 25%. There was 1 participant who became spasm-free and 1 non responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from Weeks 2 to 7.  
In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, GNX ha s been shown to reduce anxiety, hyperactivity, 
and attention in children with FXS (Ligsay et al, 2016 ). Similar behavior problems occur in 
individuals with TSC, with rates of approximately 50% for attentio n deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and autistic spectrum disorder ( Jülich and Sahin, 2014).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 175 2.2.2.1 Ganaxolone Clinical Development Program 
In the US, GNX, under the brand name ZTALMY®, is indicated for the treatment of seizures 
associated with CDKL5 deficiency  disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. GNX is 
a Schedule V controlled substance. 
GNX is being further evaluated for use as an ASM in adolescents and adults with SE and 
pediatric and adult patients with seizures associated with TSC. 
The completed GNX clinical program comprises Phase 1 studies conducted in healthy 
participants, adults with migraine, and adults with renal impairment. Phase 2/3 studies were 
conducted in adults with epilepsy, infants and children with seizure disorders, children with FXS, 
adults with PTSD, women with PPD, adults with migraine, adolescents, and adults with SE, and 
pediatric and adult participants with seizures associated with TSC. In these studies, the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokine tics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GNX were evaluated 
with an oral dosing duration ranging from 1 day up to more than 5 years, using doses from 50 to 3200 mg/day. Additionally, intravenous (IV) bolus doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg over 
durations of 2 to 5 minutes, continuous infusion of 10 to 30 mg/hour for 1 hour, or a bolus dose 
of 6 mg over 5 minutes followed with a continuous infusion of 20 mg per hour for 4 hours were 
evaluated in healthy participants. In participants with SE, IV infusions of up to 713 mg/day have been evaluated.  
As of 10 Oct 2022, an estimated 2172 participants  have received at least 1 dose of GNX across 
the completed studies. This includes 511 particip ants in Phase 1 and 1661 participants in 
Phase 2/3 studies. Participants who received GNX ranged in age from 4 months to 88 years.  Formulations used to date in the clinical development program are summarized and listed by 
study in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  2.2.2.1.1  TSC-related Epilepsy 
In TSC-related epilepsy, Study 1042-TSC-2001  is a Phase 2, single arm study with GNX. The 
primary objective was to assess the preliminar y safety and efficacy of GNX as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of seizures in participants aged 2 to 65 years with genetically or clinically confirmed TSC- related epilepsy. The core phase of the study (Part A) consisted of a 
4-week baseline followed by a treatment phase, consisting of a 4-week titration and 8-week 
maintenance period. The primary efficacy endpoi nt was the percent reduction in countable, 
TSC-associated seizures from the baseline through  the end of Period A treatment phase. Review 
of data for the primary endpoint showed a me dian 16.6% reduction in 28-day primary endpoint 
seizure frequency relative to the 4-week baseline period, with 30.4% of patients achieving a 50% 
or more seizure reduction. The CSR for the study was completed on 08 Mar 2023. 
Additional information detailing ongoing and comp leted clinical GNX studies may be found in 
the current IB.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 175 2.2.2.2 Clinical Safety Overview 
In all completed placebo-controlled studies, 63. 5% (742/1168) of participants who received 
GNX and 51.9% (443/853) of participants who received placebo experienced at least 
1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). In these studies, the most frequently reported (ie, in 
> 5% of participants) TEAEs in GNX-treated participants were: somnolence (23.8% GNX, 7.7% 
placebo), dizziness (12.2% GNX, 3.5% placebo), fatigue (11.2% GNX, 4.8% placebo), and 
headache (6.3% GNX, 6.9% placebo). All thes e events, except headache, occurred more 
frequently in GNX-treated participants than placebo participants. CNS-related events appeared to be dose related, with the majority of these events occurring at doses ≥ 500 mg and were non-
serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. These 
TEAEs were also anticipated based on the mechanism of action of GNX.  
In all completed placebo-controlled studies, the in cidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 
balanced between the GNX-treated participan ts (33/1168 participants, 2.8%) and placebo 
participants (26/853 participants, 3.0%), respectiv ely. In these studies, the only SAEs reported in 
more than 1 participant in the GNX treatme nt group were seizure and sedation.  
In all completed studies, including OL, long-term follow-up studies, 5.4% 
(118/2172 participants) of participants who received GNX experienced at least 1 SAE. With 
long-term exposure, no new safety findings were id entified through the review of SAEs in these 
studies. The most frequently reported SAEs (ie, in > 2 participants) were seizure, SE, IS, epilepsy, pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, pyrexia, seizure cluster, , dehydration, 
gastro-esophageal reflux disease, rash, somnolence,  and upper respiratory tract infection. In all 
studies, most of the SAEs were considered unrelated to treatment according to the investigator, 
and most resolved.  
The Phase 2 study (protocol 1042-TSC-2001) showed a consistent safety profile in a pure TSC 
population. Of the 24 patients screened, 4 discon tinued the study due to adverse events (AEs). 
Somnolence, sedation, and fatigue were the most common treatment emergent AEs.  
Additional information describing the safety of GNX may be found in the current IB.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Based on clinical and non-clinical data from st udies with GNX, the overall benefit/risk profile 
favors clinical development of GNX for th e treatment of TSC-related epilepsy.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of GNX may be found in the IB.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 175 2.3.1 Risk Assessment 
CNS-related effects (such as somnolence and sedation) have been identified as an important risk related to the mechanism of action of GNX. In placebo-controlled studies the most common 
CNS effects were somnolence, dizziness, sedation,  and gait disturbance. Of the AEs present at 
frequency > 1% and 2 times the frequency of placebo in the aggregate AE data, 12/13 AEs are related to CNS function. The most common CNS-related AEs that led to discontinuation reported 
in placebo-controlled studies were dizziness (GNX 1.1%; placebo 0.4%); somnolence (GNX 
0.9%; placebo 0.4%); and fatigue (GNX 0.8%; placebo 0.1%). These CNS effects were typically 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and di d not lead to discontinuation of treatment.  
Unblinded safety data will be reviewed on an  ongoing basis by an inde pendent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) who will monitor safety and safeguard the interests of study participants.  
The dose titration phase included in this study will minimize risk to participants from 
CNS-related effects as well as other treatment-related AEs.  
The safety assessments to be performed in this study including clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), phys ical and neurological examinations, AE 
assessments, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and Tanner staging. These are 
all standard evaluations to ensure partic ipant safety in this clinical study.  
2.3.2 Benefit Assessment 
This study will evaluate the efficacy of GNX compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy for 
seizures associated with TSC in children an d adults. This population may benefit from the 
development of GNX as participants randomized to GNX will receive treatment that may help 
with control of their epilepsy. These participants as well as participants randomized to placebo 
have the option to continue GNX treatment in the Open-label extension (OLE) study for up to an 
additional 3 years.  
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion 
Taking into account the measures to minimize risk to study participants, the potential risks 
associated with GNX are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be af forded to participants 
with TSC-related epilepsy.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 175 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design 
This is a Phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive GNX treatment in children and adults with TSC-rela ted epilepsy. The study consists of a 4-week 
prospective baseline phase, defined as the firs t 28 days following screening, followed by a 
double-blind phase consisting of a 4-week titratio n period and a 12-week maintenance period.  
Participants eligible for inclusion in this doubl e-blind study must have inadequately controlled 
seizures after exposure to at least 2 ASMs admin istered at adequate dos es and for adequate 
durations, with approximately 8 seizures per month in the 2 months prior to screening and 
seizure-free periods of not more than 1 week.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent from the participant or their parent(s)/LAR(s), as appropriate, has been appropriately obtained.  
An interactive response technology system will be used to randomize participants, dispense drug, 
track treatment, and maintain the blin d throughout the duration of the study.  
Participants or their parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are expected to complete electronic seizure 
diary (eDiary) entries to document the number an d type(s) of seizures daily throughout the study. 
A variety of clinician and caregiver administered instruments will be used to assess efficacy, and 
will include:  
• Clinical Global Impression — Severity (CGI-S). 
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) by parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and clinician. 
• Caregiver Global Impression of Change in  Seizure Intensity/D uration (CGI-CSID). 
• Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS). 
• Pediatric Quality of Life – Family Impact Module (Peds-QL-FIM). 
• Short Form 36  (SF-36). 
• Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life (ELDQOL). 
The titration schedule is as follows: 
• Start – Day 1. 
• Titration 1 – Day 7. 
• Titration 2 – Day 14. 
• Titration 3 – Day 21. 
• Final titration – Day 28. 
• Maintenance begins on Day 29 (Start of Week 5).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 of 175 GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension) will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose ba sed on the participant’s starting weight 
63 mg/kg/day with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for patients > 28 kg). 
The participant may have the dose of Investig ational Product (IP) temporarily or permanently 
decreased at any point in the maintenance period to manage tolerability. Additional dosing 
information can be found in Section 6.2 .  
Any dose adjustments that are not part of the prespecified titration schedule, including alternative 
dosing paradigms, should be discussed with the sponsor medical monitor prior to making the 
change. If it is not possible to contact the medical monitor prior to the dose adjustment, the medical monitor should be notified as s oon as possible after making the change.  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Participants who discontinue the IP should underg o a 2-week taper period. The taper period may 
be shortened at the discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated. Participants who 
discontinue the IP before the scheduled completi on of the study will return to the site 2 weeks 
after the end of taper to complete the safety follow-up assessments.  
Following completion of the double-blind phase, participants who are compliant with study 
conduct will have the option to enroll and be treated with GNX in a separate open-label 
extension study (OLE), 1042-TSC-3002. All particip ants entering the OLE will have their dose 
of study medication adjusted in a double-blind cross-titration over 4 weeks such that all are 
receiving GNX at study completion. Participants who do not continue in the OLE will undergo a 2- to 4-weeks double-blind down-titration and taper if discontinuing IP (See Figure 1).  
4.1.1 Study Duration for Participation  
Eligible participants will collect 4 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data prior to starting treatment. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment with GNX or placebo. 
GNX is to be titrated to target dose over 4 w eeks. The total double-blind phase (titration and 
maintenance period) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Following completion of the treatment period, pa rticipants who are compliant with study conduct 
will have the option to enroll and be treated with GNX in a separate OLE study, 1042-TSC-3002. 
All participants entering the OLE will have their dose of study medication adjusted in a 
double-blind cross-titration over 4 weeks such th at all are receiving GNX at study completion. 
Participants who do not continue in the O LE will undergo a 2- to 4-week double-blind 
down-titration and taper if discontinuing IP.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 175 4.1.2 Number of Participants  
Approximately 200 participants with TSC will be screened with the aim of randomizing 
approximately 128 participants (64 per arm), aged 1 to 65 years (2 – 65 for EU, MENA, and OC) 
(inclusive). Participants will be randomized (1:1 ) to either GNX or placebo as adjunctive therapy 
with their standard anti-seizure medication (ASMs).  
Note: Enrolled means the participant, or their LAR(s), has agreed to participate in the study 
following completion of the informed consent process and screening. Potential participants who 
are screened for the purpose of determining elig ibility for the study, but who subsequently are 
not eligible for study entry, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the 
protocol.  
4.1.3 Number of Sites 
This global, multicenter study w ill be conducted at a pproximately 80-85 sites (US and ex-US).  
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in children and adults with TSC-related epilepsy. Children and adults with TSC-related 
epilepsy are included in the study as this is one of the populations being pursued for 
development. The eligibility criteria allow for the selection of participants comparable to the patients seen in clinical practice.  
Randomization will be used in this study to avoi d bias in the assignment of participants to 
treatment, to prevent introducing bias into the st udy evaluations and statistical analyses, and to 
ensure participant characteristics are balanced between the GNX and placebo arms. In order to 
facilitate subgroup analysis, randomization will be stratified with respect to whether the 
participant is taking concomitant CBD or not.  
All the efficacy and safety assessments included in this study are standard measures used in 
clinical studies in general and epilepsy trials in particular.  
4.3 Justification for Dose 
A minimum GNX dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required for assessment of 
efficacy during the study. Clinical studies ha ve demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant 
activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 mg in 
adults and children ( Sperling et al, 2017 ; Pieribone et al, 2007 ; Kerrigan et al, 2000 ; 
Laxer et al, 2000 ).  
Dosing will be based on doses that have been shown to be safe in children and adults in multiple studies with healthy volunteers and individuals with epilepsy.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 of 175 GNX is to be given as an oral suspension (50 mg/mL) with food, eg, shortly after a meal or snack.  
This study plans to enroll participants as young as 1 year of age. Based on the known clearance 
pathway of GNX (which is primarily CYP3A4/5) and CYP3A4 maturation by the age of 
1 month, the dosing strategy for pediatric participants 1 to 2 years was guided by a recently 
completed population PK analysis which incorporat ed allometric principles. The similarity of 
model maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and the area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve  (AUC) with the proposed dosing regimen across a range of doses administered in previous 
clinical trials in participants 2 years of age and older coupled with the known maturation of CYP3A4 indicates that a similar exposure will be achieved in participants 1 to 2 years of age 
with the proposed dosing regimen. 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension) will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose ba sed on the participant’s starting weight 
63 mg/kg/day with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for patients > 28 kg). 
In the Phase 2 data for GNX in TSC there was the suggestion of a possible interaction with CBD. 
In the trial of 23 treated patients, approximate ly half were on cannabidiol, and there was an 
association between higher CBD doses and increas ed somnolence. Given the small sample size, 
more definitive conclusions were not possible. As a result, patients taking concomitant CBD 
(Epidiolex
®) must be monitored closely throughout this Phase 3 protocol and discussed with the 
medical monitor if AEs are seen (particularly those that are somnolence-related).  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  
Additional dosing information can be found in Section 6.2 .

CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 of 175 includes tumor growth which in the opinion of the investigator could affect primary endpoint 
seizure control.  
10. Any disease or condition (medical or surgical; other than TSC) at the screening visit that might compromise the hematologic, cardiova scular (including any cardiac conduction 
defect), pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or hepatic systems; or other conditions that might 
interfere with the absorption, distribution, meta bolism, or excretion of the IP, or would place 
the participant at increased risk or interfere with the assessment of safety/efficacy. This may include any illness in the past 4 weeks which in the opinion of the investigator may affect seizure frequency.

18. Participants deprived of their liberty by a judicial or administrative decision, or for 
psychiatric treatment, or participants admitted to a health or social services facility for 
purposes other than research. 
19. Participants receiving traditional Chinese medicine therapies within the prior 28 days of the 
screening. 
5.3 Lifestyle Considerations 
5.3.1 Meals and Dietary Restrictions 
Participants are requested to take the IP tid with food , eg, shortly after a meal or snack.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 175 In addition, participants should refrain from grapefruit or grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, starfruits¸ or excessive consumption of alcohol during the study. 
During each visit when PK samples are collected , participants will abstain from ingesting 
caffeine- or xanthine-containing products (eg, co ffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for 
approximately 24 hours before dosing until after collection of the PK sample such that these 
items are ingested the morning before the study visit and not consumed again until after the PK 
samples are collected. 
5.3.2 Contraception Use and Donation of Sperm and Ova  
WOCBP must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control and have a negative 
quantitative serum β-HCG test collected at the initial screening and baseline visits.  
Pregnancy testing will be performed at all in-person visits for all WOCBP to monitor participant safety throughout the duration of participation in the trial.  
WOCBP and male participants must be advised to use a medically acceptable, highly effective 
method of birth control throughout the study period and for 30 days after the last dose of IP.  
Participants should not donate sperm or ova during the study and for 30 days after the last dose.  
See Appendix 10.5  for further details on what cons titutes a medically acceptable, highly 
effective method of birth control. 
5.4 Screen Failures 
A screen failure occurs when a participant for whom informed consent/assent has been obtained is not randomized into the study and does not receive IP, regardless of reason. 
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from re gulatory authorities. Minimal information 
includes date of informed consent/assent, screen failure date and details, demography, eligibility 
criteria, and any SAE. 
Participant rescreening is allowed as agreed by th e sponsor and the investigator unless there is a 
general concern for participant safety or an inab ility for the participant to become eligible (eg, 
GNX allergy, sensitivity, or exposure, non-TSC an d/or other ineligible epilepsy, chronic 
prohibited medical condition, or treatment). Resc reened participants should be assigned a new 
participant number for every screening/rescr eening event. The medical monitor should be 
contacted for subsequent rescreening.

IMP and 
NIMP/AxMP GNX Matched placebo  
Sourcing Provided centrally by the sponsor 
Packaging and 
Labeling GNX is a Schedule V Controlled Substance in the US. The GNX (50 mg/mL) and placebo oral suspensions will be provided in HDPE bottles 
with a child-resistant closure. For GNX, each bo ttle contains 110 mL of GNX suspension, and these 
bottles should be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]; excursions permitted from 15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]). This suspension is stable for at least 18 months at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]; excursions permitted from 15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]). After 
opening, suspension should be used within 30 days.
 A placebo suspension, 
identical in taste and a ppearance with GNX suspension, will be supplied at 
an equal volume. Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging prior to dosing may not occur 
without full agreement in advance by the sponsor. Labels containing study information and bottle identification are applied to the IP container. 
All IP is labeled with a minimum of the following: protocol number, 
medication identification number (if applicable), dosage form (including product name and quantity in pack), directions for use, storage conditions, 
batch number and/or packaging reference, the statements “For 
investigational use only” and/or “Caution: New Drug—Limited by Federal (or US) Law to Investigational Use” and “Keep out of reach of children,” 
and the sponsor’s name and address. 
Additional labels may, on a case-by-case basis, be applied to the IP to satisfy local or hospital requirements, but must not: 
• Contradict the clinical study label 
• Obscure the clinical study label 
• Identify the study participant by name, without consultation with the 
sponsor. 
Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement. 
ASM = anti-seizure medication; GNX = ganaxolone; HPDE = high density polyethylene; IP = investigational 
product; tid = 3 times a day; US = United States. 
6.2 Dose Modification 
The protocol allows some alterations from the currently outlined dosing schedule. 
GNX (or matching volumes of placebo suspension) will be titrated at approximately weekly 
intervals over 4 weeks to a maximum dose ba sed on the participant’s starting weight 
63 mg/kg/day up to a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg (for participants > 28 kg). Any participant may have the dose of IP temporarily or permanently decreased at any point in the 
maintenance period to manage tolerability.  
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Protocol 1042-TSC-3001 
Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 175 Adjustments to GNX titration or dose may be used  to manage tolerability. The most common, 
dose-related, AEs in clinical experience to date, are somnolence, sedation, and lethargy. If a participant experiences one of these AEs during titration (or any other event which is, in the 
investigator’s opinion dose-related), there are several potential approaches to GNX dosing to 
manage tolerability:  
1. Maintain the dose of GNX to determine whether tolerability improves w ith additional time at 
the achieved dose. 
2. Reduce the dose of GNX: 
• Reduce the amount of GNX to the midpoint between the last well-tolerated dose and dose 
producing the adverse effect(s). 
• If the intermediate dose is tolerated, after several days the participant may escalate to the 
dose that previously produced the adverse effect(s). If tolerability is acceptable, they may 
maintain at that dose or continue the titration as scheduled if not at the maximal daily dose (63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day). 
• If the participant does not tolerate the re-challenge with re-escalation of the dose, they may 
return to the highest dose that was previously well-tolerated. The investigator may maintain 
that dose or may attempt re-titration,  based on their clinical judgment. 
Any adjustment in dose should be discussed with the medical monitor in advance, if possible. 
Other modifications in dose or titration may be warranted based on the participant’s clinical 
situation. Such adjustments may be instituted in consultation with the medical monitor. 
If the dose is interrupted for more than 48 hours, then the investigator should speak with the 
medical monitor regarding whether and how to re-initiate the medication.  
The maximum dose for all participants is 1800 mg/day. The total double-blind phase (titration 
and maintenance periods) should not exceed 16 weeks.  In Part B, for participants who continue 
to the OLE, the total daily dose that the participant was taking at the completion of Part A will be 
maintained. The titration schedule in Table 2  will be followed until the target total daily dose for 
the participant is reached. 
Participants who discontinue the IP should underg o a 2-week taper period. The taper period may 
be shortened at the discretion of the i nvestigator as clinically indicated.  
6.3 Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability 
6.3.1 Storage 
The investigator or designee must confirm a ppropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit and storage for all IP received and any discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the IP. 
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Protocol 1042-TSC-3001 
Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 of 175 The investigator has overall responsibility for ensuring that IP is stored in a secure, 
limited-access location in accordance with app licable requirements under the Controlled 
Substance Act and Drug Enforcement Administrat ion regulations. Limited responsibility may be 
delegated to the pharmacy or member of the study team, but this delegation must be documented. 
Investigational products are distributed by the pha rmacy or by a nominated member of the study 
team. Details on how to store the IP can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
All study drugs will be transported, received, st ored, and handled strictly in accordance with the 
container, study drug label, instructions provid ed to the pharmacy and applicable regulations.  
The IP must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions; the GNX oral suspension 
(50 mg/mL) should be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]; excursions 
permitted from 15°C to 30°C [59°F to 86°F]. Temperature monitoring of the IP is required at the 
storage location to ensure that the IP is mainta ined within an established temperature range. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously 
by an in-house system, by a mechanical recording de vice such as a calibrated chart recorder, or 
by manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified minimum/maximum thermometer) would require  manual resetting upon each recording.  
The sponsor must be notified immediately upon di scovery of any excursion from the established 
range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the IP and will provide supportive 
documentation as necessary. Under no circumst ances should the product be dispensed to 
participants until the impact has been determined  and the product is deemed appropriate for use 
by the sponsor. 
The sponsor should be notified immediately if ther e are any changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity of the product(s), such as fumigation of a storage room. 
6.3.2 Investigational Product Accountability 
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study IP accountability, reconciliati on, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amount s of the IP to carry out this protocol for the 
agreed number of participants. The investigator  or designee will acknowledge receipt of the IP, 
documenting shipment content and condition. Accu rate records of all IP dispensed, used, 
returned, and/or destroyed must be maintained as detailed further in this section. The investigator has overall responsibility for ad ministering/dispensing IP. Where permissible, 
tasks may be delegate d to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmaci st) who is adequately trained in the 
protocol and who works under the direct supervisi on of the investigator. This delegation must be 
documented in the applicable st udy delegation of authority form. 
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 of 175 The investigator or their designee (as documente d by the investigator in the applicable study 
delegation of authority form) will administer and/or dispense the IP only to participants included in this study following the procedures set out in the study protocol. Each participant will be 
given only the IP carrying his or her treatment a ssignment. All administered and/or dispensed IP 
will be documented on the electronic case report form (eCRFs) and/or other IP record. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the retrieval of all IP and study supplies from the 
participant.  
The participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to save and bring their unused 
IP and empty/used IP packaging to the clinic and final follow-up visit or to ship it back to the site 
via secure courier. Investigational pr oduct accountability must be assessed at the 
container/packaging level for unused IP that is contained within the original tamper-evident sealed container (eg, bottles) or at the indivi dual count level for opene d containers/packaging. 
The pharmacist/nominated person will record details on the IP accountability form. 
No IP stock or returned inventory from a Ma rinus-sponsored study may be removed from the site 
where originally shipped without prior knowledge and consent by the sponsor. If such transfer is 
authorized by the sponsor, all applicable local, stat e, and national laws must  be adhered to for the 
transfer. 
The sponsor or its representatives must be pe rmitted access to review the supplies storage and 
distribution procedures and records.  
At the end of the study, or as instructed by the sponsor, all unused stock, participant-returned, or 
expired IP are either to be sent to a nominated contractor on behalf of the sponsor for destruction 
or are to be destroyed by the site. Investig ational product being returned to the sponsor’s 
designated contractors or approve d to be destroyed by the site counted/measured and verified 
will be reconciled by clinical site personnel and the sponsor (o r designated contract research 
organization [CRO]). Shipment return forms, when  used, will be signed prior to shipment from 
the site. Returned IP will be packed in a ta mper-evident manner to ensure product integrity. 
Shipment of all returned IP must comply with local, state, and national laws. 
With the written agreement of the sponsor, unused  stock, participant-returned, and expired IP 
may be destroyed at the site or a local facility. In this case, destruction records identifying what 
was destroyed, when, and how must be obta ined with copies provided to the sponsor. 
Destruction of IP must be in accordance with local, state, and national laws. Based on entries in the site’s drug accountability forms, it must be possible to reconcile IP 
delivered with those used and returned. All IP s must be accounted for and all discrepancies 
investigated and documented to the sponsor’s satisfaction. 
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study IP are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 175 6.4 Measures to Minimize Bias 
6.4.1 Randomization  
Randomization procedures to minimize bias in this randomized, double-blind study are shown below. 
6.4.1.1 Study using IWRS  
All participants will be centra lly assigned to randomized study intervention using an Interactive 
Web Response System (IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and 
directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site. An IWRS will be utilized for the following 
IP tasks:  
• Randomization, stratified for current CBD use. 
• Supply management. 
• Inventory management and supply ordering. 
• Expiration date tracking. 
• Emergency unblinding. 
An IWRS will centrally randomize participants. The randomization schedule (comprised of a kit 
list and randomization list) will be generated using standard, va lidated methods, and maintained 
by the respective supplier and IWRS vendor. The investigator will be instructed by the IWRS, which numbered bottle to use to dose a participant. The investigator and research staff will be 
aware of the ascending dose design of the clinical  investigation; however, the investigator, the 
research staff, and the participants will be blinded with respect to who is receiving active drug 
versus placebo. The maximum placebo period is 18 weeks.  
The contents of each bottle will be blinded us ing labels. The randomiza tion schedule will match 
a participant number to a bottle number. Upon completion of baseline evaluations for each 
participant, the investigator or appropriate de signee will log into the IWRS to receive a bottle 
number allocated according to the randomization sche dule. Complete instructions for obtaining a 
bottle number will be provided to the clinical sites prior to initiating the study. The designated 
personnel at the clinical site wi ll match the assigned bo ttle number with the correct bottle of IP 
and distribute the bottle to the investigator or designee. 
Study medication will be dispensed at the study visits as summarized in the SOA ( Section 1.3) .  
Returned study medication should not be redispensed to the participants. 6.4.1.2 Participant Numbering 
During the screening visit, each participant will be assigned a unique 6-digit participant number. 
The participant number will consist of a 3-digit clinical investigationa l site number assigned by 
the sponsor, followed by a 3-digit participant nu mber (eg, 001) assigned by the electronic data

Protocol 1042-TSC-3001 
Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 68 of 175 capture system. This participant number will also serve as the screening number. The unique 
6-digit participant number will serve as the participant ID and be used to track the participant 
throughout the study. 
The clinical site is responsible for maintaini ng a current log of participant number assignments 
and bottle numbers of the IP administered to each  participant. The unique participant number is 
required to be entered on all clinical investig ation documentation (eCRFs,  labeling of clinical 
materials and samples containers , drug accountability logs, etc.). 
6.4.2 Blinding 
6.4.2.1 Blinded Investigational Product 
This is a double-blind study in which study staff as well as study participant and caregiver(s) are 
blinded to study intervention. The contents of each bottle will be bli nded using labels with 
unique bottle numbers. 
Only the IP supplier and the sponsor’s IP manager will be unblinded as to the contents of each 
bottle of IP. 
6.4.2.2 Blind Break (IWRS) 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breakin g functionality. In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ 
intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. 
If a participant’s intervention assignment is  unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within 24 hours of this occurrence. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded. 
6.5 Study Intervention Compliance 
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive the IP directly from the investigator or 
designee, under medical supervision. The dose of the IP and study participant identification at 
this time will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than 
the person administering the study intervention.   
When participants administer the IP at home, compliance with the IP will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by inspecting the eDiary entries and returned supplies, with 
queries as necessary, during the site visits. Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are to record daily 
seizure events in addition to study medication and non-study ASM administration in the eDiary 
device daily. Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will be  re-educated on the importance of adhering to 
daily seizure, IP and non-study ASM recording as  needed. Deviation(s) from the prescribed 
dosage regimen should be recorded in the eCRF. 
A record of the number of bottles of the IP dispensed to and taken by each participant must be 
maintained and reconcile d with study intervention and compliance records. Intervention start and

the eCRF. 
6.6 Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant medications refer to all treatment taken between the date of informed 
consent/assent and the date of the last dose of the IP.  
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is  receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with:   
• Reason for use. 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates. 
• Dosage information including dose and frequency. 
Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins 
and dietary or herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme 
inducer) or 5 half-lives of the respective drug, if known (whichever is longer), before the start of 
study intervention until completion of the follow-up visit, unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator and sponsor, the medicati on will not interfere with the study.   
Paracetamol/acetaminophen, at doses of ≤ 2 g/day, is permitted for use any time during the 
study. Other concomitant medication may be considered case -by-case by the investigator in 
consultation with the medical monitor.  
Concomitant topical and intranasal steroids for dermatologic reactions and allergic rhinitis are 
allowed as needed and do not warrant exclusion fr om study. If the participant is currently taking 
an excluded medication at the time of the screen ing visit, then the participant must undergo a 
washout period equivalent to 5 half-lives of the drug before they may enter the prospective 
4-week baseline phase. 
Use of dietary supplements or herbal preparati ons are permitted if participant has been using 
them consistently for more than 6 months prior to screening and does not plan on changing the 
dose for the duration of the maintenance period.  Use of St. John’s Wort is not permitted (see 
Section 5.2 ). 
Concomitant treatment information must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. If the 
participant starts a new medication during the study, details of that medication including the dose 
and date and time of first administr ation, should be added to that participant’s list of concomitant 
medications, and recorded in the eCRF as appropriate. 
The medical monitor should be contacted if ther e are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 of 175 6.6.1 Rescue Medicine 
The use of rescue medication is allowable at an y time during the study for prolonged, severe or 
repetitive seizures (seizure clusters). Rescue medication should be dela yed for 1 hour following 
administration of IP unless it unsafe to wait due to the severity of the seizure(s). 
Permitted rescue medications include:  
• Alprazolam.  
• Clobazam. 
• Clonazepam.  
• Diazepam.  
• Lorazepam.  
• Levetiracetam. 
• Phenobarbital 
• Midazolam. 
Other rescue medications may be used if approved by the medical monitor. 
Participants are expected to record rescue medications, dose levels, date, and time of 
administration on the eDiary. The medication name , dose, start and stop dates, and frequency of 
dosing will also be recorded in the clinical database.  
The study site will not supply rescue me dication that can be obtained locally.  
6.6.2 Excluded Medications 
Excluded medications include all steroid medications, other IPs,  as well as ketoconazole, 
St. John’s wort and Chinese medicine therapies.  
Concurrent use of ACTH, prednisone or other glucocorticoid is not permitted, nor use of the 
strong inducers of CYP3A4 (except approved ASMs: carbamazepine, phenytoin derivatives, 
phenobarbital, or primidone), rifampin and St. J ohn’s Wort. Participants on ACTH, prednisone, 
or other systemically (non-inhaled or topical ) administered steroids should be off the 
product > 28 days prior to screening. Rifampin and St John’s Wort must be discontinued at 
least 28 days before Visit 2, study drug initiation. Chinese medicine therapies must be 
discontinued at least > 28 days prior to screening. 
Note: Concomitant intranasal or PRN topical st eroids for dermatologic reactions and allergic 
rhinitis are allowed. Products containing THC or non-approve d CBD are excluded during treatment. 
Tetrahydrocannabinol or non-approved CBD should be  washed out for at least 4 weeks prior to 
screening. Participants with a positive result on THC or CBD laboratory tests, and who do not

6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study 
Participants may be eligible fo r continued treatment with GNX in an OLE. In the OLE, treatment 
can continue until the sponsor terminates the development of the IP in TSC or GNX has been approved and marketed in the pa rticipants’ respective country. 
7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention 
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If the IP is discontinued at any time, participants should follow the 2-week taper 
schedule unless otherwise medica lly indicated. If the participant discontinues during the 
maintenance period, evaluations listed for the Early Termination Visit (Visit 12;  Table 1 ) are to 
be performed as completely as possible along with the end of study and safety follow-up 
assessment, as appropriate. Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by the 
participant must be recorded in the source doc uments. The reason for termination, date of 
stopping the IP, and total amount of the IP taken must be recorded in the eCRF and source documents. Discontinuation of the IP due to AEs mu st also be reflected on the AE eCRF page. 
Participants who discontinue IP should undergo a 2- week or shorter taper period, as clinically 
indicated. These participants will have a visit 2 weeks after the end of taper to complete the 
safety follow-up assessments.  
See the SOA ( Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study 
intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
The reason for early discontinuation of the IP must be determined by the investigator and 
recorded in the participant’s source documents and on the eCRF. If a participant is withdrawn for 
more than 1 reason, each reason should be documented in the source document and the most 
clinically relevant reason should be entered on the eCRF.  
Reasons for early termination include but are not limited to the following:  
• AE (including pregnancy). 
• Protocol violation/pr otocol deviation. 
• Withdrawal by participant or parent(s)/LAR(s). 
• Lost to follow-up. 
• Lack of efficacy. 
• Death. 
• Investigator decision.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 72 of 175 7.2 Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study 
All participants or his/her parent(s)/LAR(s) reserve the right to withdraw from the study at any time, as stated in the informed consent/assent form. The investigator may discontinue participants from the clinical study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant is found to have entered the study in violation of the protocol. 
• Participant requires the use of a disallowed concomitant medication. 
• Participant’s condition changes after entering the clinical investigation so that the participant 
no longer meets the inclusion criteria or de velops any of the exclusion criteria. 
• Participant or parent(s)/LAR(s) withdraws cons ent or assent to participate in the study. 
• Participant is noncompliant  with the procedures set forth in the protocol. 
• Participant experiences an AE/SAE that warrants withdrawal from the study.  
• Any laboratory, medical, or clinical finding for which clinical intervention should take precedence over study participation. This includes: 
o AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT > 3 × ULN. 
o Total bilirubin levels > 1.5 × ULN. 
o eGFR < 30 mL/min. 
• It is the investigator’s opinion that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue in the 
study. 
Decisions to discontinue the study will be made at  each participating site by the investigator. If 
feasible, the reason for discontinuation should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to participant’s discontinuation. Participan ts who discontinue the IP during the maintenance 
period will continue to record daily seizure frequency at minimum until the completion of the 
maintenance period.  
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an Early Termination Visit (Visit 12) 
should be conducted as shown in the SOA ( Section 1.3 ). At this visit, participants will start a 
2-week taper and then return to the site 2 w eeks later for safety follow-up assessments.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.   
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
7.3 Lost to Follow-up 
A participant will be considered lost to follo w-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted 
by the study site.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 73 of 175 The following actions must be taken if a particip ant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to cont act the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible, counsel the participant on the importa nce of maintaining the assigned visit schedule 
and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant. A minimum of 3 documented attempts must be made to contact any participant lost to follow-up at any time point prior to the last 
scheduled contact (office visit or telephone contact ). At least 1 of these documented attempts 
must include a written communication sent to th e participant’s last know n address via courier 
or mail (with an acknowledgment of receipt request) asking that they return to the site for 
final safety evaluations and return any unused IP. If contact is made but the participant 
refuses or is unable to return to the site fo r the early termination and final safety follow-up 
visit, it should be documented in the eCRF. 
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of  the study as a whole are handled in Section 10.1.10 . 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). Study dates will 
be based on the date of the first dose of IP an d not the date of screening or baseline visits. 
Study assessments can be conducted at the institution of the site investigator or remotely at the 
participant’s home. All assessments can be conduc ted remotely with the use of telemedicine 
video tools; and for sites located outside of the European Union only, by providing traveling 
nurses to take vital signs, draw bl ood samples, and collect specimens. 
Immediate safety concerns should be discusse d with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, includ ing those specified in the SOA, is essential 
and required for study conduct.  All screening evaluations must be completed and re viewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’ s routine clinical manage ment (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of the informed consen t form (ICF) may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were 
performed within the timeframe defined in the SOA.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 74 of 175 Safety, laboratory, and analyte results that could unblind the study will not be reported to 
investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Exceptions to 
this are if there is an urgent medical need ( Section 6.4.2 ).  
8.1 General Study Periods 
8.1.1 Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Baseline 
Potential participants w ill be pre-identified by the site because of a previous TSC diagnosis 
based on clinical features and/or results and those still experience refractory 
seizures. 
The process of identification of participants is pe rformed by the investigator. If an investigator is 
seeing a patient with TSC in their clinic who is having 8 or more seizures per month, they will 
make a judgment regarding whether the benefits of  clinical trial partic ipation may outweigh the 
risks of clinical trial participation (with any alternative treatments taken into consideration). If the clinician feels that they do, then they will explain the study to the participant (or LAR). If the 
participant/LAR is fully informed and provides consent, then this will be documented, and the 
screening activities can begin. 
Note for Investigational Site s in the United Kingdom (UK): National Health Services (NHS) 
sites in the UK will be aware of the study by virtue of the investigators participating in the site 
initiation visit, and being trained on the st udy design, conduct, and participant protection 
policies. 
Informed consent/assent will be obtained afte r the study has been fully explained to the 
participant/parent(s)/LAR(s) and before the conduct  of any screening procedures or assessments 
(see Section 10.1.3  for the informed consent procedure). This includes the collection of historical 
seizure frequency data, or if this information is not available from medical records, the 
participants will be asked to provide this inform ation for the 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit 
based on their own recall/records. This Screen ing Visit will occur 4 weeks before baseline 
(Week 0).  
At screening, informed consent will be confirmed and the participants eligibility checked. 
Demographics and Medical history in cluding prior treatment information ( Section 8.1.1.1 ), 
historical seizure calendar review ( Section 8.1.1.2 ), and a seizure identif ication and diagnostic 
review ( Section 8.1.1.3 ) will be performed as well as other study specific procedures as outlined 
in the SOA ( Table 1 ). 
Randomization will occur approximately 4 weeks after screening at baseline and all participants 
will be centrally assigned to randomized study inte rvention (stratified for current CBD use) using 
an IWRS. Details are provided in Section 6.4.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 of 175 8.1.1.1 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics including age, gender, ethnicity, and race will be collected, as allowed according to local regulations. In addition to the genetic  evaluation of pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
TSC1/TSC2 variant, relevant medical history including but limited to the age of seizure onset, other physical disabilities such as scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory problems, and 
gastrointestinal difficulties will also be assessed. The participant’s developmental history will 
also be assessed. This will include the grade level of school work that the participant has 
completed (for individuals who are chronologically school age), as well as the investigator’s estimate of the participant’s developmental age. Prior medications include all treatment, 
including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, surgical implants (such as VNS), and 
prescribed medications received within 30 days (or PK equivalent of 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of the date prior to screening.  
Demographics and Medical History will be reviewed and collected at the Visit 1 (screening). A 
review of the participant’s Medical History will be performed again at Visit 2 (baseline). All 
findings on the medical history will be recorded on the eCRF. Prior treatment information 
(therapy name, start and stop date),  if available, must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
8.1.1.2 Historical Seizure Calendar Review 
A 2-month (8-week) daily historical seizure calendar will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per inclusion/exclusion cr iteria. Acceptable daily historical seizure 
calendars will need to denote seizure types (or sufficient description), frequency, and days that 
no seizures occurred.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent/assent from the participant/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) has been appropriately obtained. 
8.1.1.3 Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review 
Per the inclusion criteria, enrollment into the study will be based on the presence and frequency 
of the primary endpoint seizure types.  
Primary endpoint seizure types are defined as the following: focal motor seizures without 
impairment of consciousness or awareness, focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or 
awareness with motor features, focal seizures evolving to bilateral, tonic-clonic convulsive 
seizures, and generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral t onic, bilateral clonic, 
or atonic/drop seizures. Seizures must have a motor component sufficiently prominent and 
distinct to clearly establish the observed symptoms as epileptic in origin. Seizures that do not 
count towards the primary endpoint include: focal or  generalized nonmotor seizures  (eg, absence 
seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with or without impairment of awareness), infantile or 
epileptic spasms, and myoclonic seizures.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 76 of 175 To standardize seizure identification and classifi cation in the study, a SIF/DRF will be submitted 
and reviewed by the Epilepsy Study Consortium. The Epilepsy Study Consortium will review participant seizure data and assign the seizure type for each participant. This categorization of 
seizure type by the Epilepsy Study Consortium shou ld not delay the participant’s entry into the 
study as this will be determined by the investigator’s assessment of eligibility.  
Final confirmation and approval of a participant’s seizure type is required prior to dispensing the 
IP.  
Instructions for completion of the Seizure Iden tification and Diagnostic Review Form (SIF/DRF) 
can be found in the Investigator Site File. 
8.1.2 Double-blind Phase 
Double-blind treatment with the IP will begin af ter baseline assessment at Visit 2. All dates 
during the double-blind phase will be based off th e date of randomization and the first dose of 
the IP. The double-blind phase will include a 4-week titration period (Day 1 to Day 28 
inclusive), and a 12-week maintenance period starting on Day 29 to Visit 12 (Week 16).   
Participants who discontinue the study prematurely before Visit 12 (Week 16) are required to 
taper their IP for 2 weeks or shorter, unless otherwise medically indicated. Participants should 
also complete the eDiary during this time. The end of study assessments, as detailed in the SOA Part A for Visit 13A ( Table 1 ), should then be performed. 
Participants who are not continuing in the OLE will then begin a double-blind taper period where 
the IP will be withdrawn from Visit 12 (Week 16) as shown in the SOA for Part A as shown in Table 1 . This taper period will last for 2 weeks but may be shortened at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
All participants entering the OLE will have th eir dose of study medication adjusted in a double-
blind cross-titration over 4 weeks after Visit 12 (Week 16) as shown in Table 2 . This will be 
performed under blinded conditions and participants previously tr eated with GNX will complete 
a dummy titration period. 
8.1.3 Safety Follow-up 
A safety follow-up visit will be conducted at Vi sit 13A (Week 20) after a 2- to 4-week down 
titration for participants who are not continuing in the OLE as shown in the SOA for Part A 
(Table 1 ). This will be the end of study visit for these participants. 
For participants who plan to continue in the O LE, additional visits will be conducted as shown in 
in the SOA for Part B ( Table 1 ).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 of 175 8.2 Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy as determined by a reduction in seizures  will be evaluated by collecting daily seizure 
type, duration, and frequency in a seizure eDiary. Days in which no seizures occur will also be 
noted. CGI-CSID and CGI-I, as well as changes in behavior and neuropsychiatric symptoms will 
be assessed by a variety of clinician and caregiver administered instruments.  
Planned timepoints for all efficacy asse ssments are provided in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). 
8.2.1 Seizure Type and Frequency 
The Epilepsy Study Consortium will review particip ant seizure data and assign the seizure type 
for each participant. This categorization of seizure type by the Epilepsy Study Consortium 
should not delay the participant’s entry into th e study as this will be determined by the 
investigator’s assessment of eligibility.  
Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will record daily se izures denoting vernacular name for the seizure 
type, duration, and frequency in an eDiary.  Primary endpoint seizure types w ill be counted towards the primary endpoint. These are defined 
as the following:  
• Focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness. 
• Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness with motor features. 
• Focal seizures evolving to bilatera l, tonic-clonic convulsive seizures. 
• Generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral tonic, bilateral clonic, or 
atonic/drop seizures.  
Seizures must have a motor com ponent sufficiently prominent and distinct to clearly establish 
the observed symptoms as epileptic in origin.  
Seizures that do not count  towards the primary endpoint include:  
• Focal or generalized nonmotor seizures (eg, abse nce seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with 
or without impairment of awareness). 
• Infantile or epileptic spasms. 
• Myoclonic seizures. 
Note: Every seizure reported by the family will be  fully described in the study outputs, and each 
description will include the vernacular name used by the participant or 
parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s), as appropriate, to refer to that seizure event as well as the medical 
seizure type as adjudicated by the Epilepsy Study  Consortium. If the parent uses a medically 
incorrect term to refer to a specific seizure (such as calling a focal seizure with impaired

seizure type. 
Participants or parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) are to record administration of the IP and 
background ASMs in the eDiary. Compliance with  the IP treatment will be assessed by 
inspecting the participants’ eDiary and retu rned supplies with queries, as necessary. 
8.2.2 Clinical Global Impression – Severity 
The CGI-S is a 7-point Likert scale that will be completed by the clinician to rate the severity of 
illness in the participant at baseline, relative to ot her individuals with TSC. This should take into 
account overall seizure control, behavior, sa fety, tolerability of medications, and any 
involvement of non-neurological organ systems. The participant will be rated as follows: 1 – Normal, not at all a problem, 2 – Border line problem, 3 – Mild problem, 4 – Moderate 
problem, 5 – Marked problem, 6 – Severe problem, 7 – Very severe problem (see Section 10.9 ).  
CGI-S will be assessed at the baseline (Visit 2). 
8.2.3 Clinical Global Impre ssion – Improvement  
The CGI-I is a 7-point Likert scale that the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and clinician uses to 
rate the change in overall seizure control, behavior, safety, and tolerability after initiation of the 
IP relative to baseline (prior to treatment with th e IP). The participant will be rated as follows: 
1
 – very much improved, 2 – much improved, 3 – minimally improved, 4 – no change, 
5 – minimally worse, 6 – much worse, and 7 – very much worse (See Section 10.10 ). 
CGI-I (parent[s]/caregiver[s]/LAR[s] and clinician) will be assessed at Visit 4 (Week 1), 
Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16). 
Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the CGI-I conducted at Visit 15 (Week 18) 
and Visit 17 (Week 20). 
8.2.4 Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration  
The CGI-CSID is a 7-point Likert scale in which the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) assesses 
change in seizure intensity and/or duration after initiation of IP relative to baseline (prior to 
treatment with IP). The scale ranges from 1-  very much improved, 2- much improved, 
3- minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- minimall y worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very much 
worse (See  Section 10.11 ). 
CGI-CSID will be assessed at Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and 
Visit 12 (Week 16). 
Participants who continue in the OLE w ill also have the CGI-CSID conducted at 
Visit 15 (Week 18) and Visit 17 (Week 20).

The ADAMS is a rating scale designed to screen fo r anxiety and depression in individuals with 
intellectual disability ( Esbensen et al, 2003 ). The 28-question scale is filled out by the 
parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and is based on th e participant’s behavior . Each question will be 
rated on 4-point Likert scale as follows: 0-  behavior has not occurred or is not a problem; 
1- behavior occurs occasionally or is a mild problem; 2- behavior occurs  quite often or is a 
moderate problem; and 3- behavior occurs a lot or is a severe problem (see Section 10.13 ). 
The ADAMS will be conducted at Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16).  
Participants who continue in the O LE will also have the ADAMS conducted at

8.2.7 Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Family Impact Module 
Peds-QL-FIM is designed to measure the impact  of pediatric chronic health conditions on 
parents and the family. The Peds-QL-FIM measures  parent self-reported physical, emotional, 
social, and cognitive functioning, communicati on, and worry. The module also measures 
parent-reported family daily activities and family relationships (see Section 10.14). 
The Peds-QL-FIM will be conducted at Visit 2 (b aseline), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), 
and Visit 12 (Week 16). Peds-QL-FIM for past 1 month will be conducted at baseline visit and 
Peds-QL-FIM for past 7 days will be conducted at on-study visits (see Section 10.14). 
Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the Peds-QL-FIM conducted at

8.3.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs including heart rate (HR) (bpm), respiratory rate (RR [breaths/minute]), body temperature measured orally or on the skin, and blood pressure (BP) (mmHg) will be collected at every in-clinic visit. 
BP and pulse measurements will be assessed in a sitting position with a completely automated 
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 
BP and pulse measurements should be preceded by at  least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in 
a quiet setting without distracti ons (eg, television, cell phones). 
Vital signs will be measured in a sitting position after 5 minutes rest and will include 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and RR. Three readings of blood 
pressure and pulse will be taken. The first r eading should be rejected. The second and third 
readings should be averaged to give  the measurement to be recorded. 
Vital signs, body temperature, height and weight  will be assessed during Visit 1 (screening), 
Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16).  
Participants who do not continue in the OLE will have vital signs, body temperature, height and 
weight assessed at their end of study visit, Visit 13A, on Week 20. Participants who continue in th e OLE will also have vital signs, body temperature, height and 
weight assessed at Visit 15 (Week 18) and Visit 17 (Week 20). 
Note: Length will be measured if  height cannot be obtained. 
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms  
12-lead ECGs will be performed to collect the el ectrical activity of the heart throughout the study 
to monitor safety. An evaluation of “normal”  by a physician must be obtained before the 
participant is enrolled in the study.  
12-lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ) using an ECG machine 
that automatically calculates the HR and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.  12-lead ECGs will be performed at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 4 (Week 1), and 
Visit 8 (Week 5), and Visit 12 (Week 16). 
Participants who continue in  the OLE will also have 12-lead ECGs conducted at Visit 15

CONFIDENTIAL Page 83 of 175 8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory safety assessments will be collected to  monitor participant safety. Clinical laboratory 
tests are listed in Section 10.2  and will be collected per the schedule listed in SOA (see 
Section 1.3 ). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
These clinical laboratory assessments will in clude complete blood c ount with automated 
differential, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and eGFR calculation (mL/min), comprehensive metabolic panel, as well serum pregnancy test for all WOCBP (at Visits 1 and 2 in the 
double-blind phase and Visit 17 for participants co ntinuing in OLE). A central laboratory will be 
utilized by the sites. 
The following liver function and eGFR tests will be monitored throughout the study as follows:  
• If AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) increases > 3 times ULN during the study, participant 
should be followed with weekly laboratory repeat  testing and continue in study if levels 
trending down. Participant will be  discontinued if levels do not decline to under 3 × ULN.  
• If total bilirubin increases to 1.5 × ULN or more during study, the participant will be 
discontinued.  
• Participants with significant renal insufficiency, eGFR < 30 mL/min (calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula or pediatric GFR calculator or Bedside Schwartz), will be 
discontinued if the criterion is met post baseline. 
• If any of the criteria above are deemed clinically significant by the investigator, then the sponsor’s medical monitor should be contacted. 
• If clinically significant values do not return to  normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the investigator, the etiology s hould be identified, and the sponsor notified. 
• If laboratory values from non-protocol-speci fied laboratory tests performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3 laboratory test), then the results must be recorded and 
discussed with the medical monitor. 
Samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and Visit 12 (Week 16).  
In addition, urinalysis will be conducted at Vi sit 1 (screening) or Visit 2 (baseline), Visit 
4 (Week 1), and Visit 12 (Week 16) for all participants.  Participants who continue in the OLE will also have clinical laboratory tests and urinalysis 
conducted at Visit 17 (Week 20). The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 60 mL. Repeat or 
unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reas ons or for technical issues with the samples, 
which may increase the total volume drawn.

of weight, if additional labs are required, the me dical monitor should be consulted to ensure that 
recommended blood volume limits are not unnecessarily exceeded. 
8.3.5 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring (Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale) 
GNX is considered to be a CNS-active intervention. GNX is related to products with an 
increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior. Participants with TSC may occasionally develop suicidal ideation or behavior. 
Participants being treated with GNX should be mo nitored appropriately and observed closely for 
suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the 
beginning and end of the course of intervention, or  at the time of dose changes, either increases 
or decreases. Participants who experience signs  of SIB should undergo a risk assessment. All 
factors contributing to SIB should be evalua ted and consideration should be given to 
discontinuation of the study intervention.  When informed consent or assent has been give n, participants or parents/caregivers/LARs of 
participants being treated with GNX should be aler ted about the need to monitor participants for 
the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as  well as the emergence of SIB and to report 
such symptoms immediately to the study investigator. C-SSRS will be used to rate the participant’s degree of suicidal ideation on a scale ranging from 
“no suicidal ideation” to “active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent” 
(Posner et al, 2011 ) (See Section 10.17 ). The C-SSRS will be assessed in all 
participants ≥ 11 years of age, if appropriate, otherwise, clinical judgment will be used.  
If the participant has a positive result for C-SSR S, the medical monitor should be contacted 
within 24 hours and the medical monitor will de termine if the individual should discontinue the 
trial.  
The C-SSRS (baseline form) will be completed at Visit 2 (baseline), while the C-SSRS (since 
previous visit) will be completed at Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 8 (Week 5), Visit 9 (Week 9), and 
Visit 12 (Week 16). Participants who do not cont inue in the OLE will have their final C-SSRS 
assessment at their end of study visit, Visit 13A, on Week 20.  
Participants who continue in the OLE will also have the C-SSRS conducted at 
Visit 15 (Week 18) and Visit 17 (Week 20).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 85 of 175 8.3.6 Concomitant Anti-epileptic Drug Levels 
Concomitant ASM levels at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 8 (end of titration), and Visit 12 (study 
completion) will be obtained centrally for the fo llowing if the participant is prescribed these 
medications: 
• CBD. 
• Clobazam (in which case clobazam and desmet hylclobazam levels should be obtained). 
• mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus, sirolimus, etc.). 
• Valproate. 
Participants who continue in  the OLE will also have the above concomitant  ASM levels 
collected at Visit 17 (Week 20). 
If the ASM levels cannot be performed centrally local testing is permitted. 
If the levels of any ASM co-administered with th e IP are measured routinely per standard of 
care, this information will be recorded in the eCRF during the study.  
Further details are provided in the SOA ( Section 1.3 ). 
8.3.7 Drug Screen 
A plasma drug screen will be performed to test for THC and non-approved CBD at 
Visit 1 (screening). If the screening drug test is positive, a confirmatory retest, via plasma, will 
be performed after 2 weeks. A positive test for CBD or THC will exclude the participant from 
the study, unless the result is fully explained by an Epidiolex® prescription, which is provided 
and managed by the investigator. 
The plasma drug screen can be performed at any time during the study per the investigator’s 
discretion. Concomitant use of THC and non- approved CBD is not permitted on study and will 
result in participant withdrawal from the study. 
8.3.8 Pregnancy Testing 
Pregnancy testing will be performed at all in-person visits for all WOCBP to monitor participant 
safety throughout the duration of participation in the trial.  
Pregnancy tests are listed in Section 10.3 and will be collected per the schedule listed in SOA 
(see Section 10.3 ). Test results must be filed with the source documents.  
A serum pregnancy test will occur at Visits 1 and 2. Participants who continue in the OLE will 
also have a serum pregnancy test at Visit 17. At Visits 4, 8, 9, 12, and 13A, the investigator may 
choose to do either a serum or urine pregnancy test.

The Tanner Staging (also known as the Tanner Scales) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents, and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based 
on external primary and secondary sex characteristics.  Participants will be evaluated and rated as 
Tanner I, Tanner II, Tanner III, Tanner IV, and Tanner V.  
Tanner staging will occur at Visit 1 (screening) for all participants. Participants who do not 
continue in the OLE will have Tanner staging at th eir end of study visit, Visit 13A, on Week 20.   
Participants who continue in the OLE w ill also have Tanner staging conducted at 
Visit 17 (Week 20).

Please refer to Section 8.5 for additional details re garding PK assessments. 
The results, date, and time of last ASM dose will be recorded in the eCRF. 
8.4 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The definitions of unsolicited and solicited AEs and SAEs can be found in Section 10.4 . 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by parent[s]/caregiver[s]/LAR[s]).  
The investigator and any qualified designees ar e responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up all AEs OR AEs that are serious, considered related to the study, or that caused the participant 
to discontinue the IP and the study (see Section 7 ). 
The reference for safety information for this study is the GNX IB, which the sponsor has 
provided under separate cover to al l investigators. For additional details, please consult the most 
current IB. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports are provided in  Section 10.4 .  
All initial and follow-up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator to Marinus’ drug 
safety vendor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. Note: The 24-hour reporting 
requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of  abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors 
unless they result in an SAE.  
The investigator must complete, sign, and da te the Marinus Clinical Study Serious Adverse 
Event Form and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the 
corresponding source documents (Note: Source docu ments are not to be sent unless requested) 
and fax or e mail the form to Marinus ’ drug safety vendor or its delegate.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 87 of 175 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information 
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent/assent is signed until the defined 
follow-up period at the timepoints specified in the SOA ( Section 10.3 ). This includes events 
occurring during the screening period of the study, regardless of whether or not the IP has been administered. All AEs reported after the initiation of the IP will be considered TEAEs. Where 
possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not 
been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs should be captured on the 
appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the IP indication s hould also be captured on the AE eCRF page. 
All AEs must be followed to closure (the participan t’s health has returned to baseline status or all 
variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the participant is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is r eached, stabilization is achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsen ing of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medi cal tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented. 
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from the time the 
participant/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) signs the informed consent/assent until the defined 
follow-up period stated and must be reported to Marinus’ drug safety vendor within 24 hours of 
the first awareness of the event.  
In addition, any SAE considered “related” to the IP and discovered by the investigator at any 
interval after the study has completed must be repo rted to the Marinus’ drug safety vendor within 
24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation. However, if the investigat or learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
8.4.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.4 . 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when  detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 88 of 175 8.4.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-se rious AEs of special interest (as defined in 
Section 8.4.8 ) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or 
the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ). Further information on follow-up 
procedures is provided in Section 10.4 . 
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the sa fety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), 
and investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from the sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
8.4.4.1 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A SUSAR is defined as an SAE that meets both the following criteria with respect to IP: Suspected — is assessed as related to IP Unexpected — compared to the IP-related AEs described in the IB, Reference Safety 
Information, the event meets any of the following criteria: 
• The event has not been previously described. 
• The event is now characterized as more severe. 
• The event is now characterized more specifically (eg, an event of “interstitial nephritis” in a 
participant receiving an agent previously described as associated with “acute renal failure”). 
In clinical trials involving ill participants, events  considered related to the natural history of the 
disease under study or to lack of efficacy (that is, the event is considered more likely related to 
those factors than to other factors, including  study drug) are not considered “unexpected”. 
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Protocol 1042-TSC-3001 
Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 89 of 175 Requirements for Expedited and Periodic Reporting of Adverse Events: 
SUSARs are required to be reported rapidly to re gulatory authorities and to IRBs/IECs (within 
7 days of initial notification for fatal or life-th reatening SUSARs; within 15 days for all other 
SUSARs). Therefore, as with all SAEs, the site must report the event to the Marinus’ drug safety 
vendor within 24 hours of being made aware of th e event. The Sponsor and the Investigator will 
work together to meet these reporting requirements. 
8.4.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, 12-lead ECG assessment can represent 
an AE if the change is clinically significant or if, during treatment with the IP, a shift of a 
parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or there is a further worsening 
of an already abnormal value. When evaluating su ch changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference range (either while continuing 
treatment or after the end of treatment with the IP), and the range of variation of the respective 
parameter within its reference range must be taken into consideration. 
If, at the end of the double-blind treatment phase , there are abnormal clinical laboratory, vital 
sign, or 12-lead ECG values that were not present in the pretreatment findings observed closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return 
to within the reference range or until a plausibl e explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found 
for the abnormal values. 
The investigator should decide, based on the a bove criteria and the clinical condition of a 
participant, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or the 12-lead ECG parameter is 
clinically significant and therefore, represents an AE. 
8.4.6 Death Events 
Any SAE that results in the participant’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome, with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the participant’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the participant’s d eath or any ongoing events at the time of death, 
unless another IP action was previously take n (eg, the drug was interrupted, reduced, or 
withdrawn), the action taken with the IP should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not 
applicable” (if the participant never received the IP). The IP action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the participant’s death. 
8.4.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease- related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events 
Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classified as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected pr ogression of the disease. This includes seizures

CONFIDENTIAL Page 90 of 175 typical for that participant unless the seizures are changed in character, frequency, or duration. 
Significant worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE. 
The following disease-related events are common in participants with epilepsy and can be 
serious/life threatening:  
• Seizures. 
• SE. 
• Falls/trauma/accidents. 
As these events are typically associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported 
according to the standard process for expedite d reporting of SAEs even though the event may 
meet the definition of an SAE. These events will be recorded within 5 business days of when 
they are reported to the site. These disease-related events will be monitored by the DMC on a routine basis. See Section 10.1.6 . 
Note: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an AE/SAE (instead of a disease-related event):  
• The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than 
expected for the individual participant, or 
• The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to study intervention. 
8.4.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An adverse events of special interest (AESI) includes any non-serious condition that falls under 
the system organ class (SOC) of ‘Breast and Reproductive disorders’. These AESIs will be 
submitted to Marinus’ drug safety vendor using the study specific AESI reporting form.  
8.4.9 Pregnancy 
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male 
participants are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow-up period. 
Any report of pregnancy for a ny female study participant or the partner of a male study 
participant must be reported within 24 hours to Ma rinus’ drug safety vendor or its delegate using 
the Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Pregna ncy Report Form (and any applicable follow-
up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Marinus medical monitor using the details specified in 
the emergency contact information section at the beginning of the protocol. The pregnant female 
study participant must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather info rmation regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 
30 calendar days after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar days after delivery.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 91 of 175 Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous  abortion/miscarriage or  congenital abnormality 
are considered SAEs and must be reported as outlined in Section 10.4 of the protocol using the 
Marinus Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event Form. Non serious AEs are to be reported as per clinical eCRF guidelines. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. 
Any poststudy pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by 
the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 8.4.4 . While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
participants/pregnant female pa rtner, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting. 
In addition to the above, if the i nvestigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE to Marinus’ dr ug safety vendor or delegate as outlined in 
Section 10.4 of the protocol using the Marinus Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event Form. The 
test date of the first positive serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin test or ultrasound result will 
determine the pregnancy onset date.  
Any female participant who beco mes pregnant while participati ng in the study will discontinue 
study intervention and be withdrawn from the study.  
8.4.10  Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication erro r should not be reported per the SAE reporting 
procedure. Only a resulting AE, if it occurs, should be reported according to the procedures as 
described in Section 10.4 . All IP provided to pediatric participants should be supervised by the 
parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s). 
The definitions below are not mutually exclusive; an event can meet more than 1 category. 
• Abuse:  Persistent or sporadic inte ntional intake of an IP for a nonmedical purpose (eg, to 
alter one’s state of consciousness or get high ) in a manner that may be detrimental to the 
individual and/or society. 
• Misuse: Intentional use of an IP other than as dire cted or indicated at any dose. (Note: This 
includes a situation in which the IP is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by the 
protocol.) 
• Overdose: Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of an IP exceeding a prespecified 
total daily dose of the product.  
• Medication error:  An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administering, and/or use of an 
IP. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. 
o Cases of participant’s missing doses of the IP are not considered reportable as medication errors. 
o Medication errors should be collected and reported for the IP under investigation. 
o The administration and/or use of an expired IP should be considered as a reportable 
medication error.

For this study, any dose of GNX greater than up to 63 mg/kg/day or over the maximum of 
1800 mg/day within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. 
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose, but participants should be 
closely monitored and receive supportive care.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:  
• Contact the medical monitor immediately. 
• Evaluate the participant to determine, in consultation with the medical monitor, whether 
study intervention should be interrupted or whether the dose should be reduced. 
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and provide any appropriate supportive medical management. 
• Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 1 day from the date of the last dose of study 
intervention if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case-by-case basis). 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 94 of 175 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock and it will include a more technical and detailed description of the statis tical analyses described in this section. This 
section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including primary and ke y secondary endpoints. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC 27513) software. 
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
Hypothesis testing will be perform ed for the primary endpoint: the percentage change in 28-day 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during the double-blind phase relative to the baseline, based 
on the primary endpoint seizure types. Summary statistics including confidence intervals for the 
treatment differences will be used to su mmarize the results. The hypothesis testing is: 
Ho: θ PBO = θ GNX  H a: θ PBO ≠ θ GNX 
where θGNX is the percentage change of seizure frequency relative to the baseline for participants 
who treated with GNX and θPBO is similarly defined for participants receiving placebo.  
9.1.1 Multiplicity Adjustment 
All endpoints will be assessed descriptively, by the treatment to which the participants are 
randomized, with point estimates and 95% confid ence intervals. The primary and secondary 
endpoints will be assessed in an inferential manner. Multiplicity control will be used for the 
primary and secondary endpoints. A gate keepi ng approach will be used to control the study 
wide Type-I error rate. There is a single prima ry efficacy endpoint, and formal hypothesis testing 
will be performed for this endpoint first. If the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary efficacy 
endpoint at the 2-sided α-level allocated to the final analysis of the primary endpoint, then 
statistical hypothesis testing w ill be performed on the 4 key secondary endpoints. The testing 
will stop if the result is non-statistically signifi cant. All other non-key secondary and

CONFIDENTIAL Page 95 of 175 9.2 Analysis Sets 
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:  
Participant Analysis Set Description 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) set All randomized participants. Participants will be summarized 
within the treatment group to which they were randomized. This population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) set All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of the IP. Participants will be summa rized within the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. This population will be used 
for sensitivity analysis for effi cacy. 
Per-protocol (PP) set All participants in the ITT analysis set participants who received 
IP for at least 6 weeks, provided at least 5 weeks of post-baseline seizure data, and without major protocol deviations that 
affect the efficacy e ndpoints (defined prior to database lock). 
Safety analysis set All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of the 
IP. Participants will be summa rized within the treatment group 
for which they actually received treatment. This population will be used for the safety analyses. 
IP = investigational product. 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set is used  to analyze endpoints related to the efficacy 
objectives and the safety analysis set is used to  analyze the endpoints and assessments related to 
safety. The primary analysis will be performed within the ITT population; a supportive analysis 
in the per-protocol (PP) and modified intent-t o-treat (mITT) population will also be conducted. 
9.3 Statistical Analyses 
9.3.1 General Considerations 
The results of the primary, secondary, and explor atory endpoints will be summarized separately. 
The results will be summarized by the treatment to which the participants were randomized. Participant demographics, characteristics, a nd medical history at randomization will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. 
The primary and secondary endpoints (unless otherwise defined) for the
 Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) will be based on the double-blind phase (titra tion and maintenance 
period).  
The primary and secondary endpoints (unless othe rwise defined) for the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) will be based on the maintenance period only. 
Ganaxolone Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 96 of 175 9.3.2 Primary Endpoint(s) 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percenta ge change from baseline in 28-day primary 
endpoint seizure frequency during the double-bli nd phase (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint 
will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
Primary endpoint seizure types are defined as the following:  
• Focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness 
• Focal seizures with impairment of consci ousness or awareness with motor features 
• Focal seizures evolving to bilatera l, tonic-clonic convulsive seizures 
• Generalized motor seizures including tonic-clonic, bilateral tonic, bilateral clonic, or 
atonic/drop seizures.   
Seizures that do not count towards the primary endpoint include:  
• Focal or generalized nonmotor seizures (eg, abse nce seizures or focal nonmotor seizures with 
or without impairment of awareness) 
• Infantile or epileptic spasms 
• Myoclonic seizures. 
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
double-blind phase divided by the number of days w ith seizure data in the period, multiplied by 
28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
baseline phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in the period, multiplied by 28. 
The calculation for percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency will be done as 
follows for each participant:  
 
The baseline, post-baseline, and arithmetic and percent changes from baseline in 28-day seizure 
frequency will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The difference between the treatment groups in the percent changes will be tested for statistical 
significance. Since the percent differences are anticipated to display skewness and/or outliers, the 
test will be performed using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic us ing a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 of 175 9.3.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis 
There are 5 sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint planned and these will be 
performed as outlined in the SAP:  
• For the first sensitivity analysis, intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 
double-blind phase and any missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing 
completely at random and the collected data will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure 
frequencies. 
• The second sensitivity analysis is to explore the possibility that participants who stop 
recording their seizure counts tend to have higher counts than the other participants. 
• The third sensitivity analysis will be performed on participants who achieved their 
maintenance dose at the start of the maintenance period. This analysis will exclude those 
participants who are still titrated continuously during maintenance period. 
• The fourth sensitivity analysis will be performed for the primary outcome measure by using the mITT population. 
• The fifth sensitivity analysis will be performed for the primary outcome measure by excluding all intercurrent events. 
9.3.3 Secondary Endpoint(s) Analysis 
All secondary and will compare GNX and placebo at the end of the 
double-blind phase and maintenan ce period relative to the 4-week prospective baseline phase. 
The primary analyses of all secondary and will be performed on the ITT 
population. All the endpoints will be included in data listings. 
The key secondary endpoints are:  
• Percentage change from baselin e in 28-day primary endpoint seizure frequency during the 
maintenance period (FDA). For the EM A this is the primary endpoint. 
• Number (%) of participants considered tr eatment responders during the double-blind phase 
(FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥  50% reduction from baseline in 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during given period. 
• Number (%) of participants considered trea tment responders during the maintenance period. 
Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥  50% reduction from baseline in 
primary endpoint seizure frequency during a given period. 
• CGI-I at the last scheduled visit in the double-blind phase. 
9.3.3.1 Secondary Efficacy: Behavioral/Neuropsychiatric/Quality of Life 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in be havior, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life domains are:  
• Change from baseline in ADAMS total score and sub-score. 
• Change from baseline in quality-of-life scales: SF-36, Peds-QL-FIM, and ELDQOL.

Secondary efficacy endpoints in seizure control are:  
• Change from baseline in the percentage of seizure-free days during the double-blind phase, 
based on primary endpoint seizure types (FDA ). For the EMA, this endpoint will be 
evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
• Change from baseline in the CGI-CSID at the end of the double-blind phase (FDA). For the 
EMA, this endpoint will be evaluate d over the maintenance period only.  
• Participants with a ≥ 25% and ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in primary endpoint seizure 
frequency during the double-blind phase (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated over the maintenance period only. 
• Participants with a ≥ 25%, ≥  50%, and ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in primary endpoint 
seizure frequency during the maintenance period. 
• Responder analysis for primary endpoint seizur es and all seizures during the double-blind 
phase using the following response categories: ≤ 0%, > 0% to < 25%, ≥ 25% to < 50%, 
≥ 50% to < 75%, and ≥ 75% to 100% (FDA). For the EMA, this endpoint will be evaluated 
over the maintenance period only. 
• Percent change in 28-day fr equency of all seizures.  
• Change from baseline in the percentage of se izure-free days, based on all seizure types.

All safety analyses will be performed in the Sa fety Population. The results will be summarized 
by the treatment received.  
The number and percentage of days that participants received IP, the highest percentage of the 
maximum allowable daily dose (63 mg/kg or 1800 mg ) that participants received, and the total 
amount of IP received will be summarized.  
A participant data listing will be provided with full details of the IP dispensation. 
Safety assessments include:  
• AEs.  
• Clinical laboratory tests.  
• Vital signs including BP, HR, RR, body temperature, height, and weight. 
• 12-lead ECG. 
• Physical, neurological, and de velopmental examinations. 
• Concomitant ASM levels (if collected as part of standard of care by the study site).  
• C-SSRS.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 100 of 175 9.3.7 Subgroup Analyses 
The following subgroup summarizations of the primary efficacy parameter are planned as 
outlined in the SAP:  
• Gender (Female vs Male). 
• Age groups (12 months to 23 months; 2 to 11 years; 12 to 17 years; 18 to 64 years; and 
65 years). 
9.4 Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 200 participants with TSC will be screened with the aim of randomizing 
approximately 128 participants into 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio.  
Testing of treatment effect (the actual analys is will use a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which has 
approximately the same power as the Analysis of Variance [ANOVA]) for GNX vs placebo will be performed using a 5% 2-sided alpha level. A total of 64 participants per group provides at 
least 90% power for the primary endpoint assuming an estimate of the treatment effect difference 
that is at least 25% and a common standard deviation of 43% or less.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 102 of 175 10.1.3  Informed Consent Process 
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study, including the risks and benefits, to the participant/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and answer all questions regarding the study. 
Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants/parent(s)/LAR(s) 
will be required to sign a statement of informed consent/assent that meets the requirements of 
21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, priv acy, and data protection requirements, where 
applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center. 
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before 
the participant was enrolled in the study and th e date the written consent was obtained. The 
authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. 
Participants/parent(s)/LAR(s) must be reconsented to the most current version of the ICF(s) 
during their participation in the study. 
Minor participants must be re-consented if they re ach the age of majority during the course of the 
study, in order to continue pa rticipating. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the 
participant/parent(s) or LAR(s). 
If a participant is rescreened, that participant/parent(s)/LAR(s) is required to sign a new ICF. 
10.1.4  Data Collection 
During each participant’s visit to the clinic, a clinician participating in the trial will record 
progress notes to document all significant observations. At a minimum, these notes will contain:  
• Documentation of the informed consent process, including any revisions. 
• The date of the visit and the corresponding visit or day in the trial schedule. 
• General participant status remarks, including any significant medical findings. The severity, 
frequency, duration, action taken,  and outcome of any AEs and the investigators assessment 
of relationship to the IP must also be recorded. 
• Any changes in concomitant mediations and dosages. 
• A general reference to the procedures completed. 
• The signature (or initials or other unique identifier) and date of each clinician (or designee) 
who made an entry in the progress notes. 
In addition, any contact with the participant/par ent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) via telephone or other 
means that provides significant clinical inform ation also will be documented in the progress 
notes as described above. Any changes to informat ion in the trial progress notes and other source 
documents will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a site staff member 
authorized to make the change . Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous 
data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly entering the correct data (eg, wrong

CONFIDENTIAL Page 103 of 175 data right data). If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change 
will be written in the source documentation by the clinician. 
Information from the trial progress notes and other source documents will be data entered by 
investigative site personnel dir ectly onto eCRFs in the sponsors electronic data capture system. 
10.1.5  Data Protection 
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. 
The participant/parent(s)/LAR(s) must be inform ed that the participant’s personal study-related 
data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of 
disclosure must also be explained to the particip ant who will be required to give consent for their 
data to be used as described in the informed consent. The participant/parent(s)/LAR(s) must be informed that the participant’s medical records may be 
examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the 
sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
10.1.6  Data Monitoring Committee Structure and Function 
The DMC will review emerging study data on a periodic basis. The DMC is a group of 
independent scientists who are appointed to monitor the safety and scientific integrity of a human 
research intervention, and to make recommendations to the sponsor regarding the stopping of a 
study for safety concerns. The composition of the committee is dependent upon the scientific 
skills and knowledge required for monitoring the particular study.  
The mission of the DMC will be to safeguard the interests of study participants and to enhance 
the integrity and credibility of the trial. To enable the DMC to achieve their mission, the DMC 
will have periodic access to unblinde d safety data and data regard ing quality of trial conduct and 
will ensure the confidentiality of these data will be preserved. A DMC Charter will provide the 
principles and guidelines for the DMC process. 
10.1.7  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data 
The sponsor will register and/or disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as 
required by local laws and regulations. 
10.1.8  Data Quality Assurance 
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or eCRFs unless transmitted 
to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, labor atory data). The investigator is responsible for 
verifying that data entries are accurate and co rrect by physically or electronically signing the 
case report form (CRF).

Protocol Date and Version: 12 Sep 2023; v 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 104 of 175 Guidance on completion of CRFs will be provided in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
The investigator’s authorized site personnel must enter the information required by the protocol 
on the eCRF. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the e CRF will be addressed by qualified site personnel. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site 
personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a participant is screened, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the e CRF entry within approximately 7 business days of the 
participant’s visit. 
The participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) must enter the information required by the 
protocol in the diary. A study monitor will revi ew all seizure eDiary entries in accordance with 
the monitoring plan for completeness and accu racy. Discrepancies w ill be addressed by the 
participants’ parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and qu alified site personnel. Wh en a data discrepancy 
warrants correction, the correction will be made by the participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and authorized site  personnel. Data collec tion procedures will be 
discussed with the site at the site initiation vis it and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) signs informed consent/assent, it is expected that all diary entries 
will be made daily a nd no longer than 48 hours after each day. 
The investigator must permit study-related mon itoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
Quality tolerance limit(s) (QTL[s]) will be predefined in the IB to identify systematic issues that 
can impact participant safety and/or reliability of  study results. These predefined parameters will 
be monitored during the study, and important de viations from the QTLs and remedial actions 
taken will be summarized in the CSR. Monitoring details describing strategy, including definition of study critical data items and 
processes (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and 
mitigation strategies and analytical risk-bas ed monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and 
requirements, including handling of noncomplianc e issues and monitoring techniques (central, 
remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan. 
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of th is study, including quality 
checking of the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions dele gated to other individuals (eg, contract 
research organizations). Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO data management plan. 
Quality control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy 
of the clinical database.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 105 of 175 Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queri es requiring clarification will 
be communicated to the site for resolution. Only  authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections w ill be documented in an auditable manner. 
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pert aining to the conduct of this study must be 
retained by the investigator for a minimum of 2 years after the Sponsor’s receipt of final 
approval of a marketing applicati on for the drug; or, if an application is not approved for the 
drug, until 2 years after the shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been notified. No records may be destroyed during the retention 
period without the written approval of the sponsor . No records may be transferred to another 
location or party without written notification to the sponsor. 
Telephone follow-up visits are allowed to be cond ucted via secure email per institutional policy 
if granted by individual sites IRB/IEC. 
10.1.9  Source Documents 
Source documents provide evidence for the existe nce of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the e CRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
investigator may need to request previous medical  records or transfer records, depending on the 
study. Also, current medical records must be available. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF. 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data veri fication to confirm that data entered into 
the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of particip ants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the curren tly approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.1.10  Study and Site Start and Closure 
10.1.10.1 First Act of Recruitment 
The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of 
participants.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 106 of 175 10.1.10.2 Study/Site Termination 
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. The decision to terminate a study may 
be for administrative or safety reasons. A decision to terminate for safety reasons may be driven 
by any data collected on the IP which negativel y influences the risk/benefit assessment. Study 
sites will be closed upon study completion. A study s ite is considered closed when all required 
documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been 
performed. 
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in a dvance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to:  
For study termination:  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development. 
For site termination:  • Failure of the investigator to comply with th e protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of participants by 
the investigator. Total number of participants included earlier than expected. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory author ities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall pr omptly inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant th erapy and/or follow-up. 
10.1.11  Publication Policy 
The results of this study may be published or presente d at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission. 
This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. 
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agr eement and in line with International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 of 175 10.1.12  Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood including PK samples collected according to the SOA ( Section 10.3 ) can be analyzed 
for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study 
participants. This includes testing to ensure an alytical methods produce reliable and valid data 
throughout the course of the study. This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of 
unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and 
comparability. 
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis 
or storage. Samples will be tracked using a unique  identifier that is assigned to the samples for 
the study. Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.  
Samples can be retained for up to 1 year after the final study closure (defined as final CSR). 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the participant directly or to alter the treatment 
course, the results of pharmacogenetic, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the 
participant’s medical record and are not to be ma de available to the participant, members of the 
family, the personal physician, or ot her third parties, except as specified in the informed consent. 
The participant retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting 
the investigator. Following the request from the pa rticipant, the investigator is to provide the 
sponsor with the required study and participant number so that any remaining (sample types [eg, blood, tumor]) samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed. However, information collected from samples prior to the re quest for destruction, will be retained by the 
sponsor. 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data , discoveries, or derivative materials from the 
sample materials and is responsib le for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the 
participant through the investigator, at the end of  the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the 
scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample  type no longer justifies keeping the 
sample). If a commercial product is  developed from this research project, the sponsor owns the 
commercial product. The particip ant has no commercial rights to such product and has no 
commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or 
produced from the sample. (See Section 10.1.4  for participant confidentiality).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 111 of 175 10.4 Appendix 4: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting 
10.4.1  Definition of AE 
AE Definition 
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product; it does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (inves tigational) product, whet her or not related to 
the medicinal (inves tigational) product ( International Council for Harmonisation Guidance 
E2A March 1995 ). 
Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE 
• An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not solicited using a participant diary and that is communicated by a participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s )/LAR(s) after signing 
the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs include serious and nonserious AEs. 
• Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (ie, symptoms or illnesses requiring a hospitalization, emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare provider). The participants/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s )/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the 
site as soon as possible to report medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not medically attended, ar e of participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver/LAR)(s) 
concern. Detailed information about reporte d unsolicited AEs will be collected by 
qualified site personnel a nd documented in the participant’s records. 
• Unsolicited AEs that are not medically a ttended nor perceived as a concern by the 
participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) will be collected during an 
interview with the participant/participant’s parent(s)/caregiver/LAR(s) and by review of available medical records at the next visit. 
• Solicited AEs are predefined local and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant in their diary.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 112 of 175 Events Meeting the AE Definition 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology,  clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, 12-lead ECGs , vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New condition detected or diagnosed after st udy intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention-intervention interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
• Lack of efficacy or failure of expected pharmacological action per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, 
the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Lack of efficacy 
or failure of expected pharmacological action also constitutes an AE or SAE. 
 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laborat ory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being st udied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy,  appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 113 of 175 10.4.2  Definition of SAE 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or 
more of the criteria listed: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life threatening 
The term life threatening  in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization 
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at th e hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• The term disability means a substantial disr uption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
f. Is a suspected transmission of any infect ious agent via an authorized medicinal 
product 
g. Other situations: 
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in deciding whether 
SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as significant medical events that may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious. 
o Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, c onvulsions or development of intervention 
dependency or intervention abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 114 of 175 AE and SAE Recording 
• The monitoring period for AEs begins at the time that informed consent is obtained. 
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, la boratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information. 
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to IRB/IEC in lieu of completion of the required form. 
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
IRB/IEC. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copies of  the medical records before submission to 
IRB/IEC. 
• The investigator will attempt to establis h a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
• Every reasonable effect will be made to follow up with participants who have AEs. Any 
participant who has an ongoing AE at the la st study visit will be followed up, where 
possible, until resolution, or until the unresolved AE is judged by the investigator (or 
designee) to have stabilized. This will be completed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Assessment of Intensity 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Moderate: Minimal, local or noninvasive in tervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living  (ADL). Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, 
shopping for groceries or clothes, usi ng the telephone, managing money, etc. 
• Severe: Severe or medica lly significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitaliza tion indicated; disabling, limiting self-care 
ADL. Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medicati ons, and not bedridden.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 115 of 175 Assessment of Causality 
• The investigator is obligated to assess th e relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator wi ll use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. 
• The investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the study 
intervention using a 2-category system according to the following guidelines:  
o Not Related: The AE is definitely or most likely caused by the participant’s clinical 
state or the study procedure/conditions.  
o Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause-
effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced. 
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that th ere are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying diseas e(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment. 
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE ha s occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to IRB/IEC. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to IRB/IEC. 
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 116 of 175 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by IRB/IEC to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other h ealth care professionals. 
• If a participant dies during participation in  the study or during a recognized follow-up 
period, the investigator will provide IRB/IEC with a copy of any postmortem findings 
including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded  in the originally submitted documents. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
 
10.4.4  Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to IRB/IEC via Paper Data Collection Tool 
• Facsimile or email transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool are the preferred methods to transmit this information to the Pharmacovigilance Team/Vendor. 
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of available equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service . 
• Initial notification via telephone  does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE data collecti on tool within the designated reporting 
timeframes. 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  Section 10.2  and the Study Operations

CONFIDENTIAL Page 117 of 175 10.5 Appendix 5: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance 
10.5.1  Female Contraception 
WOCBP must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control and have a negative 
quantitative serum β-HCG test collected at the initial screening visit and baseline visits. WOCBP 
must be advised to use medically acceptable bi rth control throughout the study period and for 
30 days after the last dose of IP. These include intrauterine devices (that have been in place for at 
least 1 month prior to the screening visit), hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral 
contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants), and surgical sterilization (such as 
oophorectomy or tubal ligation). When used consis tently and correctly, “double barrier” methods 
of contraception can be used as an effective al ternative to highly effective contraception methods 
(see Section 10.5.3  for “double-barrier methods). Contraceptive measures such as Plan BTM, sold 
for emergency use after unprotected sex, ar e not acceptable methods for routine use.  
10.5.2  Male Contraception 
Male participants must agree to use highly e ffective contraceptive methods during the study and 
for 30 days after the last dose of IP. Highly e ffective methods of contraception include surgical 
sterilization (such as a vasectomy) and adequa te “double-barrier” methods as described in 
Section 10.5.3 . Male participants should not donate sperm during the study and for 30 days after 
the last dose of IP.  
10.5.3  Acceptable Barrier Methods of Contraception 
“Double-barrier” methods of contraception include  male condom with di aphragm, or male 
condom with cervical cap.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 137 of 175 10.12.2  Sleep Quality Scale 
 
Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) 85 
Purpose Consisting of 28 items, the SQS evalu-
ates six domains of sleep quality: daytime symp-
toms, restoration after sleep, problems initiating 
and maintaining sleep, difficulty waking, and 
sleep satisfaction. Developers hoped to create a 
scale that could be used as an all-inclusive assess-
ment tool -a general, efficient measure suitable 
for evaluating sleep quality in a variety of patient 
and research populations. 
Population for Testing The scale has been vali-
dated in individuals aged 18-59 years. 
Administration Requiring between 5 and 10 min 
for administration, the scale is a simple self-report, 
pencil-and-paper measure. 
Reliability and Validity An initial psychometric 
evaluation conducted by Yi and colleagues [l] 
found an internal consistency of .92, a test-retest 
reliability of .81. The SQS is strongly correlated 
with results obtained on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (Chap. 67). Scores achieved by the insomnia 
sample were significantl y higher than those of con-
trols, indicating good construct validity. Obtaining a Copy A list of the scale's 28 items 
can be found in the original article published by 
developer s [1].

Scoring Using a four-point, Likert-type scale, 
respondents indicate how frequently they exhibit 
certain sleep behaviors (0 = "few," 1 ="some-
times," 2 = "often," and 3 = "almost always"). 
Scores on items belong to factors 2 and 5 (resto-

QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE 
ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS 
1. These questions ask about how your child has been in the last four 
weeks. We are interested in how much your child's daily life and 
activities have been affected by his/her epilepsy and its treatment. Serial No. 1-3 
2. We are interested in your views about how things have been for your 
child. Your opinions are very important to us, and we hope you will take 
time to complete the questionnaire. We do not think it will take more 
than 15-20 minutes for you to do so. 
3. Some people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure. If your 
child experiences different types of seizures, please answer the 
questions as they apply to the most severe seizures, in your opinion, 
that he/she has. 
4. Most of the questions can be answered simply by ringing a number next 
to the answer that applies to your child. Sometimes you are asked to 
write in a number. 
5. We want to know how things have been in the lastfour weeks. If you 
cannot remember, do not know, or are unable to answer a particular 
question, please write that in. 
6. Your name and address do not appear anywhere in this booklet. The 
information you give us will be treated as strictly confidential.

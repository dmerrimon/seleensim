BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICAN CE 19 
 20 
Physiologic insulin replacement for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, or  intensive insulin 21 
therapy, is administered either by multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or via continuous 22 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via insulin pump.  Since its inception in the 1970’s, CSII has 23 
improved continuously in terms of both the devices and the rapid acting  insulin analogues they 24 
deliver so that today’s insulin pumps are considered the “gol d standard” of intensive insulin 25 
therapy.  However,  CSII has  only  shown advantages over MDI regimens which used older  basal 26 
insulin products including intermediate -acting insulin (NPH) and first generation ins ulin 27 
analogues (glargine and detemir) in cluding  reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia, improving 28 
overall glycemic control and  improving gly cemic variability  (1,2) .  CSII  also has advantages in 29 
terms of patient conv enience and comfort by  eliminating the need for multiple daily insulin 30 
injections, portab ility of insulin, and the use of computerized bolus calculators to assist with 31 
bolus calculations. However, patients treated with CSII continue to show  significant glycemic 32 
variability owing to  different absorption characteristics of insulin infused subcut aneously at 33 
different body si tes and due to the  inherent  variability of absorption of  rapid -acting insulin 34 
analogues even when infused continuously in sub -unit quantities for basal insulin delivery by 35 
modern insulin pumps.   36 
Insulin degludec is a new ultra long -acting insulin analogue with a unique mechanism of 37 
protraction giving it a flat, peakless p harmacodynamic profile with a coefficient of variation of 38 
the glucose infusion rate  of appr oximately 25% that of insulin glargine  in glucose clamp studies 39 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  2 
 and a half -life of 25  hours  (3).  Insulin degludec has  also been shown to have a reduced 40 
incidence of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine in a head -to head clinical trial in 41 
patients with type 1 diabetes. (4).  Whether insuli n degludec might  provide equivalent  basal 42 
insulin coverage  with a flatter 24 hour glycemic profile  compared to CSII using a rapid -acting 43 
insulin analogue  is currently not known  as these have not been compared in a clinical trial.  Part 44 
of the reason for th is is because patients using CSII use a pump for both the basal and bolus 45 
component of their insulin regimen; currently, no “bolus only” insulin delivery device exists.  46 
Also, there was no compelling reason until now to study a hybrid model for basal/bolus  insulin 47 
regimens since there was no true 24 hour basal insulin product which had any therapeutic 48 
advantage over basal insulin delivered by CSII.   Furthermore, it is now recognized that the use 49 
of insulin infusion sets of various design in CSII lead to inc reased glucose variability by virtue of 50 
local inflammation and micro -occlusions of the sets, which interfere with consistent insulin 51 
basal delivery (5).   Insulin degludec, however, appears in clinical use to possibly have a flatter 52 
glycemic profile than CS II can provide, with  equivalent or even  lower glycemic variability and 53 
less hypoglycemia.  If so, patients with type 1 diabetes may achieve better overall glycemic 54 
control with, and therefore prefer , a daily injection of insulin degludec for their basal in sulin 55 
needs in combination with their pump (with its bolus calculator) for their bolus insulin needs.   56 
The purpose of this investigator -initiated trial is to compare the effect of a daily injection of 57 
insulin degludec vs. basal insulin delivery via CSII, both in combination with bolus insulin 58 
delivery via the patient’s usual insulin pump with insulin aspart, on glycemic variability, overall 59 
blood glucose control and incidence of hypoglycemia, all assessed by continuous glucose 60 
monitor (CGM), as well as pat ient satisfaction, in patients with type 1 diabetes currently using 61 
CSII.  62 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  63 
The primary  objective of this trial is to determine whether insulin degludec will provide  an 64 
equally  stab le and consistent basal glycemic profile  with lower glycemic va riability  as 65 
determined by CGM compared to insulin aspart delivered by CSII in patients with type 1  66 
diabetes experienced in use of insulin pump therapy.  Specifically, this study will determine if 67 
the percent time in the target glycemic range (70 to 180 mg/dl) by CGM is superior using insulin 68 
degludec than continuously infused insulin aspart, and if deg ludec is associated with lower GV 69 
as assessed by the standard deviation (SD) of the mean daily glucose by CGM.  P articular 70 
attention will be given to the nocturnal glucose profile  (from midnight to 6 am) which most 71 
closely reflects basal insulin action as it is typically the time of day least affected by bolus 72 
insulin, food intake or exercise.  Quality of life questionnaires regarding treatment preference 73 
will be used to capture patient preference for method of basal insulin delivery.  74 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND MET HODS  75 
Study hypothesis   76 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  3 
 It is anticipated, based on the low glycemic variability of insulin degludec shown in glucose 77 
clamp studies and seen in clinical practice, that insulin degludec will provide more stable 24 78 
hour basal insulin action than insulin aspar t by CSII i n patients with type 1 diabetes.  79 
OUTCOME MEASURES/SPECIFIC ENDPOINTS  80 
 81 
Primary endpoint   82 
Percent time in euglycemia (BG 70  to 180 mg/dl) by CGM during the final 14 days of each 83 
treatment period during steady state  (with basal insulin delivery as either one daily injection of 84 
insulin degludec or as insulin aspart via CSII).  85 
 86 
Key secondary endpoints  87 
 88 
1. SD of interstitial fluid glucose  by CGM for 2 week period during each basal insulin 89 
delivery method . (Note: because the Dexcom Platinum G5 CGM is currently only FDA 90 
approved for 7 days of use, two contiguous CGM periods using 2 sensors, each for 7 91 
days, will be performed to capture 2 weeks of continuous CGM data.)  Dexcom G6 is 92 
approved by FDA for 10 days of use so 2 sensor s will be used durin g the CGM periods.  93 
2. SD of blood glucose by CGM during the nocturnal period (midnight to 6 am) during each 94 
basal insulin delivery method  95 
 96 
Other secondary endpoints  97 
1. Percent time in hypoglycemia by CGM , captured at  2 levels of hypoglycemia: B G < 54 98 
mg/dl (level 2) and BG  55-69 mg/dl  (level 1) , for each basal insulin treatment.  99 
2. Percent time in normo glycemia ( BG 70  to 140 mg/dl) by CGM during each basal 100 
treatment period.  101 
3. Time to recovery  from level 2 hypoglycemia  (BG >70 with resolution of symptoms) on 102 
each treatment.  If a second event (BG < 70 mg/dl) occurs within 60 minutes of a 103 
previous hypoglycemic event, this w ill be considered part of the same hypoglycemic 104 
episode.  105 
4. Patient satisfaction by TRIM -D and TRIM -DD questionnaire s with each basal insulin 106 
treatment.   107 
5. HbA1c after 20  weeks  of each basal insulin treatment.  108 
6. Total daily insulin dose, total basal insulin dose, and total bolus insulin dose on each 109 
treatment.  110 
 111 
See Table 1:   Study Visit Table for study procedures at each visit and when specific endpoints 112 
will be measured.  113 
STUDY TYPE  114 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  4 
 This will be a randomized, cross -over , open label, single -center  stud y consisting of a 20  week 115 
period on each of two basal insulin delivery methods, both in combination with insulin aspart 116 
with boluses taken by insulin pump. Each 20 week period will consist of a 4 week insulin 117 
optimization period for titration of basal and bolus insulin doses, followed by a 16 week 118 
maintenance period.  The final 2 weeks of the maintenance period  during each treatment arm  119 
will be used for endpoint data collection.   The treatment sequence will occur in random order.  120 
The study population will include patients with type 1 diabetes with good baseline glycemic 121 
control who are experienced in the use of both CSII and CGM; the cross -over design allows each 122 
subject to serve as his or her own control.  123 
STUDY POPULATION   124 
In order to confirm a 10% improvement in the time spent in euglycemia by CGM with 85% 125 
power, 47 subjects will be studied.  Thus, between 55 and 60 subjects will be screened to allow 126 
for a 10% drop -out rate. (See “Statistical Analysis Plan” for sample size calculation.)  127

to 3 days.  142 
7. No serious comorbidities including: retinopathy requiring active intervention, eGFR < 30, CV 143 
event within the previous 6 months, active malignancy with ongoing treatment, any condition 144 
requiring chronic  use of systemic glucocorticoids , or any other condition which in the opinion of 145 
the investigator would interfere with the subject’s ability to comply with the study protocol or 146 
acutely affect insulin requirements.  147

 184 
RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY POPU LATION  185 
 186 
A population of well controlled patients with type 1 diabetes who are experienced in the use of 187 
both CSII and CGM was chosen in order to assess the effect of the change in glycemic profile 188 
using two different methods of basal insulin delivery.  Stu dying a population with expertise in 189 
diabetes  self-management with these devices will minimize the effect of incorrect device use 190 
and allow assessment of the effect of the change of insulin  regimen  itself.  Allowing the subjects 191 
to use their insulin pumps for bolus insulin delivery, as they are accustomed, will minimize the 192 
chances of skipping meal boluses and correction doses.   193 
 194 
Replacing basal insulin delivery by CSII with a single daily injection of degludec will add minimal, 195 
if any, treatment burden which will be offset by potential therapeutic benefits.  These benefits 196 
include the potential for reduced glycemic variability and  the elimination of the risk of 197 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  6 
 hyperglycemia and DKA with basal insulin interruption which can occur with infusion set 198 
occlusion or dislodge ment inherent to CSII.  Subjects may also enjoy the freedom afforded by a 199 
basal insulin injection which will allow t hem to disconnect from their pumps safely  without 200 
sacrificing glycemic control  for prolonged periods of time ( which is not an option  using CSII for 201 
basal insulin delivery).  202 
 203

VISIT PROCEDURES  205 
 206 
Please see pages 16 -18 for “Visit Procedures”, which describes a detailed list of procedures and 207 
assessments at each visit, and  page 19  for the  “Study Flow Sheet”, which summarizes study - 208 
related procedures at each visit in spreadsheet format.  209 
 210 
ASSESSMENTS OF EFFICACY  211 
 212 
Primary endpoint   213 
Percent time spent in euglycemia by CGM: data will be downloaded from the Dexcom G5 or G6 214 
(either by download of receiver or from Dexcom Clarity cloud -based application); this will yield  215 
the percent time in euglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and SD for  endpoint analy ses. 216 
 217 
Other endpoints  218 
1. HbA1c: This will be measured by central laboratory (LabCorp, Burlington, NC). 2. GlycoMark 219 
(1,5 anhydroglucitol) will be measured by commercial assay (LabCorp, Burlington, NC).   All 220 
laboratory specimens will be drawn  and processed by site staff and shipped under required 221 
conditions to LabCorp by courier with pick -up daily.  GlycoMark is a marker of glycemic 222 
variability which essentially reflects postprandial glucose control.  It will be captured as a safety 223 
measure to  ensure that change of method of basal insulin delivery does not impact 224 
postprandial glucose control in any way, since patients us ing CSII may on occasion  have 225 
increased postmeal basal insulin  infusion  rates ( to compensate for inadequate mealtime insulin 226 
dosing)  which cannot be reproduced in the degludec treatment arm.  227 
 228 
ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY:  229 
 230 
Hypoglycemia will be captured by fingerstick BG and by CGM. All episodes of severe 231 
hypoglycemia (requiring assistance) will be documented and reported as AE’s  in diaries .  232 
Categories of hypoglycemia that will be captured include: pe rcent time in two categories of 233 
hypoglycemia ( BG < 54 mg dl and 55 -69 mg/dl) by CGM, episodes of symptomatic BG -confirmed 234 
hypoglycemia (<54  mg/dl), nocturnal hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia.  In the event 235 
where the SMBG and the CGM readings are discordant, the SMBG will be considered the 236 
primary source.  237 
 238 
Time to r ecovery from hypoglycemia , defined as BG > 70 with resolution of symptoms,  during 239 
each treatment will  also be captured.  240 
 241 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  7 
 OTHER ASSESSMENT S 242 
 243 
Patient satisfaction with each study treatment will be assessed by TRIM -D and TRIM -DD 244 
questionnaires.   245 
 246 
ASSESSMENT OF SUBJECT COMPLIANCE  247 
 248 
Compliance of study subjects with use of CSII and CGM will be assesse d by review of device 249 
downloads  which capture percent time devices are used, set changes, boluses and 250 
carbohydrate intake.  Since subjects will be using their insulin pumps to bolus, all bolus insulin 251 
doses and carbohydrate intake will be captured in both treatment arms by revi ew of insulin 252 
pump downloads at each study visit.  253 
 254 
Compliance with admi nistration of basal insulin  during the degludec treatmen t arm will be 255 
assessed by documentation of insulin doses and times in subject diaries.  Number of missed 256 
injections will be captur ed during the degludec treatment arm; num ber of infusion set changes, 257 
set occlusions , and missed boluses will be captured during both  treatment arm s. 258 
 259 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  260 
 261 
Sample Size Determination  262 
The subjects in a recent study (4) should closely reflect the population we are going to study. 263 
Using the statistics from that source as an estimate of population parameters, power analyses 264 
were done for: (1) percent time in euglycemia (BG 70 to 180 mg/dl),  desired effect size 0.4, (2) 265 
SD o f BG by CGM, desired effect size 0.44, and (3) HbA1c,  desired effect size 0.44. The repeated 266 
independent variable is degludec vs CSII. These a priori analyses – using G*Power, version 267 
3.1.9.2 http://www.gpow er.hhu.de/en.html  – assumed a Type I error of .05 and a power of .85 268 
(Type II error of .15).  269 
 270 
The sample size estimate required for percent time  in euglycemia was the largest at  n = 47. 271 
Allowing for a 10% dropout rate a final sample size of 53 will be sou ght – more if possible.  272 
 273 
Statistical Methods  274 
 275 
Ho: For Type 1 DM subjects using degludec vs CSII, there is no difference between mean 276 
percent time in euglycemia, mean SD of BG by CGM, or mean HbA1c.  277 
 278 
Ha: For Type 1 DM patients using degludec vs CSII, there  will be mean differences between 279 
percent time in euglycemia, SD of BG by CGM, and HbA1c. (No one tailed tests are planned.)  280 
 281 
Dependent Variable  282 
One group of patients will first use degludec  for 20 weeks then switch to CSII for 20 weeks. As 283 
all eligible pa tients who sign the IRB consent form are identified, a random number will  be 284 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  8 
 generated to determine the treatment with which they begin first. The other group of patients 285 
will start with CSII and after 2 0 weeks switch to Tresiba for 20 weeks. Randomization sequence 286 
will be determined by computerized randomization program.  All patients will receive both 287 
treatments unless they drop out. Dropouts are unlikely since the participants are all regular 288 
continuing patients of the site’s clinical practi ce. 289 
 290 
Since each patient will be measured twice - insulin degludec vs CSII by pump – this repeated 291 
measure will be the dependent variable . 292 
Since study participants are a ll ongoing patients of the three  physicians at the site, there should 293 
be no missing data , per -protocol, or intention -to-treat issues. Only patients who complete the 294 
entire 46-week study will be used in the final analysis.  295 
 296 
No continuous or ratio variables will be categorized.  297 
 298 
No interim analysis will be performed.  299 
 300 
Control/covariate variable s 301 
These will be  recorded at the beginning of the study to help reduce error variance in the 302 
dependent measures:  303 
1) Time elapsed since diagnosis of Type 1 DM (ratio variable)  304 
2) Age (ratio variable)  305 
3) Physician attending each patient – there are 3 physicians (nominal).  306 
4) Whether each patient started with CSII by pump or insulin degludec (nominal)  307 
5) Race of patient (if there is any variability; unlikely) (nominal).  308 
 309 
Statistical Analysis  310 
Statistical analyses  will be performed using STATA version 15.0, revision 25, released 311 
September 2017.  (www.stata.com ) 312 
Since all the dependent variables are interval and the independent and control/covariate 313 
variables are a mixture of ratio and nominal, a General Linea r Model for Repeated Measures 314 
analysis can be used. Depending on the final sample sizes a hierarchical stepwise analysis could 315 
be performed to identify the more useful control/covariate variables.  316 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  317 
The study data (CGM data a nd laboratory endpoints including HbA1c and Gl ycoMark) will be 318 
uploaded  and stored in the cloud in HIPAA -compliant electronic files.  Pertinent data for 319 
endpoint safety and efficacy analyses will be entered into and electronically filed in password - 320 
protected Excel spreadsheets.  Hypoglycemia diaries will be on paper and store d as source 321 
documents along with paper CRF’s capturing study -related procedures (history, physical exam, 322 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  9 
 vital signs, con meds, AE’s) at each visit.  Patients will complete TRIM -D and TRIM -DD 323 
questionnaires, and responses will be tabulated into Excel sprea dsheets for statistical analysis.  324 
All paper source documents and CRFs will be stored on site. All electronic data will be stored in 325 
the cloud in HIPAA -compliant electronic files . 326 
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  327

STORAGE AND DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY OF STUDY MEDICATION  371 
Study insulins will be received in temperature -controlled containers and the temperature of the 372 
medication  upon receipt  will be recorded.  Study insulins will be stored at the study site in 373 
refrigerators maintained between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius; the temperature  will be  monitored 374 
and recorded daily.  No trial medication will be dispensed to any individual not enrolled in  the 375 
study.   All medication used in the study will be recorded in the CRF at each study dispensing 376 
visit.  Subjects will be provided with sufficient stud y insulin for study completion.  377 
Subjects will be instructed not to refrigerate opened insulin degludec (Tresiba U100 & U200) 378 
and to store the product at room temperature.  Properly stored opened insulin degludec can be 379 
used for up to 8 weeks (7).  Subjects  may choose to refrigerate or not refrigerate an opened vial 380 
of insulin aspart ( Novolog ), maintaining the vial at a temperature of less than 86°F (30° C) for up 381 
to 4 weeks (8).  382 
AUXILIARY SUPPLY  383 
Study subjects will use their own insulin pumps and insulin pump supplies.  384 
Dexcom glucose sensors (6 per subject) will be purchased by the site and supplied to subjects 385 
for two weeks at 3 times (baseline and for the final two weeks of each treatment period).  386 
Subjects will use their own CGM receiver devices  which will be downloaded at appropriate 387 
study visits.  Site will have back up receivers to supply to subjects in case of loss or malfunction 388 
of subject’s own device (not likely).  Subjects will use their own sensors for each treatment 389 
period except for th e 3 two week period s of CGM data capture as described above.  390

 392 
RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  393 
This is an unblinded study as the two basal insulin delivery methods (degludec via injection vs. 394 
aspart via CSII) cannot be blinded. For a description of the randomization and treatment 395 
allocation, please refer to the Statistical Methods section above.  396 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS  397 
Definitions:  398 
Concomitant illness: any illness that is present at the start of the trial (at the f irst study visit).  399 
Concomitant medication: any medication other than the trial product(s) that is taken during the 400 
trial, including the screening and run -in periods.  401 
Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at trial entry ( at the first 402 
study visit). Any change s in concomitant medication will  be recorded at each visit.  403 
The information collected for each concomitant medication  will include  start date, stop date or 404 
continuing, and indication.  405 
For each concomitant illness, date of onset, date of resoluti on or continuing, will  be recorded.  406 
 407 
ADVERSE EVENTS  408 
 409 
Adverse events will be captured at each study visit and recorded on CRF’s.  Special AE and SAE 410 
reporting forms have been created to capture these events.  SAE’s will be reported within 24 411 
hours of discovery to appropriate local and federal authorities as w ell as to the IRB when 412 
appropriate.  The study site will comply with  all local legal, regulatory, and  IntegReview  IRB 413 
requirements.   414 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center, its investigators, and site staff will be responsible for 415 
reporting of all adverse events including serious adverse events (SAE), suspected unexpected 416 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) to the 417 
competent authority and independent ethics commi ttee/institutional review board  based upon 418 
fede ral regulations and local/IRB policies.  419 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center, its investigators, and site staff will report to Novo 420 
Nordisk all SAEs, SUSARs, and SADRs at the same time such events are reported to regulatory 421 
authorities or within 15 da ys from the site  becoming aware of such adverse events, whichever 422 
comes first.   423 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center, its investigators, and site staff will collect the 424 
following information at minimum for each of these events : 425 
1. Study name  426 
2. Patient ide ntification  427 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  12 
 3. Event (with appropriate diagnosis)  428 
4. Drug  429 
5. Reporter identification  430 
Also 6) Causality, and 7) Outcome might be repo rted, if appropriate.  431 
DEFINITIONS  432 
Adverse Event (AE):  433 
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or not 434 
related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related activity 435 
after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment  follow -up period as 436 
defined in the p rotocol.  This will also include any events related to the malfunction  of a 437 
medical device (i.e. an insulin pump or Dexcom CGM).  The following will not be recorded as 438 
AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  439 
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    440 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent  441 
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures   442 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  443 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant , 444 
i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or orga n toxicity and is of a severity  which 445 
requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more 446 
frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  447 
 448 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  449 
A serious AE is an event that  results in any of the following:  450 
• Death  451 
• A life -threatening* experience  452 
• In-patient ho spitaliz ation or prolongation of existing hospitalization  453 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  454 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  455 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threate ning*, or require  456 
  hospitaliz ation may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, 457 
they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 458 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  Suspici on of transmission of infectious agents 459 
must always be considered an SAE.  460 
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 461 
the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 462 
severe.  463 
 464 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Event (SUSAR):  465 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center will inform the appropriate regulatory authorities, the 466 
IRB, and Novo Nordisk of trial product -relate d SUSARs in accordance with reporting 467 
requirements and GCP guidelines.  468 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  13 
  469 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  470 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 471 
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the ev ent is 472 
suspected. The ADR will  be classified as serious  if it meets one or more of the seriousness 473 
criteria.  474 
 475 
Medical Events of Special Interest (MESI):  A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. wrong drug 476 
administration or wrong route of  administration) or (2) a suspected transmission of an 477 
infectious agent via the product  478 
 479 
Non -Serious Adverse Event:  480 
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil l the definition of an SAE.  481 
 482 
Severity Assessment Definitions:  483 
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  484 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  485 
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  486 
 487 
Relationship to stud y medication Assessment Definitions:   488 
• Probable: Good reason  and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  489 
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  490 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product  491 
 492 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  493 
 494 
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to 495 
the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed 496 
consent  497 
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 498 
This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial  499 
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     500 
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any A E recovered with 501 
sequelae will  be rated as an SAE  502 
• Not recovered  503 
• Fatal  504 
• Unknown  505 
 506 
Collec tion, Recording, Evaluating, and Reporting of Adverse Events  507 
 508 
All events meeting the def inition of an adverse event will  be collected, reported , and evaluated  509 
from the first trial -related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until 510 
the end of the post -treatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.  All adverse events 511 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  14 
 resulting from incorrect storage or usage of study product as per product labelling, if applicable, 512 
will be reported to the appropriate institutions  (7,8) .  The investigator will copy Novo Nordisk 513 
when expediting SAE information to health authorities and will report all SAEs related to Novo 514 
Nordisk products to the local Novo Nordisk affiliate safety department.  SAE submission to 515 
Novo Nordisk will be within 15  days from the investigator’s first awareness of the event.   516 
 517 
Follow -up of Adverse Events  518 
 519 
During and following a subject’s participation in this clinical trial, Mountain Diabetes and 520 
Endocrine Center, its investigators and site staff, will provide adequate medical care to the 521 
study subject for any study -related adverse events, including clinica lly significant laboratory 522 
values related to the study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of 523 
their insurance status.  524 
 525 
All adverse events classified as serious or severe or possibly/probably r elated to the trial 526 
product will  be followed until the subject has recovered and all queries have been resolved.  527 
For cases of chronic conditions , follow -up until the outcome category is “recovered” is not 528 
required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”.  529 
All other adverse events will  be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for 530 
chronic con ditions), or “recovered” or until the end of the post -treatment follow -up stated in 531 
the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been 532 
resolved.  533 
 534 
Pregnancy  535 
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the site and stud y physician immediately if they 536 
become pregnant.  537 
 538 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center, its investigators and site staff, will report to Novo 539 
Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the trial period. Reporting of pregnancy by the site  540 
will occur within the same timelines described above for reporting of Adverse Events.  541 
  542 
Pregnancy complications will be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a congenital 543 
anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious a dverse event.  544 
 545 
Precautions/  Insulin Over -dosage  546 
Study subjects will be prescribed glucagon kits and treatment of hypoglycemia will be reviewed 547 
with subjects upon enrolment into the study.  548 
 549 
LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  550 
During and following a subject’s part icipation in trial, Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine 551 
Center and the study physicians will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for 552 
any study -related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory value s related to 553 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  15 
 the study. T his medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 554 
status.  555 
 556 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center and its investigators will be responsible  for the 557 
conduct of the study an d agre e to defend, indemnify, and hold har mless Novo Nordisk, any of 558 
its parent companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, 559 
employees, agents, representatives, distributors, salespersons, customers, licensees, and 560 
end-users from and against any claim, suit, de mand, loss, damage, expense or liability 561 
imposed by any third party arising from or related to: (a) any breach of sponsor -investigator's 562 
obligations or representations; or (b) sponsor -investigator’s negligent or grossly negligent use 563 
or willful misuse of t he study drug, the results, or services derived therefrom.  This 564 
indemnification shall not apply in the event and to the extent that a court of competent 565 
jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter determines that such losses or liability arose as a 566 
result of  Novo Nordisk’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or material breach of its 567 
responsibilities.   568 
 569 
EVALUABILITY OF SUBJECTS  570 
Only the principal investigator  has the authority to exclude any subjects or data observation s 571 
after the initiation of the study, initial selection of subjects, and  beginning of data collection . 572 
Possible reasons for such actions might be (1) questionable validity or reliability of data 573 
collection or measurement techniques for a particular subject, (2) misrepresentation of initial 574 
selection criteria by a subject, or (3) changes in the health conditions of subjects that mig ht 575 
affect the reliability or validity of measurements or accuracy of data collection procedures. The 576 
reasons for any such action w ill be carefully documented by the princi pal investigator and kept 577 
on file for the actionable subject.  578 
 579 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY  580 
 581 
The study will only be discontinued prematurely in the unlikely event of an unforeseen safety 582 
concern arising from the study protocol.   583 
 584 
PUBLICATION PLAN  585 
 586 
Upon approval, the study will be registered with www. clinic altrials.gov.  587 
 588 
Upon study completion, the study results will be submitted in a manuscript to a peer -reviewed 589 
journal.  It is anticipated that the study results will be of sufficient interest  and importance  to 590 
be presented at one or more  national meetings, notably ADA, AACE and AADE .   591

APPENDIX: METHOD OF CONVERSION OF BASAL INSULIN BY CSII TO DEGLUDEC  604 
 605 
Upon randomization to insulin degludec, or upon crossover from CSII to insulin degludec, the 606 
first dose of insulin degludec will be administere d on day one and a 50% temporary basal 607 
reduction of the insulin pump for 24 hours will be activated.  After 24 hours , the insulin pump  608 
basal rate  will be  lowered to the lowest hourly infusion rate (0.025 units per hour or 0.05 units 609 
per hour for a total daily basal insulin dose of either 0.6 or 1.2 units per day) for the duration of 610 
the insulin degludec treatment arm, with the remainder of the basal insuli n dose administered 611 
as a single daily Tresiba injection.  612 
 613 
The 24 hour basal insulin dose by CSII will be converted to degludec on a unit -for-unit basis.  614 
This is because both degludec and CSII are roughly equivalent methods with high efficiency 615 
(bioavailab ility) for delivery of a basal insulin dose.  Although there are no head -to-head studies 616 
comparing basal insulin dose by CSII to degludec, c linical studies (and the experience  of the 617 
investigator) suggest  that the lowest basal insulin requirement for any g iven subject will be with 618 
either CSII or degludec compared to glargine, NPH or detemir.  619

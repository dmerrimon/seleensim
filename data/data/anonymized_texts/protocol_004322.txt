Screening  to Follow-up). 
Reference therapy, dosage, and mode of administration:  
None 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be taken for the measurement of PK parameters at the following time points in 
each part of the study : 
• Pre-dose; 30 min, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24  hours post-dose. 
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November  2021 8 Confidential  Sputum samples will be collected  first thing in the morning on Day 1  (pre-dose), and  spontaneous 
sputum samples may be collected  through 24 hours post -dosing as often as the patient can provide a 
sample. The exact time of the sputum collection will be documented for determination of PK 
parameters of lefamulin in sputum.  
Safety:  
Safety will be evaluated with the following assessments:  
• Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored and recorded throughout the 
study. 
• Clinical chemistry and hematology assessments will be performed at Screening , Day -1, and 
24 hours post-dose; laboratory assessments will be conducted  at Follow-up only if necessary.  
• Vital signs will be measured at Screening , pre-dose on Day 1, at 0.5 hours, 2 hours, and  24 hours 
post-dose; vital signs will be measured  at Follow-up only if necessa ry. 
• Electrocardiograms will be performed at Screening , pre-dose on Day 1, and at 0.5 and 2 hours 
post-dose; ECGs will be performed  at Follow-up only if necessary.  
• Physical examination will be performed at Screening , Day -1 and at 24  hours post-dose; physical 
examinations will be performed  at Follow-up only if necessary.  
• Drugs of abuse and alcohol (breath test ) Screening  will be performed at Screening and Day -1. 
• After the first dosing period  of the study, a F ollow-up Visit will take place 4 to 7 days after the 
final dose of lefamulin. This visit will also serve as the Screening Visit for the second dosing 
period. After the second dosing period , a Follow-up phone call will take place 4 to 7 days after 
the final dose of lefamulin to ensure the ongoing we llbeing of the patients. If a patient reports any 
TEAEs which represent a cause for concern (as determined by the Investigator) he/she will be 
required to attend the clinic for a Follow-up assessment. This will be considered an unscheduled 
visit. 
Tolerability will be assessed by evaluation of the safety parameters and recorded adverse events .  
Statistical methods:  
Pharmacokinetics :  
Presentation of PK data will be descriptive in nature and will be presented by  treatment .  
Appropriate non -compartmental techniques will be used to obtain estimates, including but not limited 
to, the following PK parameters (defined in the protocol) in plasma for lefamulin and the metabolite 
BC-8041 in plasma when possible and appropriate:  
Tlag (oral dose only), T max, Cmax, AUC (0-last), AUC (0-24h), AUC (0-inf), AUC% extrap, lambda-z, t1/2, CL (IV 
dose only), CL/F (oral dose only), Vd (IV dose only), Vd/F (oral dose only), Vss (IV dose only), 
MRT, and (F).  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability will be as sessed by monitoring adverse events ( AEs) and concomitant 
medications, clinical chemistry and hematology laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG results, and 
physical examination findings. A complete description of the safety analysis variables will be 
presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

02 November 2021 17 Confidential  3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Cystic Fibrosis  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, autosomal recessive disease resulting from a mutation in a 
single gene on  chromosome 7 that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) protein  (Katkin, 2020 ). The CFTR gene  encodes for the CFTR protein , which 
is located in every mucus-producing organ of the body, including the lungs, liver, pancreas, and 
intestines, as well as sweat glands. Normally, the CFTR protein controls the movement of ions 
from inside the cell to outside the cell. In people with CF, the mutated gene causes the protein to 
not work properly, which, in turn, affects the movement of sodium and water. This causes thick, 
sticky mucus and blockages in the lungs and digestive system .  
Staphylococcus aureus  is one of the most common airway pathogen in patients with CF  
(Figure 1). Airway infections are associated with progressive lung  function decline and 
respiratory failure, which is the leading cause of mortality. Pulmonary exacerbations are 
aggressively managed with high health care utilization, requiring chronic treatment. Methicillin -
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is also associated w ith poor survival in CF patients. In patients with 
respiratory tract cultures positive for MRSA, median survival time is 6.2 years less than for 
patients with negative MRSA cultures. Therefore, MRSA infection may be a modifiable risk 
factor for death in pa tients with CF ( Figure 2).

While a number of anti -staphylococcal antibiotics are market ed, several major limitations exist 
regarding their utility in the management of bacterial exacerbations in patients with CF: 1)  no 
agent has been demonstrated to have an acceptable efficacy and safety profile to result in 
marketing authorization approval by  the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA), European 
Medicines Agency ( EMA), or other health authority for the treatment of exacerbations of CF 
caused by S. aureus; 2) the agents possessing appreciable activity against MRSA require 
parenteral administration; 3) agents such as trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole , clindamycin, 
doxy/minocycline, that can be administered orally do not possess consistent activity against 
MRSA and have significant safety and tolerability issues limiting their utility in CF patients.  
3.2. Lefa mulin  
XENLETA® (lefamulin; BC-3781), is a novel, semi -synthetic, first -in-class pleuromutilin 
antibiotic for systemic use in humans. Pleuromutilin derivatives inhibit bacterial protein 
synthesis by a novel interaction with the peptidyl transferase center ( PTC) in domain V of 23S 
ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) in the large ribosomal subunit. The unique binding site of the 
pleuromutilins in the highly conserved core of the ribosomal PTC confers a low propensity for 
the development of bacterial resistance, and a lack of cross -resistance with other antibiotic 
classes. A pleuromutilin has been approved for topical use in humans and oral pleuromutilins 
have been used in veterinary medicine for many years.  

Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 19 Confidential  In August 2019 , the United States (US) FDA approved lefamulin in the treatment of community -
acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults  18 years of age and older  caused by the 
following susceptible microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus  
(methicillin -susceptible isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae , and Chlamydophila pneumoniae  (Nabriva Therapeutics, Inc., 2021 ). 
While the number of patients in the CABP pivotal program with MRSA did not result in an 
indication statement that includes MRSA, lef amulin has been demonstrated to possess excellent 
activity against MRSA in in vitro and in vivo animal infection models. In addition, lefamulin was 
shown to have similar efficacy as compared with intravenous (IV) vancomycin in a Phase 2 
clinical study of t he treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in which 
approximately 69% of subjects had MRSA as the causative organism identif ied (Prince, 2013). 
For details on lefamulin nonclinical and clinical development programs, see the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.3. Study and Dose Rationale  
Study NAB-BC-3781-1014 (hereafter referred to as Study 1014) is designed to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) of a 600-mg immediate -release (IR) tablet and 150 -mg IV formulations 
of lefamulin in adult patients with CF.  
3.3.1.  Study Rationale  
Staphylococcus  aureus is one of the most common causative pathogens associated with 
exacerbations of CF ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 201 9). Current treatment guidelines for the 
management of exaccerbatio ns of CF caused by S. aureus recommend the use of unapproved 
antibactertial agents. Further, many of the recommended treatments can only be administered via 
the IV route and/or have limitations due to safety and tolerability. L efamulin is a novel, first -in-
class, IV and oral pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent that has been demonstrated to be highly 
potent against S. aureus, including MRSA and strains obtained from patients with CF ( Nabriva 
Therapeutics, Inc., 2021; Sader, 2021). Cystic fibrosis patients have  altered drug distribution and 
elimination kinetics for many antimicrobials relative to patients without CF. While the advent of 
CFTR modulaotrs has resulted in improved lung function and had a positive impact on the 
quality of life of CF patients, limited  data have been published describing the impact of the 
conomittnat use of CFTR modulaotrs and commonly used antibacterial agents ( Albright, 2020).  
This study is intended to assess the PK and safety of  a single dose of IV and oral formulations of 
lefamulin in adults with CF.  
3.3.2.  Dose Rationale  
For treatment  of adults with CABP, the recommended  dosage regimen of lefamulin is  as follows: 
• 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h)  by IV infusion over 60 minutes for 5  to 7 days, or  
• 150 mg q12h by IV infusion over  60 minutes then switch to 600  mg orally 
q12h (at  the discretion of  the physician) for 5  to 7 days total,  or 
• 600 mg orally q12h for 5  days. 
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 20 Confidential  In this study, single doses of IV and oral lefamulin will be studied in CF patients; PK data from 
this study will be sufficient to compare exposure in these patients to the known exposure in non -
CF patients. The single doses to be evaluated in adults will be those recommended for treatment 
of CABP, ie , 150 mg IV or 600 mg orally.  
3.4. Risk Assessment  
Patients participating in  this crossover study will receive lefamulin as a single 600 -mg IR tablet 
and a 150-mg IV infusion in a crossover fashion  for the purposes of PK and safety assessment . 
Consequently,  patients participating in the study will be unlikely to derive any clinica l benefit 
from exposure to lefamulin.  
In adult clinical studies conducted to date, lefamulin has been well tolerated when administered 
by the oral and IV routes (see Investigator’s Brochure, Section 5.2.1). Following oral dosing, 
gastrointestinal adverse events were most frequent (typically mild nausea, diarrhoea, or 
abdominal pain), without a clear correlation with dose level. Following IV dosing, the most 
frequently reported adverse events were administration site reactions. Analysis by dose showed 
that these events generally were more frequent at IV doses ≥  150 mg. Thus, this study is 
expected to pose low risk to  patients.  
To minimize potential risk to individuals in this study there are strict inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Potential patients will be carefully screened by laboratory evaluations, medical history, 
physical examination, and by electrocardiogram ( ECG) to exclude those  patients who could be at 
increased risk. Participating patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability during each part 
of the study  and through a Follow-up phone call  which will take place 4 to 7 days after the last 
dose of lefamulin  in the second dosing period of the study .

A schedule of study assessmen ts is provided in Table 1. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion  criteria may be enrolled in the study after the nature and purpose of the 
protocol has been explained and written informed consent /assent has been voluntarily given by 
the patient or his/her legal representative, when appropriate .  
Consent must be obtaine d before any screening procedures are performed and before study drug 
administration. All study assessments and procedures as specified in this protocol will be 
performed by the Investigator or a qualified designee.  
Patients will be screened within 30 days  before check-in to the CRU on Day -1. For patients who 
are screened ( ie, those with signed written informed consent) but not enrolled, the reason for 
screening failure will be documented.  If a patient is determined to be a screen failure, he/she can 
be rescreened once if the Investigator believes the patient will be eligible upon rescreening.  
8.1. Medical/Surgical History  
A medical and surgical history will be taken at Screening  and on Day  -1 of each Period . All 
medical history findings that have been present/a ctive within 1 year before enrollment will be 
entered into the eCRF regardless of clinical relevance or presence at study start. Medical history 
findings that have been present within the 5 years before enrollment will be recorded if deemed 
clinically rele vant by the Investigator to the conduct of the study.  The medical history should  
include drug allergy history.  
8.2. Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination  (except for rectal and vaginal examinations)  will be performed 
by the Investigator  at Screening  and upon check -in to the CRU on Day  -1. At the other time 
points specified in Table 1, focused physical examinations will be performed according  to 
standard institutional practices and must be documented in source documents. Clinically 
significant f indings, as determined by the Investigator,  will be documented in the eCRF as either 
medical history or adverse events.  
Body weight and height will be measured at Screening only.  
8.3. Vital Signs  
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body temperature, HR, 
respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation  measurements will be recorded at  the time points 
specified in Table 1.  
Vital signs will be measured after patients have rested for at least 5 minutes in a sitting position. 
The position adopted by an individual patient should be consistent throughout the study. On 
Day 1 of each dosing period , pre-dose vital signs will be measured within 2 hours before each  
dose. If a patient has an abnormal value for SBP, DBP , or HR, the measurement may be repeated 
twice. If the second repeat measurement value does not qualify the patient, he or she is not 
eligible for that  part of the  study but may be reevaluated at a later time. 
Vital signs measurements should be repeated if clinically significant changes or machine errors 
occur during the course of the study .

02 November 2021 30 Confidential  Sitting BP and/or HR (as applicable) will be measured more frequently if warranted by the 
clinical condition of the  patient. 
Vital signs will be measured using the same type of device throughout the study. Vital sign 
measurements will be recorded in the eCRF. Clinically relevant vital signs abnormalities meet ing 
the definition of an adverse event ( AE) must be recorded by the Investigator on the AE page of 
the eCRF.  
8.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests (Safety)  
Clinical chemistry and h ematology assessments will be performed at the time points specified in  
Table 1. All safety laboratory tests performed during the study (Screening through  Follow-up) 
will be analyzed at a local laboratory . Additional tests may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator if deemed clinically appropriate . A full list of the clinical laboratory tests that will be 
performed and analyzed can be found in Appendix  1. 
A serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at the 
Screening and Day -1 Visits for each dosing period . A confirmatory FSH level will be 
determined at Screening for females who are ≥  1 year post -menopausal. A FSH level 
> 40 mIU/mL indicates non -child bearing potential.   
Safety laboratory results outside the normal range will be evaluated by the Investigator as 
“clinically significant” or “not clinically significant.” Any clinically significant value that is not 
expected for this population should be repeated as necessary.  
If a patient has an abnormal laboratory value at check -in for either study period,  the laboratory 
test may be repeated . If after the repeat measurem ent the value does not qualify the  patient , the 
patient is not eligible for that part of the study. If the Investigator determines that the laboratory 
abnormality is likely to be transient and easily explained, the explanation will be documented 
and the patient may return once for re -evaluation  after an appropriate time interval determined by 
the Principal Inve stigator at the time of the disqualifying laboratory result availability . Only a 
single re-evaluation will be accepted.  
8.5. Electrocardiograms  
A 12-lead ECG will be performed at the time points specified  in Table 1 after the patient has 
been resting in a supine position for 10 minutes . The Day  1 pre-dose ECG must be reviewed by 
the Investigator or their designee before dosing to ensure that  there are no  clinically significant 
findings that would prevent dosing . Additional ECGs may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator or when clinically indicated.  
If a patient has an abnormal value ECG at Screening  for either of the parts of the study, the ECG 
may be repeated twice. If after the second repeat measurement the value does not qualify the 
patient, he or she is not eligible  for dosing. If the patient has prolongation of the QTc interval or 
any arrhythmia during the post -dose ECGs, no further lefamulin should be administered.

8.6.1.  Plasma Sample Collection  
Blood samples will be taken for the measurement of PK parameters at the following time points 
in each part of the study  (Table 1): 
• Pre-dose; 30 min, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h ours post-dose. 
For details on sample  collection,  preparation , and shipment, refer to the study -specific 
Laboratory Manual supplied by the Sponsor. It is recommended that the blood samples  are taken 
by a venipuncture  or from a separate catheter, other than the catheter used for the infusion , to 
prevent any contamination of the PK blood samples with lefamulin from the infusion line and 
catheter. 
Plasma samples will be analyzed for concentrations of lefamulin and its metabolite BC -8041 
using a validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method at the 
bioanalytical laboratory.   
The maximum total blood volume collected in the study for safety and PK evaluations is 36 mL 
per patient. 
8.6.2.  Sputum Sample Collection  
Spontaneous sputum samples will be collected first thing in the morning on Day 1 (pre -dose), 
and as many times as possible that the patient can provide a sample  until 24 hours after dosing  
for PK analysis of lefamulin. The exact time of sputum production will be recorded so th e post-
dose time can be determined precisely.  
Any spontaneous production of sputum during inpatient observation will also be collected and 
the time of collection documented.  
For details on sample collection, preparation , and shipment, refer to the study specific 
Laboratory Manual supplied by the Sponsor . 
Sputum samples will be analyzed for concentrations of lefamulin using a validated LC-MS/MS

CRU. 
8.9. Discontinuation from Study Medication  
Patients are free to withdraw from study medication at any time for any reason.  Patients may be 
withdrawn from study  medication  at the discretion of the Investigator at any time. If a  patient is 
discontinued from study  medication , the reason for discontinuation wi ll be collected in the 
eCRF. 
A patient will be discontinued prematurely from the study medication for any of the following 
reasons: 
• Patient request  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death 
• Physician decision ( ie, assessment that it is not in the patient’s best interest to 
continue, or other reason)  
• Sponsor decision  
• Positive drug/alcohol test  
• Failure to meet eligibility criteria either part of the study  
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from study  medication , the Investigator should obtain a 
PK sample if possible an d perform all procedures scheduled  for discharge from the unit. The 
patient will be contacted for  a Follow-up phone call 4 to 7 days from the time he/she is 
discharged from the unit  to ensure the ongoing wellbeing of the patient. If a patient reports any 
AEs which represent a cause for concern, he/she will be required to attend the clinic for a

Every reasonable attempt should be made to retain patients in the study. If a patient does not 
report to the study site for a  scheduled visit, study personnel will make 3 contact attempts: 
2 telephone contact attempts and, if these are unsuccessful, a certified letter will be sent to the  
patient. The patient will be considered lost to follow -up if: (1) upon receipt of delivery 
confirmation of the certified letter the  patient does not contact the site ; or (2) the certified letter is 
returned as undeliverable.  
9. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
9.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation  patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the use of a 
medicinal ( investigational ) product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. 
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 34 Confidential  Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient before the start of the 
study (ie, before infor med consent) should be recorded as medical/surgical history. Any medical 
occurrences that are new or worsened from the time of informed consent and up to and including 
the final visit must be reported as AEs. All AEs must be recorded regardless of causalit y. 
Patients will be monitored throughout the study for adverse reactions to the study medications 
and/or procedures at each study visit. Questions will be posed in a non -leading manner so as not 
to bias the response. In addition to questioning at specific time points, patients will be 
encouraged to spontaneously report any AEs. Any patient with an AE or clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory test result will be evaluated by the Investigator, or a monitoring physician, 
and will be treated and/or followed  until the symptoms or values have resolved or are assessed as 
stable by the Investigator. A physician, either at the investigative site or at a nearby hospital 
emergency room, will administer treatment for any serious adverse events ( SAEs). When 
appropria te, medical tests and examinations may be performed to ensure an AE has fully 
resolved. 
Adverse events will be collected throughout the study from the time a patient signs the informed  
consent through the Follow-up assessment  after the second dosing period . Whenever possible, a 
specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be 
identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an observed or reported 
sign or symptom is not considered a component of  a specific disease or syndrome by the 
Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  
The Investigator will evaluate and report the onset date/time, outcome and end date/time, 
severity (intensity), relationship to study drug, actions tak en with study drug, whether event 
caused study discontinuation, whether concomitant or additional treatment was given, and 
determination of seriousness for each AE.  
Laboratory abnormalities will not be considered AEs unless they are associated with clinica l 
signs and symptoms or require medical intervention. Clinically significant abnormal clinical 
laboratory findings, unless judged by the Investigator as more severe than expected for the 
patient’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will 
not be reported as AEs.  
The Investigator will exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
clinical laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
9.2. Assessment of Sever ity (Intensity)  
The following definitions for rating severity (intensity) will be used: 
• Mild: An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
• Moderate : An AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic interventio n. 
The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but the 
patient is still able to function . 
• Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 35 Confidential  9.3. Assessment of Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to explain each AE and determine its 
relationship, if any, to study drug treatment. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the 
event to the study drug will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult the 
Investigator’s Brochure in the determination of his/her ass essment. Causality should be assessed 
using the following categories:  
• Not related : The event could readily be explained by factors not involving the study 
drug and a temporal relationship with the study drug did not exist.  
• Possibly Related : There was some  temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the study drug and the event was unlikely to be explained by the  
patient’s medical condition or other therapies.  
• Probably Related : The temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the study drug was suggestive, and the event was less likely to be 
explained by the patient’s medical condition or other therapies.  
• Definitely Related : The event followed a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug, fo llowed a known or suspected response pattern to 
the study drug, was confirmed by improvement upon stopping the study drug 
(dechallenge) and reappeared upon repeated exposure (rechallenge). (N OTE: this is 
not to be construed as requiring re -exposure of the  patient, however , a category of 
definitely related could only be used when recurrence was observed.).  
9.4. Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life-threatening.  NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the  patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity.  
• Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
NOTE: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -
existing conditions, which have not worsened after entry into the  study, should not be classified 
as SAEs. For example, admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or 
previously scheduled surgery t hat meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Nabriva Therapeutics  
NAB-BC-3781-1014  Lefamulin  
02 November 2021 36 Confidential  NOTE: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the  patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  
These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant 
cancers, intensive treatment in an emerge ncy room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through completion of the Follow-up 
assessment after the second dosing period  must be reported to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC or 
their representative within 24  hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE 
that meets 1 or more of the aforementioned serious criteria). Reportin g is done by completing the 
SAE form electronically in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system or paper SAE report form, 
whichever is applicable. The EDC system and/or paper report forms should be completed in as 
much detail as possible but lack of comple te information should not delay the reporting of the 
SAE.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC, or their representative. 
However, it is very important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for 
every event prior to transmission of the SAE report form to Nabriva Therapeutics DAC, or their 
representative.  The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in l ight of follow -up 
information, amending the SAE report form accordingly. The causality assessment is 1 of the 
criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
The Investigator will provide the assessment of causality per instructions on th e SAE form in the 
eCRF. Serious AEs determined by the Investigator to be related to the study drug must be 
reported even if more than 30 days after the last administration of study drug have elapsed . In 
addition, the Sponsor will also assess causality of SAEs based on the information provided by 
the Investigator.  
All SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse events (SUSARs) will be reported by the 
Sponsor to the relevant competent authorities in a ccordance with the European Directive 
2001/20/EC, as applicable.

Patients who are pregnant at Screening and/or Day -1 are not permitted to participate  
in this study . Nabriva Therapeutics DAC or their representative must be notified of 
any female patient (or the partner of a male patient) who becomes pregnant during the  
study. Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies  must be followed

safety and public health concerns. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or 
designee to report any pregnancy that occurs during this study to Nabriva 
Therapeutics DAC or their representative.  
• Lactation exposure ( ie, the patient  was taking study drug while nursing an infant)  
• Accidental exposure (someone other than the study patient was exposed to study 
drug) 
• Overdose ( the patient  received more than the prescribed dose of study drug within a 
given timeframe)  
• Other medication errors that potentially place patients at a greater risk of harm than 
was previously known or recognized ( eg, study drug was administered by an incorrect 
route)

The ICH Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice establishes the general requirements for 
informed consent . 
A properly executed, written informed consent in compliance with the terms of these guidelines 
shall be obtained from each  patient before entering the study, or before performing any unusual 
or non-routine procedure in relation to the study. The purpose of the study, procedures to be 
carried out, and potential hazards will be described to each potential  patient in non-technical 
terms. Patients will be required to read, voluntarily sign, and date an informed consent form 
summarizing the discussion at Scree ning, and will be assured that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time without jeopardizing their medical care.  
Patients will sign and date one copy of the informed consent form which will be photocopied. 
The copy will be retained by the  patient and the original will be retained on file by the 
Investigator. The consent form must be approved by the appropriate IRB and Sponsor before 
study initiation at a study site. Any subsequent changes to the approved informed consent form 
must be reviewed and approv ed by the appropriate IRB and Sponsor before implementation.  
16. QUALITY ASSURANCE/QU ALITY CONTROL  
Standard Operating Procedures belonging to Nabriva Therapeutic or designee(s) will be adhered 
to for all activities relevant to the quality of the study and are routinely monitored by the Quality 
Assurance (QA) Division.  
Data will undergo quality control checks before clinical database lock. Sponsor -designated, 
independent monitors will be responsible for the monitoring of the study and its data within the 
eCRFs. 
A QA audit of this study may be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee. The QA 
auditor will have access to all medical records, the Investigator’s study -related files and 
correspondence, and information in the informed consent documentation of this  study. 
An inspection of this study may be conducted by a regulatory agency. The Investigator agrees to 
contact the Sponsor as soon as possible, but not later than within 1 week, upon notification of an 
inspection by a regulatory agency. The Investigator a grees to allow the Inspector direct access to 
all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and that of study site personnel to the

17.1. Data Handling  
Electronic case report form s are produced, stored electronically, and are available to the designated 
study team members. Each eCRF is reviewed and sign ed by the Investigator . The final signed case 
report forms ( CRFs) are provided to the Sponsor in the format as decided upon by the Sponsor , as 
documented in the data management plan (if applicable).  
17.2. Subject Confidentiality  
Investigator and his/her staff will be required to manage  patient data collected for the study in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations on personal data protection.  
All US-based investigational sites and laboratories or entities providing support for this study, 
must, where ap plicable, comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) of 1996. An investigational site that is not a Covered Entity as defined by HIPAA must 
provide documentation of this fact to Nabriva Therapeutics.  
After patients have con sented to take part in the study their medical records and the data 
collected during the study will be reviewed by Nabriva Therapeutics or its representatives. These 
records and data may, in addition, be reviewed by the following: independent auditors who 
validate the data on behalf of Nabriva Therapeutics; third parties with whom Nabriva 
Therapeutics may develop, register or market lefamulin; national or local regulatory authorities 
and the IRBs that gave approval for this study to proceed.  
Patients will be known by a unique number; however, their date of birth can also be collected if 
not in contradiction with any requirements and used to assist Nabriva Therapeutics to verify the 
accuracy of the data, for example, that the laboratory results are assigned t o the correct  patient. 
The results of this study may be recorded and transferred to and used in other countries 
throughout the world, which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the 
EU. The purpose of any such transfer would be to  support regulatory submissions in other 
countries.  
17.3. Computer Systems  
Data will be processed using a validated computer system conforming to regulatory 
requirements.  
17.4. Data Entry  
Data must be recorded using the eCRF as the study is in progress. All study site  personnel must 
log into the system using their secure user name and password in order to enter, review, or 
correct study data. These procedures must comply with the Title 21 CFR Part 11 for US sites and 
EU Directives 2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC for EU sites . All passwords will be strictly 
confidential.  
17.5. Data Validation  
Validation checks will be performed as agreed to in the Data Validation Plan.

02 November 2021 44 Confidential  17.6. Record Keeping  
Raw data generated in connection with this study as well as an original copy of the final clinical 
study report, will be retained in archive until at least 5 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 5 years have elapsed sin ce the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of lefamulin. These documents will be retained for a longer period if 
required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the 
responsibility of the Sponsor to i nform the Investigator/Institution as to when these documents 
no longer need to be retained.  
As required under European Directive 2005/28/EC, Article 17, all ‘essential documents’ (as 
described in the ICH GCP Guidelines) must be retained by Nabriva Therape utics and the 
Investigator for at least 5 years after the completion of the clinical study. Therefore, all studies, 
independent of where they were conducted in the world, must follow this requirement in the 
event a submission is ever made in the EU. These documents may be retained for a longer 
period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with 
Nabriva Therapeutics. It is the responsibility of Nabriva Therapeutics to inform the Investigator 
as to when these documen ts no longer need to be retained. The Investigator must obtain written 
permission from Nabriva Therapeutics before the destruction of any study document.  
The retention of investigator study records is an Investigator responsibility and Nabriva 
Therapeutic s will neither arrange nor pay for this activity. Any transfer of ownership of the 
content of the clinical trial master file is the responsibility of the Investigator or site 
representative, and shall be documented. The new owner shall assume the responsib ilities set 
forth in the applicable regulations.  
These records must be made available at reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of the US FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 
312.68 or other national or foreign regulatory authorities in accordance with regulatory 
requirements.  
18. TERMINATION OF STUDY  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study at any time.  
19. FINANCING AND INSURA NCE  
The costs necessary to perform the study will be agreed upon with each Investigator and will be 
documented in a separate financial agreement that will be signed by the Investigator and Nabriva 
Therapeutics (or designee), before the start of the study.  
The Investigator will be required to disclose any financial arrang ement whereby the value of the 
compensation for conducting the study could be influenced by the results or outcome of the 
study. The following information will be collected: any significant payments of other sorts from 
Nabriva Therapeutics, ( eg, money to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of

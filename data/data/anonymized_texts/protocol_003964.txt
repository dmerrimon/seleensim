   STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)  
Title:  BHV3000-301: Phase 3 : Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, 
Safety and Efficacy, Trial of BHV -3000 (rimegepant) for the Acute 
Treatment of Migraine  
Rationale:          Rimegepant  is being developed for the treatment of migraine, with a 
specific focus on acute treatment. Effectiveness against migraine was 
demonstrated in a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose- ranging  study where rimegepant at 75 mg showed 
efficacy on all four traditional endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and 
phonophobia. 
The data from this study will allow characterization of the relative safety, and efficacy of tablets of rimegepant  versus placebo in the treatment of 
moderate or severe migraine measuring freedom from pain  and freedom 
from most bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) 
reported at the onset of the treated migraine. Information regarding time to onset of action, the duration of action, and the sustainability of pain 
freedom in patients with an acute migraine will also be obtained.  
Target 
Population: The study will recruit male and female patients 18  years of age  and older  
with at least a one -year history of migraines (with o r without aura), 
consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification  of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition beta version[ 1], including an age of onset 
prior to 50, migrai ne attacks that last about 4 - 72 hours, not more than 8 
attacks of moderate or  severe intensity per month within the last 3 months 
and not less than 2 attacks per month.  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 1415 patients will be screened to randomize 1200 patients 
(approximately 600 per arm).   If, however, the targeted  number of treated 
subjects  (see Section 9.2 Sample Size)  is reached  first, the study may be 
closed.  The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to the rimegepant or 
placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by the use 
of prophylactic  migraine medications  (yes or no) . 
Objectives:  This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, outpatient evaluation of 
the safety and efficacy of rimegepant  as compared to placebo in the 
treatment of moderate or severe migraine. The study drug will be

BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 4.0  Page 9 of 81 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   rimegepant presented in a 75 mg tablet  or matching placebo.  
The study will randomize approximately 1200 patients. The subjects  will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or placebo treatment 
groups. The randomization will be stratified by the use of prophylactic migraine medications (yes or no). 
A patient whose usual migraine attack results in headache pain of 
moderate or severe intensity and who is otherwise found acceptable for 
entry into this trial based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will first 
participate in the screening phase (3 - 28 day period). Patients on 
prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry.  
After randomization, the patient will be dispensed a single dose of the 
double- blind study medication that will be taken at the time a migraine 
attack reaches moderate or  severe pain intensity (described below) on the 
numeric rating scale (NRS) as indicated in the electronic diary  (eDiary) . 
The patient will be instructed to take the ir study medication, as an 
outpatient, when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe pain intensity and only after they have identified their 
most bothersome migraine -associated symptom (phonophobia, 
photophobia or nausea). The patient will complete an e Diary for up to 
forty -eight hours after taking study medication. The patient will telephone 
the study center immediately if a severe or serious adverse event occurs.  
Patients will record efficacy data in their e Diary . This includes the 
following: onset time of headache, intensity of the headache prior to and at time of taking study medication. The patient should record all headache intensity leading up to dosing, but should not dose with study medication until the headache reaches moderate or severe pain intensity. Headache 
severity will be recorded using a four-point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) at the onset of the migraine and after dosing at time points of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours. The presence or absence of associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and ratings of functional disability (four-point scale: normal, mildly impaired, severely impaired, requires bedrest) will be recorded at the same time points as the headache severity 
ratings.  Patients will also complete the migraine -specific quality -of-life

   questionnaire and preference of medication (PoM)  scale  24 hours after 
dosing. Patients who experience reduction of  headache pain to a mil d 
intensity or pain free intensity level will be considered to have achieved 
pain relief . The patient who does not experience relief of their migraine 
headache at the end of two hours after dosing with study medication (and 
after the two hour assessments  have been completed on the eDiary)  will be 
permitted to use the following rescue medication: aspirin, ibuprofen, 
acetaminophen (up to 1000 mgs/day) naproxen (or any other type of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)), antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide or promethazine), or baclofen. These are the only medications allowed for rescue treatment after 2 hours post dose of study medication. If at the end of 48-hours after dosing with study medication (but before the End of Treatment Visit) patients are in need of migraine relief, they may take their prescribed standard of care medications, including triptans if not contraindicated, provided all of the assessments have been completed on the eDiary . Exclusionary rescue medication such 
as opioids, ergotamines, butalbital compounds, and muscle relaxants   (except baclofen as a rescue medication, see above ) are not 
allowed on this study. Similarly, if the migraine is relieved by study medication at 2 hours after dosing but then recurs to a moderate or severe intensity level between two and forty-eight hours, the patient will be 
permitted to take the same rescue therapy as outlined above. In all 
circumstances , the patient will always continue to complete his or her 
eDiary  for up to forty -eight hours after consuming the study medication.  
Patients will return to the study site within 7 days of study treatment for review of the eDiary , assessment of medication compliance, and 
monitoring of tolerability and safety (including vital signs, laboratory tests,  
and electrocardiography).  If a patient has  NOT  experienced  a  migraine  
headache of  sufficient severity within 45 days after randomization, he or 
she will be withdrawn from the trial and instructed to return the unused 
study medication and e Diary  to the study center.

   1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Therapeutic Area Background 
BHV -3000 (rimegepant, /rih- MEJ -eh-pant/) is a calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) 
receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. A comprehensive 
and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated in an 821 patient Phase 2b 
double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose- ranging trial where migraine 
sufferers received either placebo, sumatriptan (100 mg) or rimegepant  (10, 25, 75, 150, 
300 or 600 mg) (Study CN170003)[ 2]. A dose of 75 mg was selected as the optimal dose 
for Phase 3 clinical tri als, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and 
there was negligible benefit identified with higher doses. R imegepant  at 75 mg showed 
statistically significant comprehensive efficacy across all four traditional endpoints at 2 
hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable as evidenced by the presence of  pain freedom and pain relief which persisted through 24 hr and 48 hr 
showing significant difference from placebo on the corresponding 2-24 and 2-48 hr pain endpoints. 
1.2 CGRP’s Role in Migraine  
The CGRP receptor is located within pain -signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and 
mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. 
For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non- migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti- migraine drugs 
normalize CGRP levels. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in aborting migraine attacks.  
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the  
following possible mechanisms: 
• Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to 
CGRP receptors located on mast cells would inhibit inflammation caused by trigeminal nerve release of CGRP onto mast cells within the tough outer cove ring 
of the brain, or the meninges. 
• Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By blocking the CGRP receptors located in smooth 
muscle cells within vessel walls, CGRP receptor antagonists would inhibit the

   pathologic dilation of intracranial arteries without the unwanted effect of active 
vasoconstriction. 
Inhibiting Pain Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP 
receptors would suppress the transmission of pain by inhibiting the central relay 
of pain signals from the trigeminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus  
1.3 Product Development Background 
Details of the clinical and preclinical studies are provided in the most current investigator brochure. A summary of the relevant date to the study are presented below.  
1.3.1  Non-clinical Pharmacology  
1.3.1.1  Nonclinical Pharm acokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  
A series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies were 
conducted with rimegepant in rats, dogs, and monkeys. In addition, r imegepant was 
compared with two different triptans to assess potential to  contract coronary vessels.  
While sumatriptan and zolmitriptan exhibited progressive contraction of human coronary 
vessels at increasing concentrations, the CGRP receptor antagonist compounds leading up to identification of rimegepant did not induce any changes in the baseline tension in human coronary vessels even at very high (10 uM) concentrations.  Rimegepant was tested using the identical protocols in dog coronary artery (when viable human tissues were not available) and no vessel contraction was observed, in contrast to the triptans which again showed progressive concentration-dependent constriction. These data provide direct evidence that rimegepant acts without the undesirable effect of active vasoconstriction associated with treatment by ‘triptans’ . Please refer to the most current 
version of the Investigator Brochure for further details.  
1.3.1.2  Nonclinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicity of rimegepant  was comprehensively evaluated in a series of 
single - and repeat -dose oral toxicity, genetic toxicity, phototoxicity, and safety 
pharmacology studies. R imegepant  is not genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential 
for off -target receptor interactions or  adverse effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, 
and central nervous (CNS) systems. Please refer to the most current version of the 
Investigator Brochure for further details.

   1.3.2.8  RCT
 Dose -ranging trial of rimegepant for acute migraine 
(CN170003) 
Study CN170003 [ 3] was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, dose -ranging 
trial of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine.  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the acute treatment of 
migraine as me asured by pain freedom (head  pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at 
2 hours post-dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying  an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby one quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one- eighth were

   assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six r imegepant  groups based 
on a Bayesian an alysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat 
one migraine of moderate or severe pain intensity and then return  to the clinic within 7 
days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study. A broad and durabl e efficacy profile for rimegepant was demonstrated to be fully present 
at 75 mg [ 2].  This dose was selected  as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical 
trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and there was negligible 
benefit identified with larger doses , consistent with previous ly published migraine studies 
characterizing the dose- response profiles of acute treatments for migraine [8].   
Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed statistically significant efficacy (Figure 1 ) across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate- to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p < 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1% = < 0.0007) as compared to placebo 
(15.2% and 51.2%, respectively).

In conclusion, Study CN170003[ 3] demonstrated that r imegepant  is superior to placebo 
in the acute treatment of migraines. The s election of 75 mg rimegepant as the Phase 3 
dose is based on reliably demonstrated efficacy on the key primary outcome measure, 
Pain Freedom at 2 hours (31.4% vs 15.3% placebo; p = 0.0018).

   1.3.4  Clin
ical Adverse Event Profile  
To date, 7 clinical studies have been completed in healthy volunteers and migraineurs  
that inform PK, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy.  In total, the 
current data suggests a favorable benefit -risk profile for rimegepant  in the acute treatment 
of migraine attacks.  Efficacy was established in Study CN170003, and the overall 
database suggests a favorable safety profile. Clinical experience with rimegepant has also 
allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the intended therapeutic exposure and intended frequency of use. R imegepant  has been 
assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 14-days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded exposures more than 60 times greater in AUC and 30 times higher in Cmax as compared to the mean therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose.  These high exposure multiples were generally well tolerated and safe.

   Rimeg
epant  appears to be generally safe and well toler ated in humans when given as 
single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and multiple oral doses up to the 
maximum daily dose of 600 mg for 14 days. Please refer to the Investigators Brochure for a summary of the clinical safety profile.  
The prima ry identified AE of interest is potential change in liver functions tests. 
Investigators must carefully monitor routine liver functions tests ( ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and ALP) and potentially liver related symptoms and signs. Clinicians should  also monitor  changes in hematology and other laboratory measures. Please refer to the 
current Investigators Brochure for further information regarding the clinical safety profile of rimegepant.  
1.4 Study Rationale  
Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder chara cterized by recurrent attacks lasting 
four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typically one-sided, pulsating 
headaches of moderate or severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Burden of Disease Study ranks migraine as the third most prevalent disease worldwide [ 9] and the Global 
Burden of Disease Survey 2010 rates migraine as the seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide .  Annually, migraines affect approximately 15% of the adult 
population in the United States [ 10], comprising approximately 33 million adults.  
Approximately 62% of migraineurs have one or more attack per month, and approximately 25% have one or more per week[ 11].  Approximately 80% of individuals 
are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with 53% report ing 
severe impairment and/or requiring bedrest [ 12, 13]. Comorbid conditions associated 
with migraine include depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease [ 14] .   
While there are multiple classes of medications for the acute treatment of migraine, considerable unmet need remains, as evidenced by migraines being the seventh leading cause of disability worldwide [ 9].  In part, this burden is attributed to limitations of 
current standard -of-care pharmacotherapies, which are contraindicated for use in over 2.6 
million Americ an migraine sufferers with known cardiovascular disease as well as many 
others with multiple cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.  The US Prescribing Information (USPI) for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with 
CCI
   
Study BHV3000 -301 Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 4.0  Page 30 of 81 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a strong family history of 
coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a triptan. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. Even in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first dose in a medically -supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram immediately 
following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered for long-term users of triptans who have cardiovascular risk factors. According to a recent study published in the journal Headache, an estimated 2.6 million migraine sufferers in the United States have a cardiovascular event, con dition or 
procedure that limits the potential of triptans as a treatment option. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for a novel migraine- specific medication that does not 
increase the risk of cardiovascular liability.  
Biohaven is developing a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, rimegepant, for the acute treatment of migraine that will address such cardiovascular limitations.  Clinical and nonclinical studies show that rimegepant is not associated with adverse vasoconstrictive properties that are thought to cause the serious cardiovascular adverse events of the triptan class and does not share a mechanism with other agents of cardiovascular concern such as non- steroidal anti- inflammatories (NSAIDs) and 
ergotamine derivatives.  A complet ed Phase 2 trial [3] demonstrated the efficacy of 
rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine, with and without aura, at doses of 75 mg and above.   Doses above 75 mg were not associated with clinically significant differences in efficacy and therefore 75 mg is the selected  dose for Phase 3.   
The randomized controlled study proposed herein will further assess the efficacy and  
safety of rimegepant (75 mg) for the acute treatment of migraine.  As such, this study serves the broader objectives of the rimegepant clinical develo pment program: to 
demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.  
1.4.1  Study Design Rationale  
This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, outpatient evaluation of the safet y and 
efficacy of rimegepant  as compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate or severe 
migraine. The study drug will be r imegepant  formulated  in a 75 mg tablet  or a matching 
placebo. The patient will be instructed to take their study medication, as an outpatient, 
when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe intensity.

   The study will randomize approximately 1200 patients. The subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be 
stratified by the use  of prophylactic  migraine medications  (yes or no). 
This study design is utilized to confirm the efficacy and safety profiles observed in the 
Phase 2b study with rimegepant. Incorporation of placebo and use of appropriate rescue medications will permit enrollment of patients with a broad range of comorbidities, including cardiovascular conditions, representative of the potential treatment population. 
1.4.2  Dose Selection Rationale  
Study CN170003 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose- ranging trial 
of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine  [2].  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the acute treatment of 
migraine as me asured by pain freedom (head  pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at 
2 hours post-dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying  an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10, 25, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby one quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one- eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the 
remainder were assigned to one of the six rimegepant  groups based on a Bayesian 
analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of 
moderate or severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within 7 days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study.  Key entry criteria 
were very similar to those chosen for this clinical trial. 
A comprehensive and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be 
fully present at 75 mg but not at lower doses (i.e., 10 mg or 25 mg). This dose was 
selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical trials, given that larger doses (150 
mg, 300 mg, 600 mg) showed a similar efficacy profile and there was no pattern of added 
benefit in dosing higher, consistent with previous ly published migraine studi es [8].  
rimegepant  at 75 mg showed statistically significant broad efficacy across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate- to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p = 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1%) as compared to placebo (15.3% and 
51.2%, respectively). For the 75 mg dose at 2 hr, patients also showed significant freedom from nausea (67.4%, p = 0.0074) freedom from phonophobia (52.3%, p = 0.0001) and freedom from photophobia (41.9%, p = 0.0023) vs. placebo (51.2%, 28.1%

   and 24.1%, respectively).  The lasting nature of these beneficial anti -migraine effects 
were evidenced by a comparatively similar efficacy profile in the 2 -24 hr measures, 
where rimegepant  at 75 mg produced significant 2-24 hr sustained pain freedom (27.9%, 
p < 0.0001) and 2-24 hr sustained pain relief (69.8%, p < 0.0001) vs. placebo (7.4% and 
42.4%, respectively).   
1.4.3  Other Rationale related to the compound/study  
Prior to initiation of Phase 3, a Phase 1 crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the rimegepant  tablet  in healthy  volunteers will 
be conducted to ensure PK comparability  with the previously studied capsule ( rimegepant   
free-base). The Investigator Brochure will be updated to include these study results when 
available.  
1.5 Research Hypothesis  
Rimegepant  (75mg tablet ) will have effica cy superior to placebo in the treatment of acute 
migrain e with a favorable safety profile suitable for use by a broad patient population.

   3 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary  
Pain freedom  will be assessed using the number of evaluable subjects that report no pain 
at 2 hours post-dose. Pain will be measured on a 4 point Likert scale (0=none, 1=mild, 
2=moderate, 3=severe).  
Freedom from the most bothersome symptom  (MBS) will be ass essed using the 
number of evaluable subjects that report the absence of their MBS at 2 hours post-dose.  The MBS (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) will measured using a binary scale (0=absent, 1=present).  
3.2 Secondary  
• Freedom from Photophobia  will be asses sed by tabulating the number of subjects 
that report the absence of photophobia at 2 hours post-dose in the subset of subjects that reported the presence of photophobia at headache baseline. 
• Freedom from Phonophobia  will be assessed by tabulating the number of subjects 
that report the absence of phonophobia at 2 hours post-dose in the subset of subjects that reported the presence of phonophobia at headache baseline. 
• Pain Relief  (aka “headache response” ), at 2 hours post-dose, will be assessed using 
the number of evaluable subjects that report a pain level of moderate or severe (responses of 2 or 3 on the 4 point Likert scale) at baseline and then report a pain level of none or mild (response of 0 or 1) at two hours post-dose. 
• Freedom from Nausea  will be as sessed by tabulating the number of subjects that 
report the absence of nausea at 2 hours post-dose in the subset of subjects that reported the presence of nausea at headache baseline.  
• The p robability of requiring rescue medication  will be assessed using th e number of 
subjects that take rescue medication within 24 after administration of study 
medication (BHV3000 or placebo). 
• Sustained pain freedom , from 2 to 24 hours, will be assessed using the number of 
subjects that do not experience any headache pain through the time period of interest.

   4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design and Duration 
This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, outpatient evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy of rimegepant  as compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate or severe 
migraine. Participants  will be dispensed one dose of study medication consisting of a 
rimegepant  75 mg tablet  or a matching placebo. The total duration of the study will be

1 Screening/Baseline Phase will be 3 - 28 days. The Baseline Visit may be scheduled but should only occur after all screening procedures are complete, patient meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and lab test results have been received by the site.  
2 Patients will use eDiary to answer questions about their migraine symptoms upon experiencing a moderate/severe migraine headache. The patient will administer pre- 
dispensed study drug if 1) the headache remains moderate or severe; 2) the patient has completed all required migraine assessment questions in the eDiary, including their 
current most bothersome migraine symptom, and 3 ) the patient has not already taken prohibited medications (see protocol section 5.4). 
3 Patients should keep track of their concomitant medications th roughout the study and report them to the study personnel at the End of Treatment Visit. Any medication 
taken for recurrent headache should be documented. Use of concomitant medications after randomization, including rescue medications, will be recorded by  the patient on 
a paper diary and reported to the site.  
4 Height will only be captured at the Screening Visit. Weight body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate will be collected at all time points where  
indicated. Sitting arterial s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate  will be measured.

   5 All Screening Visit laboratory test results must be received prior to Baseline Visit.  
6 A serum pregnancy test will be completed at Screening and End of Treatment Visits as part of the standard laboratory tests (if appropriate). Confirmatory urine 
pregnancy test for WOCBP should be completed on site at Baseline Visit and any subsequent visits for confirmation at the Inve stigator’s discretion. Home pregnancy test 
will be provided to WOCB P after completion of baseline visit.  
7 SAEs are reported from the time of informed consent and non -serious AEs are reported from baseline . All ongoing non -serious AEs and SAEs will be followed to 
resolution or until investigator deems there will be no further status change . SAE and AE’s that occur during the treatment period should be reported to the site.  
8 This scale will be clinician administered, completed on site , and will be in paper . The source document will be provided by Biohaven.  The assessment period for 
completing the scale will be 30 days prior to Screening, and since the last visit for the remainder of the study.  
9 Patients will be randomized in the IWRS system at the Baseline Visit (Randomization Day 01)  
10 Patient should be instructed that the dose should be taken once the migraine attack reaches moderate or severe pain.  
11 Site staff to review and confirm entries with patients and confirm all data points are transferred to the system and reset e Diary  for future patient use, PRIOR to the 
patient leaving the  clinic.  
12 ± Windows for timeframe around efficacy assessments (15, 30, 45, 60, 90 min, 2, 3, 4, 6,  8, 24 and 48 hours) will be automated and captured in the e Diary.  
13 These scales will be captured  in the e Diary . Patients will also be asked about their most bothersome symptom at the time of reporting and treating a qualifying migraine.  
14 Paper source document  will be used to capture Migraine  History. Patients will also be asked about their typical most bothersome symptom when having a migraine.

 4.3.1  Screening Phase (3 -28 days)  
It is estimated that approximately 1415 patients will be screened to allow 1200 patients to be 
randomized at the Baseline visit. All patients who are screened  into the study will be entered 
into the IWRS system. After obtaining informed consent, patients will undergo all screening 
procedures as detailed in Table 1 . After all screening procedures are complete, patients will 
return 3 -28 days from signing informed consent to be randomized at the Baseline visit if they 
meet all eligibility  criteria. Patients on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to 
remain on therapy provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to randomization.  
4.3.2  Acute  (Randomization)  Phase (45 days)  
If the patient mee ts all eligibility  criteria they will be randomized at the Baseline Visit via the 
IWRS  system. The patients will be provided with an e Diary . The study personnel will instruct 
the patient on the proper use of the eDiary  and ensure proper understanding and use of the tool, 
prior to the patient leaving the office.  
After randomization via the IWRS  syste m, the patient will be dispensed a single dose of the 
double- blind study medication  to take home for up to 45 days. This study medication  is to  be 
taken when  a migraine attack reaches moderate or severe intensity on the numeric rating scale 
(NRS) as indicated in the e Diary.  The patient will be instructed to take their study medication, 
as an outpatient, when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe 
intensity  after they answer eD iary questions about their current pain and symptoms  and 
identify their  currently most bothersome, migraine associated, symptom (phonophobia, 
photophobia or nausea) . The patient will complete an e Diary  for up to forty-eight hours after 
taking study medication. The patient will telephone the study center immediately if a sever e or 
serious adverse event occurs.  
 Patients will record efficacy data in their e Diary . This includes the following: onset time of 
headache, intensity of the headache prior to and at time of taking study medication. The patient should record all headache intensity leading up to dosing, but should not dose with study medication until the headache reaches moderate or severe intensity. Headache severity will be recorded using a four -point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe 
pain) at  the onset of the migraine and after dosing at time points of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 
minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours. The presence or absence of associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and ratings of functional disability (four-point scale: normal, mildly impaired, severely impaired, requires bedrest) will be recorded at the same time points as the headache severity ratings.  Patients will also identify  their curren tly most 
bothersome symptom before taking study medication. Patients  will record the date and time 
study therapy was taken  in their e Diary . Patients will also complete the migraine -specific 
quality-of-life questionnaire (MQoL Q) and preference of medication (PoM) 24 hours after 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 43 of 81 
 
 dosing. Patients who have headache pain  reduced  to a mild intensity or pain free intensity level 
will be considered to have achieved pain relief .  
 
After dosing with study medication, all other headache medication is prohibited during the 2 hours post dose. However, a patient who does not exper ience relief of their migraine headache 
at the end of two hours after dosing with study medication (and after the two hour assessments have been completed on the eDiary) will be permitted to use the following rescue medication: aspirin, ibuprofen, acetamin ophen up to 1000mg/day (this includes Excedrin M igraine)  
naproxen  (or any other type of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory (NSAID)), antiemetics (e.g., 
metoclopramide or promethazine), or baclofen. These are the only medications allowed for rescue treatment af ter 2 hours post dose of study medication. However, if needed , after 48 -
hours of administering the one dose of study medication (and before returning for the End of Treatment Visit) patients may take their prescribed standard of care medications for treatment of migraine,  including triptans if not contraindicated, provided all of the assessments have 
been completed on the eDiary . Exclusionary rescue medication such as, opioids, ergotamines, 
butalbital compounds, and muscle relaxants  (except baclofen as a rescue medication, see above) are not allowed on this study. Similarly, if the migraine is relieved by study medication at 2 hours after dosing but then recurs to a moderate or severe intensity level between two and forty -eight hours, the patient will be permitted to take the same rescue therapy as outlined 
above.  In all circumstances , the patient will continue to complete his or her e Diary for up to 
forty -eight hours after consuming the study medication . 
4.3.3  Extension Phase   
Not Applicable 
4.3.4  End of Treatment ( 7 days after Treatment)  
Patients will return to the study site within 7 days of study treatment (+2 days)  for review of 
the eDiary assessment of medication compliance, and monitoring of tolerability and safety 
(including vital signs, laboratory tests,  and  electrocardiography).  If a patient  has  NOT  
experienced  a  migraine  headache of  sufficient severity within 45 days after randomization, he 
or she will be withdrawn from the trial and instructed to return unused study medication and 
eDiary  to the study center. 
4.4 Post Study Access to Therapy (if applicable)  
At the end of the study the sponsor will not continue to supply study drug to patients/investigators. The investigator should ensure that the subject receives the appropriate standard of care to treat the condition under study.  Alternatively , patients may be eligible  to 
receive study drug by participation in  a rimegepant Long Term Safety  study requiring approval 
by responsible health authorities and ethics committees.

Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 49 of 81 
 
 of investigational product in such a manner that risk of pregnancy is minimized. It is required 
that all WOCBP use two methods of contraception for the duration of the study (i.e. beginning before  treatment with the 1 dose of study medication to 56 days after dosing ). The two methods 
should include one barrier method (ex. condom with spermicidal gel, intrauterine devices, cervical cap etc.) and one other method. The other method could include oral contraceptives or another barrier method (Note an Intr a Uterine Device is considered one method) . 
Women who suspect that they have become or may have become pregnant despite using proper birth control methods, should use the home pregnancy test provided at Baseline Visit. Home 
pregnancy test should be administered prior to taking Investigational Study Drug. Patient should not take Investigational Study Drug if they are pregnant and patient should immediately contact Study Investigator .

17]. If the investigator determines that a subject is at risk of suicide or self -harm, appropriate 
measures to ensure the subject’s safety and obtain mental health evaluation must be 
implemented. The subject must immediately be discontinued from the study. The  event should 
be recorded as either an AE or SAE as determined by the investigator and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor. 
 
6.3 Efficacy Assessments 
6.3.1  Pain 
Subjects are given an eDiary  to record their migraine pain score, on a 4-point numeric rating 
[no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain] at the time points indicated in Table 1 .  
 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 53 of 81 
 
 6.3.2  Nausea, Phonophobia and Photophobia  
The migraine associated symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia and nausea are measured on a 
two point scale (present or absent), using the eDiary, at the time points listed in Table 1 .  If a 
subject reports the presence of a symptom, the subject is  then  asked to rate the severity  of the 
symptom on a four point scale (none, mild, moderate or serve). All assessment is done using the eDiary.  
The subject s are also asked to identify  their most bothersome symptom on the eDiary (nausea, 
phonophobia or photophobia) at the onset of the migraine to be treated . The most bothersome 
symptom must be identified  before the subjec t takes study medication.   
6.3.3  Rescue Medicatio n 
The subject’s use of rescue medication is recorded by the subject in a paper diary.  
6.3.4  Functional Disability  
Impact of treatment on  functional disability will be assessed using a single -question scale. 
Subjects  rate the level of disability they perceive as a result of their migraine in performing 
normal actions. This is done in the eDiary, at the times indicated in Table 1 , using a 4 point 
numeric rating scale: Normal Function, Mild Impairment, Severe Impairment, Required Bedrest.  
6.3.5  Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Impact of treatment on subject -reported quality of life will be assessed using The Migraine 
Quality of Life Questionnaire ( MQoLQ). The MQoLQ is a 15 -item instrument that has been 
validated in migraine patients to measure the short- term impact of treatment (within 24 -hours) 
on seven migraine-specific domains: work, social function, energy, vitality, feelings, concerns, and migraine symptoms.  The eDiary is used to evaluate the Migraine Quality of Life 
Questionnaire at 24 hours post- dose (see Table 1 ). 
6.3.6  Migraine Preference of Medicine  
The Preference of Medication Scale (PoMs) is a brief scale that captures the subjects ' 
perception of whether the medication they are taking has had a greater benefit compared with previous medications to treat their pain. The eDiary is used to evaluate the Preference of 
Medication Scale at 24 hours post- dose (see Table 1 ).

 6.4 Early  Discontinuation from the Stu dy 
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal  of informed  consent (subject’s  decision  to withdraw for any reason)  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the 
best interest of the  subject  
• Pregnancy  
• Termination of the study by Biohaven Phar maceuticals  
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical ( e.g., infectious disease) illness  
All subjects who discontinue should comply with prot ocol specified End of Treatment 
procedures as outlined in Table 1 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is 
imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).

 7 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT 
7.1 Description  of Study Drug 
7.1.1  Investigational Product   
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some 
regions, is defined as follows: 
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. 
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local 
regulations. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational  
product is only dispensed to study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local 
regulations. 
The rimegepant tablet and the matching placebo appear identical visually, via touch, 
smell and taste.    
7.1.2  Non-investigational Product  
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non-investigational products. 
In this protocol, non- investigational product(s) is/are: Not applicable for this study. 
7.1.3  Packag ing, Shipment and Storage  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance 
with the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by the sponsor. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, do 
not dispense the study drug and contact the sponsor immediately.  
7.2 Dose and Administration 
7.2.1  Method of Assigning Patient Identification  
At the time of enrollment, immediately after written informed consent is obtained and before performing any study -related procedures, each subject will be assigned an unique 
sequential 4 -digit subject number beginning with 0001, 0002, 0003, etc. for identification 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 56 of 81 
 
 throughout the study through an IWRS  system . This subject number must not be reused 
for any  other participant in the study. The physician/coordinator must contact the IW RS 
to enroll each subject into a centralized database at the time of signing consent.  
After completion of all screening evaluatio ns all eligible subjects will be randomize d in a 
1:1 ratio to  the rimegepant or placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be 
stratified by the use of prophylactic  migraine medications  (yes or no). 
Randomization schedules will be generated and kept by  in a secure 
network folder with access limited to only unblinded team members.  Each subject who is 
qualified for treatment will be randomized via the I WRS randomization option. Patients 
will maintain their subject number assigned at screening throughout the trial. The IW RS 
will prov ide the double- blind treatment assignments.  
The randomization will trigger a bottle number for the randomized treatment type. The 
drug will be dispens ed at the time of randomization .  
7.2.2  Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration 
Study medication (one 75mg tablet ) will be in a bottle . There are no dose adjustments in 
this study and patients will receive one dose to treat  one  migra ine  headache  of  
moderate  or  severe  intensity  within  the  45  days  of randomization (Baseline Visit). 
Patients will be administered the study medication  at randomization (Baseline Visit) and 
will take the tablet  from the bottle  at the time of moderate or severe migr aine headache 
onset after answering  questions regarding their migraine symptoms on the eDiary.  The 
tablet  should swallowed with water . 
7.2.3  Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose adjustments in this study.  
7.3 Blinding and Unblinding  
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study.  However, in the event  of a 
medical emergency or pregnancy in an ind ividual patient, in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the patient’s management, the blind for that patient 
may be broken by the treating physician.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual patient’s treatment, the investigator should 
have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that  it will alter the patient’s  
immediate management.   I n many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not 
investigational product related, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the patient is receiving active product without the need for unblinding.   
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt 
to preserve the blind is made.

BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 57 of 81 
 
 7.4 Treatment Compliance  
Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug.  Accountability and 
compliance verification should be documented in the patient’s  study records.   
Patients have to be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as di rected  
when a migraine occurs and reaches moderate or severe intensity.  If the patient does not have a migraine or take their study medication within 45 days of the Baseline Visit, they should return to the clinic for their End of Study Visit and return t heir study medication.  
7.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug  
If the study drug (those supplied by the sponsor or sourced by the investigator) are to be 
destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made fo r the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been established 
according to the applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been documented.  The unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible BHV Study monitor or the sponsor’s designee unless this is against institutional policy .  
All unused and/or partially used study drug may be destroyed on site providing the site has an applicable s tandard operating procedure on file.

 8 ADVERSE EVENTS 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of the investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a patient.  In order to prevent reporting bias, 
patients should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. 
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious 
Adverse Events (AEs).   
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
8.1.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria  at any dose: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existi ng hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received 
rimegepant  
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not limited to) : 
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
o Potential drug-induced liver injury  
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 59 of 81 
 
 Definition of Terms  
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more severe form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of AE (e.g., elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BHV clinical studies (but may 
be considered non- serious AEs):  
1. A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours that does not result in an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life threatening);  
2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent; 
3. Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure; 
4. Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routine colonoscopy); 
5. Admission encountered for anothe r life circumstance that carries no bearing  on health 
and requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care- giver respite, family 
circumstances).  
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a sub stantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
8.1.2  Collection and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol- specific procedures.   All SAEs must be collected that  occur 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 62 of 81 
 
 AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilir ubinemia, including but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic 
or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug (s) kn own to be hepatotoxic.  
If any potential DILI is identified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical Monitor (or designee) should immediately be contacted for further instruction on dosing adjustments and whether the patient must discontinue from the trial and appropriate follow up requirements.  
8.2 Non-serious Adverse Events  
A non- serious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
8.2.1  Collection and Reporting of Non- Serious  Adverse Events  
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at the Baseline visit. Non -
serious AE information should also be collected from any observational period intended 
to establish  a baseline status for a patient .  
Non-serious adverse events should be followed until conclusion or stabilization, or 
reported as SAEs if they become serious.   Follow-up is also required for non-serious 
AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug or those that are present at the end of study treatment.  
8.2.2  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE 
CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:  
1. Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE;  
2. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have the study drug discontinued or interrupted; 
3. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

 9 STATISTICS  
9.1 General Procedures  
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum 
and maximum).   
For the calculation of descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects mus t have a 
baseline value to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline 
over time.  
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: protocol deviations; interruptions of study therapy; non-study medications; adverse events; and laboratory abnormalities. Thus, for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject. 
9.2 Sample Size  
If approximately 90% of the 600 subjects randomized to each treatment arm have a 
migraine  in the allotted time period, there will be approximately 550 treated subjects per 
group.  
Based on approximations from the Phase IIb study, 550 subjects provides more than 95% 
power to detect a difference between rimegepant and placebo on the subject’s self-
reported most bothersome symptom. Also, based on the Phase IIb study, 550 subjects provides more than 95% power to detect a difference in freedom from pain at 2 hours.  Having at least 95% power on each co- primary endpoint  provides at least 90% power to 
detect a difference on both endpoints jointly.  
9.3 Populations for Analysis  
• Enrolled subjects: Patients who sign an informed consent form and are assigned a 
subject identification number.  
• Randomized subjects: Enrolled subjects who receive a randomization treatment 
assignment from the IWRS ( rimegepant or placebo). 
• Treated subjects: Enrolled subjects who take study therapy ( rimegepant or placebo).  
• Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) subjects: randomized subjects that  take study 
therapy , have a migraine  of moderate or severe baseline intensity , and provide at least 
one evaluable, post- baseline, efficacy data point.   
 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 64 of 81 
 
 9.4 Statistical Methods  
9.4.1  Primary Endpoint(s)  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant)  is tested for superiority to placebo, at an alpha=0.05 level, on 
both pain freedom at 2 hours post-dose and freedom the most bothersome symptom at 2 
hours post-dose. Both endpoints are evaluated using Cochran- Mantel Haenszel  tests. The 
test for pain is stratified by  the use of prophylactic migraine medication (yes or no). The 
test for the most bothersome symptom is also stratified by the use of prophylactic 
migraine medication (yes or no). These tests are conducted using the mITT subjects, with missing data at two hours imputed  to be failure ( i.e., Non -Completers = Failure;  NC=F). 
Sens itivity analyses  are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  
9.4.2  Secondary Endpoint(s)  
If the primary endpoint tests are both significant, then the secondary endpoints are 
evaluated  using a hierarchical gate- keeping procedure, with each test in the hierarchy 
conducted at p=0.05.  These secondary endpoints will be tested in the following order: 
1. Photophobia freedom at 2 hours 
2. Phonophobia Freedom at 2 hours  
3. Pain Relief at  2 hours 
4. Nausea Freedom at 2 hours  
5. Probability of requiring rescue medication within 24 hours 
6. Sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours 
7. Sustained Pain Relief from 2 to 24 
8. Sustained Pain Freedom 2 to 48 hours 
9. Sustained Pain Relief from 2 to 48 hours 
10. Pain relapse from 2 to 48 hours 
11. Proportion of patients able to work or function normally at 2 hours. 
9.4.3  Analysis of Safety  
The investigators determine the intensity of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study therapy. The investigators’ terms are coded and grouped b y system organ class using the 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 65 of 81 
 
 latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) available. 
AEs are presented by system organ class and preferred term, ordered by the overall frequency of events.  If a subject had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity is reported.  
AEs are tabulated in all treated subjects. SAEs occurring in subjects enrolled but not treated are listed. Deaths are listed for enrolled subjects without regard to onset.  
The frequencies of the following safety events are summarized by treatment regimen, and overall, for treated subjects:  SAEs; all AEs, non- serious AEs, AEs by intensity;  and AEs 
by relatedness .. 
Graphical and tabular displays of liver function test results are provided.  
9.4.4  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics are made for: subjects randomized but not treated; subjects randomized and treated; and overall. A separate set of tabulations are made for subjects enrolled but not randomized. 
9.5 Interim Analysis  
There is a final analysis after the last subject has his/her  last visit.  No interim analyses 
are anticipated.

 10 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES   
10.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with the recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the exception that registration of such Phase 1 trial s in a 
publicly accessible database is not mandatory.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the patient informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/ IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to 
initiation of the study.    
All serious breaches must be reported to Biohaven (or designee) immediately.  A Serious 
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the stud or protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform their respective task(s).  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been 
invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., lose of medical licensure, debarment).   
10.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will not make use of a Data Safety Monitoring Committee  (DMC).  The study 
medication rimegepant  has been found to be well tolerated  in previous clinical studies .  
Safety will be closely monitored via the sites and proced ures for unblinding in case s of 
emergency will be followed .  
10.3 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure and any other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the Investigators have obtained the IEC favorable written approvals for the above-mentioned study documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by each subject prior to entering the trial or prior to performing a ny study 
procedure. The original signed and dated ICF will be kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.  
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 67 of 81 
 
 In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by the 
IEC prior to its implementation, u nless the changes involve only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IEC, prior to subsequently obtaining each subject’s consent.  
The Principal investigator and the Sponsor’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendments (if any) before initiating the study.  
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.  
10.4 Informed Consent  
Investigators must ensure that patients, or, in those situations where consent cannot be 
given by patients, their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully in formed 
about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or 
Local) sample informed consen t form which will include all elements required by  
ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Before the potential subject  has undergone any study- related screening procedures, the 
nature of the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are answered, but before proceeding further, the subject 
must read and sign a written informed consent form. This signed informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC, revisions to the protocol and informed  
consent form will b e reviewed and approved by the IRB/ IEC, a  copy retained in the 
Study Master File, and the date and time the subject signed the form will be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.   
If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardian or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the patient.  
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its 
representatives and regulatory authorities may have direct access  to patient records.  
The rights, safety, and well-being of study patients are the most important considerations and should prevail  over interests of science and society.

 10.5 Case Report Forms  
An Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories  
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation of each 
study patient. Data reported on the CRF that are derived from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies  must be explained. 
Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collections fields when EDC is being used.    
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting 
the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The Investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of changes and 
corrections.   If EDC is being used, signatures  will be obtained electronically and a copy 
of the electronic CRFs will be provided (or the data from the CRFs) for future reference.   
10.6 Records Management  and Retention 
In accordance with the principles of GCP and GLP, the study may be inspected by regulatory authorities, the Sponsor and CRO. The Sponsor is entitled to access information about the status of the study and to review the original documents of the study.  
The Investigator must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum 
required by the applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures or for the period of time specified by the sponsor, whichever is longer.  The Investigator must 
contact the Sponsor prior to destroying any records  associated with this study.  
Biohaven will notify the Investigators when the study files for this study are no longer 
needed.  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (i.e., retirement, relocation), the records shall 
be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be given 
in writing to Biohaven.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure t hat the current disposition record of 
investigational product (those supplied by the sponsor) is maintained at each study site 
where the study drug is inventoried and dispensed.  Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include: 
1. amount of study drug received and placed in storage area 
2. label ID number or batch number or Kit number as specified for the protocol 
3. amount dispensed to and returned from each patient 
4. amount transferred to another area or site for dispensing or storage if applicable 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 69 of 81 
 
 5. amount of drug lost or wasted 
6. amount destroyed at the site if applicable  
7. amount returned to sponsor, if applicable 
8. retain sampled for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable  
9. record of dates and initials of personnel responsible for IM dispensing and 
accountability    
10.7 Source Documentation 
An Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent for all subjects on study.   
If source documents are created to support the collection of study information, this must 
be retained with the other pertinent medical record for each patient for verification of data points.   Unless otherwise instructed by the Sponsor or designee to enter data directly on the eCRF.   
10.8 Study Files and Record Retention 
The CRO will maintain adequate study records after completion or termination of study. After that period, the Sponsor will be contacted to determine whether the study records will be forwarded to the Sponsor, destroyed or kept at CRO or at another facility  for a 
longer period of time at the Sponsor's expense.

 11 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, 
may be made only by Biohaven. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is 
notified within 5 days. 
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The 
written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases , informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before 
continued participation.

 APPENDIX II – Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles  
for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly 
Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and amend ed by the  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983 
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996 
and the 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 
A. INTRODUCTION  
The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement 
of ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medic al 
research involving human subjects. Medical research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.  
It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medica l Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest 
when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately mu st rest in part on 
experimentation involving human subjects. 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 76 of 81 
 
 In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well -being  of the 
human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best-proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuous ly be challenged through research for their 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research is s ubject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings 
and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need 
special protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research is combined with care.  
Research investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, healt h, privacy, and 
dignity of the human subject. 
Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.  
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially appointed ethical rev iew committee, which must be independent of the 
investigator, the Sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent committee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. T he committee has the right to monitor ongoing 
trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the committee, especially any SAEs. The researcher should also submit to the committee, for 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 77 of 81 
 
 review, information regarding funding, Sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential 
conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects. 
The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in this Declaration.  
Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a subject of the research, even though the subject has given consent. 
Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benef its to 
the subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available. 
Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects 
unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.  
Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is especially important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers. 
Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations 
in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. 
The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project.  
The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. 
Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality of the subject’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of 
the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of inte rest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed. 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 78 of 81 
 
 When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship. 
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons. 
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent 
to decisions about partic ipation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in 
addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy 
or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surroga te. 
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED 
WITH MEDICAL CARE  
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic valu e. 
When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research subjects.  
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 79 of 81 
 
 At the conclusion of the study, every subject entered into the study should be assured of 
access to the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by 
the study. 
The physician should fully inform the subject which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a subject to participate in a study must never interfere with the subject -physician relationship. 
In the treatment of a subject, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the su bject, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

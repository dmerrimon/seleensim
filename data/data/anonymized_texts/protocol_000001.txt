Methodology 
(continued)Determination of the MTD: An adaptive dose 
escalation design will be used to determine the 
MTD in study  Part 1 (all comer). The MTD is 
defined as the highest dose that can be given such 
that not more than 20% of subjects experience a 
DLT during Cy cle 1. The dose escalation will be
performed as follows:
Initiall y 3 subjects per dose level will be enrolled. In 
case 2 or more sites are conducting the dose 
escalation part, the initial enrolment of 4 subjects 
per dose level is optional.
The starting dose of BAY 1163877 is 50 mg given 
asa single dose on C ycle 1, Day 1, and twice daily 
(b.i.d.) from C ycle 1, Day 3 (100 mg /day)
The maximum dose escalation will be 2- fold.
Possible daily  doses of BAY 1163877 starting from 
100 mg in increments of 100 mg.
If at least 1 subject out of 3 or 1 o ut of 4 in a cohort has 
DLTs or if at least 2 subjects report drug -related AEs 
(CTCAE v4.03) of Grade ≥ 2, any  further dose 
escalation, de -
escalation or cohort expansion will be 
decided in consultation between all investigator(s), and 
the sponsor (within t he drug safet y monitoring team = 
DSMT) after consideration of all available safet y data 
of the previous cohorts. Any  subsequent dose will be 
selected in order to determine the MTD. 
Model -based dose -response anal ysis of the DLT rates 
will be performed duri ng these interim reviews in order 
to guide the dose decision (see details in Section 16.4).
The model -
based dose selection procedure is 
considering data at all dose levels (not just at the last 
cohort). The dose predicted to y ield 20% DLT rates will 
be reported from that model as a best candidate for the 
next cohort. 
The final decision about the next dose will be made by  
the sponsor in consultation with all investigators 
(DSMT). If the selected dose is larger than the last dose 
tested, then escalation will be pursued. If it is lower, a 
de-escalation step will occur.

Methodology 
(continued)Without the occurrence of toxicities, dose escalation 
could be stopped and RP2D may  be determined based 
on PK and/or PD results. The decision to continue 
treatment for an individual patient will be made by  the 
investigator according to the criteria specifi ed in the 
protocol (Section 8.4).
Cohort expansion will occur when a previousl y tested 
dose is selected again for the next cohort of 3 subjects. 
Expansions at any  given dose up to a total of 9 subjects 
are allowed. In principle, the selection of a next dose 
level where the predicted DL
T rate is close to 20% 
should insure that the next dose tested will remain safe. 
Nevertheless, the following constraint will be added in 
order to protect subject safet y during the adaptive dose 
selection decisions:
If 2 out of 3 (or 2 out of 4), at least 4 out of 6 (or at 
least 5 out of 9) subjects experience DLTs at a given 
dose level, only lower doses will be given in all 
subsequent cohorts because the probability  that the 
dose is above the MTD is very  large (above 95.4%).
The dose -escalation procedure will be stopped as 
soon as: 
-the MTD has been defined with good precision 
(i.e., the coefficient of variation for the MTD is 
lower tha n or close to 40%)
or
-at an y time when the selected dose level for the 
next cohort has alread y been given in 
9subjects.
If the dose escalation stops, the sample size for the 
MTD cohort will be expanded up to a total of 
20evaluable subjects (study  Part 1 / MTD expansion 
cohort (all comer)). 
No intra -subject dose escalation is permitted. Dose 
interruptions and / or dose red uctions may  be required 
based on individual safety and tolerability .

(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN). In all subjects 
participating in Stud y Part 3, multiple dose PK of BAY 
1163877 will be evaluated in plasma samples collected 
on Cy cle 1, Day  15 (up to 12 hours after dosing).14
In approximately  8
subjects enrolled in MTD 
expansion cohorts (study Part 1 and Part 2), single 
dose PK of BAY 1163877 will be evaluated in 
plasma sample s collected on Cy cle1, Day  -3 (up to 
48 hours after dosing) and on Cy cle1, Day 1 (up to 
48 hours after dosing) for food effect assessment.
In the MTD expansion cohorts, in 
approximately 8 
subjects with moderatel y impaired renal function at 
baseline (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 30 to 
59mL/min/1.73 m2according to the modified diet in 
renal disease [MDRD] abbreviated formula), serial 
PK blood samples will be collected on C ycle 1 D ay 1 
and Day  15.15
Plasma concentration of BAY 1163877 will be 
measured using a validated method.
In approximately  8 subjects enrolled in MTD expansion 
cohorts (study  Part 1 and Part 2), urine will be collected 
for 24 hours after dosing on Cy cle 1, Day  1 
(concurrently with plasma PK samples) and anal yzed 
using validated method.
Exploratory  monitoring of metabolites may  also be 
performed in pooled plasma (most likely  at the MTD or 
the therapeutic dose) and urine samples.

Methodology 
(continued)Safety / tolerability: Safety  will be assessed by  close 
monitoring and timely  assessment of adverse events 
(AEs), laboratory  parameters (blood tests, urinal ysis), 
vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), subject’s 
medical condition (ph ysical examination including 
weight), ophthalmological examination , general well -
being and activities of daily  life (Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status).16Each 
subject will be regularl y assessed in each cy cle for 
potential AEs and disease related signs and s ymptoms. 
The CTCAE v4.03 will be used to grade toxicities / 
AEs.
Cardiovascular assessment: Blood pressure (BP) and 
heart rate (HR) will be measured at screening, 
frequentl y on PK profile days in C ycle 1, and once at all 
other visits during treatment and fo llow up.
Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12-lead ECG readings will 
be performed at screening, on C ycle 1, Days -3 and -2 
(“tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect assessment” 
only), on C ycle 1, Days 1, 2, and 15, thereafter on 
Day 1 of each subsequent Cy cle, and at the EOT visit.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers: In an attempt to 
demonstrate the mechanism of action of BAY 1163877,
biomarkers will be studied in tissue samples.
Biomarker analysis in tumor tissue
Biomarker anal ysis will be done at screening for subject 
stratification in the MTD expansion cohorts (Part 1: all 
comer; Part 2: sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN ; Part

Methodology 
(continued)3: “Safety cohort” sqNSCLC + LAC + BC ) according 
to FGFR expression levels / FGFR mutation using 
either an archival or fresh tumor biopsy  material (see 
inclusion criteria).17
Analy sis of phospho -extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase 1/2 levels, (p -ERK1/2) will be done at screening 
and on Cy cle 2, Day  1 for all subjects of study  Part 1 
and Part 2 who are willing to undergo a biops y both at 
screening and on Cy cle 2, Day  1.18Both biopsies are 
mandatory  for “all comer” subjects included in the 
MTD expansion cohort of Part 1.
Priming of immune response (only  in Part 3 “Safety  
cohort”): Selected parameters of immune response will 
be measured in fresh tumor tissue at baseline and 
between C ycle 2, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 21 and 
peripheral blood at the following timepoints: at 
baseline; Cy cle 1, Day  8; Cy cle 2, Day  1; Cy cle 2, Day  
15; and on the day of the second biopsy .19
Tumor response evaluation: Computed tomography  
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all 
anatomic regions involved with the disease will be 
performed at screening (baseline), at the end of Cy cle 2 
and thereafter, every  third cy cle to assess tumor 
response using the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors, Version 1.1. (RECI
ST v1.1) (1). 
Recommended Phase II do se (RP2D): The RP2D will 
be determined at the end of the study  (after Part 2).
Type of control The study  is uncontrolled.
Number of subjects Subjects will be enrolled in the pre- treatment phase of 
the study to recruit enough subjects with present high 
FGFR expression levels for the following stud y parts .
 Study Part 1 / dose escalation (all comer) : 
The total number of subjects will depend on the number 
of cohorts necessary  to identify  the MTD. Relative

bioavailability  of the tablet formulation in comparison 
to the solution formulation will be performed in all 
subjects enrolled in one of the dose escalation cohorts; 
pharmacokinetic data are needed in a minimum of 
3subjects for relative bioavailability  assessm ent. 
 Study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer): 
Additional subjects will be enrolled to have 20 
evaluable “all comer” subjects treated at MTD.
Number of subjects
(continued) Study Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCLC + 
LAC + BC + SCCHN) : 
Additional subjects will be enrolled to have 
20evaluable subjects with sqNSCL C or LAC and a 
cohort of at least 30, up to a maxim um of 50 evaluable 
subjects with BC and at least 8 subjects with SCCHN 
treated at MTD.20
 Study  Part 3 / MTD expansion “Safet y cohort”
(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC):
Additional subjects will be enrolled to have 
approximately  20subjects with sqNSCL C or LAC and 
approximately 20
subjects with BC treated at MTD.21
Primary variables Determination of MTD
The primary  variable for MTD determination will be 
the incidence of DLTs during the first 21 day s of 
treatment (C ycle 1). 
The primary  study  outcome is the MTD being defined 
as the maximum dose at which the incidence of DLTs 
during C ycle 1 is below 20%.
Pharmacokinetics: (BAY 1163877)
On Cycle 1 Day - 3 (“tablet bridging cohort” and 
“food effect assessment” only) and Cycle 1, Day 1:
Cmax, AUC(0 -12), AUC(0-t last), AUC and corresponding 
dose adjusted parameters (C max/D, AUC(0- 12)/D 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D, AUC/D and AUC).  
Amount of BAY 1163877 excreted renally  during 0 to

12 h (A E,ur(0-12)), 12 to 24 h (A E,ur(12-24)) and 0 to 
24h (A E,ur(0-24)) post -dose will be calculated at the 
MTD and also expressed as percent of dose 
administered.
For Cycle 1, Day 15: Cmax,md , Cmax/Dmd, AUC(0 -12) md, 
AUC(0 -12)/D md, AUC(0 -tlast)md, and AUC(0-t last)/D md.
Plan for statistical analysis This is primarily  a descriptive safet y and tolerability 
trial. A confirmatory  analy sis is not intended. 
Quantitative data will be desc ribed b y summary 
statistics. Frequency  tables will be provided for 
qualitative data.
The incidence of subjects with DL Ts during C ycle 1 
will be summarized by  cohort and, as possible, modeled 
as a function of BAY 1163877 dose using Bay esian 
logistic regression to guide the dose selection.
PK data will be summarized by  descriptive statistics. 
To investigate dose proportionality , bioavailability  and 
food effect, ANOVA will be performed on the log -
transformed values of appropriate PK parameters and 
90% confidence intervals will be derived.

3Introduction - amended
Background information 
Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their corresponding receptor family  (FGFR) drive 
crucial oncogenic signaling pathway s including cell proliferation, survival and 
migration (1)(2) . FGFRs are commonl y altered in various human tumor diseases, 
including FGFR1 amplification in non- small cell lung cancer (e.g. sqNSCLC (3)(4) ), 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN (38) ), or activating mutations of 
FGFR3 in bladder cancers (BC (5)(6)(7) ). These changes contribute to tumor cell growth, 
sustained angiogenesis, invasi on and metastasis and resistance against other therapies.
BAY 1163877 is an oral inhibitor of FGFR1, 2 and 3 and showed strong anti -tumor 
efficacy  in pre -clinical models as a single agent as well as in combination with cy totoxic 
agents in FGFR pathway  addicted tumor models. 
The targeted application form is oral and preclinical data suggest low clearance and low 
volume of distribution resulting in a daily  dose of 300 to 800 mg.
Further details can be found in the investigator's brochure (IB), which contains
comprehensive information on the study  drug. The IB in its most current version is 
available in the Study  File.
Rationale of the study 
The target indications for BAY 1163877 in the expansion phase of this study  are 
sqNSCL C, lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), BC and SCCHN. Preclinical data demonstrate a 
strong anti -tumor efficacy  of BAY 1163877 in all four tumor ty pes as a single agent. In 
human s qNSCL C, amplification of FGFR1 has been demonstrated in up to 21% of cases 
(8)(9) (10)(11) , and FGFR1 amplification was found in 15 % of SCCHN cases (38) which 
is usually  detected b y FISH-based analy sis of gene copy  number alterations. Recent data 
from the literature, however, suggest that stratification via this approach may  not b e of 
sufficient sensitivity  as a considerable number of subjects has been identified with low to 
intermediate gene cop y numbers, rendering these subjects ineligible for targeted therapies 
with other FGFR inhibitors (12) (13). Anal ysis of responsive and non- responsive xenograft 
models revealed a strong correlation with total FGFR1, 2 and 3 mRNA expression levels 
that will be used as a stratification biomarker in the expansion phase of this trial. 
Additional genetic information needs to be confirmed as data from the literature (10)(14)
and in- house data confirmed a strong influence on tumor response through additional 
oncogenic mutations (e.g. in K- ras). In BC, activating mutations of FGFR3 have been 
described in up to 70% of cases (15)(6)(16) and will be used as an additional stratification 
marker if overall mRNA expression in these subjects is low. This stratification approach 
allows to minimize the risk for subjects who will potentially  not benefit and increase the 
chance for generating early  signs of clinical efficacy . Inhibition of FGFR1 leads to the 
upregulation of FGF23 in serum (17), which will be used as sensitive pharmacody namic 
(PD) biomarker. Inhibition of extracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) phosphory lation 
will be assessed as an additional PD biomarker from tumor tissue.

Preclinical data suggest a good tolerability  and efficacy  in these subject populations after 
continuous oral dosing with BAY 1163877. 22
It was shown that FGFR3 expression is inversely  correlated to programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1)expression and T cell infiltration in tumor tissue of patients with BC (40).This 
finding was confirmed in archival biops y samples collected in study 16443. A similar 
correlation was detected in patients with sqNSCLC and L ACin study  16443 .
It is assumed that a causal relationshi p between FGFR expression and T cell exclusion 
leads to low PD -L1 levels and decreased responsiveness towards inhibition of the PD -L1 
axis. Potentially , inhibition of FGFR can overcome this interaction and render tumors 
targetable b y the immune sy stem .
Immune responses and the tumor microenvironment are inadequatel y reflected in 
preclinical cancer models. We therefore aim to analy ze selected immune parameters 
before and during BAY1163877 treatment in paired biopsies and in serum of biom arker -
selected patients. Fresh tumor tissue will be used to assess immune parameters indicating a 
T cell response against the tumor tissue. This will be done b y performing gene expression 
profiling (nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel) and immunohistochemistry for 
CD8+ T cell infiltration and PD -L1 expression on the tumor tissue. Peripheral blood will 
be used to collect serum to determine cy tokine levels (IL -6, IFN -gamma, and other 
cytokines if needed). Aim of the assessment of peripheral bl ood is to search for changes in 
this easily  accessible specimen that reflect the immune response in the tumor tissue.
Guidance regarding selected adverse events of special interest is provided in Section 8.4.3. 
Additional details can be found in the IB.
Benefit -risk assessment 
BAY 1163877 is expected to demonstrate clinical benefit as additional treatment for 
subjects with refractory , locally  advanc ed or metastatic solid tumors.
Taken all preclinical data together, BAY 1163877 has an acceptable safety
 profile with 
promising therapeutic efficacy . Subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events by  
the investigator for an y adverse events starting from baseline visit till the end of the study  
visit to ensure the safet y of subjects.
The subjects may  not personally  benefit from participation in the trial. They are the first to 
receive BAY 1163877 that may  possibl y become the standard of care. However, the 
therap y being tested is new, and the side effects in humans are unknown. Subjects 
participating in this trial will be seen frequentl y by qualified health care professional who 
provide care and closel y monitor and evaluate the subject’s response to the study  
medication, in terms of its safet y and effectiveness. Since there is often no alternative for 
subjects with advanced, refractory  cancer, the risk–benefit ratio for finding the MTD may  
therefore be acceptable to the subjects.

The study  shall be discontinued in the event of new findings that indicate that a relevant 
deterioration of the risk -benefit relationship is probable. On the basis of the data 
available to date, the conduct of the study  is regarded as justifiable.
In summary , this Phase I study of BAY 1163877 for the treatment of refractory , locally  
advanced or metastatic solid tumors is justifiable without exposing subjects to an undue 
risk.

6Study design -amended
Design overview
This is a Phase I, first -in-human, open -label, non -random ized, multi- center, 2- part, dose -
escalation study of BAY 1163877 in sequential cohorts of subjects with refractory, locally 
advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study  will be conducted at multiple centers 
worldwide.
Study  Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects with any  solid 
tumors (all comer) using an adaptive dose escalation design and expansion of cohort at 
MTD.
Study  Part 2 will explore further the safet y and PD of BAY 1163877 at the MTD 
identified in Part 1 in subjec ts with sqNSCL C, LAC, BC and SCCHN to seek any  
evidence of preliminary  clinical responses. Study  Part 2 may  start as soon as the MTD has 
been established in Part 1.
Study  Part 3 will expand the safet y database for patients on treatment with  BAY1163877 
at the MTD identified in Part 1 with sqNSCL C, LAC, and BC. In parallel, in Part 3 
additional efficacy  data will be collected and changes of selected immune parameters will 
be assessed.
The complete duration of the study  (Part 1 ,Part 2, and Part 3) depends on the number of 
dose-escalation steps in Part 1 and will be approximately  7 years.25

Planned sample size:
Subjects will be enrolled in the pre- treatment phase of the study  to recruit enough subjects 
with present high FGFR expression levels for the following stud y parts .
Targeted / planned enrollment:
 Study Part 1 / dose escalation (all comer) : The total number of subjects will 
depend on the number of cohorts necessary  to identify  the MTD. Relative bioavailability  
of the tablet formulation in comparison to the solution formulation will be performed in all 
subjects enrolled in one of the dose escalation cohorts; pharmacokinetic data are needed in 
a minimum of 3 subjects for relative bioa vailability  assessment.
 Study Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer) : Additional subjects will be enrolled to 
have 20 evaluable “all comer” subjects treated at MTD.
 Study Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCLC + LAC + BC + SCCHN) : additional 
subjects will be enrolled to have 20 evaluable subjects with sqNSCL C or LAC and at least 
30, up to a maxim um of 50 evaluable subjects with BC and at least 8 subjects with 
SCCHN treated at MTD.26
 Study Part 3 / MTD expansion 
“Safety cohort” (sqNSCLC + LAC + BC): 
additional subjects will be enrolled to have approximately  20subjects with sqNSCL C or 
LAC and approximately  
20subjects with BC treated at MTD.27
PK assessments will be performed in all subjects participating in stud y Part 1 / dose 
escalation and MTD expan sion (all comer) and study  Part 3/ MTD expansion “Safet y 
cohort” .Additionally , PK assessments are planned in at least 12 subjects participating in 
study  Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN) such that valid PK 
data are available in 8 subject sand in approximately 8 subjects of the MTD expansion 
cohorts with impaired renal function at baseline .26Food effect PK assessment is planned 
in approximately  8subjects enrolled in the MTD expansion cohorts (study Part 1 and Part 
2). Subjects participating in “food effect assessment” in study  Part 2 may  be included in 
the total sample size of 12 if all protocol requirements are met.
All subjects participating i n either of the 3MTD expansion cohorts (Part 1 ,Part 2 and Part 
3despite subjects with impaired renal function )28will have 2 PK samples drawn for the 
purpose of exposure -response modelling on Day  1 of Cy cles 2, 3, 4, and 5 (1 blood sample 
just before the morning dose of BAY 1163877 and 1 blood sample between 0.5 and 1.5 
hours post -dose). Subjects in Part 3 will provide one PK sample within 1 hour of biopsy  
collection in Cy cle 2 .29The dose needs to be taken under supervision and the time

Note: Treatment with BAY 1163877 at MTD in Part 1 (expansion cohort “all comer”) ,  
Part 2 (expansion cohort sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN) , and Part 3 (expansion cohort 
“Safet y cohort” , sqNSCLC + L AC + BC) can run in parallel.32
 Follow- up (FU)
-End of Treatment (EOT) visit 0 -14 day s after last dose of BAY 1163877
-Follow- up (FU) visit at 30 -35 day s after dose of BAY 1163877
The first screening visit is scheduled within 7 days / within 28 day s before administration 
of the first dose of BAY 1163877. The informed consent form will be signed by  the 
subject before or at the first screening visit (please refer to Section 13.2). The screening 
period ends just before start of treatment.
The treatment period starts on the day  of the first administration of study  treatment either 
on Cy cle1, Day  1 or on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 (“tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect 
assessment”) and ends with the last day  when the study  medication is administered in

administration of the last dose of BAY 1163877. The Follow- up visit for subjects who 
either discontinue prematurely  or finish dosing with BAY 1163877 will be performed 30 -
35 day s after the last study drug treatment. The re will be no long -term (survival) follow -
up (FU) period. 
Treatment: Subjects with PK assessment (all subjects of study  Part 1 and3and at least 
12subjects of study  Part 2 and approximately 8 subjects of the MTD expansion cohorts 
with impaired renal function at baseline ) will receive BAY 1163877 (tablet or solution) on 
a continuous schedule starting with single -dose administration on Cy cle 1, Day  1, 
followed b y a “drug -free day ” (to enable s ingle dose PK assessments , except for subjects 
in Part 3 who will receive BAY 1163877 twice daily  continuously  with no “drug free 
day”).33Treatment with BAY 1163877 will resume on Day  3 of C ycle 1 if no protocol -
defined dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) are reported. Starting on Cy cle 1, Day  3, the study  
drug will be self- administered twice daily  for the remaining 19 days of Cy cle 1. For 
subsequent cy cles, stud y drug will be administered twice dail y for 21 day s until disease 
progression or as long as clinical benefit is assumed by  the investigator or until 
unacceptable toxicity  occurs .
In one of the dose escalation cohorts in study  Part 1 (“tablet bridging cohort”) , relative 
bioavailability  of the tablet formulation will be assessed by  administration of a sing le dose 
of the tablet formulation on Cy cle 1, Day  -3. Starting with Cy cle 1, Day  1, subjects 
enrolled in the “ tablet bridging cohort” will continue with the solution formulation as 
described above. Depending on the results from the relative bioavailability assessment, 
subjects who initially  start with solution formulation may  be switched to tablet 
formulation in later cy cles.
Approximately  8 subjects enrolled in the MTD expansion cohorts (study  Part 1 and Part 2) 
will receive single doses of BAY 1163877 on Cycle 1, Day  -3, after consumption of a 
high-fat, high -calorie breakfast and on C ycle 1, Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 
8hours followed b y treatment according to the schedule described above starting on 
Cycle1, Day  3.
Subjects without PK asse ssment in study  Part 2 will receive BAY 1163877 (tablet or 
solution) twice daily  from Cy cle 1, Day  1 ongoing. 
At home, subjects will document the intake of study  drug in a diary  (see Section 8.7).
Subjects will continue receiving treatment until tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity , 
consent withdrawal, or subject withdrawal from the study  at the discretion of the 
Investigator or his/her designated associate(s), see Section 7.2.1 . As long as, in the 
judgment of the subject and the investigator, some benefit with evidence of tumor 
reduction or stable disease is being derived, dosing with BAY 1163877 may  continue.
Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
An adaptive dose escalation design will be used to determine the MTD in study  Part 1 (all

comer). The MTD is defined as the highest dose that can be given such that not more than 
20% ofsubjects experience a DLT during Cy cle 1.
Without the occurrence of toxicities, dose escalation could be stopped and RP2D may  be 
determined based on PK and/or PD results . The decision to continue treatment for an 
individual subjects will be made b y the investigator according to the criteria specified in 
the protocol (Section 8.4).
Each cohort will be evaluated after all subjects have completed the first 21 day s of 
treatment (which will subsequently  referred to as “Cy cle 1”) or earl y discontinued.
Safety  monitoring will occur by  telephone conferences with participation of the 
investigators and the sponsor on a regular basis.
At the time of dose escalation the avai lable clinical safet y information is discussed in a 
telephone conference b y the involved investigators and representatives from the Sponsor 
including the Study  Medical Expert as well as representatives of other clinical and if 
required further contributing functions (drug safety  monitoring team –DSMT) . During 
this telephone conference it will be judged if dose escalation can proceed as planned 
according to the procedure outlined below. Dose escalation for subsequent cohorts will 
only be considered after fu ll evaluation of at least Cy cle 1 safet y data from the previous 
cohort.
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03) will be used to grade toxicities / adverse events. I n general, 
the assessm ent of relationship between adverse events (AEs) and BAY 1163877 will be 
performed as described in Section 9.5.1.2.3 .
The dose escalation will be pe rformed as follows:
 Initiall y 3 subjects per dose level will be enrolled. In case 2 or more sites are 
conducting the dose escalation part, the initial enrolment of 4 subjects per dose level is 
optional. 
 The starting dose of BAY 1163877 is 50 mg given as a single dose on C ycle 1, 
Day 1, and twice dail y (b.i.d.) from Cycle 1, Day 3 (100 mg / day).
 The maximum dose escalation will be 2- fold.
 Possible daily  doses of BAY 1163877 starting from 100mg in increments of 
100mg.
 The possible maximum dose of BAY 116387 7 is considered to be 550 mg b.i.d. 
(1100 mg / day ). Higher doses might be explored after discussions between sponsor and 
investigators.
 If at least 1 subject out of 3 or 1 out of 4 in a cohort has DLTs or if at least 
2subjects report drug -related AEs (CTCAE v4.03) of Grade ≥ 2, an y further dose 
escalation, de -escalation or cohort expansion will be decided in consultation between all 
inves tigator(s), and the sponsor (within the DSMT) after consideration of all available 
safet y data of the previous cohorts. An y subsequent dose will be selected in order to 
determine the MTD.

Model -based dose -response anal ysis of the DLT rates will be perform ed during these 
interim reviews in order to guide the dose decision (see details in Section 16.4). The 
model -based dose selection procedure is considering data at all dose levels (not just at the 
last cohort). The dose predicted to y ield 20% DLT rates will be reported from that model 
as a best candidate for the next cohort. 
The final decision about the next dose will be made by  the sponsor in consultation with all 
investigators (DSMT). 
If the selected dose is larger than the last dose tested, then escalation will be pursued. If it 
is lower, a de- escalation step will occur. 
Cohort expansion will occur when a previousl y tested dose is selected again for the next 
cohort of 3 subjects. 
Expansions at any  given dose up to a total of 9 subjects are allowed. In principle, the 
selection of a ne xt dose level where the predicted DL T rate is close to 20% should insure 
that the next dose tested will remain safe. 
Nevertheless, the following constraint will be added in order to protect subject safet y 
during the adaptive dose selection decisions:
-If 2out of 3 (or 2 out of 4), at least 4 out of 6 (or at least 5 out of 9) subjects 
experience DLTs at a given dose level, only lower doses will be given in all 
subsequent cohorts because the probability  that the dose is above the MTD is very  
large (above 95. 4%).
-The dose -escalation procedure will be stopped as soon as:
othe MTD has been defined with good precision (i.e., the coefficient of variation for 
the MTD is lower than or close to 40%) 
or
oat an y time when the selected dose level for the next cohort has alread y been given 
in 9 subjects.
If the dose escalation stops, the sample size for the MTD cohort will be expanded up to a 
total of 20 evaluable subjects (stud y Part 1 / MTD expansion cohort (all comer)).
No intra -subject dose escalation is permitted. Dose interruptions and / or dose reductions 
may be required based on individual safety  and tolerability .
Pharmacokinetics (PK):   Single -and multiple -dose PK of BAY 1163877 will be 
evaluated in plasma samples collected on C ycle 1, Day -3 in the “tablet bridgi ng cohort”, 
and on Cy cle 1, Day s 1 and 15 in all subjects participating in Part 1 (all comer) and in at 
least 12 subjects participating in Part 2 (sqNSCLC + L AC + BC + SCCHN). In 
approximately  8subjects enrolled in the MTD expansion cohorts (study  Part 1 and Part 2), 
the effect of food on the PK of BAY 1163877 will be determined b y comparing exposures 
on Cy cle 1 Day  -3 (administration after consumption of a high- fat, high -calorie breakfast) 
and Cy cle1 Day  1 (administration after an overnight fast of at le ast 8 hours), see 
Section 8.1.  In the MTD expansion cohorts, in approximately 8 subjects with moderately
impaired renal function at baseline (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 30 to 59 
mL/min/1.73 m2according to the modified diet in renal disease [MDRD] abbreviated 
formula), serial PK blood samples will be collected on Cy cle 1 Day  1 and Day  15.In all

will be evaluated in plasma samples collected on Cy cle 1, Day  15.34
Plasma concentration of BAY 1163877 will be measured using a validated method. 
In approximately  8 subje cts enrolled in MTD expansion cohorts (stud y Part 1 and Part 2), 
urine will be collected for 24 hours after dosing on Cy cle 1, Day  1 (concurrently  with 
plasma PK samples) and anal yzed using validated method.
Exploratory  monitoring of metabolites may  also b e performed in pooled plasma samples 
(most likely  at the MTD or the therapeutic dose) and urine samples. 
The time points for PK sampling and further details are provided in Section 9.4.2.1 .
Safety / tolerability:   Drug safet y will be monitored and evaluated continuously 
throughout the stud y, including a 30 -day follow up period (time window +5 day s) after 
administration of the last dose of BAY 1163877. 
Safety  will be assessed by  close monitoring and timely  assessment of adverse events 
(AEs), laboratory  parameters (blood tests, urinal ysis), vital signs (blood pressure, heart 
rate), subject’s medical condition (phy sical examination including weight), 
ophthalmological examination , general well -being and activities of dail y life (Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status). 35
Each subject will be regularly  assessed in each cy cle for potential AEs and disease related 
signs and s ymptoms. The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03) will be used to grade toxicities / AEs.
Subject data will be analyzed for evidence of cumulative toxicity  with repeated cy cles of 
therap y.
Women of c hildbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy  test performed within 
7days prior to first treatment with BAY 1163877 (i.e. 1 week before C ycle 1, Day  1 or 
Cycle 1, Day  -3, if applicable). 
Cardiovascular assessment: Blood pressure (BP) and heart rat e (HR) will be measured at 
screening, frequently  on PK profile day s in Cy cle 1, and once at all other visits during 
treatment and follow up. The time points for monitoring BP and HR on the day s of PK 
sampling and further details are provided in Section 9.4.1.1 .
Assessment of immune priming (Part 3) : Selected parameters of immune response will 
be measured in fresh tumor tissue at baseline and again bet ween Cy cle 2, Day  1 and C ycle 
2, Day  21; and in peripheral blood at the following timepoints: at baseline; Cy cle 1, Day  
8; Cy cle 2, Day  1; Cy cle 2, Day  15; and on the day ofthesecond biops y.
Fresh tumor tissue will be used to assess immune parameters indicating a T cell response 
against the tumor tissue. This will be done by  perform inggene expression profiling

collect serum to determine cy tokine levels (IL-6, IFN- gamma, and other cytokines if 
needed) . Aim of the assessment of peripheral blood is to search for changes in this easily  
accessible specimen that r eflect the immune response in the tumor tissue .36
Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12-lead ECG readings will be performed at screening, on 
Cycle 1, Day s -3 and -2 (“tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect assessment”, only ), on 
Cycle 1, Day s 1, 2, and 15, thereaft er on Day  1 of each subsequent Cy cle, and at the EOT 
visit. I n all Cy cles  and at the EOT visit, ECG readings will be performed as single 
readings. The time points for ECG readings and further details are provided in 
Section 9.5.3.4 .
Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers: In an attempt to demonstrate the mechanism of 
action of BAY 1163877 biomarkers will be studied in tissue samples (for details see 
Section 9.4.4 ). 
Biomarker analysis in tumor tissue: Biomarker analy sis will be done at screening for 
subject stratification in the MTD expansion cohorts (Part 1: all comer; Part 2: sqNSCL C + 
LAC + BC + SCCHN ; Part 3: sqNSCL C + LAC + BC ) according to FGFR expression 
levels / FGFR mutation using either an archival tumor tissue specimen or fresh tumor 
biopsy  material (see Section 7.1.1 , inclusion criteria).37
Analy sis of phospho -extracellular signal -regulated kinase 1/2 levels, (p -ERK1/2) will be 
done at screening and on Cy cle 2, Day  1 for all subjects of study  Part 1 and Part 2 who are 
willing to undergo a biopsy  both at screening and on Cy cle 2, Day  1.38Both biopsies are 
mandatory  for “all comer” subjects included in the MTD expansion cohort of Part 1 
(please refer to Section 7.1.1 for details).
Tumor response evaluation: Computed tomography  (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of all anatomic regions involved with the disease will be performed at 
screening (baselin e), at the end of C ycle 2 and thereafter every third cycle to assess tumor 
response using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1. 
(RECI STv1.1) (1).
Response evaluation according to RECI ST v1.1 can be done up to 5 day s after CT / MR 
scan. 
Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) : The dose recommended for Phase II studies with 
BAY 1163877 will be determined by  the investigators and the sponsor (DSMT) at the end 
of this study  (after Part 2) after having reviewed the data from all dose levels evaluated 
including PK data, overall incidence and severit y of AEs, cardiac safet y, and amount of

6.1 Primary variable(s)
This is primarily  a descri ptive safet y and tolerability Phase I stud y. The primary variable 
for MTD determination will be the incidence of DL Ts during the first 21 day s of treatment 
(Cycle 1). The primary  study  outcome is the MTD being defined as the maximum dose at 
which the incid ence of DLTs during C ycle 1 is below 20%. 
Primary  PK parameters are provided in Section 9.4.2.2. 
6.2 Justification of the design -amended
For stud y objectives please see Section 4.
The study  will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide to ensure recruitment of a 
sufficient number of subjects with advanced solid organ malignancies. The sites must be 
specialized in tumor assessment according to RECIST 1.1 and must be well equipped to 
conduct the efficacy  and safet y evaluations required by the protocol.
Only  subjects for whom in the opinion of t he investigator, experimental therapy  with 
BAY 1163877 may  be beneficial are allowed to participate. L ife expectancy in most of 
those subjects is expected to be about 3 months. Dosing with BAY 1163877 may  continue 
without evidence of tumor reduction or sta ble disease as long as, in the judgment of the 
investigator, some benefit is being derived. The inclusion of a placebo control or blinding 
of the treatment is considered not applicable for the objectives of this dose -escalation 
study  (identification of MTD / RP2D).
The open -label, non -randomized, dose -escalating design is the standard design to define 
the safet y profile, MTD, PK, PD biomarker and tumor response profile in subjects with 
advanced malignancies.
Once DLTs are reported, the use of adaptive dose- selection decisions according to pre -
specified safet y rules based on actual DLT observations is chosen because it permits a 
better determination of the MTD with reduced sample size, while limiting the number of 
subjects being treated with toxic doses.
The "all-comers" design in study  Part 1 will allow for expedited accrual of subjects and 
evaluation of safet y in subjects with varied solid tumor types (an y solid tumors).
Study Part 3 / “Safety cohort” (sqNSCLC + LAC + BC)39
Preliminary  safet y data of patients with advanced cancer treated with BAY 1163877
showed a favorable safety profile (details can be found in the current version of the IB). 
However, sample size is still limited in selected indications (sqNSCL C, LAC, BC) and 
additional safet y data  will be g enerated in Study  Part 3 “Safet y cohort” .In parallel, 
additional efficacy  data will be collected and changes of selected immune parameters will 
be assessed in Part 3.

It was shown that FGFR3 expression is inversely correlated to programmed death -ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression and T cell infiltration in tumor tissue of patients with BC (40). This 
finding was confirmed in archival biops y samples collected in study 16443 . A similar 
correlation was detected in patients with sqNSCLC and L AC in study  16443.
Recently , the PD-1 and PD-L1 inactivating antibod iesreceived accelerated approval b y 
the FDA for patients with BC. It was demonstrated that patients with a low expressio n of 
PD-L1 had a smaller chance to respond to atezolizumab treatment. 
It is assumed that a causal relationship between FGFR expression and T cell exclusion 
leads to low PD -L1 levels and decreased responsiveness towards inhibition of the PD -L1 
axis. Potent ially, inhibition of FGFR can overcome this interaction and render tumors 
targetable b y the immune sy stem.
Immune responses and the tumor microenvironment are inadequatel y reflected in 
preclinical cancer models. We therefore aim to analy ze selected immune parameters 
before and during BAY1163877 treatment in paired biopsies and in serum of biomarker -
selected cancer patients. Fresh tumor tissue will be used to assess immune parameters 
indicating a T cell response against the tumor tissue. This will be done b y performing gene 
expression profiling (nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel) and 
immunohistochemistry  for CD8+ T cel l infiltration and PD -L1 expression on the tumor 
tissue. Peripheral blood will be used to collect serum to determine cy tokine levels (IL -6, 
IFN-gamma, and other cy tokines if needed). Aim of the assessment of peripheral blood is 
to search for changes in thi s easily  accessible specimen that reflect the immune response 
in the tumor tissue.
6.3 End of study
For each participating EU country , the end of the study  according to the EU Clinical Trial 
Directive will be reached when the last visit of the last subject (L PLV) for all centers in 
the respective country  has occurred. 
As for this study , the primary outcome will be analy zed at 6 months from last patient first 
visit (L PFV) or after LPLV, whatever comes first. 
The end of the stud y as a whole will be the date wh en the clean data base is available.
However, t he LPLV date can also be reached based on the last patient stopping study  
treatment , switching to a roll-over study , or being switched to commercial drug suppl y 
with no cost to the patient. 
If the trial is stopped but benefits are observed for patients, further treatment options may  
be discussed and agreed between the investigator, sponsor and the patients.
See also Sections 8.2and 8.8for further details on the roll- over stud y.

7.1.3 Justification of sele ction criteria
The selection criteria are chosen to ensure that subjects with specific risks for 
administration of the study drugs and / or subjects with conditions which may  have an 
impact on the aims of the study  are excluded.
7.1.4 Justification for gender se lection
As this is a Phase 1, dose- escalation trial, no specific gender distribution is necessary . 
The envisaged indication for BAY 1163877 is treatment of refractory , locally  advanced or

metastatic solid tumors in males and females. The proportion of male and female subjects 
enrolled in this study  depends only  on the availability  of eligible subjects at the study  site. 
7.2 Withdraw al of subjects from study
7.2.1 Withdrawal - amended
Subjects will be withdrawn from the stud y for the following reasons:
 Consent withdrawal
-At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative
-At any  time during the study  and without giving reasons, a subject may  decline to 
participate further. The subject will not suffer an y disadvantage as a result.
 Substantial non -compliance with study  procedures
-Subject who is off study  drug (BAY 1163877) longer than 8 consecutive day s in 
Cycle 1 
-Subjects lost to follow -up
 Violation of in - / exclusion criteria (subject no longer eligible for the study)
-If the subje ct develops conditions which would have prevented his / her entry  into 
the study  according to the in -/ exclusion criteria, he / she must be withdrawn 
immediately  if safet y is concerned; in other cases, the investigator will decide 
whether there is a confl ict with the study  objectives.
-The development of a second malignancy  that requires a different treatment.
-Development of an y intercurrent illness or situation which may , in the judgment of 
the investigator, affect assessments of clinical status and stud y endpoints to a 
relevant degree.
-Subjects with a positive urine beta -HCG test confirming pregnancy . Pregnancy  
will be reported under the same timelines as a serious adverse event.
 Unacceptable toxicity
-If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation of study  would be harmful to the 
subject’s well -being
-Severe allergic reactions, such as exfoliate ery throdermia, anaph ylaxis, or vascular 
collapse
-Any other potential adverse reaction deemed sufficiently  serious to warrant 
discontinuation of treatment by  theinvestigator or his designated associate(s).
-Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may , in the opinion of the investigator 
or his designated associate(s), have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity

or otherwise confound the results.
-Retinal detachment of grade 2 or higher according to CTCAE v4.03 46
-AST/AL T > 3xUL N with concomitant bilirubin > 2xULN in the absence of 
another reason for these elevations46
-AST/AL T > 8xUL N or AST/AL T > 5xUL N for > 2 weeks if no other reason is 
found for these elevations46
 Tumor progression
-Subjects with documented disease progression, unless the investigator (in 
consultation with the sponsor) deems that continued treatment is appropriate.
Patients may  continue if they experience clinical benefit as assessed by  the 
investigator, do not exhibi t rapid disease progression and have stable performance 
status.  I n addition, treatment bey ond progression should not delay  an imminent 
intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e .g.CNS 
metastases).46
 At specific request of the sponsor
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) and the subject’s medical record.
A sub ject who discontinues study  participation prematurely  for any  reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the subject has alread y been administered at least 1 dose of the study drug 
(BAY 1163877).
A subject who, for an y reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selectio n criteria), terminates the 
study  before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see above) is regarded a 
“screening failure”.
Any subject removed from the study  will remain under medical supervision until 
discharge or transfer is medicall y acceptable. 
Details for the premature termination of the study  as a whole (or components thereof 
[e.g. centers, dose steps]) are provided in Section 12.
7.2.2 Replacement
Subjects who discontinue due to a DLT will NOT be replaced.
Subjects who discontinue during the first cy cle of therap y (Cycle 1) due to any  reason 
other than a DLT and / or rela ted toxicity , and subjects who took less than 80% of the 
required stud y drug (BAY 1163877) in Cycle 1 (see Section 8.7) will be replaced to 
ensure 3 evaluable subjects per cohort for the determination of MTD and PK of 
BAY 1163877. Subjects who discontinue after the first cy cle (C ycle 1) will not be

replaced.
Subjects enrolled in Study Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer) with insufficient paired 
biopsy  samples will be replaced to ensure at least 10 subjects with paired biopsy  samples 
for p -ERK1/2 analy sis.
7.3 Subject identification
Each subject who signs a consent form for the study  will be assigned a unique 9 -digit 
screening number (SNR) in ascending order of recruitment into the study  at that center. 
The first 2 digits will refer to the country , the subsequent 3 digits to the site number, and 
the following 4 digits will be subject identifiers. 
This SNR will be entered into the electronic case record form (eCRF) regardless of 
whether the subject is actually  treated with the study  drug (BAY 1163877). 
Subjects who are not treated will be considered screening failures. The reason for 
screening failure should be recorded in the eCRF.

In stud y Part 1 / dose escalation + MTD expansion (all comer), twice dail y dosing of 
BAY 1163877 follows the dose -escalation scheme described in Section 6(Determination 
of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)).
Study  Part 1 starts with single -dose administration of 50 mg BAY 1163877 on Cy cle 1, 
Day 1. After a “drug -free day ” (Cycle 1, Day 2), mult iple doses of BAY 1163877 will be 
given twice dail y in an adaptive dose escalation manner, starting at a dose of 100 mg / day 
(50 mg b.i.d.), with possible dose steps of 100 mg / day . The dose -escalation design 
proceeds with cohorts of 3 subjects. Cohort e xpansion, increase or decrease in dose will be 
decided b y the DSMT after consideration of all available safety data of the previous cohort 
(see Section 6). The dose decision will be guided by  model -based dose -response anal ysis 
of the DLT rates (see Section 16.4).
In the “tablet bridging cohort” , relative bioavailability  of the tablet formulation in 
comparison to the solution formulation will be assessed b y administration of a single dose 
of the tablet formulation on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 in at least 3 subjects. Starting with Cy cle 1, 
Day 1, subjects e nrolled in this cohort will continue with the solution formulation as 
described above.

All investigational drugs used during the trial will be stored at the site in accordance with 
instructions given b y the clinical supplies delivering department, and will be inac cessible 
to unauthorized personnel. 
Study  medication needs to be stored according to the label text. For special storage 
conditions see investigator site file (ISF) and trial master file (TMF).
In case patients are transferred to a roll -over stud y (ROS), drug formulation and / or 
dosage might change compared to this study  depending on the course of the clinical 
development. 
8.3 Treatment assignment
After completion of the screening examinations, subjects who meet the entry criteria will 
be placed in the current cohort at the specified dose level. A random list is not necessary  
because this is a non -randomized open label clinical trial. All subjects will be assigned a 
unique screening number (SNR), whether or not they are treated after the first signed 
informed consent. For subject identification, see Section 7.3.
8.4 Dosage and administration
Please refer to Sections 8.1and 8.2for the dose, route of administration, formulation and 
duration of treatment. 
8.4.1 Estimation of safe starting dose
Study  Part 1 / dose escalation (all comer)
The first cohort is treated at a starting dose of 100 mg / day  of BAY 1163877 (50 mg 
b.i.d.) which i s considered to be safe based on extrapolation from animal toxicological 
data. 
The dose level for each dose- escalation step will be defined primarily  based on the results 
with regard to safet y, tolerability, and, if available, PK of the previous dose steps. For this 
reason, an evaluation will be conducted after each dose step and the decision for the next 
step will be made b y the study  team. If necessary , the dose of the next step will be 
adopted. Details for the dose -escalating steps are given in Section 6(Determination of the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)).
8.4.2 Selection and timing of dose for each subject -amended
Details for the dose -escalating steps in study  Part 1 / dose escalation + MTD expansion 
cohort (all comer) as well a s extent and duration of drug exposure of the individual subject 
are given in Section 6(Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)). Safety
monitoring will occur b y teleconferences with participation of the investigators and 
representatives of the sponsor on a regular basis (DSMT). Dose escalation for subsequent 
cohorts will only  be considered after all subjects from the previous cohort have completed 
the first cy cle or early  discontinued.

Evidence of tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity , consent withdrawal or subject’s 
withdrawal from the study at the discretion of the Investigator may  lead to termination of 
treatment (see Section 7.2.1 ).
8.4.2.2 Mode of administration
BAY 1163877 will be administered per os (p.o.). Subjects participating in “food effect 
assessment” will receive a single dose after consumption of high -fat, high -calorie meal 
(Cycle 1, Day  -3) and a single dose after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours (Cy cle 1, Day  
1) see Section 8.4.2.2.1 .
The read y-to-use solution will be administered directl y and undiluted via disposable 
syringe into the mouth of the subject. Immediatel y after administration, the subject has to 
drink a glass of water (approximately  200 mL / 7 ounces).
BAY 1163877 tablets should be taken with a glass of wat er (approximately  200 mL / 
7ounces). Tablets should be swallowed intact and not chewed.
Subjects should not take additional doses of BAY 1163877 to compensate for a missed 
dose.
8.4.2.2.1 Food effect assessment
To assess the effect of food on the PK of BAY 1163877, a single dose of BAY 1163877 
will be administered immediately (within 5 minutes) after consumption of a high -fat, high -
calorie breakfast on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 followed by  PK profiling in subjects participating in 
the MTD expansion cohorts of study  Part 1 and Part 2.  
Examples of high -fat, high -calorie breakfast: 
A)50 grams of smoked cooked ham, 30 grams of chicken liver sausage, 50 grams of 
rye bread, 7 ounces (210 mL ) whole milk, 40 grams of butter, 30 grams of butter 
cheese and 17 Crispbread Wasa Mjölk
B)2 eggs (fried), 2 strips of bacon, 2 slices of bread toast, 8 ounces (240 mL) whole 
milk and 3 teaspoons of butter (for fry ing and for toast) 
High -fat, high -calorie breakfast may  be adapted depending on the country  while 
maintaining similar fat and calorie co ntent (approximately  50 % fat and 800 to 1000 
calories). Breakfast should be consumed within 25 minutes. No snack is permitted for 
4hours after stud y drug administration.  
BAY 1163877 will not be administered on C ycle 1, Day -2 and Day  -1.
A single dose of BAY 1163877 will be administered on Cy cle 1, Day  1 after an overnight 
fast of at least 8 hours (water is allowed ad libitum ) followed b y PK profiling. No food or 
snack is permitted for 4 hours after drug administration, but water is allowed 1 hour after
dosing.  
Study  drug will not be administered in the evening of Cy cle 1, Day  1 and on Cy cle 1, 
Day 2 (“drug -free day ”). 
Starting with Cy cle 1, Day  3, BAY 1163877 will be taken twice dail y.

8.4.2.3 Treatment duration
BAY 1163877 will be administered on a continuo us schedule in at least one 21 -day Cycle 
with no break between cycles until progression or as long as clinical benefit is assumed by  
the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity  occurs.
For subjects in the “tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect asses sment”, treatment starts 
on Cy cle 1, Day  -3.
For all other subjects, treatment starts on Cy cle 1, Day  1.  
Further details on dosing schedule are provided in Section 8.4.2.1 . 
8.4.3 Dose modification and delays -amended
Doses of study  drug (BAY 1163877) may be delay ed or reduced in case of clinically  
significant hematologic and other toxicities that are possibly , probably  or definitely  related 
to study  drug therap y. Toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE v 4.03 (see 
Section 16.5). 
No intra -subject dose escalation will be permitted. However, the dose can be reduced or 
delay ed for an individual subject based on toxicities that are related to study  drug.
If a subject experiences a DL T during Cy cle1, the next dose of BAY 1163877 can be 
delay ed for up to 21 days, but only  in cases Grade 3 non-hematological toxicities persist 
no longer than 7 days.
All subjects who are re -treated following a DLT should undergo dose reduction (see Table 
8-3).
If the toxicity  resolves to Grade 1, the next dosing of BAY 1163877 at 1 dose level 
below the current dose (see Table 6 -3) can be considered, provided that this dose level has 
been evaluated during the dose escalation part of the study. Detailed dos e adjustments for 
hematological toxicities are described in Table 8-4. If the subject was dosed at the starting 
dose level, the subject should be removed from the study . If the toxicity  fails to resolve to 
Grade 1within 21 days after the planned treatment date, the subject will be removed 
from the study . Subjects who expe rience a Grade 4 non- hematological toxicity  will be 
removed from the stud y. 
Drug -related adverse events of Grade 3 
For Grade 3 adverse event regarded as related to study  drug, the next dosing of 
BAY 1163877 can be delay ed for up to 21 days. If the to xicity  fails to resolve to 
Grade 1 within 21 days after the scheduled dosing date, the subject will be removed 
from the study . If the toxicity  resolves to Grade 1, the next dosing of BAY 1163877 at 1 
dose level below the current dose (see Table 8-5) can be considered, provided that this 
dose level has been evaluated during the dose escalation part of the study. Dose 
adjustments for toxicities are detailed in Table 8-3.
If the re -treatment reproduces the same toxicity  grade, the next dosing of BAY 1163877 
can be delay ed for up to 21 days until the toxicity  has resolved to Grade 1. Re -treatment 
is possible at 1dose level below the previous dose.

Retinal detachment
Patients that experience retinal detachment of grade 2 or higher according to CTCAE 
v4.03 have to be permanently  discontinued from study  treatment.  
8.4.4 Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)
Adverse events which qualify  as DLT s are causally  related to study  drug (while in turn not 
all related AEs are regarded as DLT). Dose- limiting toxicity  will be defined as an y of the 
following occurring during C ycle 1 of a dose level and regarded by  the investigators and / 
or sponsor to be r elated to BAY 1163877. The CTCAE v 4.03 will be used to assess 
toxicities / adverse events (see Section 16.5).
Hematological
 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3for more than 7 days
 Febrile neutropenia (a disorder characterized b y an ANC < 1,000/mm3and single 
temperature 38.3°C or sustained temperature of 38.0 °C for more than 1 hour)
 Platelets < 25,000/mm3
 Grade 3 hemorrhage associated with thrombocy topenia of ≥ Grade 3
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 65of 395
Non-hematological
 Non-hematologic Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity  (nausea and vomiting onl y if 
refractory  to anti- emetics; excluding alopecia ). A maximum duration of 48 hours of Grade 
3 nausea or vomiting will be allowed and not be considered DLT.
 Serum calcium (albumin -corrected) x phosphate product > 70 mg²/dL² 
(5.6mmol²/L ²) despite the use of phosphate binders 
Miscellaneous
In case an unexpected drug -related toxicity  is seen more frequently , this toxicity  may  be 
declared a DLT for the remainder of the study  after thorough consultation between the 
investigator and the sponsor. 
Any toxicity  thought to be related to BAY 1163877 that, at the discretion of the 
investigator, or his designated associate(s), is thought to warrant withholding the drug. 
Such toxicities might be Grade -1or Grade -2 toxicities which interfere with the activities 
of daily  life (e.g. long -lasting fatigue, or anorexia), making a dose reduction necessary  in 
order to ensure the subject’s compliance.
For cer tain toxicities such as laboratory  assessments without a clear clinical correlation 
(e.g. lipase increase without signs of a clinical pancreatitis), a discussion between the 
investigator and the sponsor may  take place if that adverse event should be assess ed as 
DLT necessitating dose reduction.
8.5 Blinding
The study  is performed in a non -blinded design because this is considered adequate to 
meet the study  objectives. 
8.6 Drug logistics and accountability
Study  medication will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with good clinical 
practice (GCP) and GMP requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical supplies 
department of the sponsor (or its affiliate / contract research organization (CRO)), and will 
be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage conditions and a complete 
record of batch numbers and expiry  dates can be found in the Sponsor study  file; the site -
relevant elements, of this information will be available in the I SF. The responsible site 
personnel will confirm receipt of study  drug in writing and will use the study  drug onl y 
within the framework of this clinical study  and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, 
distribution, return and destruction (if an y) of the study  drug must be properly  documented 
according to th e sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures.
Written instructions on medication destruction will be made available to affected parties as 
applicable.

8.7 Treatment compliance
Treatment compliance
The first administration of study  medication (BAY 1163877) will be done with a member 
of the site team. This person will ascertain and document that the subject receives the 
treatment as planned.
On the following day s the subject will self- administer (or a caregiver will administer) 
BAY 1163877 after he / she has been informed about the correct dosing schedule. 
Plasma / serum concentrations will give additional information about the subjects’ 
treatment compliance.
At home, subjects will document the intake of study drug (date and time of dosing) as well 
as the administ ered dose on a compliance sheet / paper diary  (source document to verify  
treatment compliance), see Section 9.6.1 . 
The packages of stud y medicatio n have to be brought back to the trial site for an additional 
control. 
Compliance will be evaluated b y the investigational site based on drug accountability. 
The information recorded in the paper diary  will be transferred into the eCRF taking into 
accoun t each dose interruption and / or any  individual changes in dosing. 
A compliance of at least 80% is required, meaning documented intake of at least 80% of 
the planned study  medication (80 % = 32 doses or 16 day s in C ycle 1 with PK assessment 
[Part 1 and P art 2 only ] and 34 doses or 17 days in ≥ Cy cles 2 and in C ycle 1 without PK 
assessment [including Part 3] ).52
Drug accountability
To have complete control over the distribution and use of the stud y medication, the drug 
accountability  must be performed befo re new medication is handed out to the subject.
8.8 Post- study therapy
Further treatment at the end of the study  will be at the discretion of the investigator.
At the conclusion of the study , patients who demonstrate clinical benefit may  be eligible 
to continue to receive study  drug. They  may receive further treatment, assessments and/or 
be followed either via a roll- over study  -subject to approval b y the compet enthealth 
authority  and ethics committee -or through an y other mechanism in accordance with local 
legal and compliance rules. This applies to patients on study  treatment and in follow -up.
In the event a roll -over study  is established, the present study  will end when all patient s 
have transitioned into the roll -over stud y or discontinued from this study for another 
reason (e.g. consent withdrawn, lost to follow- up, death). Until the transition to the roll -

over study , patients will continue to follow all th e procedures and visits required in the 
current version of the protocol.
8.9 Prior and concomitant therapy
For prior therap y, see Section 7.1.2 (Exclus ion criteria “Medication, drug use and special 
behavioral patterns”). 
Medication other than the investigational product must not be taken during the study  
without consulting the investigator. 
All therapies that are considered necessary  for the subject’s welfare and that are not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study  drug may  be given at the discretion 
of the investigator. 
Disease -specific anti -neoplastic therapies, including kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy , 
radiation therap y, or surgical intervention, are not allowed during study  treatment.
All concomitant medications (including start / stop dates, total daily  dose, and indication) 
must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and in the eCRF. Concomitant use 
of contrast media needs not to be recorded unless the subjects experiences and AE and 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the event might have been caused b y exposure to 
contrast media.
8.9.1 Drug- drug interactions relevant for BAY 1163877
Oxidative metabolism of BAY 1163877 is mainl y catal yzed by CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 
and to a lesser extent by  CYP2C9. Therefore, drugs and herbal preparations that are strong 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are not permitted during the stud y. Currently, there are 
no known approved drugs or herbal preparations that are strong CYP1A1 inhibitors or 
inducers. However, it should be noted that CYP1A1 is induced in smokers. The subjects 
who are current smokers and those with recent history of smoking may have lower 
plasma concentrations of BAY 1163877.
Initial in vitro study  results with BAY 1163877 indicate minor mechanism -based 
(irreversible) inhibition potential towards CYP 3A4 .Since several commonly  used drugs 
are metabolized b y CYP 3A4, subjects should be proactivel y closel y monitored for side 
effec ts of these comedic ations due to potentially  increased s ystemic exposure . 
In general, subjects should be closel y monitored for side effects of all concomitant 
medications regardless of elimination pathway , especiall y those with narrow therapeutic 
index. I f possible, narrow therapeutic index drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates should be 
avoided (see Section 16.11 ).
No data are available to evaluate the interaction between BAY 1163877 and radiation.
8.9.2 Prohibited concomitant therapy
Concomitant therap y with the following medication is NOT allowed:
 Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherap y during the stud y or within 5 -half-
lives prior to start of study treatme nt. Antibody  treatment should not be given within 6 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 68of 395
weeks before starting to receive stud y treatment . Acute toxic effects of previous anticancer 
chemotherap y or immunotherap y have to be normalized completely (excluding alopecia, 
anemia and / or h ypoth yroidism). Anticancer therapy  is defined as an y agent or 
combination of agents with clinically  proven anti -tumor activity  administered by  any route 
with the purpose of affecting the malignancy , either directly  or indirectl y, including 
palliative and therapeutic endpoints.
 Mitomy cin C, nitrosoureas or monoclonal antibodies with anticancer activity  (e.g. 
bevacizumab or cetuximab etc.) should not be given within 6 weeks before starting to 
receive study  treatment or within 6 weeks of pre -treatment biopsy  for biomark er (p-
ERK1/2) studies in case of performed biops y procedure 
 Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue.
 Investigational anti -tumor agents or anti -neoplastic chemo / hormonal / 
immunotherapy .
 Radiotherap y to target lesions (palliative radiotherapy is allow ed)
 CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: BAY 1163877 is mainly  metabolized by  
CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 and to a lesser extent by  CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and strong inducers of CYP3A4 are not permitted for 2 
weeks prior to star t of study  treatment or during the study . Concomitant use of moderate 
and weak CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided as clinically  significant decrease in plasma 
concentrations of BAY 1163877 cannot be ruled out. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers are shown in Section 16.11 .
 Concomitant use of herbal preparations containing CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. St 
John’s Wort) are not permitted during the study .
 Grap efruit and grapefruit juice (CYP3A4 inhibitor) consumption is not permitted 
during the stud y.
 If possible, narrow therapeutic index drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. 
alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, fentan yl, pimozide, quinidin e, 
sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be avoided
 Fluconazole is considered a moderate to strong inhibitor of CYP 2C9 and should 
be avoided, if possible.
 Therapies that are known to increase serum calcium and / or phosphate levels, 
especiall y calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, parath yroid hormone (parathormone).
Therapeutic monitoring should be performed consistent with the local clinical standard of 
care following dose modification of the investigational agent. In general, subjects should 
be closel y monito red for side effects of all concomitant medications regardless of path of 
elimination.
8.9.3 Permitted concomitant therapy -amended
 Subjects may receive supportive care for any  underly ing illness, including 
dexamethasone, G -CSF and other hematopoietic growth fa ctors to treat acute toxicities, 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the investigator’s discretion. 
 Additional concomitant medications such as low dose heparin, gonadotropin 
releasing hormone agonist or antagonist, antihistamines and intravenous fluid supply  are 
permitted, if clinically  indicated
 In view of the maximum dose of 800 mg b.i.d. , a risk for clinically  relevant drug 
interaction due to inhibition of BCRP and/or P-gp in the intestine for drugs with a low 
bioavailability  limited by P -gp and BCRP cannot be ruled out.  However, b ased on the 
maximum achievable plasma BAY 1163877 concentration, risk of clinically relevant drug 
interaction due to s ystemic inhibition of BCRP and P -gp is regarded as low.53
 Subjects taking narrow t herapeutic index medications should be monitored 
proactivel y.
 Antiemetic therap y is allowed.
 Treatment with “non -conventional therapies” (such as acupuncture), and vitamin / 
mineral supplements are permitted provided that they  do not interfere with the stu dy 
endpoints, in the opinion of the investigator (to be documented in the source notes and in 
the eCRF).

performed to obtain tumor material after subjects´ informed consent
All subjects enrolled into the study  will be listed on a subject enrollme nt log provided by  
the sponsor’s representatives.
9.1.2.1.2 Screening - amended
Pre-study  examinations will be performed within 7 day s / within 28 day s before first 
administration of BAY 1163877 (i.e. before C ycle 1, Day  1). Due to the fact that not all 
subjects may fulfill the inclusion / exclusion criteria, a higher number of subjects, than 
needed to be valid for the evaluation of the stud y, will be asked to participate in the pre -
study  (screening) examination. As soon as fulfillment of all criteria is confirmed, t he 
subject is included into the trial. In case all subjects are equally  qualified, decision will be 
made b y the sponsor or sponsor representative casting lots.

9.2 Population characteristics
9.2.1 Demographic
The following information will be collected and summarized as part of the demographic 
and baseline characteristics for all subjects e nrolled in this study : age, gender, ethnic 
group. The subjects of all races / ethnicity  can participate in the study  provided that they  
meet all eligibility  criteria.
9.2.2 Medical history
Medical history  findings (i.e. previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) meeting all criteria 
listed below will be collected:
 Not pertaining to the study indication
 Start before signing of the informed consent
 Considered relevant to the study
Detailed instructions on the differentiation between medical history  and AEs can be found 
in Section 9.5.1.1 .
9.2.3 Other baseline characteristics  
Other baseline characteristics to be obtained include 
 Tumor stage according to the I nternational Union Against Cancer (UICC), Tumor 
Node Metastasis (TNM) Classification of Malignant Tumors, 7th edition (UI CC-TNM 
v7, see Section 16.6).
 Presence of visceral or non-visceral metastases in subjects with metastatic disease
 Prior therap y received for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors:
-Neoadjuvant therap y:  Treatment (e.g. chemotherapy , radiation therap y, and 
hormone therap y) given a s a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, 
usually  surgery .
-Adjuvant therap y:  Additional cancer treatment given after the primary  treatment 
to lower the risk of cancer recurrence (e.g., chemotherap y, radiation therapy, 
hormone therap y, targeted therap y, or biological therap y). 
-Any other anticancer therapy  (to be specified in the eCRF)
 Smoking habits and alcohol consumption.
9.3 Efficacy
Efficacy  will be assessed by determining tumor response to therapy  as a secondary  
endpoint.
For each subject, the investigator will designate at least 1 and up to 5 measurable (if 
appropriate) or non -measurable lesions for response assessment. The most appropriate 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 84of 395
measures to evaluate the tumor status of a subject should be used. The investigator must 
enter a statement in the subject’s medical records clearl y defining the basis of his / her 
decision on subject disease status. 
The following standard assessments should be performed to evaluate the response of the 
tumors:
 Tumor response assessment f or measurable lesions (CT / MRI  scan) according to 
RECI ST, v1.1, see Section 9.3.1
All records and films of responding subjects (complete response, partial response, and 
stable disease) must be available for eventual extramural review of the tumor.
All measurable and evaluable disease will be assessed by  the identical method as used at 
baseline. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or 
calipers. 
9.3.1 Tumor evaluation -response assessment (RECIST)
In measurable lesions (i.e., at the primary  site, visceral or nodal [in ly mph nodes ≥1,5 cm] 
lesions), the objective response will be assessed b y CT / MRI  scan at the EOT visit a nd 
documented according to the revised RECIST guideline, Version 1.1 (RECIST, v1.1), see 
Section 16.8. The assessment will be done by  the investiga tors. No central evaluation is 
planned for this study .
CT / MRI  scans will be performed at the following time points:
 Screening (within 28 days prior to the first dose of BAY 1163877)
 At the end of C ycle 2 and every third subsequent Cycle (beginning with C ycle 5)
Results for these evaluations will be recorded with as much specificit y as possible so that 
pre-and post -treatment results will provide the best opportunity  for evaluation of tumor 
response. 
A zero should be recorded when a lesion has completely  resolved. Otherwise, 
disappearance of a lesion cannot be differentiated from a missing value.
The occurrence and location of new lesions should be recorded in the eCRF and the 
subject’s medical records.
In general, the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria (see Section 16.8). 
If radiographic changes are believed b y the investigator to be secondary  to drug induced 
inflammation and not tumor progression, the investigator may postpone a diagnosis of 
progressive disease (PD) until the next radiographic evaluation in the stud y.
All scans should be done with the identical moda lity (CT or MRI) and the identical 
technique (e.g., slice thickness, field of view) to those obtained at baseline. For a response 
to be scored as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), the response must be 
confirmed by a repeat CT scan (with cont rast) or MRI  scan (with and without contrast) 
performed not earlier than 4weeks after the response was first determined.

9.4 Clinical pharmacological parameters and procedures
9.4.1 Pharmacodynamics
9.4.1.1 Cardiovascular assessment
To assess a possible pharmacod ynamic e ffect of BAY 1163877 on cardiovascular 
function, a blood pressure (BP) / heart rate (HR) profile will be recorded b y an automated 
device as follows: 
-Subject seated for at least 2 minutes before measurement with their arms bared and 
supported at heart leve l.
-At screening, BP must be measured in both arms to see whether there is a difference 
in blood pressure readings between the subject’s right and left arm. If one arm has 
higher blood pressure than the other, that arm should be used for further BP 
measurem ents (all further BP measurements must be done on the same arm) 
-When blood pressure measurement and PK sample collection are scheduled at the 
same time point, subject’s blood pressure will be measured before collection of the 
PK sample.
BP and HR will be measured at the following time points:
 Screening (one measurement within 7 day s before start of treatment)
 Cycle 1, Day  -3 to Day  -1 (“tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect assessment” 
only)
-before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 (Day  -3), 24 (Day  -2) and 48 (Day  -1) hour(s) 
after single -dose administration 
 Cycle 1, Day  1 and Day  2
before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 (Day  1), and 24 (Day  2) hour(s) after single -dose 
administration 
 Cycle 1, Day  3
- before and 1, and 2 hour(s) after morning dose
 Cycle 1, Day 8 (one measurement)
 Cycle 1, Day  15
-before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hour(s) after morning dose (12-hour 
measurement before evening dose)
 Cycle ≥ 2 and follow up
-each visit (one measurement)
 Follow up

FU-visit (one me asurement)
If a reduction of s ystolic BP below 90 millimeters of mercury  (mmHg) or an increase in 
HR above 120 beats per minute (bpm) is detected, the assessment has to be repeated after 
2 hours.
When blood pressure measurement and PK sample collection are scheduled at the same 
time point, subject’s blood pressure will be measured before collection of the PK sample.
Details about ECGs readings are provided in Section 9.5.3.4 . 
9.4.1.2 Assessment of immune priming73
Assessment of immune response will be done at screening and during treatment for 
subjects in the “Safety cohort ” (Part 3 : sqNSCL C + LAC + BC ). For gene express ion 
profiling (nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel) and immunohistochemistry  for 
CD8+ T cell infiltration and PD -L1 expression a fresh tumor biospy  (e.g. obtained by  
endoscopic or ultrasound guided biops y) will be collected as follows:
 Study Part 3 / “Safet y cohort” (sqNSCLC + LAC + BC):
Screening:  Biops y is mandatory
Between C ycle 2, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 21:  Biopsy  is mandatory
Peripheral blood will be collected for determin ation of cy tokine levels (IL-6, IFN -gamm, 
and others if needed) at the following timepoints: at baseline; Cy cle 1, Day 8; Cy cle 2, 
Day 1; Cy cle 2, Day  15; and onthe day of the second biopsy .
9.4.2 Pharmacokinetics
9.4.2.1 Drug measurements - amended
Pharmacokinetics of BAY 1163877 will be evaluated on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 (“tablet bridging 
cohort” and “food effect assessment”, onl y), on Cycle 1, Day 1 after single -dose 
administration, and on Cy cle 1, Day  15 after multiple -dose administration of 
BAY 1163877 at the respective dose level achieved during dose escalation.
Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed in all subjects enrolled in Part 1 (dose 
escalation and MTD expansion (all comer) cohorts). The plan is to perform 
pharmacokinetic assessments in at least 12 subjects in Part 2 MTD expansion cohort 
(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN) such that valid PK data are available in 8 subjects. 
“Food effect assessment” will be performed in approximately  8 subjects enrolled in the 
MTD expansion cohorts (study  Part 1 and Part 2). In the MTD expansion cohorts
pharmacokinetic assessments will be p erformed in approximately 8 subjects with 
moderatel y impaired renal function at baseline (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 30 to 
59 mL /min/1.73 m2according to the modified diet in renal disease [MDRD] abbreviated

 Cycle 2: S ubjects in Part 3 / MTD expansion “Safety  cohort” will provide one PK 
sample within 1 hour of biopsy  collection in C ycle 2.75
In consultation with the investigators, if needed, up to three additional samples may  be 
collected during the study.
Whenever possible, all efforts should be made to adhere to the blood sampling schedule as 
given above. However, based on practical c onsiderations, the following time range is 
provided:  for planned time points ≤ 6 hours, PK samples should be collected within 
±15minutes of the planned time, and for planned time points > 6 hours, PK samples 
should be collected within ±30 minutes. Sampli ng times outside the suggested intervals 
will not be considered as protocol deviations. It is of importance that the actual date and 
time of blood sampling is documented in the eCRF and subject`s source document 
because PK calculations will be based on the actual sampling times relative to dosing 
times.
When blood pressure measurement and PK sample collection are scheduled at the same 
time point, subject’s blood pressure will be measured before collection of the PK sample .

plasma PK samples. For each subject, within each collection interval, the collected urine 
will be combined and the total volume of the combined urine will be determined. 
A representative aliquot of the pooled urine will be used to determine the concentration of 
BAY 1163877.
Plasma and urine concentrations of BAY 1163877 will be measured using a validated 
method. I nstructions for sample collection, processing, storage and shipment will be 
described in a separate document (e.g. lab manual).
Exploratory  monitoring of metabolit es may  also be performed in pooled plasma samples 
(most likely  at the MTD or the therapeutic dose) and in urine samples. 
9.4.2.2 Pharmacokinetic evaluation
PK parameters will be calculated b y non -compartmental anal ysis (NCA) according to 
current Bay er guidelines using WinNonlin software, in the latest version. PK parameters 
from NCA will be evaluated only  for those subjects meeting the PK validit y criteria 
(Section 10.2). Based on plasma concentration versus time results, the following 
parameters are planned to be calculated (see Table 9-1):

Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers:
In an attempt to demonstrate the mechanism of action of BAY 1163877, biomarkers will 
be studied in tissue samples.
Biomarker anal ysis in TUMOR TISSUE
Biomarker anal ysis will be d one at pre -screening for subject stratification in the MTD 
expansion cohorts (Part 1: all comer; Part 2: sqNSCLC + LAC + BC + SCCHN; Part 3
sqNSCL C + LAC + BC ) according to FGFR expression levels / FGFR mutation using 
either an archival tumor tissue specim en or fresh tumor biopsy  material (see Section 7.1.1 : 
Inclusion criteria, and Section 9.4.4.1 : Predictive marker investigation).76For anal ysis of 
phospho -extracellular signal -regulated kinase 1/2 levels, (p- ERK1/2) a tumor biospy  (e.g. 
obtained by  endoscopic or ultrasound guided biops y) will be collected as follows: 
 Study  Part 1 / dose escalation (all comer):
-Screening:  Biops y is optional* (p -ERK1/2) 
-Cycle 2, Day  1:  Biops y is optional* (p- ERK 1/2)
 Study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer):
-Screening:  Biops y is mandatory (p -ERK1/2) 
-Cycle 2, Day  1:  Biops y is mandatory  (p-ERK1/2)
 Study  Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN):
Screening:  Biops y is optional* (p -ERK1/2) 
Cycle 2, Day  1:  Biops y is optional* (p- ERK1/2)
*Optional biopsy: Only for subjects who agreed on biopsy both at screening and on Cycle 2, Day 1.
Anticancer chemotherapy must have been stopped for at least 5 half -lives of the last 
applied therap y before the pre -treatment biops y for biomarker (p -ERK1/2) studies is 
taken.77Mitomy cin C, nitrosoureas or monoclonal antibodies with anticancer activity  (e.g. 
bevacizumab or cetuximab etc.) should not be given within 6 weeks of pre -treatment 
biopsy  for biomarker (p -ERK1/2) studies.
The evaluation of FGFR pathway  mutations is planned retrospectively for subject in the 
MTD expansion cohorts. 
Tumor response evaluation: Computed tomography  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) of all anatomic regions involved with the disease will be performed at screening 
(baseline), at the end of Cy cle 2 and thereafter, every  third c ycle to assess tumor response 
using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1. (RECI ST v1.1)(1). 
Response evaluation according to RECI ST v1.1 can be done up to 5 day s after CT / MR

Rationale for serum FGF23, phosphate and calcium measurements as PD biomarker
The phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) controls phosphate 
homeostasis by  regulating renal expression of sodium -dependent phosphate co -
transporters (18). Multiple FGF receptors (FGFRs) can act as receptors for FGF23 when 
bound by  the co -receptor Klotho expressed in the renal tubular epithelium. FGFRs also 
regulate skeletal FGF23 secretion (19). Activation of FGFR- FGF23 signaling, e.g. b y 
administration of an FGFR1 activating antibod y (20) or by administration of recombinant 
FGF23 to mice (21) leads to hy pophosphatemia. Likewi se, inhibition of renal FGFR 
signaling e.g., by administration of pan -FGFR kinase inhibitor leads to an enhanced 
reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney  and thus to an increase of serum phosphate levels. 
This increase of phosphate levels in turn activates FGF23 s ynthesis in the bone leading to 
higher serum levels of FGF23 (22). The FGF23/FGFR/Klotho complex also limits renal 
vitamin D sy nthesis and th us intestinal calcium uptake (23)(24). FGFR inhibitor treatment 
may therefore lead to increased serum calcium levels. Hence, modulation of circulating 
FGF23, and the incidence of h yperphosphatemia and elevated serum calcium levels are 
potential biomarkers for effective s ystemic FGFR inhibition (25). A dose -dependent 
hyperphosphatemic effect accompanied b y an increase of serum FGF23 levels was 
observed in all animal species after BAY1163877 administration including mouse, rat and 
monkey s. Similar effects have also be en observed with competitor compounds in 
preclinical models (26)(22) and in clinical trials (28)(29).
Rationale for the immunohistochemical quantification of tumor p -ERK levels as PD 
biomarker
Activation of the FGFR signaling pathway  leads to enhanced cell proliferation –an effect 
that is mediated at least in part by Extracellular Regulated Kinases 1&2 (ERK1/2) (27). In 
a large set of human tumor cell lines, the phosphory lation of p- ERK1/2 was increased 
upon stimulation of the FGFR signaling pathway  with the FGFR ligand bFGF, whereas 
pre-treatment of the cells with pan -FGFR inhibitor BAY 1 163877 strongly  reduced p -
ERK1/2 phosphory lation levels and inhibited cell proliferation. In line with this, treatment 
of tumor -bearing xenograft mice with pan -FGFR -inhibitor BAY 1163877 leads to a 
reduced phosphory lation of tumor ERK1/2 in sensitive model s, whereas no effect or onl y 
a weak effect on tumor p -ERK1/2 levels was observed in xenograft mouse models that 
were largel y insensitive to BAY 1163877 -treatment. Quantification of tumor p -ERK1/2 
levels in biopsy  samples from study  participants pre -and po st-treatment with 
BAY 1163877 may  thus serve as an earl y predictor of clinical efficacy of the drug, as has 
been described for man y kinase inhibitors in first- in-man trials including competitor 
compound dovitinib (28)(29) .

biomarker anal ysis will be done prior study  start (subject stratification) on either a fresh or 
archival tumor biops y sample to confirm high fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
expression levels / FGFR mutation (see Section 7.1.1 : Inclusion criteria). 78
Rationale for the quantification of tumor FGFR-1 -2- and -3 levels 
Amplification of the FGFR1 8p12 gene locus has been observed in up to 20 % of
sqNSCL C subjects (8)(9)(11). FGFR1 gene amplification is so far one of the most 
frequentl y observed molecular alteration in sqNSCLC (30). In SCCHN, the FGFR1 gene 
was amplified in about 15 % of all cases (38). In vitro experiments with BAY 1163877 
and published data with competitor compounds revealed equal sensitivity  to proliferation 
inhibition by  either adenocarcinoma or squamous subty pe-derived lung cancer cell lines. 
In-house quantification of FGFR1- 3 mRNA expression levels in patient -derived lung 
cancer tumors revealed a high FGFR1, 2 or 3 mRNA expression levels also in cases of 
lung adenocarinomas. In line with this, a recent publication conf irmed a strong expression 
of FGFR1 mRNA also in adenocarcinoma biops y samples in the absence of FGFR1 
amplification (39). Therefore, we suggest to include lung adenocarcinoma patients into 
Part 2 of the study .Mutations in FGFR -encoding genes are rare in sqNSCLC subjects 
(< 2%), whereas in bladder cancer, up to 70% of all cases reveal mutations within FGFR3 
gene (31). The mo lecular consequences of FGFR gene amplifications are not alway s clear: 
In bladder cancer, activating FGFR3 mutations with higher kinase activity  have been 
described (32) but also cases in which FGFR3 amplification leads to higher target 
expression levels in tumor (33). 
Recent publications investigating the correlation between FGFR1 gene amplification in 
sqNSCL C and their correlation with target expression level (mRNA or protein expression) 
revealed, a high proportion of subjects with FGFR1 overexpression in tumor that do not 
have an FGFR1 gene amplification and even in those subjects with a high FGFR1 gene 
copy  number, a relevant subset of subjects does not reveal high FGFR1 target 
overexpression (12)(13).
In line with this literature data on subject biops y samples, preclinical in vivo data with 
competitor compound AZD4547 and in vitro data with competitor compound BGJ398 
revealed that a correlation with response -to-treatment (tumor weight inhibition or 
proliferation inhibition) correlated onl y weakl y with gene amplification status and that up 
to 50 % of tumor cells did not respond to FGFR inhibitor treatment despite having FGFR 
genetic alterations (10)(34). In house data revealed that the best correlation with anti-
tumor efficacy  upon BAY1163877 -treatment in preclinical cancer models was observed 
for total -FGFR mRNA tumor ex pression levels - including lung and bladder cancer, and 
head and neck squamous cell cancer models. This may  at least in part be explained by  the 
parallel expression of more than one FGFR isoform in xenograft tumors which could not 
be investigated on protein level by  immunohistochemistry  due to the lack of isoform -
specific, sensitive anti -FGFR antibodies. Parallel quantification of FGFR1/2/3 mRNA

levels in fresh frozen xenograft tumors (b y RT -PCR) and in archival tissue samples 
derived thereof (b y RNA in si tu hy bridization) indicated a high degree of correlation 
between both methods. Thus, quantification of FGFR1/2/3 mRNA levels in archival tissue 
samples is technicall y feasible. We therefore consider to stratify sqNSCL C, LAC, BC and 
SCCHN subjects to be enr olled in study  Part 2 and Part 3 / MTD expansion by  the 
quantification of total FGFR mRNA expression levels in archival tissue samples in order 
to exclude subjects that are unlikely  to benefit from BAY1163877 therapy  due to low 
overall FGFR target expressi on levels.79
Rationale for the detection of genetic alterations in FGFR encoding genes and in 
FGFR pathway downstream signaling molecules
In subjects included in study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer) and Part 2 / MTD 
expansion (sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN) and Part 3 / MTD expansion “Safet y 
cohort” (sqNSCL C + LAC + BC) , genetic testing of tumor tissue may  be necessary  if a 
subject lacks a treatment response to BAY 1163877 despite FGFR overexpression in 
tumor. Such a lack of anti -tumor response upon BA Y 1163877- treatment has been 
observed in some preclinical models despite high total FGFR mRNA tumor levels and 
may be attributable to a constitutively  active FGFR downstream signaling pathway  e. g.
due to K- ras mutations. Existence of such FGFR downstream pathway  activating 
mutations in the case of lack of response to BAY 1163877 treatment -despite high total 
FGFR mRNA tumor expression levels -should be evaluated retrospectively  in subjects 
enrolled in study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer) and Part 2 / MTD expansion 
(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN) and Part 3 / MTD expansion “Safet y cohort”
(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC) .80
Furthermore, in some animal models with bladder cancer cell lines bearing an activating 
mutation in FGFR3 gene, a good a nti-tumor response upon BAY 1163877 -treatment was 
observed despite rather low overall total FGFR mRNA expression levels in tumor cells. 
We therefore consider genetic testing for FGFR3 -activating mutations in bladder cancer 
subjects prior to treatment start -in case they  lack high FGFR mRNA expression levels in 
tumor.

9.5 Safety
9.5.1 Adverse events
9.5.1.1 Definitions
Definition of adverse event (AE)
In a clinical stud y, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for 
participation in the study . Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporall y or causall y 
associated with the use of a medicin al (investigational) product.
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study  by any physician 
treating the subject should not be recorded as AE (however, the condition for which the 
surgery  is required may  be an AE). 
 The clinical ma nifestation of any  failure of expected pharmacological action 
(tumor progression) is not recorded as an AE. If, however, the event fulfills any  of the 
criteria of an SAE, it must be recorded and reported as such unless otherwise specified in 
the protocol. 
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term “condition” 
may include abnormal e.g. phy sical examination findings, sy mptoms, diseases, laboratory  
values, ECG.
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as 
medical history  (e.g. seasonal allergy  without acute complaints).
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which 
symptoms or treatment ar e present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged 
intensity , are recorded as medical history  (e.g. allergic pollinosis).
 Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events.
Serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any  untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets an y of 
the following criteria (a –f):
a)Results in death
b)Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c)Requires insubject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 95of 395
A hospitalization or prolongati on of hospitalization will notbe regarded as an SAE if at 
least one of the following exceptions is met:
The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
The admission is pre- planned 
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the stud y)
The admission is not associated with an AE 
(e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any  hospitalization may  
fulfill the criterion of ‘medically  important’ an d as such may  be reportable as an SAE 
dependant on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
specifically  require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
a)Results in persistent or significant disability  /incapacity
Disabilit y means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
b)Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect
c)Is another medically  important serious event as judged b y the investigator
All SAEs occurring after the I C for study  treatment eligibility  has been obtained, until 
the end of the follow -up period must be handled via this process. All serious 
diagnoses, s ymptom(s), sign(s) or finding(s) that have a start date after signing the IC 
must be recorded as SAEs. This also includes all serious events with a start date during 
the pre -treatment period for subject stratification (FGFR expression / FGFR mutation 
testing period), in case an invasive procedure was performed to obtain tumor 
material. A condition that was pres ent before signing the IC for study  treatment 
eligibility  and worsens after signing the IC must also be recorded as an SAE if the 
serious criteria are met.
9.5.1.2 Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investi gator according to the categories 
detailed below.
9.5.1.2.1 Seriousness
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section 9.5.1.1
9.5.1.2.2 Intensity
The intensity  / severity  of an AE will be graded using the CTCAE v4.03, see Section 16.5. 
For events not listed in the CTCAE v4.03 the following scale will be used:
Grade 1 = Mild AE, transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 96of 395
Grade 2 = Moderate AE, sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
Grade 3 = Severe AE, prevents normal activities
Grade 4 = Life -threatening and / or disabling AE
Grade 5 = Results in death (fatal)
9.5.1.2.3 Causal relationship
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the eCRF. 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “r easonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question.
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”
An assessment of “no” would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
or
2. Non-plausibilit y, e.g. the subject is struck by an automobile when there is 
no indication that the drug caused disorientation that may  have caused the 
event; cancer developing a few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that there is a reasonable suspicion that the AE is 
associated with the use of the study  treatment.
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment include:
 The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the 
drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event.
 Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re-
introduction (re -challenge):
 Subject’s response after de -challenge or subjects response after re -challenge should 
be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
 Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the subject may  have.
 Concomitant medication or treatment:
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether an y of them may  be susp ected to cause the event in 
question.
 The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment:
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 97of 395
study  treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacody namics should be 
considered.
9.5.1.2.4 Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationsh ip” 
to protocol -required procedure(s).
Possible answers are “y es” or “no.”
9.5.1.2.5 Action taken with study treatment
Any action on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed below.
-Drug withdrawn
-Drug interrupted
-Dose reduced
-Dose not changed
-Dose increased
-Not applicable
-Unknown
9.5.1.2.6 Other specific treatment(s) of AE
-None
-Remedial drug therap y
-Other
9.5.1.2.7 Outcome
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows: 
-Recovered / resolved
- Recovering / resolving
-Recovered/resolved with sequelae
-Not recovered/not resolved
-Fatal
-Unknown
9.5.1.3 Assessments and documentation of adverse events
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by  a member of the investigator team or 
spontaneously  reported by  the subject, will be documented (see Section 11.1 for details). 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  BAY 1163877 / 16443
17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 98of 395
AEs will be documented event based (using the CTCAE v4.03 guidelines). The 
observation phase for AEs will start with signing the first Informed C onsent and will end 
in general with the last visit of follow -up. All AEs identified after first IC during the pre-
treatment period for subject stratification (FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing 
period) will not be documented in the eCRF, in case no invasive procedure will be 
performed to obtain tumor material. Adverse events should be collected past 30 -35 day s 
after the stud y treatment stop for all AEs that were ongoing at the end of treatment as well 
as new SAEs (information may  be obtained via phone call). The investigator is 
responsible for the grading of each category  mentioned in Section 9.5.1.2 .
Adverse events should be followed until resolu tion or stabilization unless, in the 
investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely  to resolve due to the subject’s underl ying 
disease.
If any subject dies within 30 -35 day s of last dose of study  drug, the investigator will 
inform the sponsor and record the cause of death in detail within 24 hours on a SAE form.
A laboratory  test abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, e.g. causing the subject to 
withdraw from the stud y, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, 
or judged relev ant b y the investigator, should be reported as an AE. Each event should be 
described in detail along with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to investigational 
product, action taken and outcome.
An isolated laboratory  abnormality  that is assigned grade 4, according to CTCAE v4.03 
definition, is not reportable as an SAE; unless the Investigator assesses that the event 
meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE. CTCAE v4.03 Grade 4 baseline laboratory  
abnormalities that are part of the disease profile s hould not be reported as an SAE, 
specificall y when they  are allowed or not excluded by  the protocol inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. If an Investigator is in doubt about the applicable reporting obligations, he/she 
should consult with the study  monitor for th e Sponsor. CTCAE v4.03 Grade 4 laboratory  
abnormalities will be documented in the laboratory data and will be reviewed on a regular 
basis.

reports to the designated recipient.
SAEs occurring after the protocol -defined observation period will be processed by  the 
sponsor according to all applicable regulations.
Notification of the IECs / IRBs
Notification of the Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) / Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs) about all relevant events (e.g. SAEs, <suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs)>) will be performed b y the sponsor (or delegate) and / or by the 
investigator according to all applicable regulations.
Notification of the authorities 
The processing and reporting of all relevant events (e.g. SUSARs) to the authorities will 
be done b y the sponsor according to all applicable regulations.

10.3 Variables
Variables (primary  and secondary ) are specified in Section 9.4.
10.4 Statistical and analytical plans
10.4.1 Demographic and other baseline characteristics
Summary  statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
for quantitative variables) will be presented b y treatment arm. Frequ ency  tables for 
qualitative data will be provided. Medical history  findings will be summarized using 
MedDRA ( Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities) terms. 
10.4.2 Maximum tolerated dose
Individual listings and treatment summaries of dose limiting toxicitie s with CTCAE v4.03 
code and grade will be presented.
The incidence of subjects with DL Ts during C ycle 1 will be summarized by treatment and, 
as possible, modeled as a function of BAY 1163877 dose using Bay esian logistic 
regression. The moderately -informati ve independent priors used during the interim 
analysis (see Section 16.4 for details) as well as non -informative priors will be used for 
this analy sis in order to assess sensitivity  of the estimates. Parameter estimates and model 
predictions will be reported with 90% credibility  sets. The MTD will be computed as a 
derived function of model parameters as:
MTD = (log(0.2/0.8) -intercept) / slope.
The posterior distribution of the MTD will be summarized in tabular and graphical 
formats.
10.4.3 Adverse events
Individual listings of adverse events will be provided. The incidence of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment -emergent drug -related adverse events 
(TEADRs), respectivel y, will be summarized by  cohort in frequency  tables using worst 
CTCAE v4.03 grade. Frequency  tables will also be provided for the changes of worst 
CTCAE v4.03 grade after start of treatment versus baseline. In addition anal ysis will be 
done using MedDRA terms.
10.4.4 Safety parameters
Quantitative data (vital signs, ECG) will be described by  the following summary  statistics: 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. These summary  
statistics will be presented by cohort for the original data as well as for the difference to 
baseline. Frequency  tables will be provided for qualitative data.
Laboratory  data outside the reference range will be listed with abnormal values flagged. 
The incidence of laboratory  data ou tside the reference range (low, high) will be 
summarized by cohort in frequency  tables. The incidence of laboratory  toxicities will be 
summarized by  worst CTCAE v4.03 grade and by  cohort. Frequency  tables will be

provided for the changes of worst CTCAE v4. 03 grade after start of treatment versus 
baseline.
10.4.5 Pharmacokinetic data
The concentration -times courses of all anal ytes will be tabulated for each cohort. The 
following statistics will be calculated for each of the sampling points: arithmetic mean, 
standar d deviation and coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean, geometric standard 
deviation (re -transformed standard deviation of the logarithms) and CV, minimum, 
median, maximum value and the number of measurements. Means at an y time will only be 
calculat ed if at least 2/3 of the individual data were measured and were above the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ). For the calculation of the mean value a data point below 
LLOQ will be substituted by  one half of this limit. I n tables showing mean values, whe re 
values below LLOQ are included in the calculation of mean values, these means will be 
marked.
Individual and geometric mean concentration vs. time curves of all anal ytes (using the 
actual sampling times for individual plots and the planned sampling time s for mean plots) 
will be plotted by  treatment using both linear and semilogarithmic scale. The amount and 
percent of drug excreted into urine will be graphically  illustrated for the sampling interval 
as well as for the whole sampling period (bar -charts fo r the individual data and the 
arithmetic mean including standard deviation).
Pharmacokinetic characteristics (t maxand t lastexcluded) will be summarized by the 
statistics mentioned above. t maxand t lastwill be described utilizing minimum, maximum 
and median as well as frequency  counts. A mount and percent of drug excreted in urine 
will be described b y arithmetic statistics, minimum, maximum and median.
To investigate dose proportionality , an explorative analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
including the factor cohort, will be performed on the log- transformed values of 
appropriate PK parameters calculated from single (where applicable) and multiple dose 
PK profiles.
In order to evaluate the relative bioavailabili ty of the tablet formulation, tablet C max/D, 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D and AUC/D on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 will be compared to solution C max/D, 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D, AUC/D on Cy cle 1, Day  1 for all analy tes. If needed, additional PK 
parameters may  be used for relative bioavailabi lity assessment. The logarithms of these 
PK parameters will be analy zed using anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) including subject 
and formulation effects. Based on these analy ses, point estimates (L S-means) and 
exploratory  90% confidence intervals for the ratio s (tablet/solution) of C max/D, 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D, AUC/D will be calculated b y retransformation of the logarithmic data 
using the intra -individual standard deviation of the ANOVA.
In order to evaluate the food effect, BAY 1163877 C maxand AUC(0 -tlast) on Cy cle 1, 
Day -3 and C maxand AUC(0 -tlast) on Cy cle 1, Day 1 will be compared. The logarithms of 
Cmaxand AUC(0 - tlast) will be anal yzed using ANOVA including subject and food effects. 
Based on these analy ses, point estimates (L S-means) and exploratory  90% con fidence 
intervals for the ratios (high -fat, high -calorie meal / fasting) of C maxand AUC(0 - tlast) will 
be calculated b y retransformation of the logarithmic data using the intra -individual

standard deviation of the ANOVA.
10.4.6 Pharmacodynamic data
Cardiovascula r parameters will be described by  the following summary  statistics: 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. These summary  
statistics will be presented by  cohort for the original data as well as for the difference to 
baseline.
Grap hical display s of individual data as well as mean values with standard deviation will 
be included for absolute values as well as change from baseline.
10.4.7 Efficacy data
Efficacy  data, such as best tumor response, will be summarized using descriptive statistics
and will be graphically  display ed if appropriate. The correlation between 
pharmacod ynamic parameters and selected safet y, efficacy , or PK parameters may  be 
graphicall y display ed. Further statistical anal yses may  be conducted.
The efficacy anal ysis will in clude descriptive analyses on response rate, progression -free 
survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP). 
Response as defined b y RECI ST v.1.1: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), 
stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), see Section 16.8.
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (day s) from the date of the first 
dose of study  drug to the date of the first observed radi ological disease progression or 
death, whatever comes first. PFS for subjects without tumor progression at the time of 
analysis will be censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.
Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from start of study  treatment until 
objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths.
10.5 Planned interim analysis
Safety  data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during study  Part 1 / dose escalation (all 
comer). Bay esian dose -response and / or PK / PD modeling of DLTs ra tes and CTCAE 
v4.03 gradings may  be performed after selected cohorts in order to generate additional 
relevant information for the adaptive dose selection decisions. The sponsor together with 
all investigators will review all available data and make the fin al decision as to dose -
escalation, de -escalation or cohort expansion during the adaptive dose escalation part. This 
group will also determine when to implement predefined stopping rules.
No interim anal ysis is planned during dose expansion at MTD in study  Part 1 (MTD 
expansion cohort “all comer”) ,study  Part 2 (MTD expansion cohort “sqNSCL C + LAC + 
BC + SCCHN”) or study part 3 ( MTD expansion cohort “Safety  cohort” ).84

10.6 Further analysis described and reported under separate cover
In order to evaluate the exposure -response during 4 cy cles, two blood samples will be 
collected on Day  1 of C ycles 2 -5, one before and one after a supervised dose. The 
resulting longitudinal exposure data will be modeled together with occurrences of select ed 
adverse events and documented clinical responses. Also longitudinally  measured PD 
biomarkers will be modeled with this exposure data. Exposure -response models and 
simulations after alternative dosing schedules will be reported in a separate document.
10.7 Determination of sample size -amended
This is primarily  a descriptive safet y and tolerability Phase I trial. No formal sample size 
estimation is performed. The actual sample size required to adequately  determine the 
MTD depends on the initial dose, rate o f dose escalation and the observed dose -toxicity  
and dose / exposure-pharmacological relationships. Simulation studies have been 
performed to quantify  the operational characteristics (i.e., precision of the MTD, sample 
size, number of subjects being over / under dosed) of the adaptive dose -escalation design 
under a number of plausible dose- DLT relationship scenarios. Results are provided in 
Section 16.4. Based on experience the chosen sample size of 3 -9 subjects per cohort is 
considered to be sufficient to fulfill the objectives of the study . 
In stud y Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer), additional subjects will be included in order 
to gain more inform ation about biomarkers (p -ERK1/2) in at least 20 evaluable subjects 
with any  solid tumors.
In stud y Part 2 / MTD expansion, additional subjects will be included in order to obtain 
further safet y and PK data at the MTD level in at least 20 subjects with sqNSCLC or
LAC , at least 30, up to a maximum of 50 evaluable subjects with BCand at least 8 
subjects with SCCHN.85
In stud y Part 3 / MTD expansion “Safet y cohort” , additional subjects will be included to 
expand the safet y database , to collect additional efficacy  data, and to assess changes of
immune paramet ers during treatment at the MTD level in approximately  20subjects with 
sqNSCL C or LAC, and approximately  20subjects with BC. 86
11Data handling and quality assurance

Samples of the 2 SI S /ICFs are provided as a document separate to this protocol.
Based on the subject information sheet(s), the investigator or designee w ill explain all 
relevant aspects of the study  to each subject prior to his / her entry  into the study  
(i.e.before an y examinations and procedures associated with the selection for the study  
are performed or an y study -specific data is recorded on study -specific forms).
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IEC / IRB has been 
obtained.
Each subject will have ample time and opportunity  to ask questions and will be informed 
about the right to withdraw from the study  at an y time withou t any  disadvantage and 
without having to provide reasons for this decision.
Only  if the subject voluntarily  agrees to sign the informed consent form(s) and has done 
so, may  he / she enter the study. Additionally , the investigator and other information 
provider (if an y) will personally sign and date the form(s). The subject will receive a cop y 
of the signed and dated form(s).
The signed informed consent statement(s) is (are) to remain in the I SF or, if locally  
required, in the subject’s note / file of the medical institution.
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures 
are performed, the study  record or subject’s clinical record must clearl y show that 
informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
The in formed consent form(s) and an y other written information provided to subjects will 
be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to 
the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a c hange 
to the content of the subject information and / or the written informed consent form(s). 
The investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely  manner and will ask the 
subject to confirm his / her participation in the study  by signing the re vised informed 
consent form(s). An y revised written informed consent form and written information must 
receive the IEC / IRB’s approval / favorable opinion in advance of use.

15.1.1 Overview of changes
Modification 1: Use of a further drug formulation (tablet)
Rationale for introducing Modification 1 
Studies have demonstrated the stability  of a tablet formulation of BAY 1163877 which 
was developed for ease of administration. The switch from solution to tablet formulation 
is planned after relative bioavailability  assessment of the tablet formulation planned in one 
of the dose escalation cohorts (“tablet bridging cohort”).

Old text:
Doses of study  drug (BAY 1163877) may be delay ed or reduced in case of clinically  
significant hematologic and other toxicities that are possibly , probably  or definitely  related 
to study  drug therap y. Toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE v 4.03 (see 
Section 14.5). 
No intra -subject dose escalation will be permitted. However, the dose can be reduced or 
delay ed for an individual subject based on toxicities that are related to study  drug.
If a subject experiences a DL T during Cy cle1, the next dose of BAY 1163877 can be 
delay ed for up to 21 days, but only  in cases where Grade 3 events occur no longer than 
7days.
All subjects who are re -treated following a DLT should undergo dose reduction (see Table 
6-3).
If the toxicity  resolves to Grade 1, the next dose of BAY 1163877 can be considered. 
Re-treatment for this subject should be at 1 dose level below the initial dose (see Table 6 -
3), provided that this dose level has been evaluated during the dose escalation part of the 
study . Detailed dose adjustments for hematological toxicities are described in Table 6- 4. If 
the subject was dosed at the starting dose level, the subject should be removed from the 
study . If the toxicity  fails to resolve to Grade 1within 21 days after the planned 
treatment date, the subje ct should be removed from the study . Subjects who experience a 
Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity  should be removed from the stud y. 
Drug -related adverse events of Grade 3 
For Grade 3 adverse event regarded as related to study  drug, the dose of BAY 1163877 
can be delay ed for up to 21 days. If the toxicity  fails to resolve to Grade 1 within 
21days after the planned dosing date, the subject should be removed from the study . If the 
toxicity  resolves to Grade 1, the next dose of BAY 1163877 can be considered.  
Re-treatment for this subject should be reduced b y 1dose level. Detailed d ose adjustments 
for toxicities are described in Table 6-2.
If the re -treatment reproduces the same toxicity  grade, the next dose of BAY 1163877 can 
be delay ed fo r up to 21 days until the toxicity  has resolved to Grade 1. Re- treatment is 
possible at 1 dose level below. 
Subjects who experience a Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity  should be removed from

In order to evaluate the relative bioavailability  of the tablet formulation, tablet C max/D, 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D and AUC/D on Cy cle 1, Day  -3 will be compared to solution C max/D, 
AUC(0 -tlast)/D, AUC/D on Cy cle 1, Day  1 for all analy tes. If needed, additional PK 
parameters may  be used for relative bioavailability assessment. The logarithms of these 
PK parameters will be analy zed using anal ysis of vari ance (ANOVA) including subject 
and formulation effects. Based on these analy ses, point estimates (L S-means) and 
exploratory  90% confidence intervals for the ratios (tablet/solution) of C max/D, AUC(0 -

15.2 Amendment 2
Date of amendment: 19 Mar 2014
15.2.1 Overview of changes
Modification 1: Type of packaging for test drug was modified 
Rationale for introducing Modification 1 
The available stability data of the IMPD shelf life study for 50mg tablets show superiorit y 
of Alu/Alu blister against HDPE bottles. Therefore, as a precaution until real time data are 
available in HDPE bottles for 200 mg tablets, clinical supplies of 200mg tablets are 
packaged in Alu/Alu- blister. Stability  studies for 200mg tablets in both packaging 
materials have been started.

15.3 Amendment 3
Date of amendment: 19 Jun 2014
15.3.1 Overview of changes
Modification 1: Expansion of indications for study Part 2
Rationale for introducing Modification 1 
Preclinical data demonstrate a strong a nti-tumor efficacy  of BAY 1163877 not only  in 
subjects with sqNSCL C and BC, but also in subjects with L AC or SCCHN. Protocol 
amendment 3 therefore expands the indications to evaluate biomarker status, PD 
parameters, and tumor response in Part 2 / MTD expan sion from 2 specific populations 
(sqNSCL C + BC) to 4 specific populations (sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN).
List of all CSP sections affected by Modification 1:
Due to the expansion from 2 to 4 indications in study  Part 2, the term “ sqNSCL C + BC” 
was replaced throughout the text by“sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN”.
Modification 2: Introduction of a second SIS / ICF for subjects recruited for the 
MTD expansion cohort of study Part 1 and Part 2 
Rationale for introducing Modification 2 
In this stud y, the information on subjects’ FGFR expression level and the presence of 
activating mutations in FGFR encoding genes is a key  prerequisite for subject 
stratification at screening. If subjects do not present the criteria required for stratifica tion it 
is not necessary  to perform all screening examinations and assessments. It was therefore 
decided to separate FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing from screening procedures, 
and to introduce a separate SI S / ICF for FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing which 
will only  be used for subjects recruited for the MTD expansion cohort of Part 1 or Part 2. 
Due to this change, “FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing” and “screening” have 
become two separate parts of the newl y introduced generic term “pr e-treatment” phase 
(see Section 7.1.2.1), and Section “Inclusion criteria” was divided in Section 5.1.1.1 
“Eligibility  criteria for FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing” and Section 5.1.1.2 
“Eligibility  criteria for study  treatment“. 
Additionally , it w as clarified, that the evaluation of FGFR signaling pathway mutations 
(that may  render a tumor drug- insensitive despite having high FGFR expression or an 
activating mutation) is planned retrospectively for subjects in the MTD expansion cohorts 
of both stud y parts, i.e. for subjects of Part 1 (all comer) and for subjects of Part 2 
(sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN).

Modification 3: Modification of inclusion and exclusion criteria
Rationale for introducing Modification 3 
Before, onl y subjects with amylase ≤ 1.5 x UL N and mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh 
score A) were eligible for the treatment period. The restriction was considered too strict 
for the target population (refractory , locall y advanced or metastatic solid tumors). To 
improve subject recruitment, the criteria were changed to amy lase ≤ 2.5 x ULN and not 
more than Child- Pugh score B7 to allow inclusion of subjects with more advanced 
pancreatic and hepatic impairment. 
Monoclonal antibodies with anticancer activity  (e.g. bevacizumab or cetuximab etc.) were 
added to the list of not allowed previous chemotherapy  within 6 weeks of pre -treatment 
biopsy  for biomarker (p
-ERK1/2) studies.

Modification 4: Additional evaluation of food effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
BAY 1163877
Rationale for introducing Modification 4 
Food -effect bioavailability  will be evaluated additionally  to guide and select dosing 
regimen of BAY 1163877 in the further development. Evaluation of the effect o f food on 
single -dose PK of BAY 1163877 is considered to impose only  little extra burden on the 
study  population. Approximately  8 subjects treated at MTD in Part 1 or Part 2 Part will be 
asked to participate in “Food effect assessment” with single- dose adm inistration under fed 
and fasting conditions on Day  -3 (after breakfast) respectivel y Da y 1 (after an overnight 
fast) of C ycle 1.

pharmacokinetic assessments in at least 12 subjects in Part 2 MTD expansion cohort 
(sqNS CLC + LAC + BC + SCCHN ) such that valid PK data are available in 8 subjects.
“Food effect assessment” will be performed in approximately  8 subjects enrolled in the 
MTD expansion cohorts (study  Part 1 and Part 2).
Blood (plasma) samples for PK assessment of BAY 1163877 will be collected at the 
following time points:
 Cycle 1, Day  -3 (“tablet bridging cohort” and “food effect assessment” only): 
single -dose PK

…
When blood pressure measurement and PK sample collection are scheduled at the same 
time point, subject’s blood pressure will be measured before col lection of the PK sample
24-hour urine collection: In approximately  8 subjects of the MTD expansion cohorts 
(study  Part 1 and Part 2), on Cy cle 1 Day  1, complete urine output will be collected over 
24 hours post administration in 0 to 12 hour and 12 to 24 hour intervals concurrentl y with 
plasma PK samples. For each subject, within each collection interval, the collected urine 
will be combined and the total volume of the combined urine will be determined. 
A representative aliquot of the pooled urine will be used to determine the concentration of 
BAY 1163877.
Plasma and urine concentrations of BAY 1163877 will be measured using a validated 
method. I nstructions for sample collection, processing, storage and shipment will be 
described in a separate document (e.g. lab manual).
Exploratory  monitoring of metabolites may  also be per formed in pooled plasma samples 
(most likely  at the MTD or the therapeutic dose) and in urine .

For subjects to be enrolled in study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer) and subjects to be 
enrolled in Study  Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCLC + BC) biomarker analy sis will be 
done prior stud y start (subject stratification) on either a fresh or archival tumo r biopsy  
sample to confirm high fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) expression levels and the 
presence or absence of additional genetic alterations in the FGFR signaling pathway (see 
Section 5.1.1: I nclusion criteria).
Rationale for the quantification of tumor FGFR -1 -2- and -3 levels by RNA in situ 
hybridization
Amplification of the FGFR1 8p12 gene locus has been observed in up to 20 % of 
sqNSCL C subjects (8)(9)(11). FGFR1 gene amplification is so far theone of the most 
frequentl y observed molecular alteration in sqNSCLC (30). Mutations in FGFR- encoding 
genes are rare in sqNSCLC subjects (< 2 %), whereas in bladder cancer, up to 70 % of all 
cases reveal mutations within FGFR3 gene (31). …

are unlikel y to benefit from BAY1163877 therap y due to low overall FGFR tar get

Rationale for the detection of genetic alterations in FGFR encoding genes and in

In subjects included in study  Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCL C + BC), genetic testing of 
tumor tissue may  be necessary  if a subject lacks a treatment response to BAY1163877 
despite FGFR overexpression in tumor -as revealed by  RNA in situ hy bridization.

Existence of such FGFR downstream pathway  activating mutations in the case of lack of

and published data with competitor compounds revealed equal sensitivity  to proliferation 
inhibition by  either adeno carcinoma or squamous subty pe-derived lung cancer cell lines. 
In- house quantification of FGFR1-3 mRNA expression levels in patient- derived lung 
cancer tumors revealed a high FGFR1, 2 or 3 mRNA expression levels also in cases of 
lung adenocarinomas. In lin e with this, a recent publication confirmed a strong expression 
of FGFR1 mRNA also in adenocarcinoma biops y samples in the absence of FGFR1 
amplification (39). Therefore, we suggest to include lung adenocarcinoma patients into 
Part 2 of the study . Mutation s in FGFR -encoding genes are rare in sqNSCLC subjects (< 2

sqNSCL C + LAC + BC + SCCHN), a separate SIS / I CF  will b e provided to subjects for 
FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing. This separate SI S / ICF gives brief information 
on the study  conduct, details on the tissue sample required to be taken to perform the tests 
along with information on possible risks. 
SIS / ICF for study treatment eligibility
All subjects who have interest to participate in this study  (including those who are 
confirmed presenting the appropriate FGF receptor level, or -for bladder cancer subjects -
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

who are confirmed carry ing the FGFR mutat ion) will be provided the SI S / ICF for 
screening of stud y treatment eligibility  no longer than 28 day s prior to start of study  
treatment. 
Samples of the 2 SI S /ICFs are provided as a document separate to this protocol.
Based on thesubject information sh eet(s), the investigator or designee will explain all 
relevant aspects of the study  to each subject prior to his / her entry  into the study  
…
Only  if the subject voluntarily  agrees to sign the informed consent form (s)and has done 
so, may  he / she enter t he study . Additionally , the investigator and other information 
provider (if an y) will personally sign and date the form (s). The subject will receive a cop y 
of the signed and dated form (s).
The signed informed consent statement (s)is (are) to remain in the ISF or, if locally  
required, in the subject’s note / file of the medical institution.
...
The informed consent form (s)and an y other written information provided to subjects will 
be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be r elevant to 
the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change 
to the content of the subject information and / or the written informed consent form (s). 
The investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely  manner and will ask the 
subject to confirm his / her participation in the study  by signing the revised informed 
consent form (s). Any  revised written informed consent form and written information must 
receive the IEC / IRB’s approval / favorable opinion in a dvance of use.

Methodology …
Determination of the MTD: An adaptive dose 
escalation design will be used to determine the MTD in 
study  Part 1 (all comer). The MTD is defined as the 
highest dose that can be given such that not more than 
20% of subjects experience a DLT during Cy cle 1. Th e 
dose escalation will be performed as follows:
Initiall y 3 subjects per dose level will be enrolled. In 
case 2 or more sites are conducting the dose 
escalation part, the initial enrolment of 4 subjects 
per dose level is optional.
The starting dose of BAY 1163877 is 50 mg given 
as a single dose on C ycle 1, Day 1, and twice daily 
(b.i.d.) from C ycle 1, Day 3 (100 mg /day)
The maximum dose escalation will be 2- fold.
Possible daily  doses of BAY 1163877 starting from 
100 mg in increments of 100 mg.
If at least 1 subject out of 3 or 1 out of 4 in a cohort has 
DLTs or if at least 2 subjects report drug -related AEs 
(CTCAE v4.03) of Grade ≥ 2, any  further dose 
escalation, de -
escalation or cohort expansion will be 
decided in consultation between all investigator(s), and 
the sponsor (within the drug safet y monitoring team = 
DSMT) after consideration of all available safet y data 
of the previous cohorts. Any  subsequent dose will be 
selected in order to determine the MTD. 
Model -based dose -response anal ysis of the DLT rat es 
will be performed during these interim reviews in order 
to guide the dose decision (see details in Section 16.4). 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 254of 395
Methodology 
(continued)The model -based dose selection procedure is 
considering data at all dose levels (not just at the last 
cohort). The dose predicted to y ield 20% DLT rates will 
be reported from that model as a best candidate for the 
next cohort. 
The final decision about the next dose will be made by  
the sponsor in consultation with all investigators 
(DSMT). If the selected dose is larger than the last dose 
tested, then escalation will be pursued. If it is lower, a 
de-escalation step will occur. 
Without the occurrence of tox icities, dose escalation 
could be stopped and RP2D may  be determined based 
on PK and/or PD results. The decision to continue 
treatment for an individual patient will be made by  the 
investigator according to the criteria specified in the 
protocol (Section 8.4).
Cohort expansion will occur when a previousl y tested 
dose is selected again for the next cohort of 3 subjects. 
Expansions at any  given dose up to a total of 9 subjects 
are allowed. In principle, the selection of a next dose 
level where the predicted DLT rate is close to 20% 
should insure that the next dose tested will remain safe. 
Nevertheless, the following constraint will be added in 
order to protect subject s afety during the adaptive dose 
selection decisions:

Number of subjects Approximately  200 subjects will be enrolled in the pre-
treatment phase of the study .
 Study Part 1 / dose escalation (all comer) : 
The total number of subjects will depend on the number 
of cohorts necessary  to identify  the MTD. Relative 
bioavailability  of the tablet formulation in comparison 
to the solution formulation will be performed in all 
subjects enrolled in one of the dose esca lation cohorts; 
pharmacokinetic data are needed in a minimum of 
3subjects for relative bioavailability  assessment. 
 Study  Part 1 / MTD expansion (all comer): 
Additional subjects will be enrolled to have 20 
evaluable “all comer” subjects treated at MTD.
 Study Part 2 / MTD expansion (sqNSCLC + 
LAC + BC + SCCHN) : 
40additional subjects will be enrolled to have 
20evaluable subjects with sqNSCL C or LAC and a

A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will notbe regarded as an SAE if at 
least one of the following exceptions is met:
-The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
- The admission is pre- planned 
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the study )
-The admission is not associated with an AE 
(e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any  hospitalization may  
fulfill the criterion of ‘medically  important’ and as such may  be reportable as an SAE 
dependant on clinical judgment. In addition, where local regulatory  authorities

functions.
Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect
Is another medically  important serious event as judged b y the investigator
All SAEs occurring after the I C for study  treatment eligibility  has been obtained, until the 
end of the follow -up period must be handled via this process. All serious diagnoses, 
symptom(s), sign(s) or finding(s) that have a start date after signing the IC must be 
recorded as SAEs. This also includes all serious events with a start date during the pre -
treatment period for subject stratification (FGFR expression / FGFR mutation testing 
period), in case an invasive procedure was performed to obtain tumor mater ial.A 
condition that was present before signing the IC for study  treatment eligibility  and 
worsens after signing the I C must also be recorded as an SAE if the serious criteria are 
met.

15.6 Amendment 7
Date of amendment: 16March 2017
15.6.1 Overview of changes
15.6.1.1 Modification 1: Change in Medical Expert and further clarifications
Description of modification to the study plan
The medical expert for this study  changed. Moreover, minor changes were done for 
clarification.
Rationale for introducing the modification
Due to organizational reasons the medical expert for this study  was changed.
List o f CSP sections affected by this modification 
Sections 1, 5and 16.3
15.6.1.2 Modification 2: Safety cohort
Description of modification to the study plan
A 3rdstudy  part investigating the“Safety cohort ”was inc luded.
Rationale for introducing the modification
Preliminary  safet y data of patients with advanced cancer treated with BAY 1163877
showed a favorable safety profile (details can be found in the current version of the IB). 
However, sample size is still limited in selected indications (sqNSCL C, LAC, BC) and 
additional safet y data  will be generated in Study Part 3 “Safet y cohort”.
In parallel, changes of selected immune parameters will be assessed in Part 3. It was 
shown that FGFR3 expression is inversely  correlated to PD -L1 expression in tumor tissue 
of patients with BC. This finding was confirmed in archival biops y samples collected in 
study  16443. A similar correlation was detected in patients with sqNSCLC and L AC. It is 
assumed that a causal relationship between FGFR expression and T -cell exclusion leads to 
low PD -L1 levels. Potentially , inhibition of FGFR can overcome this interaction and 
render tumors targe table by  the immune s ystem. Preclinical models are not available due 
to limitations in mimicking immune responses in murine model sy stems.

Liver toxicity  criteria were modified and criteria for retinal detachment were added.
The protocol was modified to clarify that tissue mineralization and increased Ca x PO4 are 
different events. Further more investigators were instructed to carefull y monitor patients 
with a GFR in the range of 30 mL / min to 60 mL/min. Conditions when patients may  
continue treatment although they  show disease progression were clarified. Possible drug 
interaction with respe ct to BCRP and/or P
-gp was addressed.
Rationale for introducing the modification
Modifications were implemented to further reduce the risk of drug -induced toxicities.

Rational eof the study
Additional text:
It was shown that FGFR3 expression is inversely correlated to programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression and T cell infiltration in tumor tissue of patients with BC (40). This 
finding was confirmed in archival biops y samples collected in study 16443. A similar 
correlation was detected in patients with sqNSCLC and L AC in study  16443.
It is assumed that a causal relationship between FGFR expression and T cell exclusion 
leads to low PD -L1 levels and decreased responsiveness towards inhibition of the PD -L1 
axis. Potentially , inhibition of FGFR can overcome this interaction and render tumors 
targetable b y the immune sy stem.
Immun e responses and the tumor microenvironment are inadequatel y reflected in 
preclinical cancer models. We therefore aim to analy ze selected immune parameters 
before and during BAY1163877 treatment in paired biopsies and in serum of biomarker -
selected patients . Fresh tumor tissue will be used to assess immune parameters indicating a 
T cell response against the tumor tissue. This will be done b y performing gene expression

Study Part 3 / “Safety cohort” (sqNSCLC + LAC + BC)
Preliminary  safet y data of patients with advanced cancer treated with BAY 1163877
showed a favorable safety profile (details can be found in the current version of the IB). 
However, sample size is still limited in selected indications (sqNSCL C, LAC, BC) and 
additional safet y data  will be generated in Study Part 3 “Safet y cohort”. In parallel, 
additional effica cy data will be collected and changes of selected immune parameters will 
be assessed in Part 3.
It was shown that FGFR3 expression is inversely correlated to programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression and T cell infiltration in tumor tissue of patients with BC (40) . This 
finding was confirmed in archival biops y samples collected in study 16443. A similar 
correlation was detected in patients with sqNSCLC and L AC in study  16443.
Recently , the PD1 and PD -L1 inactivating antibod iesreceived accelerated approval b y the 
FDA for patients with BC. I t was demonstrated that patients with a low expression of PD -
L1 had a smaller chance to respond to atezolizumab treatment. 
It is assumed that a causal relationship between FGFR expression and T cell exclusion 
leads to low PD -L1 levels and decreased responsiveness towards inhibition of the PD -L1 
axis. Potentially , inhibition of FGFR can overcome this interaction and render tumo rs 
targetable b y the immune sy stem.

16.4 Model-based dose -response analysis of the DLT rates 
16.4.1 Statistical model
The anal ysis is based on a method reported by  Tibaldi et al (2008) (37).
A range of dail y doses will be tested, including possibly  100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 
800, 900, 1000 and 1100mg. Additional or alternative dose levels may  be chosen. These 
possible dose levels are labeled as d= 1, …, N, where N is the maximum number of dose 
levels for the stud y. The probability, p, of observing a subject with DLTs during cy cle 1 is 
modeled as a function of dose:
dpp  )1log( .
The prior distribution on and determine the prior distribution on the probability  of DLT as 
a function of dose. Prior distributions were elicited. All of the following distributions are 
independent. The following prior distributions are used in the trial:
1) sd-3, N(µ~    ,
and
0.003) sd 0.0015, (µN ~    .
Based on these distributions, 100 dose- DLT curves from the prior distribution were simulated 
(see Figure 16-1).  
The prior probability  distribution for the MTD is summarized in Table 
16-9.

Given an y set of data, the prior distribution can be updated, yielding a posterior distribution of 
the parameters. From this posterior distribution many  different quantities of relevance c an be 
calculated:
 E(p|d) = Posterior mean probability  of DLT for dose d.
 Td = (tolerable) Probability  that the DLT rate is below 0.20, Pr(p <0.20| d), for a dose 
d.

Note that, in this model, the MTD is a parameter. It has a probability  distribution. A 
consequence of the Bay esian modeling is the probability , Qd, which is the probability  that a
dose is the MTD. This is a powerful question that cannot be answered from a frequentist 
perspective.
16.4.2 Trial simulation details
The trial design for purposes of simulation is as follows:
1.Three subjects are assigned to d = 1 (100mg)
2.
Pursue the following dose escalation process up to when first DLT is observed: 
a.2-fold dose escalation testing doses up to 1100 mg in cohorts of 3 subjects.
3.If at least one DLT is reported, fit Bay esian model and select next dose as the dose d at 
which Qd is maximum, or the maximu m allowed dose if an y of the following 
constraints are met:
If 2 DLTs in a cohort of size 3, d must be lower than or equal to that dose.
If 3 DLTs out of 3 or at least 4 DLTs out of 6, d must be lower than that dose.
Dose d must be at most 2
-fold larger th an the maximum dose tested.
Repeat 3, again assigning 3 subjects / cohort to this dose. Terminate stud y when an y of the 
following stopping rules happen:
1.MTD precisel y estimated: CV (MTD) calculated as the inter -quartile range over the 
median is lower than 40% 
2. Maximum possible dose is safe TN > 80%
3. Minimum dose tested (100mg) is toxic (TN < 20%)
4.Total sample size for next dose is alread y equal to 9.
16.4.3 Simulation scenarios
Five dose -DLT profiles were considered in order to evaluate the operational characteristics of 
that adaptive dose escalation trial. The 5 scenarios are:
Scenario A – Maximum dose safe:   This scenario represents a negative scenario under 
which all doses are safe and the true MTD is larger than the maximum possible dose 
(MTD=10,000 mg). 
Scenario B 
- Late MTD:  This is a scenario is which the MTD is 500 mg. The probability  of 
a DLT is gradually  increasing across all dose levels.
Scenario C – Early MTD:   In this scenario, the rate of DLT progression is faster over doses 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 378of 395
so that the MTD appears sooner (200 mg).
Scenario D - Toxic : Under this scenario, all doses are toxic, with a DLT rate of 39% at the 
lowest dose and increasing to 100% at the highest dose level.
Scenario E - Peak:   In this scenario there is a step function in the prob ability  of DLT’s 
occurring very  early in the dose escalation process. The first doses up to 300 mg are very safe 
(p=5%), and all subsequent doses are toxic (p=80%).
Figure 16-2:Dose versus DLT rates simulati on scenarios
16.4.4 Operational characteristics
We used 1000 trial simulations in order to monitor the following properties of the adaptive 
design under the 5 scenarios:
 Accuracy  and precision of the MTD
 Probability  of archiving each of the 3 stopping rules ( MTD precision, last dose is safe, 
max. sample size).
 Total sample size
 Number and proportion of subjects being under -dosed and over- dosed (i.e., relative to DLT rate

B: Late MTD
C: early MTD
D: Toxic

the true MTD)
 Patient distribution across dose levels
16.4.5 Simulation results
Scenario A –Maximum dose safe: 
When all doses are safe, the study  has 87.4% probability  to report a mean MTD larger than 
1100mg. It has 75.3% probability  to conclude that the maximum dose has a DL T rate of 
below 20% with 80% confidence. The expected mean standard deviation (±sd) sample size 
is 20.3±2.0 patients in 6.8±0.7 cohorts.
The predicted patient distribution by  dose is reported in Figure 16-3 for all 5 scenarii. Under 
scenario A, as expected, the maximum dose escalation scheme of a 2 -fold increase is 
performed for most simulations. The top dose (1100mg) is, on average (±sd), administered to 
8.1±1.7 patients.
Scenario B – Late MTD: 
When the true MTD is 500mg, the mean relative bias in the MTD estimate was 26.3%. The 
study  has 81.9% chances to y ield a CV (MTD) < 40%. I t reaches the cap of N=9 subjects per 
dose in another 17.9%. At study  end, the mean CV of the MTD is 40.1%. The expected mean 
(±sd) sample size is 18.1±4.4 patients in 6.0±1.5 cohorts. The expected mean (±sd) number of 
subjects being over- dosed (i.e., at doses larger than 500 mg) is 5.5±3.3.
As shown in Figure 16-3, dose escalation progresses up to 400 mg in a similar way  as for 
scenario 1 with fewer patients being overdosed at 800 mg or 1100 mg and additional subjects 
receiving a dose of 300 mg.
Scenario C –Early MTD: 
When the tr ue MTD is 200mg, the mean relative bias in the MTD estimate was 35.5%. The 
study  has 27.8% chances to y ield a CV (MTD) <40% and it reaches the cap of N=9 subjects 
per dose in another 70.9%. At study  end, the mean CV of the MTD is 50.0%. The expected 
mean ( ±sd) sample size is 19.6±6.5 patients in 6.5±2.2 cohorts. The expected mean (±sd) 
number of subjects being over -dosed (i.e., at doses larger than 200mg) is 7.7±6.0.
As shown in Figure 16-3, under scenario C, maximum dose escalation progresses as expected 
up to 400mg. Then adaptation occurs around the MTD between doses from 100 to 300mg 
with a peak at 200mg (N=6.2±2.7). 
Scenario D –Toxic: 
When the DL Trate ranges from 39 to 100%, the study  has 57.9% chances to declare that the 
DLT rate at the lowest dose (100mg) is at least 20% with 80% probability. I n another 40.9%, 
the study  will stop when the cap of N=9 subjects per dose is reached. The expected mea n 
(±sd) sample size is 17.0±9.7 patients in 5.7±3.2 cohorts.
As shown in Figure 16-3, under scenario D, the majority  of patients receive doses up to 
400mg where the predicted DLT rate is 68.0%.

17 Oct 2018 Version 8.0 Page: 380of 395
Scenario E –Peak: 
When doses up to and including 300 mg are very  safe but larger doses are very  toxic, the first 
doses up to 400mg are administered in most patients, as expected. Then adaptation occurs in 
the 2 00 -300mg interval. The expected mean (±sd) total sample size is 19.7±4.5 patients in 
6.5±1.5 cohorts. The expected mean (±sd) number of subjects being over -dosed (i.e., at doses 
larger than 300mg) is 4.1± 2.4. Most of these over -dosed patients receive a m aximum dose of 
400mg.

16.8 Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1) - amended
Response and progression will be evaluated in this trial using the new international criteria 
proposed by the RECI ST committee. Changes in only  the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria for determination of tumor 
response. Additionally , per the RECI ST working group, CT scan (with contrast )is currently  
the best available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response 
assessment.
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accuratel y measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the pl ane of measurement is to be recorded) 
with a minimum size of:
10 mm by  CT scan ( CT scan slice thickness 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that cannot be accurately
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).
20 mm by  chest x -ray.
-Malignant l ymph node: T o be considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by  CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed . Lymph nodes 10 mm are non -
pathological. Ly mph nodes measuring 10 mm to 15 mm are considered non- target. 
Non-measurable disease: Non-measurable disease is defined as all other lesions (or sites o f 
disease), including small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or pathological ly mph nodes with 
10 mm to 15 mm in short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions 
considered to be trul y non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, ly mphangitic involvement of the skin or lung, inflammatory  
breast disease, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly  identified by  physical exam that is 
not measurable b y reproducible imaging techniques.
Special consideration s
Bone lesions: Lytic bone lesions or mixed ly tic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated b y cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT scan or 
MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue compo nent meets the definition 
of measurable disease. Blastic bone lesions are considered non -measurable disease. Note: 
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these can be used to conf irm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesions .
Cystic lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria to be radiographically defined as simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
because they  are, b y defi nition, simple cy sts. C ystic lesions thought to represent cystic 
metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they  meet the definition of measurable

disease. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously  irradiated area, or 
in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy, are usuall y not considered measurable 
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.
Measurement of lesions : All measurements sh ould be recorded in metric notation, using 
calipers if clinically  assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.
Target lesions: When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all measurable 
lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and be record ed and 
measured at baseline. This means that, in instances where subjects have only  one or two organ 
sites involved, a maximum of two or four lesions, respectivel y, will be recorded. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wit h the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. In situations in which the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement, the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected. 
Lymph nodes as target lesions : Pathological nodes, which are defined as measurable and may  
be identified as target lesions, must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by  CT scan. 
Only  theshort axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the 
node is the diameter normally  used b y radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid 
tumor. Nodal size is normally  reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is 
obtained (for CT scan, this is almost alway s the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition 
may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. All other 
pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm bu t 15 mm) should be considered non -
target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 10 mm are considered non -pathological and 
should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only  the short axis is added into the sum. 
The baseline sum of diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective 
tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological l ymph 
nodes, should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded a t baseline. 
Measurements are not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be 
followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases, “unequivocal progression”. In addition, it is 
possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the 
case record form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic ly mph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’) .

Best response
All subjects will have their best response on trial classified as outlined below and 
summarized in Table 16-11 , Table 16-12 and Table 16-13 .
Evaluation of response in target lesions
Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions (both target and non -
target). An y pathological ly mph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduc tion in short axis to
10 mm.
Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions taking as the reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Stable disease (SD): steady  state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify  for PD, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of 
diameters while in the trial.
Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of dia meters of the 
target lesions, taking as a references the smallest sum on study  (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on trial). I n addition to a relative increase of 20%, 
the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm . Appearance of 
new lesions will also constitute PD.
Special notes on assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes : Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should alway s have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study . This means that when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may  not be zero, even if 
complete response criteria are met, because a normal ly mph node is defined as having a short 
axis of 10mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in the sum of target lesions
Target lesions that become too small to measure
While on study , all lesions (nodal and non -nodal) re corded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very  small (e.g., 2mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or ly mph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that th e radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may  report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs, it is 
important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the 
radiologist that the lesi on has likely  disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 
0mm. I f the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly  seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned. 
Evaluation of response in non -target lesions
Complete response: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of

tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR / Non -PR: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor m arker level above the normal limits.
Progressive disease: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Note: 
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)
Disease progression in subjects with only non -measurable dis ease
For subjects with onl y non -measurable disease, disease progression is defined as development 
of new lesions or “unequivocal progression” of existing lesions. Because worsening in non -
target disease cannot be easily  quantified (by  definition: if all le sions are truly  non-
measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for unequivocal 
progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden, based on the change in 
non-measurable disease, is comparable in magnitude to th e increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease, i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable 
lesion). If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had 
overall PD at that point.
New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; however, the finding 
of a new lesion should be unequivocal, i.e., not attributable to diffe rences in scanning 
technique, change in imaging modality  or findings thought to represent something other than 
tumor (e.g., some ‘new’ bone lesions may  be simply  healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). 
A lesion identified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. If a new lesion is 
equivocal (e.g., because of small size), continued therap y and follow -up evaluation will 
clarify  if it represents trul y new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

a:  If a CR is truly met at the first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, 
even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point 
(because the disease must have re -appeared after CR). Best response would depend on 
whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may  be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely present an d, in fact, the subject 
had PR, or CR at the first time point. Under this circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR and the best response is PR.
Response duration
Response duration will be measured from the time that measurement criteria for CR/PR 
(whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent disease or PD is 
objectively  documented.
Stable disease duration
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of therap y until the criteria for 
progre ssion are met, taking as a reference the smallest measurements recorded since the start 
of treatment.

Methods of measurement
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Clinical lesions -Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they  are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules, palpable l ymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by  color photography , including a ruler to estima te the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. When lesions can be evaluated by  both clinical exam and imaging, imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken because it is more objective and may  also be reviewed at the 
end of the stud y.
Chest x -ray -Chest CT is pre ferred over chest X -ray, particularl y when progression is an 
important endpoint, because CT is more sensitive than X- ray, particularly  in identify ing new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may  be considered measurable if they  are clearl y 
defined and surrounded by  aerated lung .
CT / MRI –CT scan is the best currently  available and reproducible method to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. MRI  is acceptable in certain situations (e.g., 
for bod y scans). CT scans should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness, 
contiguousl y. This applies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Head and neck and extremities 
usually  require specific protocols.
Ultrasound -Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not b e used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entiret y for 
independent review at a later date and, because they  are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be take n from one assessment to 
the next. I f new lesions are identified by  ultrasound in the course of the study , confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI  may  be 
used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endosc opy / laparoscopy -The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, they  can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence follo wing complete 
response or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor markers -Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they  must normalize for a subject 
to be cons idered in complete response. Because tumor markers are disease specific, 
instructions for their measurement should be incorporated.
Cytology / histology -These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases if required b y protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor ty pes such as germ 
cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to 
be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or 
angiogenesis inhibitors) , the cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable

16.9 Estimation of renal function
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) equation
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be estimated using the variables serum creatinine, 
age (years), race, and gender.
The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m 2
body  surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.
All laboratories should be using creatinine (Cr) methods calibrated t o be IDMS (isotope 
dilution mass spectrometry ) traceable.
For creatinine in mg/dL ; age in y ears
Men: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* = 175  x  (serum creatinine) -1.154 x  age-0.203
Women: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* = 175  x  (serum creatinine) -1.154  x  age-0.203x 0.742
For creatinine in µmol/L ; age in y ears
Men: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* = 175  x  (serum creatinine / 88.4)-1.154  x  age-0.203
Women: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* = 175  x  (serum creatinine / 88.4)-1.154  x  age-0.203x 0.742
* For African Americans, multiply by 1.212 (eGFR x 1.212)
The calculator for SI units (for outside the U.S) or for conventional units (for use primaril y in 
the USA) provided b y the National Kidney  Disease Education Program should be used by  the

1.0       PURPOSE  
1.1 Name and Intended Use  
The purpose of this study is to ev aluate histological results of the treatments with the TempSure 
Firm handpiece on the flanks perform ed in the CYN20-FIRM-LIPO study. 
 1.2 Objectives   
Primary Objective:  
 Evaluate histological tissue re sponse as seen in biopsies. 
 
1.3 Duration of the Investigation 
The sponsor anticipates that all s ubjects can be enrolled within 3  months.  If subject participates in 
all required visits, then the subjec t’s participation in this study may last up to 1 month. It is 
anticipated that it will take approximately 3  months to analyze the data  collected during this study. 
The total duration of this study is anticipated to last approximately  7 months.  
 
1.4 Context of the Proposed Investigation  
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly us ed in surgery, noninvasive treatments and 
aesthetic applications. RF tec hnology is a safe method for no n-ablative (A non-wounding device 
treatment which heats underlying skin) treatment  because energy can be precisely delivered 
through the skin to the dermal tissue be neath without damaging the epidermis.  
 Aging skin shows decreased collag en synthesis and altera tion of fiber networks . By gently heating 
dermis tissue (which is comprised of colla gen, elastic fibers an d ground substance), both 
immediate effects (collagen cont raction) and long-term effect s (wound-healing response with 
neocollagen production) will occur. RF-induced ther mal injury to the dermal tissue will produce a 
microinflammatory response to induce collagen denaturation, contraction, and subsequent 
synthesis as well as elastin and ground substance production.
1 This, in turn, cr eates a tightening 
effect that helps to eliminate skin wrinkles and is used also for other co smetic treatments on the 
body.2 
 The extent of collagen shrinkage, fibroblast act ivation, fibroplasia and neocollagenesis in the 
different skin layers is based on a complex multivariate mechanism, which depends on the 
temperature distribution and timing.
2 Further investigation of parameter optimization is necessary 
to achieve safe and efficacious results.    
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they have completed their part icipation in the 
CYN20-FIRM-LIPO study. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled at up to 4 study centers. Subjects 
will receive 2 biopsies, 1 biopsy in  the treatment area on the flank and 1 biopsy on the contralateral 
side to serve as a control.

Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non-ablativ e aesthetic treatm ents and will 
drive demand for innovated products , procedures, and practice design.3 Due to this shift in patient 
base, practices need to evolve to  adapt to the newer generational id eologies. There have been rapid 
advances in RF technology over th e past few years and the nonsurgi cal treatment using this energy 
source offers great promise to our aging population.4 Radiofrequency technology for the treatment 
of abdominal wrinkles needs to be  further investigated to optimi ze treatment parameters for safe 
and effective non-ablative aesthetic treatments.  
 Relevance: Over time, skin structure degrades due to a variet y of internal and external conditions. As enzymes 
break down collagen and elastin, skin loses its su ppleness and becomes loose.  UV exposure, diet, 
and smoking among other behavior s all contribute to the skin becoming lax.  Body wrinkles, 
particularly on the abdomen, are a sign of aging and are also a pr evalent concern with postpartum 
women or subjects who have lost we ight. It is estimated that adult skin loses approximately 1% of 
its dermal collagen content on an annual basis due to increased collagen degradation and decreased 
collagen synthesis.
2 Radiofrequency, ultrasound, non-ablative fractional technology, and ablative 
technology have all been used to varying degrees of success.  The limitati ons of current products 
on the market include different side effe ct profiles and modes of administration. 
 Testability: The improvement in the appearance of skin has b een previously linked to a histological evaluation 
of the treatment area and can be used to verify an increase in  collagen after a radiofrequency 
treatment.  Dr. Neil Sadick in  2008 published an article titled Tissue Tightening Technologies: 
Fact or Fiction which discusses the link between changes in collagen and improvement in skin 
tightening, including wrinkles.  The collection of biopsies will allow a histological evaluation of 
the treatment area to confirm the device is safely  and effectively affectin g the collagen in the 
dermis.   
 Compatibility: Not applicable – feasibility study.  Predictive power: While this study will observe the effects of the handpieces on the fl anks, results could potentially 
be applied to a variety of body ar eas and other potential applicat ions.  Assuming that there is 
significant improvement, it would be appropriate to expect results in different areas where other 
products and devices have significant results.  
 
2.2 Protocol Study Design 
This is a prospective, multi-cente r clinical study to evaluate histol ogical results of treatments with 
the TempSure ™ Firm handpiece. 
 
2.3 Subject Selection Criteria 
Subjects will meet the cr iteria described below:

 Version  1.1: February 2, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 21 
 
Inclusion Criteria: 
 Subject has completed their pa rticipation in the CYN20-FI RM-LIPO study no more than 6 
months prior. 
 Exclusion Criteria: 
 The subject has not had any othe r treatment in the treatment ar ea after their i nvolvement in 
the CYN20-FIRM-LIPO study. 
 The subject has any condition or is in a situa tion which in the investigators opinion may put 
the subject at significant ris k, may confound study results or ma y interfere signi ficantly with 
the subject’s participation. 
 
2.4 Screening  
Subjects will undergo the scre ening procedures in the  CYN20-FIRM-LIPO study. 
  2.5 Informed Consent Process and Enrollment 
Subjects will be asked to review  the post treatment instructions  prior to signing the informed 
consent form and their involvement  in the study. Subjects will be informed of standard COVID-19 
procedures that adhere to federal and state guide lines at this time. Subj ects will be de-identified 
through their subject identificati on number, which will be stored in a secure location. Subject 
identification numbers will be generated chronologi cally and assigned only to subjects who have 
met all the study selectio n criteria and have signed the info rmed consent form.  The informed 
consent will be obtained prior to  a subject’s involvement in any study related procedures. A 
subject will be considered enrolled in the study on ce they have signed the informed consent form.  
 
2.6 Pre-Biopsy Procedures 
If the subject is of childbeari ng potential (i.e. fema les not post-menopausal or not surgically 
sterile), they will be asked if they are pregnant, th e date of their last menstrual cycle, and perform a 
urine pregnancy test. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior their biopsies. A urine pregnancy test may also be  conducted at the Investigator’s 
discretion at any time during th e study. If a urine pregnancy test  is conducted, then a negative 
result must be obtained within 24 hours prior to the treatment. 
 Urine Pregnancy Test Procedure: 
1. A urine sample is tested mid-stream or by cup sample with an  indicator stick.  
2. Negative results are indicat ed on the indicator stick. 
 
 The biopsy area will be identified and may be ma rked with a surgical or permanent marker. 
 Photographs will be taken prior to the biopsy an d may be taken during and/or after treatment.  
  
2.7 Biopsy Procedures 
 Biopsy subjects will receive 2 biopsies, 1 in th e treatment area and 1 on the contralateral 
side of the treatment area  to serve as a control. 
 A local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, will be injected to the area prior to biopsy. 
 A 2 mm or 3mm punch biopsy (based on P hysician assessment) will be taken.

 Sutures may be used to close the incision site. 
 
2.8 Post Biopsy Instructions 
 Slight redness, initial tenderne ss to the wound site is normal; however, if you experience 
more redness, swelling, pain, pus, or drai nage contact the of fice immediately, 
 If the biopsy site begins to bl eed, apply direct pressure for 10-20 minutes. If it continues to 
bleed, call the study site immediately. 
 Keep the wound dry today and remove bandage in 24 hours and leave off. 
 Avoid hot tubs, pools, and ocean until sutures are removed.  Avoid soaking in water until 
14 days after your biopsy. 
 When showering, wash carefully  and do not scrub or  traumatize the trea ted skin, or allow 
spray of shower to strike the skin directly.  If the skin is treated harshly, this can increase 
the risk of scarring. 
 After showering, lightly pat dry the wound or let it air dry, then  cover the biopsy site with 
an application of Vaseline (o r petroleum jelly) at least 1-2 times dail y.  Keeping the wound 
moist reduces infecti on, minimizes scarring, and prevents crust formation over the wound.  
 Band-Aids (or any generic Adhe sive Bandages) may be used  for sleeping or in daily 
routines where the area may be rubbed/irrita ted.   Whenever possible, keep Band-Aid (or 
generic Adhesive Bandage) off of the area and keep the area moist with Vaseline (or 
petroleum jelly) as previously  described but do not allow drying out and forming a hard 
scab.  
 For any wound discomfort, you may take Tylenol as needed, or use cold compresses for up 
to 20 minutes hourly as needed.  If using ice,  it should be wrapped in a plastic and then a 
cloth to avoid burning your skin and wetting your bandage. 
 Avoid picking at the wound site, which incr eases risk of infe ction and scarring. 
o In order for the wound to heal properly a nd not leave bumpy scars,  be careful not to 
overstretch the wound site area.  As a w ound heals, it will be weaker than the 
surrounding skin and can even "pop open" th e sutures (stitches)  if stretched too 
much.  Sport or strenuous exercises that can  pull at the wound s ite are best avoided 
for at least the next 3 days and up to one week. 
 Return for suture removal within 7 - 10 days  as instructed per study protocol. If applied, 
Steri-strips must be kept dry as they are more likely to separate when wet. Steri-strips will 
usually fall off by themselves or you may be  advised by the study doctor to remove them 
when the wound healed. 
 ONCE SUTURES ARE OUT: To minimize sore formation and to improve the final 
appearance of your skin, it is very important to keep the wound site area covered with the 
Vaseline for the next few days, until there is no more crust forming and the skin has 
completely healed.  
 Temporary discoloration at the wound site is normal and sh ould gradually fade over the 
next few months.  Please protect newly heal ed biopsied area with SPF and avoid sunburn. 
 2.9 Follow Up 
 The subject may be asked to attend a 1 week (7 -10 days) post biopsy foll ow up visit to remove 
the sutures.

 Photographs may be taken, and adverse events will be documented at this follow up visit.  
 
2.10 Unscheduled Visits 
An unscheduled visit may be perf ormed at any time during the study at the subject’s request or as 
deemed necessary by the site Inve stigator. The date and reason fo r the unscheduled visit will be 
recorded in the source documentation.  2.11 Replacement of Subjects 
Replacement of subjects who have  withdrawn or been withdrawn from the study will not be 
allowed to be replaced without prior approval from the sponsor and/or IRB .

2.13 Evaluation Methods 
Skin Biopsies: Biopsies will be obtained to examine the effects on the skin following radiofrequency treatments. 
Sections of skin will be removed using the punch biopsy technique to render a microscopic 
diagnosis. Each specimen will first be preser ved with a fixative and then stained using 
Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoeff and Masson Red/Fast  Green and/or nitroblue tetrazolium chloride 
(NBTC) staining methods. If us ing Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoe ff and Masson Red/Fast Green 
staining, samples will be assessed and evaluated by the amount of collagen and elastin stained. If 
using NBTC staining, samples will be assessed a nd evaluated to differen tiate between the blue-
stained viable cells and the unstained thermally damaged cells. A report will be provided for each 
sample by the pathologis t or the Investigator. 
 
2.14 Adverse Event Recording 
All data captured must be supported by the Inves tigator’s timely assessment and documentation of 
the adverse event in the case re port forms or source documents.  All documented adverse events 
will be reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to  determine whether the adverse event meets 
PROTOCOL #: CYN20-FIRM-LIPO-ROLLOVER

 Version  1.1: February 2, 2021  CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 21 
 
regulatory reporting requirem ents and to ensure timely adverse event reporting to meet local and 
global regulatory requirements. All adverse even ts must be followed until their resolution. 
 
Biopsies Complication with biopsies can include pain, redn ess, swelling, infecti on, bleeding, scarring and 
skin texture irregularities. 
 
 Lidocaine 
1% lidocaine (Lidocaine) Injecti on with or without Epinephrine 
You may experience pain and numbness at the site  of the injection. You may also experience 
redness, rash, infection, skin da mage or nerve damage at the site of the injection. You may 
experience temporary loss of sensation and mu scle function at the site of injection. 
 
Lidocaine with epinephrine contains the preser vative sodium metabisu lfite which may cause 
allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic sy mptoms and life-threat ening or less severe 
asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people.  Adverse Events Pertaining to Surgical Marker: Using surgical marker has minimal risks and ma y produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. Markings may remain vi sible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol.  
 
 3.0  RISK MANAGEMENT  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been  invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or simil ar systems and industry experience.  Experience 
with biopsies is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods will be used.  
The value of the compensation to th e clinical investigator for conduc ting the study is not influenced 
by the study outcome.    All other known risks will be disclo sed to the subject via the inform ed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are volun teers, it can be assumed that their signature on 
the informed consent is indicative of thei r agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 The risks to the subjects who par ticipate in this study are the same as those for most subjects 
undergoing biopsies when enrolled in  a non-ablative radi ofrequency study.  
  4.0 MONITORING PROCEDURES  
The Sponsor Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for monitoring the inves tigative site will be 
followed. The sponsor will train the site following sponsor SOP’s and may be  present at initiation 
of treatment.  The sponsor will al so monitor the site periodically. The Investigator/Institution will 
permit trial-related moni toring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspections by providing 
direct access to source documents.  The sponsor ma y request intermediate da ta following each visit

 10.0  PHOTOGRAPHY 
Standardized photography may be taken of the bi opsy site. Photographs will be taken with an 
appropriate high-resolution dig ital camera. Camera settings (lighting, distance, background, 
polarization, etc.) wi ll be reproduced at each visit, so that photographs are suitable for comparison.  
Photographs will be taken of the treatment area for study purposes.  If the subject does not wish to 
have their photographs taken, they cannot be in the study.  
 11.0  ADVERSE REACTIONS DEFINITION S AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
All adverse events that occur, st arting from the time of the first tr eatment, will be recorded in the 
source documents and Case Report Forms (CRF).

Adverse Events (AE) occurring will be capture d and followed until the condition resolves, 
stabilizes, is otherwise e xplained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Subjects will be instructed that 
they may contact the Investigator at a ny time throughout the c ourse of the study. 
The Investigator and/or designate d study staff will review each even t and assess its relationship to 
the study device (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating rela tionship to the TempSure™ treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to othe r factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or a concomitant medication ad ministered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known re sponse pattern to the i nvestigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable tempor al sequence from the tim e of investigational 
product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time  of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other fact ors such as the subjec t’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant me dications administered  to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational produc t administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventi ons, or concomitant medica tions administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stopping the i nvestigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  Each adverse event reported will be graded  on a 3-point severit y. Using the following 
definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discom fort, and not interferi ng with normal everyday 
activities. 

 Moderate – sufficiently discom forting and may interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or pr eventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experi ence that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life-threatening advers e device experience, in-patient hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disa bility/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or ma y not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospitaliz ation may be considered a seri ous adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardiz e the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes listed in this definition

If any of the above adverse events  are serious as defi ned by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures  will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within 24 hours of acknowledgment to the Sponsor whether or not the serious events are deemed 
sampling session-related.  All serious event repor ting will adhere to 21 CFR part 812 and the IRB 
will be notified accordingly.     The SAE information will be entered into the da tabase and a desk copy of the complete SAE 
report will be submitted to the study file.   Adverse events, whether serious or non-serious, will be followed until the condition is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained or the subject is lost to  follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of even t(s). Outcomes may be classi fied as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to fo llow-up.  Following the resolution of any study-
associated adverse events there will be no furt her adverse event reports for that subject.
